# L. Test Principle:

The FT4L method is a homogenous, sequential, chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring, weaker binding analog of T4, and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a fraction of the biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free T4 concentration. In a second step, T3 chemibeads are added and form bead/biotinylated antibody immunocomplexes with the nonsaturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is an inverse function of the FT4 concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was conducted using Bio-Rad Lyphochek $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ commercial controls and serum pools. Serum pool 1 was prepared from normal human serum. Serum pool 2 was prepared from normal human serum spiked with USP grade Thyroxine. The Bio-Rad levels were 0.71, 2.20 and $5 . 6 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The serum pools were 1.17 and 6.36 $\mathrm { n g / d L }$ . These concentrations span the measuring range which is $0 . 1 - 8 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . There were two runs per day for twenty days. Measurements were taken by two operators. The data was collected on one reagent lot on one instrument. The data was analyzed using analysis of variance. The data is summarized below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range was determined using the Level $5 \mathrm { L O C I @ }$ Thyroid Calibrator and the calibrator base matrix. Intermediate levels were prepared by proportional mixing of these calibrators to produce concentrations evenly distributed across the measuring range. There were eleven concentrations $( 0 . 1 5 { - } 8 . 6 2 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ evenly distributed across the measuring range. Each sample was assayed in replicates of $\mathrm { n } { = } 5$ . The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The quadratic term of a second order polynomial fit was statistically insignificant (p value $= 0 . 2 9 1 1$ ), supporting linearity across the measuring range. The results from least squares linear regression analysis were: slope $= 1 . 0 3$ , y-intercept $= - 0 . 2 1$ and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 0$ .

Based on this study and on the Limit of Detection (see section $d$ below), the reportable range was determined to be $\mathrm { 0 . 1 { - } 8 . 0 \ n g / d L }$ . Samples with results higher than $8 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ will be reported as greater than 8.0 and the results are flagged by the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EXL™ with LM system. Samples above the measuring range should not be diluted. This is stated in the instructions for use, in the section "Analytical Measurement Range" of the labeling. The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L method is not a sandwich immunoassay. Hook effect is not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrator Traceability:

USP-grade thyroxine is spiked into stripped human serum at different concentrations.   
This becomes the “Anchor Pool”. The “Anchor Pool” values are validated in-house.

A Master Pool is developed from stripped bovine albumin to which different concentrations of thyroxine have been added. Values for the Master Pool are derived by multiple analyses against the Anchor Pool calibration curve. $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ Thyroid Calibrator value assignment is established by measurement against the Master Pool calibration.

# Stability:

The shelf life and opened bottle stability of the $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ Thyroid Calibrator is ongoing using real-time data collected from three (3) lots of the calibrator. All testing is being performed using product which is in its final container. The target shelf life is 12 months. The target open bottle stability is 3 months.

Closed vial stability protocol:

Identical lots of calibrators are used. One set is stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (test) throughout the study and the other at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ (control). Both sets of calibrators will be tested at Day 0 and monthly thereafter for 12 months plus a minimum of 6 days. Replicates of each level will be analyzed for acceptable recovery and drift over time. The test lot will be evaluated for recovery against the calibration curve derived from the control lot.

Open vial stability protocol:

Identical lots of calibrators are used. Both sets are stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The control set will be unopened throughout the study and the other stored opened (test). The test calibrator is returned to $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage to simulate worst-case usage of opened calibrators. At each time point, the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L method is calibrated using the control calibrators to generate a standard curve. The test calibrators are recovered from the standard curve. Recovery of the test calibrators versus time is plotted and drift is determined by the slope of the regression line.

# d. Detection limit:

A Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Blank (LoB) study was conducted using four blank samples and four low analyte samples. The four blank samples were water, phosphate buffered saline, HEPES buffered saline and stripped serum. The low analyte samples were prepared from four individual patient samples that were diluted with stripped serum to levels that were approximately 4 times the limit of the blank.

Each blank and low analyte sample was assayed in triplicate using two reagent lots on two instruments over three days. The Limit of Blank was determined from the nonparametric distribution of one-hundred-and-forty-four (144) measurements of the blank samples. The Limit of Detection was calculated from the following equation: $\mathrm { L o D = L o B + ( \ C _ { p } \times S D _ { s } }$ ).

The LoB was determined from non-parametric distribution of 144 blank measurements $9 5 \%$ interval). The LoD for FT4L is $0 . 0 6 { \mathrm { n g / d L } }$ (0.77 pmol/L) with proportions of false positives (α) and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ , and a LoB of $0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ (0.39 pmol/L).

$= 0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$   
$\mathrm { L o D = L o B + ( C p \times S D s ) }$   
= 0.03 ng/dL + ( 1.648 \* 0.0169 ng/dL)   
$= 0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L } + 0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$   
$= 0 . 0 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .   
The Limit of Detection was calculated from the following equation: $\mathrm { L o D = }$ $\mathrm { L o B + ( \mathbf { C } _ { p } \mathbf { x } \mathbf { S } D _ { s } ) }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical Specificity

Analytical specificity was evaluated for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L method on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EXL™ with LM system. One hundred normal patient samples were assayed in duplicate for albumin, thyroid binding globulin (TBG) and free thyroxine (FT4). The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. No significant correlation was observed between albumin and FT4 $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { r = } 0 . 0 4 2$ ) or between TBG and FT4 $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { r = 0 } . 1 4 5$ ). Samples from normal patients were used in the study. The range of values as determined by the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EXL™ with LM system were:

Cross reactivity was evaluated against monoiodotyrosine $( 1 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , diiodotyrosine (1 $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , d-thyroxine $\mathrm { 1 0 ~ \mu g / d L } )$ , L-Triiodothyronine $( 6 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ ), R-Triiodothyronine $( 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } ) }$ and 3,5-Diiodo-L-Thyronine $( 6 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ . The calibrator base material was used as a control. Test samples were prepared with the cross reactant substance spiked into calibrator base matrix. Samples were assayed in replicates of $\mathrm { n } { = } 5$ . Cross reactivity was calculated as the difference between the mean of the test and control sample. The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ had cross-reactivity which was equivalent to the predicate device.

# Endogenous Interference

Potential endogenous interferents were added to two serum pools. Pool 1 contained normal human serum $\mathrm { 1 . 1 \ n g / d L }$ free thyroxine). Serum pool 2 was prepared from normal human serum spiked with $3 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ USP grade Thyroxine. Samples were assayed in replicates of $\mathrm { n } { = } 5$ and the means calculated.

The control pool consisted of normal human serum with the appropriate amount of buffer added.

The $\%$ bias was calculated using the following equation.

Significant interference is defined as a bias exceeding $10 \%$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

180 patient samples were obtained retrospectively from either blood banks or from local hospitals. Samples were frozen at the collection site and tested at the manufacturer’s site. The samples were assayed on both the new device and the predicate device on the same day. The range of values for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EXL™ with LM was $0 . 1 6 - 7 . 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The range of values for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4 Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ on the Dimension Vista™ was $0 . 1 6 - 7 . 4 5$ $\mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The summary regression statistics and $9 5 \%$ confidence interval are provided below.

Slope $= 0 . 9 7$ (0.96 to 0.97), y-int $= - 0 . 0 3$ (-0.05 to -0.01), ${ \mathrm { r } } = 0 . 9 9 9$ , $\mathrm { S y , x = 0 . 0 8 }$ $\mathrm { n g / d L }$ , $\mathrm { n } = 1 8 0$

The values span the proposed measuring range of $0 . 1 - 8 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$

# b. Matrix comparison:

Serum/plasma studies were performed to characterize the correlation between with sodium heparin, lithium heparin and EDTA plasma. 33 samples were assayed in multiple replicates of each type. Samples ranged from $0 . 8 2 \mathrm { - } 7 . 3 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . Data was analyzed using least squares linear regression and is summarized below.

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes __X____ or No

3. Specimen Identification: Barcode labeled tubes, racks, or sample cups

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Uncapped direct patient tube sampling is provided via sample racks containing slots for up to ten samples. Barcoded sample cups may also be used. Non-barcoded samples can be manually programmed with unique identifiers and rack position. The racks are loaded onto a sample wheel where a sampling arm picks up a portion of the specimen and delivers it to the appropriate testing vessel or area. The instrument can be programmed to evaluate degree of hemolysis, icteric, and lipemia. It can also be programmed to perform automatic dilutions, reflex testing and repeats.

5. Calibration:

Automatic and on-demand calibrations can be performed. Calibration calculations are automatically performed using either linear regression or log-logit. Calibration curves and calibration history are stored in the software and can be reviewed for acceptance by the operator.

6. Quality Control:

Automatic QC processing and alerts are present. QC records are stored on-board the device for 108-270 days, depending on the number of quality control levels are run. Results can be displayed as Levy-Jennings plots. QC statistics can be generated from the stored data.
