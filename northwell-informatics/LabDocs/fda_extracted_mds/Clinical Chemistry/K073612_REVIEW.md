# L. Test Principle:

Uric acid is oxidized to allantoin by uricase. The generated hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) and N-ethyl-N-(hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-m-toluidin (TOOS) to a blue violet dye. The absorbance of the formed color is measured at 540 nm.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity study was performed using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. The samples were diluted in 11 steps (from $0 \%$ to $100 \%$ ) by mixing samples with each other 1:1. Two parallel measurements were made in random order using one reagent lot. The extended linearity range was a separate set of samples prepared and measured as above. Six samples were run using an additional secondary dilution of 1:15. Results were as follows:

Based on the linearity study data, the sponsor will claim a measuring range of $0 . 2 { - } 2 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and an extended measuring range of $0 . 2 { - } 4 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ after secondary dilution.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability for sCal

Traceability is to NIST SRM 909b using a two-fold process. First, the value of the NIST SRM 909b is transferred to a lot of sCal by calibrating the T60 with the NIST material and running the sCal and 5 commercially available controls in triplicate. The measurements are repeated three times on multiple analyzers. Second, the sCal with the newly assigned value is used to calibrate multiple analyzers. The sCal is also run as a sample with 5 commercially available controls in replicates of 10 each.

# Traceability of Nortrol and Abtrol

The traceability of controls is determined by calibrating the Uric Acid assay using sCal. The controls together with NIST SRM 909b and five commercially available controls are run as samples with three replicates. The measurements are repeated ten times using several different instruments and ten individual control vials from each control. The control ranges are calculated as median $\pm 8 \%$ . The expected values for each lot are provided on the value sheet provided with the product.

# Stability

The protocols and acceptance criteria for stability studies were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims an open on-board stability of reagents for 32 days. After reconstitution sCal, Abtrol, and Nortrol are stable for 7 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed according to CLSI EP17-A. In the LoB study, thirty replicates of a blank sample $( 0 . 9 \% \mathrm { N a C l } )$ ) were run using two T60 instruments and two reagent lots for a total of 60 measurements. The LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The LoD study consisted of five low level samples run in ten replicates with two T60 instruments and two reagent lots during two days for a total of 100 measurements. The LoD was determined to be $0 . 0 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous and exogenous interference: The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP7-A. Three concentrations of uric acid were run in paired-difference testing with five different levels of interferent against control pools containing no interferent. Three parallel measurements were taken for each level. This protocol was performed for icterus and lipemia. Interference from hemolysis was determined using the same protocol except that control and test pools were tested in four replicates within one run. Interference from ascorbic acid was determined using the same protocol as the hemolysate. The sponsor defined interference as a difference greater than $\pm$ $1 0 \% \ 0 \Gamma \pm 0 . 8 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of the initial value.

According to the interference studies, the following claims were established:

Lipemia: No interference found up to $9 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 9 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } )$ ) of Intralipid.

Hemolysate: No interference found up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ( $[ 1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ of hemoglobin.

Bilirubin conjugated: No interference found up to $1 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (200 micmol/L) of conjugated bilirubin.

Bilirubin unconjugated: No interference found up to $1 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (250 micmol/L) of unconjugated bilirubin.

Ascorbic Acid: No interference of ascorbic acid up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / L } \left( 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } \right)$

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison studies were performed using CLSI EP9-A as a guide. One hundred thirty-six Li-heparin plasma samples (122 native, 14 contrived) were analyzed using T60i with Uric Acid reagents and Bayer Advia 2400 instrument with Uric Acid reagents to demonstrate the equivalence of the two systems. Samples ranged from $0 . 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $1 8 . 9 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The samples were split in two and run either on the predicate (one replicate) or candidate device (as duplicates). Deming regression analysis resulted in the equation: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 7 \mathrm { x } { - 0 . 1 3 }$ , $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 9$

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

Eighty-eight matched serum and plasma (Li-heparin) samples (77 native, 3 diluted and 12 spiked) were run on the T60. Dilutions and spiking were performed in parallel on the matched samples. Samples ranged from 0.8 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $1 9 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Deming regression analysis resulted in the equation: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathrm { x } { - 0 . 0 1 }$ , $\mathrm { R } = 1 . 0 0 0$ .
