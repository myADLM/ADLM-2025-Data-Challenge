# I. Device Description:

The GlucoSure Star Blood Glucose Monitoring System is based on an electrochemical biosensor technology (electrochemical) and the principle of capillary action. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in 6 seconds. The control solutions available are used to test the performance of the device.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

# L. Test Principle:

Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured

and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor evaluated precision in k062799. The sponsor evaluated the precision of the device using replicate measurements of glucose adjusted venous whole blood with 3 different strip lots. Within-run precision was performed using ten replicates each of 5 glucose concentrations and 2 levels of glucose control solutions. Between-run precision was performed using ten replicates per day of 5 glucose concentrations and 2 levels of glucose control solutions for ten days were tested on ten meters each tested with 3 strip lots. Results are summarized in k062799.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was established in the predicate device (k062799) and the study is summarized below:

To establish the linearity of the system whole blood samples were compared to YSI 2300 with three lots of test strips using 8 different glucose concentrations. For each lot of test strips, 10 meters where tested for each concentration. Linear regression yields the following statistics:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r2 }$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9894</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.758</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.007</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.761</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.028</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-2.842</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996</td></tr></table>

The sponsor claims $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The controls were evaluated in the predicate device (k062799). The evaluation of the controls in that submission is described below.

The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose standard (NIST SRM 965a).

Stability characteristics of both levels of control solutions were determined using real time aging studies to determine the open vial storage stability at room temperature to be 18 months and unopened vial stability to be 24 months.

The expected values for the two glucose control solutions were established by repeat testing (10 times) on two meters using one lot of strips for both glucose levels. The expected results may change with each new lot, but the control range is listed on the control solution vials.

d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the GlucoSure Star Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 - $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (above).

e. Analytical specificity: Analytical specificity was evaluated in the predicate device (k062799).

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A consumer study was performed with 152 lay-users and a technician to see if glucose readings from the fingertip were comparable to a laboratory glucose reference method and that alternate site testing were comparable to fingertip. The labeling provided to the users was in English only. Each participant obtained their own alternate site samples and tested their blood using the instructions in the user’s manual. The samples ranged from $4 4 . 7 - 4 5 4 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ . For the palm site, both thenar and hypothenar sections were tested and found to give equivalent results when compared to each other. Results of the study are summarized below using single finger stick values:

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.   
2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X____ or No _

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, or forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

A code strip is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that batch.   
No further calibrations are required of the user.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor is providing a single level glucose control solution with this device as a “starter kit.” There is a “simple kit” in which controls are not provided. Two levels are available for purchase separately, as stated in the labeling. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the control solution vial label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control results fall outside these ranges.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

None

Q. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
