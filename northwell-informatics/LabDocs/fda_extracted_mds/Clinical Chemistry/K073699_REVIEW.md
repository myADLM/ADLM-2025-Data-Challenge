# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY ASSAY AND INSTRUMENT COMBINATION TEMPLATE

A. 510(k) Number: k073699   
B. Purpose for Submission: New submission for an accessory data management software application for glucose meters   
C. Measurand: Whole Blood Glucose   
D. Type of Test: The MyCare Team (MCT)-Diabetes is a software-only medical device which serves as an internet-based accessory which interfaces between the software in personal glucose monitoring devices and the MCT general-purpose health management database.   
E. Applicant: MyCare Team, Inc.   
F. Proprietary and Established Names: MCT-Diabetes   
G. Regulatory Information: 1. Regulation section: 21CFR Sec.- 862.1345-Glucose test system. 21CFR Sec.-862.2100 - Calculator/data processing module for clinical use. 2. Classification: Class II and I, respectively 3. Product code: NBW - System, Test, Blood Glucose, Over the Counter JQP-Calculator/Data Processing Module, For Clinical Use 4. Panel: Chemistry (75)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications(s) for use below   
2. Indication(s) for use: The MCT-Diabetes™ software serves as an interface between the software in personal glucose monitoring devices and a general purpose health management database to assist in the review, analysis and evaluation of blood glucose test

results. MCT Diabetes is designed for home use and professional healthcare settings.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Not Applicable

4. Special instrument requirements: Compatible glucose meters for home use such as glucose meters by Roche Diagnostics, Bayer, BD, Johnson & Johnson, Abbott, and Nova Biomedical.

# I. Device Description:

MCT-Diabetes is a software-only device. MCT-Diabetes allows the patient to transfer their blood glucose readings from their glucose meter(s) over a secure connection to the MCT-Diabetes server. The glucose readings are then stored in a secure database for the patient to review. MCT-Diabetes allows the patient to group their readings into specific timeslots and then review their readings for each timeslot over long periods of time. This type of analysis provides the patient with a better view of how they are managing their diabetes and the convenience of viewing the output from all blood glucose monitors in one place. The patient can then also allow others that assist them in the management of their disease to view their data and send secure messages back to the patient about their readings.

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Usability studies were designed to test human factors such as ease of operation, readability of the measured results, unambiguous messages to the user, and evaluation of the instructions for use (i.e., the help features) as described in Sections 4.4 and 8.4 of ISO 15197:2003 and in Section 3 of the FDA Total Product Life Cycle guidance document (2006). As recommended in Section 8.3 of ISO 15197, study participants were given two surveys to evaluate their understanding of the system and were not given additional training, instructions, or assistance than those routinely provided with the MCT-Diabetes system. The studies were conducted in September and October 2006, respectively, with 47 completed responders out of 65 total participants.

The survey group included a near-even representation of individuals with Type 1 and Type II diabetes, including both children and adults. All responses were kept confidential and participants remained anonymous throughout both surveys. Data were reported in aggregate and no identifying information was linked back to individual responses.

The human factors that were most applicable to this software-only device are the user characteristics (individuals with vision problems must be able to understand the system) and the device-user interface ensuring ease of operation, readability of the result, and unambiguous messages to the user.

The first survey was designed to evaluate the set up process for MCTDiabetes, including registering with MyCare Team, uploading of blood glucose data, and the initial display of the blood glucose data. The outcome of this survey resulted in the following changes to the MCT-Diabetes software:

Enhancements to the Active X control for uploading data from various meters in order to make the upload process proceed more smoothly from USB ports.   
Support for additional meters   
Additional error-checking and updated help files for users

The second survey was designed to evaluate the usability experience for the participants including evaluations of all features of the MCT-Diabetes software. The outcome of this survey resulted in the following changes to the MCT-Diabetes software:

Redesign of the user interface for a number of web pages, including new icons for better readability and navigation. • Addition of new features & functionality, including date of last upload, user setting of blood glucose ranges, and user adjustment of times of day

The usability testing and results was factored appropriately into the Risk Analysis. As problems were identified, software changes were made and documented. The final version after usability testing was identified as Version 2.0.
