Precision: In testing at three CRE levels for 22 days, the within-run CV ranged from 1.3 to 9.6%, and total CV ranged from 4.3 to 17.2%. In precision studies at three separate Physician Office Laboratory (POL) sites and in-house over five days, the within-run CV ranged from 1.0 to 10.1% and total CV ranged from 1.3 to 10.8%. Accuracy: In the correlation study, 65 samples with CRE values ranging from 0.6 to 14.6 mg/dL were assayed on the S40 Clinical Analyzer using S-Test CRE (y) and a comparative method (x). Least- squares regression analysis yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.998, a standard error estimate of 0.16, a confidence interval slope of 1.002 to 1.031, and a confidence interval intercept of -0.20 to -0.10. In patient correlation studies at four separate POL sites using the S40 Clinical Analyzer and a comparative method, least-squares regression analysis yielded correlation coefficients ranged from 0.997 to 0.999, standard error estimates of 0.25 to 0.34, confidence interval slopes of 1.003 to 1.060 and a confidence interval intercepts of -0.38 to 0.10.</td></tr><tr><td>Conclusions:</td><td>Sensitivity: The detection limit was 0.3 mg/dL.

Dear Mr. Tascheck:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) poe Ausl euvaeyurvic y imarketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
