# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The APOLOWAKO analyzer is a fully-integrated POC test system that can perform up to six analytical tests per individual sample. For the HbA1c test, whole blood, and not plasma, is used. For all other tests, the analyzer

automatically separates plasma from whole blood for testing. Once the plasma has been separated, it is transferred to a cell on a measurement disk where the chemical reactions take place. The analyzer uses liquid reagents which are packaged into kits. Each kit contains 2 reagent units. Each unit is composed of two reagents and a calibrator. All of thc rcagents have a reagent information tag applied to the back of each bottle which controls the reagent parameters and conditions such as, calibration, reagent quantity, shelf-life, and lot number. The instrument contains an automated liquid dispcnscr, temperature controlled reagent carrousel, analysis compartment, and sample holder. The instrument is designed to automatically and constantly monitor the reagents, dispensing system, measurement disk, and measurement process to ensure that no erroneous results are shown. The APOLOWAKO HbA1c and APOLOWAKO Glucose include hemoglobin A1c and glucosc test rcagents. The test system is designed for professional use and consists of a small table top instrument (31 cm wide x 47.5 cm high $\mathrm { \textbf { x } } 5 6 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ deep, weight: $2 5 \mathrm { k g } ,$

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use

Thc APOLOWAKO HbA1c and APOLOWAKO Glucose are for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc) $\%$ and glucose in whole blood samples.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Non-clinical Data

Evaluations were performed for within-day imprecision, between-day imprecision, linearity, and intcrfering substances. Those resulting data are summarized below.

# HbA1c

Within-day imprecision, when evaluated at three levels of hemoglobin (low- $4 . 8 \%$ , intermediate- $7 . 7 \%$ ,and high- $1 6 . 7 \ \%$ , ranged from $1 . 2 \%$ CV to $1 . 5 \ \%$ CV. Between-day imprecision, when evaluated in duplicate over 10 days ranged from $1 . 5 \%$ CV to $3 . 0 \%$ CV.

Results from linearity studies demonstrated that thc hcmoglobin Alc ratio $( \% )$ is linear throughout the reportable range.

Results from an interference testing showed hemoglobin Alc assay is not affected by high levels of glucose or bilirubin (conjugated or unconjugated).

# Glucose

Within-day imprecision, whcn evaluated at three levels of glucose (low$5 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ,intermediate- $9 7 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and high- $5 8 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ , ranged from $0 . 6 \%$ CV to $1 . 8 \%$ CV. Between-day imprecision, when evaluated with in duplicate over 10 days, ranged $0 . 7 \%$ CV to $1 . 1 \%$ CV.

Results from linearity studies demonstrated that the glucose is linear throughout the reportable range.

Results from an interference testing showed that the glucose is not affected by high levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin (conjugatcd or unconjugated), triglycerides, ascorbic acid, EDAT-2Na, heparin sodium, or sodium fluoride.

# 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Clinical Data

The method comparison study shows substantial equivalence to FDA cleared comparison methods for HbAlc and Glucosc. For each analyte at least 387 (352 for HbA1c) broadly distributed samples showed statistically significant correlation to the reference method with slopes approaching 1.0 and y-intercepts approaching zero. APOLOWAKO results were collected under rigorous conditions sufficient to meet the requirements for CLIA Waiver. The results show correlation coefficients of O.99 or better for each assay.

# 807.92 (b)(3): Conclusions from Non-clinical and Clinical Testing

Non-clinical and clinical testing was performed for the APOLOWAKO HbA1c and APOLOWAKO Glucose. The test system was shown to be safe and effective for its intended use.

Dear Mr. Panfili:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Iyrvcaeboveint cas  pecassIMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The FDA finding  substantial equivalence of your device to a lealy marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) -638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Intemet address at
