# L. Test Principle:

The Triage $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Profiler S.O.B. Panel is a fluorescence immunoassay for the quantitative determination of D-dimer, CK-MB, myoglobin, troponin I, and BNP in whole blood and plasma specimens using EDTA as the anticoagulant. After addition of the sample to the sample port, the cells are separated from the plasma via a filter contained in the device. A predetermined quantity of plasma is allowed to react with fluorescent antibody conjugates within the reaction chamber. After sufficient incubation has occurred, the reaction mixture flows down the device detection lane. Complexes of the analytes and fluorescent antibody conjugates are captured on discrete zones resulting in binding assays that are specific for each analyte. The concentration of the analyte in the specimen is directly proportional to the fluorescence detected.

The changes to the portion of the Indications for Use pertaining to BNP and the labeling revisions to the “Prognostic Utility in Patients with Heart Failure” section of the labeling were cleared for the Triage $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ BNP Test in k051787.

To support the additional intended use, the sponsor provided five peerreviewed articles from the scientific literature assessing the clinical utility of BNP measurements as an aid in the risk stratification of patients with heart failure. All five studies utilized the Biosite Triage BNP device in their test method.

In one additional paper titled “How well does B-type natriuretic peptide predict death and cardiac events in patients with heart failure: systematic review,” J.A. Doust et al. (British Medical Journal, volume 330, 19 March 2005) performed a systematic evidence-based medicine review of the literature. The review included 24 studies in all. While the review included studies with different study designs and test methods (BNP and NT-proBNP), the five articles previously mentioned were part of the review. The authors concluded that BNP was a strong prognostic indicator for patients with heart failure.

All literature references are cited in the sponsor’s labeling.
