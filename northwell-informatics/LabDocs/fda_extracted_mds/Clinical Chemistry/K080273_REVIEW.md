# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP-5: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline, Second Edition

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

Control values are traceable to an in-house standard prepared from NIST material SRM917b. The control material is analyzed on the sponsor’s reference analyzer in one run of 10 replicates and values must fall within $\pm$ $5 \%$ of the target value of the standard.

Expected Values (Control Range Determination)

The expected values were determined by repeat testing on Bayer Ascensia Breeze 2 using three lot numbers of test strips. Statistical analysis of the data obtained resulted in one range for the three lots. The expected results may change with each new lot, but the control range is listed in the product insert. In addition, the product insert alerts the user to use the control range indicated in the control’s product insert rather than the glucose test strip product’s insert.

# Stability

Shelf Life: Real time stability studies were conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Open Vial Stability: Control material was divided into two pools— Test and Control. The Control Group remained unopened until testing against the Test Group. The Test Group was opened daily and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, then closed and stored at room temperature. One vial of the Test Group and one vial of the Control Group were checked weekly by the sponsor’s reference method. Results from the study supported a 13 week open vial stability.
