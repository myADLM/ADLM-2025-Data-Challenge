Biotinidase activity is determined by measuring the color that develops from ${ \mathfrak { p } }$ -Aminobenzoic Acid (PABA) after PABA is released from Biotinyl- $\mathfrak { p }$ -Aminobenzoate (Biotin-PAB). Samples with biotinidase activity develop a purple color. Samples without biotinidase activity remain straw-colored.

Patient samples of whole blood collected on standardized filter paper are eluted in a standard 96 well microplate. The plate is incubated with Biotin-PAB in a buffer at $3 7 \%$ for 240 minutes on a combination incubator/shaker. Following incubation, TCA is added to the sample mixture and the resulting precipitate is

removed through filtration. The PABA in the filtrate is subsequently diazotized and coupled to a napthol derivative toform an azo dye by the successive addition of sodium nitrite, acidicammonium sulfamate and finally, N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED). The azo dye is measured colorimetrically at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ on a commercial microplate absorbance reader with a reference measurement at $6 9 0 \mathrm { n m }$

The color devcloped is proportional to the biotinidase activity in the sample. A standard curve prepared from a stock PABA solution is used to evaluate the results.

# 5. Statement of Intended Use

This method is for the semi-quantitative determination of biotinidase, EC 3.5.1.12, activity in dried whole blood spots using a spectrophotometer. Measurement of biotinidase activity is primarily for the diagnosis and treatment of biotinidase deficiency in newborns. This method is intended for in vitro diagnostic use to aid in screening for decreased levels of biotinidase activity and not for monitoring purposes.

This device is for use by trained, qualified laboratory personnel.

# 6. Summary of the Technological Characteristics of the Device

# DEVICE COMPARISON

The most significant difference between the SPOTCHECK Biotinidase Microplate Rcagent Kit and the predicate device is the intended analyzer platform. The predicate device is used on a segmented-flow analyzer while the new reagent kit is for manual laboratory use only, applying simple bench chemistry techniques (e.g pipetting) and utilizing a combination incubator/shaker and spectrophotometric microplate reader. The units used for the two assay kits are also different: microplate response units (MRU) for the new kit and enzyme response units (ERU) for the predicate device ( $\mathbf { \Omega } _ { 1 } \mathbf { M R U } \neq \mathbf { \Omega } _ { 1 }$ ERU).

Newborn patient blood spots are punched into microplate wells, eluted and incubated with the same substrate and buffer system as on the predicate device. Extraction and incubation occur concurrently, whereas on the predicate device, samples are irst eluted, then vacu fitere and subsequenty ncbad on the analyzer system. The predicate device utilizes automated dialysis to remove interferences. The SPOTCHECK Biotinidase Microplate Reagent Kit however, uses a reagent not included with the predicate device to precipitate matrix interferences which are subsequently removed through vacuum filtration. The same reagent formulation is used on both devices to generate the azo dye measured at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .

# LINEARITY

Calibration standards are analyzed at the beginning of each assay using the SPOTCHECK Biotinidase Microplate Kit, as with the predicate device. The calibration utilizing PABA standards ranges from 0 to 200 MRU with a typical correlation coefficient of at least 0.999.Additionally, the assay was deemed linear after evaluation over the range of 5 to 213 MRU adhering to CLSl EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach: Approved Guideline.

# SENSITIVITY

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) for biotinidase activity are 2 and 3 MRU, respectively, determined using the guidelines in the CLSI EP17-A protocol. The total error is less than the LoD, and the CLSl document prescribes that the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is equal to the LoD. This correlates well with the sensitivity of the predicate device.

# Page 15 of 27

# DETERMINATION of CLINICAL CUTOFF

The recommendation for determining the clinical action cutoff and cutoff for profound deficiency are the same for both devices: 37 and $10 \%$ of the mean patient result, respectively. As with the predicate device, each laboratory must determine its range of normal, partial and deficient levels of biotinidase activity, based on its population and analytical variables. All samples below the partial activity cutoff require follow-up screening according to local, state and federal laws.

# CLASSIFICATION of DEFICIENT aNd UNCLASSIFIED PATIENT SAMPLES

The performance of the SPOTCHECK Biotinidase Microplate Reagent Kit was evaluated against the predicate device by analyzing unclassified (564) and biotinidase deficient (2) patient samples and (10) deficient controls provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). All deficient patient samples are from persons clinically-confirmed as such. Samples analyzed with the SPOTCHECK Biotinidase Microplate Reagent Kit were treated according to the procedures detailed under SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION FOR ANALYSIS in the product insert.

# PRECISION

To evaluate within-run and total precision (according to CLSI Document EP5-A2) for the new device, Astoria-Pacific's Quality Assurance Laboratory completed 2 analyses per day, of samples in duplicate, for 20 days.An additional low-activity precision study was performed over 5-days only on the Microplate Kit. A summary of the data is shown below compared to the historical performance evaluation of the predicate device. The predicate device evaluation utilized data from 2 runs per day for 8 days (deficient) to 11 days (normal and near deficient) according to NCCLS Document EP5-T.

# 7. Determination of Substantial Equivalency

Based on performance characteristics and comparison data, we believe this device to be safe, effective, and substantially equivalent to the legally-marketed predicate device. The indications for use re the same for the SPOTCHECK Biotinidase Microplate Reagent Kit and the predicate device. Technological characteristics are very similar to the predicate device and there is sufficient evidence demonstrating that the differences do not significantly affect safety and effectiveness when analyzing clinical patients.
