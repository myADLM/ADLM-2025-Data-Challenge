# D. Predicate Device

Roche/Hitachi AST (ASAT/GOT) Aspartate aminotransferase ac. to IFCC with/without pyridoxal phosphate activation (k924244)

Roche Calibrator for automated systems (C.f.a.s.) (k990460).

Roche Precinorm Universal Plus and Precipath Universal Plus controls (k042389).

E. Device Description and Explanation of the Test

The DiaSys ASAT (GOT) FS assay is based on NADH reduction to NAD, as shown in the following equation:

L-Aspartate +2-Oxoglutarate <ASATL-Glutamate + Oxalacetate

Addition of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P-5-P) stabilizes the transaminases and avoids falsely low values in samples containing insufficient endogenous P-5-P, e.g. from patients with myocardial infarction, liver disease and intensive care patients

paC Diagnostics. 1" ed. Frankfurt: TH-Books Verlagsgesellschaft; 1998. p. 55-65.

TruCal U calibrator -Serum based calibrator for use in the calibration of the quantitative DiaSys ASAT (GOT) FS assay on Hitachi 917.

TruLab N and TruLab P controls- Serum based control serum in normal and pathological range for use in quality control for monitoring accuracy and precision of the quantitative DiaSys ASAT (GOT) FS assay on Hitachi 917.

# F. Intended Use / Indications For Use

ASAT (GOT) FS

The ASAT (GOT) FS assay is intended for quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of the activity of the enzyme aspartate amino transferase (AST) in human serum and lithium heparin plasma on the Hitachi 17 instrument. Measurement of aspartate amino transferase levels aids in the diagnosis and treatment of certain types of liver and heart disease.

TruCal U

For in vitro diagnostic use on the Hitachi 917 instrument. TruCal U is used as a calibrator for the DiaSys ASAT (GOT) FS assay.

TruLab N and TruLab P Controls

For in vitro diagnostic use for quantitative testing on the Hitachi 917 instrument. TruLab N and TruLab P control sera are used to monitor accuracy and precision for the DiaSys ASAT (GOT) FS assay.

# G. Substantial Equivalence

# Similarities and Differences

The similarities and differences between the predicate and subject devices are provided below. Briefly, the ASAT assays, calibrators, and control material are similar with respect to intended use, functionality, and operating principle. Both assays are intended to operate as in viro quantitative tests for the measurement of ASAT (GOT) on the Hitachi 917 instrument. Both calibrators are intended to calibrate their respective ASAT assays. Both control materials are intended to monitor the accuracy and precision of their respective ASAT assays.

The main differences are that the subject assay device is indicated ony for human serum and lithium heparin plasma while the predicate assay device is indicated for human serum and both EDTA and Heparin plasma, the subject calibrator is indicated only for ASAT on the Hitachi 917 instrument while the predicate calibrator is a multi-analye calibrator that can be used on a variety oinstruments, and the subject controls are indicated only for ASAT on the Hitachi 917 instrument while the predicate controls are multi-analyte controls that can be used on a variety of instruments.

# Conclusion

In summary, the DiaSys Diagnostic Systems ASAT (GOT) FS assay, TruCal U calibrator, and TruLab N and TruLab P controls devices described in this 510(k) are, in our opinion, substantially equivalent to the predicate devices. They have the same intended use and technological characteristics as the predicates, and raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness.

Dear Ms. Klein:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
