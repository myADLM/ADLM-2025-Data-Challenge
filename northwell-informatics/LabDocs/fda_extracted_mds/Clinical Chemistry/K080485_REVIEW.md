4. Special instrument requirements: Roche Hitachi 917 analyzer

# I. Device Description:

The DiaSys aspartate amino transferase (AST) assay is supplied as ready-to-use, liquid reagents with two formats (with or without pyridoxal- $5 ^ { \circ }$ -phosphate). The first format is a two reagents format without P-5-P, which consists of reagent A and reagent B. The second format is a three reagents format, which consists of reagent A, reagent B, and a third optional reagent, which is pyridoxal- $. 5 '$ -phosphate (P-5-P). For the two-reagent method, the entire contents of reagent B are added to reagent A and are mixed well before use. For the threereagent method, reagent A, reagent B and pyridoxal- $. 5 "$ -phosphate are not mixed together. Components included in the reagents are listed below:

1. Reagent A (Enzyme reagent) contains Tris buffer, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 6 5$ ( $1 1 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ ), L-Aspartate (320 mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase $( \ge 1 2 0 0 \mathrm { U / L } )$ , and malate dehydrogenase $( \geq 8 0 0$ U/L).

2. Reagent B (substrate) contains 2-Oxoglutarate $( 6 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ ) and NADH (1 mmol/L).

3. Liquid pyridoxal- $. 5 '$ -phosphate contains Good’s buffer, $\mathsf { p H } 9 . 6$ (100 mmol/L) and pyridoxal- $\cdot 5 ^ { \circ }$ -phosphate (13 mmol/L).

The TruCal U calibrator is a lyophilized calibrator based on human serum and contains purified additives from human and animal origin, purified pharmaceuticals, and chemical additives. The AST added origins of porcine heart.

The TruLab N and TruLab P controls are lyophilized human-based control serum and contains purified human and animal components, purified drugs and non-organic components.

Human source materials was tested by FDA approved methods and found to be negative for the presence of antibodies to HIV-1, HIV-2, HBsAg, and HCV.

# L. Test Principle:

AST catalyses the transfer of amino group from aspartate to oxoglutarate during the formation of glutamate and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by malate dehydrogenase (MDH). During this conversion, an equivalent amount of NADH is oxidized to NAD. The resulting decrease in absorbance at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ is directly proportional to the activity of AST in serum.

Addition of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P-5-P) stabilizes the transaminases and avoids falsely low values in samples containing insufficient endogenous P-5-P.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A guideline using three levels of serum samples. Samples were run twice per day in duplicate for 20 days on the Hitachi 917 analyzer $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ). Precision data was calculated and summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was evaluated across the entire measuring range. A low serum sample and a high serum sample were mixed to prepare 11 different concentrations of AST and then diluted with saline (the recommended diluent). Each concentration was tested in quadruplicate and range tested was $0 { - } 9 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ for both methods (with P-5-P and without P-5-P) on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Values were plotted for the expected concentrations (X) versus the observed concentrations (Y) and an appropriate line fitted by Passing Bablok method was calculated as follows:

With P-5-P: $y = 0 . 9 9 7 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { + } 0 . 0 4 $ 6, r=0.9998

Without-P-5-P: $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 \mathrm { x } { + } 0 . 0 0 1$ , r=0.9997

The data provided supports the sponsor’s claim that the assay has a reportable range of $7 – 7 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The DiaSys ASAT (GOT) FS assay is standardized against IFCC reference method. The two reagent format without P-5-P is traceable to the modified IFCC formulation while the three reagent format with P-5-P is traceable to the original IFCC formulation.

# Value Assignment:

The concentration of the TruCal U calibrator, TruLab N and P controls are lotspecific and given in the value sheet of the corresponding lot. The value was determined using either the two reagent method without P-5-P or the three reagent method with P-5-P and by using the reagents specified by the method formats. Determinations of the value were performed under an internal protocol against a TruCal U master lot.

The shelf life and open vial stability testing protocols for the calibrators and controls and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. The Limit of Blank (LoB) is defined as the highest value expected to see in a series of results on a sample that contains no analyte. The Limit of Detection (LoD) is the smallest amount that the method can reliably detect to determine presence or absence of an analyte. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is the smallest amount the assay can reliably measure quantitatively and at which the uncertainty of the observed test result is less than or equal to the goal set (total error of a $C V \leq 2 0 \%$ . LoB was determined by running a blank sample 60 times on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined by running 4 low samples 60 times on the Hitachi 917. The detection limits are calculated as follows:

For method with P-5-P: $\mathrm { L o B } { = } 0 . 7 8 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ , $_ { \mathrm { - 0 D = 1 } . 2 6 ~ \mathrm { U / L } }$ , and $_ { \mathrm { L o Q = 1 } . 2 6 \mathrm { U / L } }$

For method without P-5-P: L $\mathrm { { o B } = 1 . 3 0 ~ U / L }$ , Lo $\mathrm { D } { = } 1 . 8 4 ~ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ , and $\mathrm { L o Q { = } 1 . 8 4 U / L }$

The reportable range for the assay is 7 – 700 U/L.

# e. Analytical specificity:

An interference study was evaluated to determine the effect of common interference substances according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Two levels of human serum pools with different AST were tested. The following interference substances were tested: conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin, ascorbic acid and triglyceride. Stock solutions of the above chemicals were prepared and spiked into the tested samples with different concentrations. The $\%$ bias was calculated based on the differences between the spiked sample and the pool sample. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was $< 1 0 \%$ bias for the interferences to be considered as not significant. Results of the hemoglobin study demonstrated significant interference for hemoglobin; thus, the sponsor recommends that user not to use hemolyzed samples for this test and this information is provided in the labeling.

Results of the interference studies of various potential interferents were shown as follows:

For method without P-5-P: Conjugated bilirubin: Interference $\leq 1 0 \%$ for up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ conj. bilirubin Unconjugated bilirubin: Interference $\leq 1 0 \%$ for up to $2 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ unconj.bilirubin Triglycerides: Interference $\leq 1 0 \%$ for up to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ triglycerides Ascorbic acid: Interference $\leq 1 0 \%$ for up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ascorbic acid

For method with P-5-P: Conjugated bilirubin: Interference $\leq 1 0 \%$ for up to $3 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ conj. bilirubin Unconjugated bilirubin: Interference $\leq 1 0 \%$ for up to $2 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ unconj.bilirubin Triglycerides: Interference $\leq 1 0 \%$ for up to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ triglycerides Ascorbic acid: Interference $\leq 1 0 \%$ for up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ascorbic acid
