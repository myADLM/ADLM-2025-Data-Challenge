# D. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE SUMMARY

The IDEAL LIFE Pod Model ILP 0001, Version 2, is substantially equivalent to the Intended Use of the In Touch Diabetes Management Software (K984527) and both the Intended Use and technology of the IDEAL LIFE Pod Model ILP 0001, Version 1 (K060504). Differences with the new Pod have been demonstrated not to affect safety or effectiveness of the device, using software design controls, V&V testing, and user testing of the device. The decision algorithm brings us to a determination of Substantial Equivalence, as defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

# E. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The technological characteristics of the IDEAL LIFE Pod Model ILP 0001 and the predicate Pod are extremely similar, having the same software and hardware design and controls and basic functionality.

Software controls and validation and verification testing have demonstrated that the software changes do not affect device performance. Since the Pod is a wireless device, the radiofrequency interference and emissions have been tested and the Pod complies with appropriate FCC Standards. User testing and historical experience with the Pod have demonstrated that the Pod can be used in the intendcd setting.

# G. CONCLUSIONS

IDEAL LIFE INC. has demonstrated through its comparison of characteristics with the predicate devices and software and hardware testing, that the ILP Model 0001, Version 2 is substantially cquivalent to the predicatc devices.
