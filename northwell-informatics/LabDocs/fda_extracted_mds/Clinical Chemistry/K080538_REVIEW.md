3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): User testing of the POD was conducted to determine:

1. If the POD and Gluco-Manager are easy to use and function as planned when the user is provided only the instructions and materials that would be available if a person were to purchase the devices; and

2. To verify that test data transmitted with (a) the POD connected via the RJ-11 telephone jack, and (b) the POD connected via the RJ-45 Ethernet cable are user friendly and provide the expected Gluco-Manager output on the Internet.

The goal was to select subjects who have never used these devices, who have varying educational levels, and who range in age from 18 to $^ { 7 0 + }$ years. Twenty (20) subjects were enrolled in this study.

Inclusion Criteria:

1. Male and female patients aged 18 to $7 0 +$ years.   
2. Subjects must be able to read English and must be physically able to conduct the test by themselves.   
3. Subjects must have some familiarity with computers, as the use of the two devices with a computer and Internet-based system is central to the study.   
4. Subjects must agree to sign the Informed Consent document.   
5. Subjects will not be paid for their participation in this study.

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Subjects who have used either of these IDEAL LIFE devices before will be excluded from the trial.

Evaluation Each Study Subject was provided with the following:

• One POD   
• One Gluco-Manager One Ethernet cable One telephone cable Pod and Gluco-Manager Instruction Manuals   
• Written Instructions   
• Survey parts 1 and 2

Study Subjects were instructed to follow the Instruction Manual(s) to set up the Gluco- Manager and Pod. The Instruction Manuals provide a tollfree number to register the Pod and to receive a user name and password. If the Study Subject asked questions of IDEAL LIFE staff at the time that the toll-free telephone number is called for product registration, questions will be allowed as this will be standard procedure during actual device use.

Seven data sets are preloaded in the Gluco-Manager and the subjects transmitted preloaded data using the Modem/RJ-11 jack setup and then view their data on the Internet. After this process was completed, Part 2 of the evaluation was completed to evaluate the usability of the devices and the accuracy of the data transmitted. At the end of the user questions, the subjects were directed to repeat this process using the Ethernet connection. Subjects transmitted preloaded data using the Ethernet/RJ-45 jack setup and then viewed their data on the Internet. After this process was completed, Part 3 of the evaluation was completed to evaluate the usability of the devices and the accuracy of the data transmitted.

Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the mean and standard deviation of VAS scores, as well as the coefficient of variation (SD/Mean). Comments of study subjects were analyzed to determine if changes to the Instruction Manual or the device are required or would be beneficial. A log of telephone calls and questions was maintained for the same purpose. Adverse events, if any, were processed according to IDEAL LIFE MDR Reporting Procedure 902P.

Applicant’s Analysis and Conclusions

The Pod is a "Plug-N-Play" device that is, by design, simple to set up and to use. Validation and Verification testing conducted by IDEAL LIFE engineers during development and prior to finalizing the software and hardware design, including this Usability Test and one smaller previous test. The user test was designed to test the usability of the Pod with the Gluco-Manager for naive users, to reflect initial operation by a new purchaser of the devices and identify potential design flaws in actual use situations.

Average scores for all questions were below "2" on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the most favorable response. All open comments were positive.

In conclusion, the positive response to this user test and a previous usability test indicates that there are no areas of concern about the usability of the device by the intended users.

N. Instrument Name: Ideal Life POD (Model ILP 0001)

O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The device is for data transmission the communication of the Pod with compatible IDEAL LIFE devices is shown using wireless Bluetooth technology. After the data from these devices is transmitted to the Pod, the Pod acts like a modem to communicate through the user's telephone line cord (using the LINE connector, white in the photo below) or over the Internet (using the Ethernet connector via an RJ45 connector, red in the photo below).
