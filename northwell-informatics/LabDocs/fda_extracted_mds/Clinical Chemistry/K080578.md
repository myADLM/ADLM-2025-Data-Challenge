# F. Predicate Device:

The Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PBNP Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge (K6423A) and the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PBNP Calibrator (KC676A) are substantially equivalent to the Dimension Vista $\textcircled{8}$ PBNP Flex $\circled{8}$ reagent cartridge (K6423) and the Dimension Vista $\circled{ R}$ PBNP Calibrator (KC676) both cleared under K061795.

# G. Device Description:

Method

The PBNP method is a one-step sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $L O C \lvert \textcircled { \mathsf { R } }$ technology. $L O C \left| \mathfrak { Q } \right.$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated monoclonal antibody fragment which recognize an epitope located in the N-terminal part of proBNP. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second antibody specific for a second independent epitope on NT-proBNP and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a particle/NT-proBNP/biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads then are added and bind to the biotin to form a bead-aggregated immunocomplex. Illumination of the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads, which diffuses to the Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at 612 nm and is directly proportional to the concentration of NT-proBNP in the sample.

# Calibrator

The PBNP Calibrator is a frozen liquid product containing synthetic human Nterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in bovine albumin matrix with stabilizers and preservative. The kit consists of ten vials, two vials per level (A, B, C, D, and E), 1.0 mL per vial. Description of the manufacturing, value assignment and stability testing process are provided in this submission report.

# H. Intended Use:

# Method

The PBNP method is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative measurement of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista $\textcircled{8}$ System. In individuals suspected of having congestive heart failure (CHF), measurements of NT-proBNP are used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of severity. The test is further indicated for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome and heart failure.

# Calibrator

The PBNP CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the N-Terminal Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (PBNP) method for the Dimension Vista® System.
