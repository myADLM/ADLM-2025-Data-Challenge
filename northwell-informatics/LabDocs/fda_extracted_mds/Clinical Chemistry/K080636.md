# 4. Description:

HuBDIC's Duo- Max Blood Pressure and Glucose Monitor System, Model HMF-100 combines the function of a blood pressure meter and a blood glucose monitoring system in one unit. Supplies with the meter are test strips, lancets, Lancing device, storage case, batteries and log book.

HMF-100 adopts the wrist type cuff for blood pressure meter part. The cuff and control unit are combined into a single wrist-mounted assembly. The user interface pane has power switch, timer switch, memory switch for blood pressure meter part and LCD for displaying the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, date and time. This device has the memory function that permits memory and display of the 180 most recent measurement results.

# 5. Indications for use:

The Duo-Max Blood pressure and Glucose Monitor, Model HMF-100 consists of a meter with wrist cuff and test strips. The system is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood taken from the fingertip. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes mellitus, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for use on neonates. Also the system measures systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate from adult's wrist in the home care environment. The device employs a wrist cuff and the oscillometric metric method of measurement.

# 6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics with Predicate:

The Duo-Max Blood Pressure and Glucose Monitor, Model HMF-100 has the same general design and performance characteristics as the predicate device from Sein. The main difference is the physical size, shape and weight as seen below:

# 7. Performance Data:

In terms of operating specification, Safety $\&$ EMC requirements, the device conforms to applicable standards including ANSl/AAMI SP-10, IEC 60601-1 and IEC 60601-1-2 requirements.

The Blood Pressure and Glucose Monitor, Model HMF-100 tested and met all relevant requirements of the aforementioned tests.

# 8. Conclusion:

We have demonstrated that the Blood Pressure and Glucose Monitor, Model HMF100 is as safe and effective as the predicate devices based on our performance testing results as well as with the risk analysis supplied with this submission.

This submitter concludes that the Blood Pressure and Glucose Monitor, Model HMF100 is therefore substantialy equivalent to the predicate devices.
