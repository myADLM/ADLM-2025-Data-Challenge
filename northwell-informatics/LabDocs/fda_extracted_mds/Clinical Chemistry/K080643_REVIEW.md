# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys Anti-TSHR CalCheck is a lyophilized product consisting of human anti-TSHR antibodies in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the antibody is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels. The control material is provided at three levels of 1ml each.

All components of the control are tested individually and shown to be free of HBsAG and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods used were FDA approved or cleared with the European Directive 98/79/EC Annex II List A.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck

2. Predicate K number(s): k040157

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: Standardized against NIBSC $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ IS 90/672 Standard

Value Assignment: Values are assigned using a minimum of three Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 and three MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 / cobas e 601 Immunoassay Analyzers. Six independent series of analyses are performed on each instrument platform. The target value is calculated as the median of the determined values. Approximate target values are found in the following table. Lot-specific target values may differ slightly after value assignment.
