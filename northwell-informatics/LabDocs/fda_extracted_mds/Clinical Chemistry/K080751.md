# Predicate Device

ABBOTT TDx/TDxFLx Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood (P8900251 and supplement 7)

# Device Description

The ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of cyclosporine in human whole blood using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex.

Prior to the initiation of the automated ARCHITECT sequence, a manual pretreatment step is performed in which the whole blood sample is lysed with a solubilization reagent, extracted with a precipitation reagent and centrifuged. The supernatant is decanted into a Transplant Pretreatment Tube, which is placed onto the ARCHITECT / System.

In the first step, sample, assay diluent, and anti-cyclosporine coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined to create a reaction mixture. Cyclosprorine present in the sample binds to the anti-cyclosporine coated microparticles. After washing, cyclosporine acridiniumlabeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the amount of cyclosporine in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT / System optics.

# Statement of Substantial Equivalence

The ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of cyclosporine in human whole blood on the ARCHiTECT i System. The ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay is used as an aid in the management of heart, iver and kidney transplant patients receiving cyclosporine therapy.

The ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay is substantially equivalent to the TDx/TDxFLx Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood assay. Both of the devices are IVD products and are indicated for the quantitative determination of cyclosporine in human whole blood and used as an aid in the management of heart, liver and kidney transplant patients receiving cyclosporine therapy.

A study was performed using human whole blood specimens from heart, renal and liver transplant patients receiving cyclosporine therapy, where regression analysis was performed using the Passing-Bablok² method. Data from the study are summarized in the following table.

# Performance Characteristics

# Precision:

A study was performed with the ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, document (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) Protocol EP5- A2. Abbott Immunosuppressant-MCC (levels $1 , 3 ,$ and 4) and two pooled patient samples and 3 human whole blood samples spiked with cyclosporine were assayed, using two lots of reagents, on two instruments, in replicates of two at two separate times per day for 20 days. Each reagent lot used a single calibration curve throughout the study.

The total precision $\% C V$ of the ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay was determined to be less than or equal to $1 5 \%$ .

# Linearity:

A dilution linearity study was performed by diluting high concentration cyclosporine whole blood specimens with the ARCHITECT Cyclosporine Calibrator A. The concentration of cyclosporine was determined for each dilution of sample and the mean percent $( \% )$ recovery was calculated.

The ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay was determined to have a mean recovery within $10 \%$ of the expected result for diluted samples.

# Functional Sensitivity:

Whole blood specimens were spiked with cyclosporine to achieve approximate concentrations from 5 to 50 ng/mL and tested in replicates of 10, twice a day, for five days. At the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence limit, the lowest ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay value exhibiting a $20 \%$ CV was calculated to be 20.7 ng/mL.

# Analytical Sensitivity:

The limit of detection for the ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay, defined as the concentration at two standard deviations above the ARCHITECT Cyclosporine Calibrator A (0.0 ng/mL) was calculated to be 4.7 ng/mL at the $9 5 \%$ confidence (based on one study with $\mathsf { n } = 2 4$ runs, 10 replicates calibrator A and 4 replicates calibrator B per run).

# Interference:

Whole blood specimens were supplemented with various drugs and potentially interfering compounds (triglycerides, hematocrit, bilirubin, total protein, cholesterol, uric acid, HAMA, and

heumatoid factor RF).The average recovery observed during the study ranged from 97 tc $108 \%$ ..

# Specificity:

Aliquots of whole blood specimens were augmented with cyclosporine, targeting values ranging from 30 to 1500 ng/mL. These five specimens were spiked with cross-reactant solution. Data from this study are summarized in the following table.

<table><tr><td>Metabolite</td><td>Amount Added (ng/mL)</td><td>Mean Excess Concentration Detected</td><td>% Cross Reactivitya</td></tr><tr><td>AM1</td><td>1000</td><td>(ng/mL, n=5) 0.7</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>AM1c</td><td>1000</td><td>10.2</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>AM4N</td><td>1000</td><td>-5.9</td><td>-0.6</td></tr><tr><td>AM9</td><td>1000</td><td>-1.6</td><td>-0.2</td></tr><tr><td>AM19</td><td>1000</td><td>-4.5</td><td>-0.4</td></tr></table>
