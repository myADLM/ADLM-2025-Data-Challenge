# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-T2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices;

# L. Test Principle:

The A/C Portable Enzymatic Homocysteine (HCY) Assay measures total homocysteine (tHCY) in plasma and serum. The principle of the assay is that tHCY is degraded by Homocysteinase (rHCYase) and produces hydrogen sulfide $\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S ) }$ , which is measured using N,N-dibutyl phenylene diamine (DBPDA), the combination of which forms a chromophore. After oxidation, the $\mathbf { A } / \mathbf { C }$ Diagnostics Reader, a fluorescence reader is used to obtain the tHCY values.

The A/C Portable Enzymatic Homocysteine Assay is a manual assay with the results read by the A/C Diagnostics Reader. Five $\mu \mathrm { L }$ of EDTA plasma is used in a dithiothreitol reduction reaction for 60 minutes to release bound homocysteine. The rHCYase reaction is then run for 5 minutes. The DBPDA chromophore is then added and one minute later an oxidant, potassium ferricyanide, is added. Ten minutes later, the end-points are read at $\mathrm { E m 7 1 0 n m / E X ~ 6 6 0 }$ nm.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the assay on the A/C Diagnostics Reader was evaluated in a study based on CLSI EP5-T2 guidelines “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices.” In this study, precision was determined after analyzing three plasma samples containing low, medium and high tHCY in parallel assays. The within-assay precision was determined from results from 10 parallel analytical setups. The between-assay precision was calculated in 10 successive assays carried out over 10 days. The CVs, shown in the table below, for within-assay and between-assay were less than $5 \%$ and $10 \%$ , respectively.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Five plasma samples containing different levels of homocysteine $( 3 . 2 { - } 4 4 . 6 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l { L } ) }$ were measured by the $\mathbf { A } / \mathbf { C }$ Portable Enzymatic HCY Assay on the $\mathbf { A } / \mathbf { C }$ Diagnostics Reader. The data demonstrated linearity of the assay up to $4 3 . 8 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ with the regression equation of $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 5 3 6 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 5 9 6 3$ , $\operatorname { R } ^ { 2 } = { \dot { 0 } } . { \dot { 9 } } { \dot { 9 } } 6 9$ . The studies support the stated measuring range of the assay of 4.1 to $4 3 . 8 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ .

A recovery study was performed in which one sample with tHCY a concentration of $4 5 . 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ was serially diluted 2, 4 and 8 times. The samples were analyzed by the Portable $\mathbf { A } / \mathbf { C }$ Enzymatic HCY Assay in 10 replicates in a single run. The average $\%$ recoveries ranged from 91 to $104 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrators and Controls were prepared by spiking homocysteine into a plasma matrix. The plasma matrix was manufactured from material such that each donor unit was tested by an FDA approved method for the presence of antibody to HIV-1/2, antibody to HCV, as well as for the Hepatitis B Surface Antigen $\left( { \mathrm { H b s A g } } \right)$ , and found to be negative. An HPLC method was used for the value determination of Calibrators and Controls for the A/C Enzymatic Homocysteine Assay. Calibrators and controls are stated to be stable for 24 hours at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 2 months at $4 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 2 years at ${ } - 2 0 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stability was determined by testing the vials stored at different temperatures for certain periods compared with the standard in the Portable A/C Enzymatic HCY Assay. Calibrators and controls are supplied with the kit.

# c. Detection limit:

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) is used as the low detection limit of the assay. The limit of quantitation was defined as the lowest concentration having a $C V < 2 0 \%$

The results demonstrate that the LoQ of the $\mathbf { A } / \mathbf { C }$ Portable Enzymatic HCY Assay on the A/C Diagnostics Reader is $3 . 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ . The sponsor has established the measuring range of the assay as from 4.1 to $4 3 . 8 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ (see Section b. Linearity).

# d. Analytical specificity:

To study the effect of bilirubin, plasma samples with tHCY levels of 5.7 and 14.8 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ were spiked with bilirubin to achieve bilirubin levels of12.5, 25 and 50 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .The samples were analyzed in quadruplicate by the assay. The results demonstrate that bilirubin concentrations of up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ show $< 1 0 \%$ interference and therefore, do not interfere with the measurement of tHCY by the assay.

Interference from glycerol was studied using plasma samples with tHCY levels of 6.8 and $1 1 . 6 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ which were spiked with glycerol to achieve levels of 1,250, 2,500 and $5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The results demonstrated that glycerol concentrations of up to 5000 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ show $< 1 0 \%$ interference and therefore, do not interfere with the measurement of tHCY by the assay. In addition, plasma samples with tHCY levels of 6.8 and 11.6 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ spiked with a commercially available lipid mixture containing $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ showed $< 1 0 \%$ interference. To study the effect of hemoglobin plasma samples with 5.5 and $1 4 . 6 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ tHCY were spiked with hemoglobin to achieve hemoglobin levels of $0 . 2 5 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ , $0 . 5 { \mathrm { g } } / { \mathrm { L } }$ and $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { g / L }$ . The results demonstrate that hemoglobin concentrations of up to $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / m L }$ $( 1 . 0 \mathrm { g / L } )$ show $< 1 0 \%$ interference and therefore, do not interfere with the measurement of tHCY by the assay.

Cross reactivity was tested and is $\leq 1 0 \%$ for cystathione (up to $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ), Lcysteine (up to $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ ), methionine (up to $0 . 2 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ) and glutathione (up to 0.5 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ .

# Other Limitations

Specimens from patients who are on drug therapy involving S-adenosyl methionine may show falsely elevated levels of homocysteine. Specimens from patients taking methotrexate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide or 6-azauridine triacetate may have elevated levels due to their effect on the methionine-homocysteine metabolic pathway.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Fifty EDTA plasma samples with values ranging from 5.0 to $3 7 . 6 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ were measured both by the A/C Portable Enzymatic HCY Assay on the $\mathrm { A } / \mathrm { C }$ Diagnostics

Reader and the $\mathbf { A } / \mathbf { C }$ Automatic Enzymatic HCY Assay on the Hitachi 912 Automatic Analyzer (predicate device). The comparison yielded a regression equation of $\mathbf { y } =$ $1 . 0 0 9 8 \mathrm { x } + \bar { 0 } . 9 1 2 4$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 \dot { 4 } 6$

# b. Matrix comparison:

Samples collected from 10 donors were immediately separated into three different vacutainers, one without additive, one containing $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ –EDTA and one containing sodium heparin, respectively. Plasma and serum were separated from whole blood within one hour by centrifugation. High HCY samples were prepared by spiking Lhomocysteine into 6 samples to prepare a total of 16 samples. Total HCY values of the samples were measured by the $\mathbf { A } / \mathbf { C }$ Portable Enzymatic HCY Assay on the A/C Diagnostics Reader. The results are shown in the table below.
