# Device Name:

Trade name: CarcSens Blood Glucose Monitoring System Common Name: Blood Glucose Test System Classification Name: Class II, 862.1345 Glucose Blood Tester

# Predicate Device:

We claim substantial equivalence to the OneTouch® Ultra® from LifeScan, Inc.,

# Device Description:

CareSens Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an in vitro diagnostic device designed to measure the concentration of glucose in capillary whole blood with CareSens Test Strips. The CareSens II modcl consists of the CareSens II meter, CareSens test strips, CareSens control solution (Normal and Middle ranges), check strips, lancing device, lancets, user manual, quick reference guide and a logbook. CareSens POP model consists of the CareSens POP meter, CareSens test strips and lancing device, lancets, user guide, and quick guide.

# The test principle is:

CareSens Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an in vitro diagnostic product intended for the measurement of glucose concentration in human blood, based on the glucose oxidase method for glucose dctermination. Each test strip features an electrode containing the enzyme glucose oxidase. A blood sample is applied to the blood collection area at the tip of thc strip and is automatically drawn into the reaction zone, where the glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to produce gluconic acid. During the reaction, a mediator transfers electrons to the electrode surface and generates a current. The amount of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the blood sample. The test strip employs an elcctrochemical signal generating an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is mcasured by the Meter and displayed as your blood glucose result.

# Intended Use:

The CareScns II, CarcSens POP Meters are used for the quantitative measurement of glucose level in capillary whole blood as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management at home or in clinical settings. CareSens Blood Glucose System is only for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). Testing sites include the traditional fingertip along with alternate sites such as forcarm, palm, thigh and calf.

CareSens Test Strips work with the CareSens II, CareSens POP meters to quantitatively measure glucosc level in capillary whole blood as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management in the home or in clinical settings. CareSens Blood Glucose System is only for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). Testing sites include the traditional fingcrtip along with alternate sites such as forearm, palm, thigh and calf.

CareSens Normal and Middle Control Solutions are a red liquid which is to be used to check that both the CareSens metcrs and CareSens test strips are working together properly. It contains a known range of glucose as specified on the vial.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

The i-SENS, Inc. CareSens Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed item, the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Ultra $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ by LifeScan, Inc.

Data demonstrating Substantial equivalence:

The clinical data demonstrates the performance of the CareSens Blood Glucose Monitoring System well with the laboratory glucose reference test equipment. All predetermined acceptance criteria wcre satisfied. The data also demonstrate that the CareSens Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

# Conclusion:

CareSens Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to thc following predicate device system: K024194 - LifeScan, Inc. OneTouch® Ultra $\underline { { \widehat { \mathbb { R } } } } )$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

Dear Hyun Joon Oh:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
