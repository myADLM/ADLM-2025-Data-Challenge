# L. Test Principle:

The Precision Xceed Pro Blood Glucose and B-Ketone Monitoring System measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose biosensor is capable of determining glucose oxidized by the enzyme (Glucose Dehydrogenase, GDH-NAD) catalyzed reaction with Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide $( \mathrm { N A D + } )$ cofactor. The reduced form of $\mathrm { N A D + ( N A D H ) }$ is re-oxidized by reaction with the electrochemical mediator, 1,10-phenanthroline quinone (1,10-PQ). The reduced mediator is re-oxidized via electron transfer at the electrode surface. This current is translated into a number by the monitor, after applying lot specific calibration information and after a 20 second countdown, a concentration value is presented to the user. In this same manner, the biosensor electrode utilizes the enzyme hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase (HBDH), which reacts with the beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-ketone) concentration in the sample. This reaction is transferred to the monitor through an electrical current generated proportional to the level of beta-ketone in the sample. This current is translated into a number by the monitor, after applying lot specific calibration information and after a 10 second countdown, a concentration value is presented to the user.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Glucose precision was established in k021960.

B-ketone within-run precision - Testing with blood was conducted using four Xceed meters for each of three lots of blood ketone test strips with three venous whole blood samples. Each blood was spiked to five 3-OHB (ketone) levels (0-0.75, 0.75-1.5, 1.5- 3, 3-4.5 and $4 . 5 { - } 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ ). For each lot of test strips, twenty replicate measurements were performed for each blood and ketone level. Testing with control solution was conducted over two runs using four Xceed meters for each of three lots of blood ketone test strips with low, mid and high ketone control solution. For each run and lot of test strips forty replicate measurements were performed for each control solution level.

Results from testing with blood; the mean response, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation $( \% \mathrm { C V } )$ were calculated for each lot of test strips, blood, meter and ketone level. Mean results were then calculated for each ketone level by lot and over the three lots of test strips. Mean values for SD and $\%$ CV were calculated using root mean square (RMS). Results from testing with control solution; the mean response, SD and $\%$ CV were calculated for each lot of test strips, run, meter and control solution level. Mean results were then calculated for each control solution level by lot and over the three lots of test strips. Mean values for SD and $\%$ CV were calculated using root mean square.

Summary of results:

B-ketone between-run precision - Testing was conducted over twenty days using ten Xceed meters and three lots of blood ketone test strips with low, mid and high ketone control solution. For each meter, two replicates were performed on each day, lot of test strips and control solution level.

The mean response, standard deviation (SD) and coefficients of variation $( \% \mathrm { C V } )$ were calculated for each lot of test strips and control solution level. Mean results were then calculated over the three lots of test strips. Mean values for SD and $\%$ CV were calculated using root mean square.

Glucose linearity was established in k021960.

B-ketone linearity – The study was conducted over 2 days. On each day, capillary whole blood samples were collected from 20 donors. The capillary samples were spiked to varying ketone concentrations and distributed throughout the measuring range, from $0 . 0 1 { - } 8 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . Three lots of test strips were tested. Duplicate measurements were performed for each lot of test strips, day and blood sample.

The sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $+ / - 0 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ for ketone levels below $1 . 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and $+ / - 1 0 \%$ for ketone levels at or above $1 . 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were met. The linear regressions for lot 1 was $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 6 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 1$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ , for lot 2 was $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 \mathrm { x } -$ 0.03, $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ , and for lot 3 was $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 5 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0 1$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 0$ . This testing also demonstrated that readings of “Hi” were consistently obtained for ketone levels $> 8 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Glucose controls traceability and stability was established in k021960.   
Ketone controls traceability and stability was established in k040814.

d. Detection limit:

Glucose detection limit was established in k021960.

B-ketone limit of detection is 0.01mmol/L.

e. Analytical specificity:

Glucose analytical specificity was established in k021960.

Since the B-ketone test strips have not been modified since clearance in k040814, the B-ketone specificity established in k040814 is applicable.

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable
