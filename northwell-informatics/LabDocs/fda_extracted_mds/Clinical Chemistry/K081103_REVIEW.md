# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

FDA/CDRH Guidance for Industry: Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators, Final- February 22, 1999.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

Traceability and value assignment for free thyroxine (fT4) in the calibrator was previously described in k073604 and has not been modified.

Traceability and value assignment for thyroid stimulating hormone involves preparation of anchor pools and master pools. The anchor pool is prepared from WHO TSH $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ IRP 80/558 reference material spiked into TSH-free serum. Three levels of anchor pool are prepared. A Master Pool is prepared gravimetrically from a commercially available TSH. Values for the Master Pool are derived by multiple analyses against the Anchor Pool calibration curve. $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ Thyroid Calibrator value assignment is established by measurement against the Master Pool calibration.

Stability: The shelf-life and open-vial stability of the LOCI Thyroid Calibrator when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ have been demonstrated using real time data collected from 3 lots of calibrators. The predetermined acceptance criteria and protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

For the LOCI Thyroid Calibrator, the sponsor claims a shelf life of 12 months when unopened and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once opened, the LOCI Thyroid Calibrator is stable for 3 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable
