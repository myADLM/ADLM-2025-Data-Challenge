# Device Name

Proprietary name Cobas Integra 400/800 Bilirubin Total Common name Bilirubin (total or direct) test system Classification name Bilirubin (total or direct) test system

# Device Description

The Cobas Integra Bilirubin Total reagent is intended for use with the Cobas Integra systems for the quantitative determination of the total bilirubin concentration in human serum

# Intended use

In vitro test for the quantitative determination of the total bilirubin concentration in human serum on Cobas Integra Bilirubin is formed in the reticuloendothelial system during the degradation of aged erythrocytes The heme portion from hemoglobin and from other heme-containing proteins is removed, metabolized to bilirubin and transported as a complex with serum albumin to the liver In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid for solubilization and subsequent transport through the bile duct and elimination via the digestive tract Diseases or conditions which, through hemolytic processes, produce bilirubin faster than the liver can metabolize it, cause the levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin to increase in the circulation Liver immaturity and several other diseases in which the bilirubin conjugation mechanism is impared cause similar elevations of circulating unconjugated bilirubin Bile duct obstruction or damage to hepatocellular structure causes increases in the levels of both conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indrect) bilirubin in the circulation
