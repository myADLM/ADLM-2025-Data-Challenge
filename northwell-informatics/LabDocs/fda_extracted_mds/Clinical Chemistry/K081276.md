# Description:

All the reagents, controls and calibrators included in this submission are for use on the ABX PENTRA 400 (K052007), which is a discrete photometric bench top clinical chemistry analyzer.

The ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of glucose in human serum, plasma and urine based on an enzymatic method using hexokinase coupled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. It is composed of a bi-reagent cassette, with $5 6 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ and $1 4 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ compartments. Reagents are chemical solutions with additives.

The ABX PENTRA Uric Acid CP is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of uric acid in human serum, plasma and urine based on the enzymatic determination of uric acid using a chromogenic system in the presence of peroxidase and uricase (Trinder method). It is composed of a bi-reagent cassette, with $6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m l } }$ and $1 5 \mathrm { m l }$ compartments. Reagents are chemical solutions with additives.

The ABX PENTRA Urine Control L/H is a two-level (Low and High) quality control consisting of liquid solutions prepared from human urine with chemical additives and materials of biological origin added as required to obtain given component levels. The assigned values of the control components are given in the enclosed annex, ensuring control of the appropriate HORIBA ABX methods on the ABX PENTRA 400 analyzer. Each control level is provided in one vial of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ .

# Intended Use :

All reagents in this submission are intended for use on the ABX PENTRA 400 for the quantitative in-vitro determination of their respective analytes (Glucose, Uric Acid) using human serum, plasma and/or urine.

The controls and calibrators are intended for use in association with the above reagents.

# Discussion of Performance Data:

ABX Pentra Glucose HK CP (K052007) and ABX Pentra Uric Acid CP (K060205) have already been cleared by the FDA for use on serum and plasma samples. No modification has been made to these devices. The performances on serum and plasma samples have not been modified.

Therefore, for these 2 devices, only added performances, on urine samples, are discussed below.
