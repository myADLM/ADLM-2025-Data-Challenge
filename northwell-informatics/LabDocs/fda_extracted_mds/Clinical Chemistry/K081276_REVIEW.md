b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

# ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP

Without Post-dilution

Linearity determination was based upon CLSI EP6-A using aqueous glucose standards. The concentrations of the standards covered the measuring range with the lowest standard at 3.92 and the highest standard at $1 0 1 7 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each level was measured 4 times. Following the CLSI document, first, second and third order regressions were calculated. It was determined that the third order regression represented the best fit. Based on these studies, the sponsor has demonstrated linearity for the ABX Pentra Glucose HK CP from $3 . 9 \mathrm { - } 9 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sponsor is claiming a measuring range of $3 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ - $9 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# With Post-dilution

The Pentra 400 performs automatic dilutions (1/3) on urine glucose samples if the value is $> 9 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ up to a limit of $2 7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A study was performed comparing manual dilutions to the Pentra 400 automated dilutions using human urine samples spiked with glucose. Samples ranged from $1 1 7 7 . 6 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $2 6 2 9 . 5 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Manual and automated dilution factors were the same and each sample was run in duplicate. Bias between the two methods was calculated and was acceptable.

# ABX PENTRA Uric Acid CP

Without Post-dilution

Linearity determination was based upon CLSI EP6-A using 11 uric acid solutions. The concentrations of the solutions were prepared based on the dilution of the highest concentration solution with a solution near the low limit of detection. The concentrations of the standards ranged from 5.19 to 283.37 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each level was measured 4 times. Following the CLSI document, first, second and third order regressions were calculated. It was determined that the second order regression represented the best fit. Based on these studies, the sponsor is claiming a measuring range for the ABX Pentra Uric Acid CP from $5 . 2 { - } 2 5 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# With Post-Dilution

The Pentra 400 performs automatic dilutions (1/3) on urine uric acid samples if the value is $\mathrm { : > 2 5 2 m g / d L }$ up to a limit of $7 5 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A study was performed comparing manual dilutions to the Pentra 400 automated dilutions using human urine samples spiked with uric acid. Samples ranged from $2 5 3 . 9 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $7 1 2 . 9 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Manual and automated dilution factors were the same and each sample was run in duplicate. Bias between the two methods was calculated and was acceptable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability: ABX PENTRA Urine Control L/H

The values of the ABX PENTRA Controls are assigned from the ABX PENTRA calibrator, reagents and analyzers following a standardized protocol. A minimum of 6 ABX PENTRA 400 analyzers are used.

Target values for each level of control are the median of the combined results from the 6 analyzers $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 5 0 )$ . The percentage of deviation between the lowest device mean and the highest device mean must be less than $10 \%$ . The coefficients of variation (CV) are calculated and ranked by value for each analyzer. The confidence range generally applied is $+ / - 3$ times the standard deviation around the highest CV. Once the target value and confidence interval have been determined, the control is run on 1 ABX Pentra 400 for confirmation.

Control Shelf-life : The stability of the products have been evaluated using 2 lots. Results support a real time stability of 2 years in unopened vials stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Reagent Stability After Opening : Control stability has been tested by doing recovery studies over time. Results have determined a stability of 30 days in vials stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , tightly closed when not in-use.

# d. Detection limit:

# ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP

Physiological water $( 0 . 9 \%$ NaCl) was assayed 60 times on 2 different Pentra 400 for glucose. Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP17-A “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation ; Approved Guideline”. The LoB is $1 . 9 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Limit of Detection (LoD) was derived from assaying 4 samples with concentrations between LoB and LoB x 4, 20 times. The LoD is $2 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying a range of low concentration samples 12 times. The LoQ was defined as the first concentration sample where the $C V \%$ was lower than $1 5 \%$ and the relative bias within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ . The LoQ is $3 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# ABX PENTRA Uric Acid CP

Physiological water $( 0 . 9 \%$ NaCl) was assayed 90 times on 3 different Pentra 400 for uric acid. Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP17-A “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation ; Approved Guideline”. The LoB is $2 . 3 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Limit of Detection (LoD) was derived from assaying 4 samples with concentrations between LoB and LoB x 4, 20 times. The LoD is $3 . 4 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying a range of low concentration samples 12 times. The LoQ was defined as the first concentration sample where the $C V \%$ was lower than $1 5 \%$ and the relative bias was within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ . The LoQ is $5 . 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The claimed LoQ for uric acid is $5 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d l }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous interference was determined in according to the following protocol: Interfering substances in solution were added to pooled human urine at two different glucose or uric acid concentrations (normal and high). Each sample was then serially diluted with the same neat base urine to adjust the glucose or uric acid concentrations. The sponsor determined that greater than $10 \%$ deviation from the target glucose or uric acid values constituted interference.

Exogeneous interference from $\mathsf { p H }$ was tested for glucose at levels of 3.3, 7.2 and 10.4.

# ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP

The conclusions were:

Hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } { - } 5 \mathrm { g / L }$ (290 micmol/L ) does not interfere with glucose determination on the ABX Pentra 400.

Total Bilirubin up to $2 9 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (500 micmol/L ) does not interfere with glucose determination on the ABX Pentra 400.
