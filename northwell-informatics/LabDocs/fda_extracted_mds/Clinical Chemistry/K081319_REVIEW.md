2. Classification: Class II

3. Product Code: JIT

4. Panel: Chemistry (75

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): The LIPL Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product to be used to calibrate the Lipase (LIPL) method for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems.

2. Indication(s) for use: See intended use(s) above.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Prescription Use Only

4. Special instrument requirements: Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems

# I. Device Description:

The LIPL calibrator is a liquid bovine serum albumin-based product. The level 1 calibrator contains no detectable lipase. Levels 2 and 3 contain porcine pancreas lipase. The kit consists of six vials, two vials of Calibrator Level 1, two vials of Calibrator Level 2, and two vials of Calibrator Level 3 which are ready for use (no preparation is required). The volume per vial is $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ .

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 14971:2007 Medical Device – Application of risk management to medical devices (General)

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The assigned values of the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LIPL Calibrators are traceable to Master Pool values, assigned on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry system.

Master Pool level 1 of BSA base is assigned a value of $0 \mathrm { U / L }$ . LIPL Master Pool bottle values levels 2 and 3 are assigned on multiple instruments calibrated with LIPL Anchor Pool. The LIPL Anchor Pool values are assigned using an external reference system (PBS/Precical $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ). A previous Master Pool lot is used as a control. Calibrators are prepared gravimetrically from porcine lipase. The concentration of each level is verified against Master Pool values.

Stability was assessed by comparing vials opened, quantities removed and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for designated time periods to freshly opened vials. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were change in value must be $65 \%$ over the shelf life of the product and $65 \%$ over the open vial period.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: The assigned values for each calibrator are provided on the vial.
