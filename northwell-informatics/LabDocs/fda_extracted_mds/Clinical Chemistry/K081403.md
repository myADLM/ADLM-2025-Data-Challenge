# II. Description of the new device

Glucose Meter-Check" Control Solution is a single-level, viscosity-adjusted, aqueous liquid glucose control solution. Glucose Meter-Check" Control Solution is intended for use to verify the performance of the Roche ACCU-CHEK brand BGM Systems listed in the package insert at glucose levels within the normal fasting blood glucose range for non-diabetic persons. This mid-level glucose concentration will complement the current, low and high glucose concentrations available in quality control products distributed by Roche Diagnostics for these same BGM systems. The product is packaged in plastic bottles with dropper tips for application of the solution to test strips. The control has a red color to help users see the solution while dispensing onto a test strip.

Glucose Meter-Check" Control Solution is a non-hazardous aqueous solution containing no human or animal-derived materials.

Dear Mr. Byrd:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
