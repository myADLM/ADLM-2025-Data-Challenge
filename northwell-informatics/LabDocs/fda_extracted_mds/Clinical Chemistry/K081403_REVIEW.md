\*Mid Assigned Range is mean of assigned ranges for each meter (Accu-Chek ACTIVE for Glucose Meter-Check and SMS Glucose Control)

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 15197 In-vitro diagnostic test systems – requirements for self-testing in managing diabetes ISO 14971 Medical Devices, Application of risk management to medical devices

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): A reference lot of material is used to establish the targeted glucose value on the YSI 2300. Value assignment for subsequent lots is compared to the reference lot and is acceptable if within a specified range of values. After verifying that the meters and test strips are recovering within target ranges on the Roche-branded control solutions appropriate for each meter type, multiple samples of the Glucose Meter-Check solution are analyzed on each of 2 meters on each of 3 lots of test strips. Value assignment range is determined as the mean value of all measurements $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the mean value.

Product stability has been established based on real time and accelerated studies on products with equivalent formulation matrixes and packaging. Samples are analyzed at predetermined intervals with failure defined by the sponsor as $\leq 9 5 \%$ recovery of the most labile analyte, glucose.

Close Bottle: In these evaluations, the change in glucose concentration over 24 months at 31 $\mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ is less than $5 \%$ . Ongoing real-time studies continue under refrigerated, room and elevated temperature conditions to establish final product stability and to ensure performance to within specified tolerances over labeled shelf life.

Open Bottle: This testing demonstrated less than $5 \%$ change in glucose over the 90 day evaluation period.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

An expected range for each glucose monitoring system is printed in the labeling. When using this control material, users are to compare their control results to the range printed in the labeling for the system being used rather than the range printed on the test strip.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
