# II. Description of the new device

RNA Medical Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone Calibration Verification Controls is a five-level, viscosity-adjusted, aqueous liquid glucose and $\beta$ -ketone control linearity set optimized for use with the Abbott Diabetes Care Precision Xceed Pro™ Blood Glucose and $\beta$ . Ketone Monitoring System using Precision Xceed Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips and Precision Xceed Pro Blood β-Ketone Test Strips. RNA Medical Glucose and β-Ketone Calibration Verification Controls provides a convenient method of performing periodic QC checks for laboratories selecting to measure liquid QC material as part of their quality assurance program.The product is packaged in plastic bottles with dropper tips for application of the solution to test strips. The control has a red color to help users see the solution while dispensing onto a test trip.

RNA Medical Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone Calibration Verification Controls contains glucose and ketone values at the lower and upper limits of reportable range as well as three points within the range and therefore, may be used to assess the linearity and calibration, or verify performance of the blood glucose and blood ketone systems listed on the package insert.

Re: k081478 Trade Name: RNA Medical Glucose and B-Ketone Calibration Verification Controls Regulation Number: 21 CFR $\ S 8 6 2 . 1 6 6 0$ EPY Regulation Name: Quality control material (assayed and unassayed) Regulatory Class: Class I, reserved Product Code: JJX Dated: September 10, 2008 Received: September 12, 2008

Dear Ms. Storro:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to preimarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
