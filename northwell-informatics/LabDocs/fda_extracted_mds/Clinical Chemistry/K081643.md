# 3. Identification of the Predicate Device

Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CTNI Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge, K063756   
Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CTNI Sample Diluent, K053577

# 4. Device Description

The Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ TNI Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge is an in vitro diagnostic device that consists of prepackaged reagents in a plastic eight-well cartridge for use on the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EXLTM with LM system.

The TNI method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay bascd on $\mathrm { L O C I } \ @$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I ( \mathfrak { R } ) }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bcad reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photoscnsitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylatcd antibody to form bead-cardiac troponin I-biotinylated antibody sandwiches.

Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Scnsibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 { \mathrm { n m } }$ and is a dircct function of the cardiac troponin I concentration in the sample.

The CTN1 Sample Diluent is a liquid, human serum based product with prescrvatives.

# 5. Device Intended Use

The TNI method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of cardiac troponin I in human serum and plasma on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EXLTM integrated chemistry system with $\operatorname { L O C I } ( { \bar { \mathbb { R } } } )$ module. Measurements of cardiac troponin I are used as an aid in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and in the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes with respect to their relative risk of mortality.

The CTNI Sample Diluent is an in vitro diagnostic product for manual dilution of samples with elcvated cardiac troponin I results processed on the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Dimension $^ { \textregistered }$ EXLTM integrated chemistry system with $\mathbf { L O C I } { \mathfrak { R } }$ module.

# 6. Summary of the devices technological characteristics

The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TNI Flex $\textcircled{8}$ reagent cartridge has the same technological characteristics as the predicate devicc. A comparison of features is provided.

# 7. Method Comparison to the predicate

A split sample method comparison study was conducted on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TNI Flex vs. the Dimension $\langle { \widehat { \mathbb { R } } } \rangle$ Vista CTNI Flex $( \widehat { \mathbb { R } } )$ reagent cartridge using two hundred-and-twenty nine (229) serum and plasma samples. The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The resulting regression statistics are shown below.

# 8. Conclusion

Based on a review of the devices technological features and the method comparison study, the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TNI Flex $^ { © }$ reagent cartridge is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed device, the Dimcnsion Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CTNI Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge.

Dear Ms. Lewis:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
