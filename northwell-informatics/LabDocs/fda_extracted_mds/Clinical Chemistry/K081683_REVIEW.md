b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and Value Assignment:

Traceability and value assignment for LOCI Troponin I calibrators involves preparation of anchor pools and master pools. The master pools are used to assign individual calibrator lots.

The anchor pools are a 6-level set of primary reference calibrators. They are prepared from native human sera and are assigned values using the Siemens Stratus CS analyzer. The master pools are prepared from a normal human serum pool spiked with human troponin complex to the appropriate concentrations. Values for the Master Pool are derived by multiple analyses against the Anchor Pool calibration curve. Each lot of the $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ Cardiac Troponin I Calibrator is prepared the same manner as the master pool and the value assignment is established by measurement against the Master Pool calibration.

Stability: The shelf-life and open-vial stability of the LOCI Cardiac Troponin I Calibrator have been demonstrated using real time data collected from 3 lots of calibrators. The predetermined acceptance criteria and protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

For the LOCI Cardiac Troponin I Calibrator, the sponsor claims a shelf life of 12 months when unopened and stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once thawed and opened, the calibrator is stable for 24 hours when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
