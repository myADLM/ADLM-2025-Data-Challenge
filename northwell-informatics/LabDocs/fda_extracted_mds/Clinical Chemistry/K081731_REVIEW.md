# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI/NCCLS EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; CLSI EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; CLSI EP6-A Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement; CLSI EP9-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; CLSI C28-A2, How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory

# L. Test Principle:

Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (CKI) Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reagent Cartridge

In a coupled enzyme reaction, the creatine kinase in patient samples catalyzes the transphosphorylation of phosphate from creatine phosphate to adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) producing adenosine-triphosphate (ATP). Hexokinase (HK) uses ATP to phosphorylate glucose. The resulting glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized by glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) with the simultaneous reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The rate of formation of NADPH is directly proportional to the CK activity in the sample and is measured bichromatically at 340 and $5 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (MBI) Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reagent Cartridge

The activity of the CK-MM isoenzyme is inhibited by an antibody specific for the CK-M subunit. The activity of the B subunit of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme is not inhibited, and it is on this basis that CK-MB can be measured.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To determine imprecision of the CKI Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge, CLSI EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices, was followed. During each day of testing, two separate runs, with two test samples, for each test material, were analyzed for 20 days on the Dimension RxL analyzer $\mathrm { ~  ~ \omega ~ } _ { \mathrm { n } } = 8 0$ for each sample).

For the CKI Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge, the results are shown in the table below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor conducted a linearity study based on CLSI EP6-A Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement. For both the CKI and MBI assays, a high pool sample was serially diluted with a low pool sample to cover the sponsor’s claimed measuring range $\mathrm { 7 - 1 0 0 0 U / L }$ for CKI and $3 – 1 2 5 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ for MBI). Theoretical concentrations were computed for all intermediate pools based on the initial concentrations of the high and low pools. Five replicate tests were run on the Dimension RxL analyzer for each level, using a

randomized testing order. Mean concentration was computed for each level. Recoveries ranged from 99 to $101 \%$ for CKI and from 99 to $102 \%$ for MBI. The linear regression equation was $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 4 + 1 . 0 0 9 \mathrm { x }$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 9 7$ for CKI and $\mathrm { y } = - \ 0 . 9 9 9 0 6 + 1 . 0 1 3 7 \mathrm { x }$ , $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 9 2$ for MBI.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and value assignment involves preparation of anchor pools and master pools. The anchor pool is prepared from pooled normal and high human serum and is assigned by the IFCC Reference Method. Three levels of CK master pools are manufactured by adding the appropriate volume of CK stock, with a known concentration into an aqueous human serum albumin calibrator base. Level 1 of the CK master pool, containing no analyte is assigned zero U/L. Levels 2 and 3 of the CK master pool are assigned by the IFCC reference method and verified against the anchor pools using multiple Dimension instruments and replicates.

Five levels of CKMB master pools are manufactured by adding the appropriate volume of CKMB stock, with a known concentration, into an aqueous human serum albumin matrix. Level 1 contains no analyte and is assigned zero U/L. Levels 2 - 5 of the CK master pool are assigned by the IFCC reference method and verified against the anchor pools using multiple Dimension instruments and replicates. The final bottle values for commercial lots are assigned to levels 2 and 3 of the of Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CKI/MBI Calibrator, using CKMB IFCC master pools. The final bottle values for each level of commercial lots are assigned against the master pools using multiple instruments and reagent lots.

Stability: The shelf life and open stability of the CKI.MBI calibrator have been demonstrated using real time data. The predetermined acceptance criteria and protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The CKI/MBI calibrator has a target shelf life of 12 months when stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The calibrator must be thawed at room temperature before use. Once the cap is removed, the assigned values are stable for 14 days when recapped immediately and stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

CLSI/NCCLS EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation, was referenced by the sponsor.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) calculation was performed with ${ \mathrm { N } } { = } 3$ replicates per sample on each of 3 days on the Dimension RxL analyzer. Two reagent lots, 2 instrument systems, 4 blank samples and 4 low analyte serum samples were tested. This gave 36 measurements for each of 8 samples, 144 each total blank and low analyte sample measurements. For the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CKI Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$

reagent cartridge, the Limit of Blank was estimated to be $5 \mathrm { U / L }$ . For the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ MBI Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge, the Limit of Blank was estimated to be $1 \mathrm { U / L }$ .

CLSI EP17-A was followed to determine the Limit of Detection, with proportions of false positives (α) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 288 determinations, with 144 blank and 144 low level samples. LOD is the lowest concentration that can be detected reliably.

The calculation of the Limit of Detection was performed by the following formula:

$$
\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + ( \mathrm { c p } ) \mathrm { x ( s d ) }
$$

CKI: $5 \mathrm { { U / L } + ( 1 . 6 4 6 ) \times ( 1 . 3 ) = 7 \mathrm { { U / L } } }$

$$
1 \mathrm { { U / L } + ( 1 . 6 4 6 ) \times ( 1 . 2 ) = 3 \mathrm { { U / L } } }
$$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Testing was performed using the paired difference approach described in the guideline document, CLSI EP7-A2. Potential interferents were spiked into aliquots of a fresh sample pool and analyzed as patient samples. Spiked sample results were compared to control samples prepared without the potential interferent.
