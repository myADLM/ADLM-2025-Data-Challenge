# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and value assignment involves preparation of anchor pools and master pools. The anchor pool is prepared from pooled normal and high human serum and is assigned by the IFCC Reference Method. LD enzyme is weighed into BSA based matrix to make (LDI )stock solution. Three levels of LDI master pools are manufactured by adding the appropriate volume of LDI stock, with a known concentration into an aqueous BSA base material. Level 1 of the LDI master pool, containing no analyte is assigned zero U/L. Levels 2 and 3 of the LDI master pool are assigned by the IFCC reference method and verified against the anchor pools using multiple Dimension instruments

Stability: ENZ I CAL is supplied as a ready to use liquid. Target shelf life for the ENZ I CAL is 12 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The shelf life and open stability of the calibrator have been demonstrated using real time data. Shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the control material stored at ${ } ^ { - 2 0 } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Recovery vs. time is monitored and percent change over time is determined with allowable drift (control vs. test): Level 2 and $3 \colon \leq 5 \%$ . Once the cap is removed, the assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately and stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Not applicable
