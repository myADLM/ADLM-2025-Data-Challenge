# 5. $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { S 1 0 } } ( \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } } )$ Summary Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Information Supporting a Substantially Equivalent Determination

Device description

The Gentian cystatin C Immunoassay is a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA). The immunoparticles are made from activated polystyrene microspheres to which avian anti-human cystatin C antibodies are covalently attached. The immunoparticles and cystatin C form aggregations that change the absorbance signal, depending on the amount of cystatin C present. Measurements obtained by this device are used for the determination of Cystatin C in human serum and plasma. The Gentian cystatin C assay is calibrated with human Cystatin C calibrators. Cystatin C controls are assayed for the verification of the accuracy and precision of the Gentian cystatin C immunoassay.

# Substantial Equivalence

The Gentian Cystatin C Immunoassay for the Beckman Coulter™ Synchron® and UniCel® Systems is substantially equivalent to the Gentian Cystatin C Immunoassay on the Abbott Architect® c8000 instrument (K071388), with respect to indications for use, device design and material. The difference between the Synchron and UniCel applications and the FDA cleared Architect application is a minor difference in the instruments' methods in curve fit for calibration curve establishment. In the Architect a spline method is used while in Synchron and UniCel a math model 8 is used (described in instrument manual). The Gentian assay is a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA), and can be used on all commercially available automated clinical chemistry analyzers using a light absorption detection system. The Gentian device uses avian antibodies and it is known by one skilled in the art that there is no interaction between Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and avian antibodies.

# Comparison to predicate device

The substantial equivalence, safety and efficacy of the Gentian cystatin C Immunoassay on Architect versus Synchron and UniCel was evaluated in a comparison study between the Architect and Synchron instruments. The aim was to demonstrate substantial equivalence between the instrument applications of the Gentian Cystatin C Immunoassay. A summary of the method comparison regression analyses results are shown in table 1.

The agreement between the Beckman Coulter's Synchron and UniCel Systems was further evaluated by an instrument variation study between the two applications. A summary of the method comparison regression and bias analyses results are shown in table 2.

# Performance characteristics

The measuring range is 0.4-8.0 mg/L. The reference range is 0.62-1.15 mg/L. Linearity is absolute over the whole assay range. Total imprecision CV, measured over 3 days for Synchron is in the range 2.2 - 5.4 %, and measured over 5 days for UniCel is in the range 2.9 - 5.8 %. Interference studies show no significant interference, from hemoglobin (400 mg/dL), intralipid (1200 mg/dL), triclycerides (15 mmol/mL) and bilirubin (20 mg/dL). Due to the use of avian antibodies, no interference with rheumatoid factor is detected. No carry-over is detected. The limit of detection (LoD) is below 0.35 mg/L and the limit of quantification (LoQ) (within CV 7%) are below 0.47 mg/L for both Synchron and UniCel applications, which is below the lowest calibrator concentration. Sample stability is up to one month at 2-8°C. Stability of the reagents at 2-8°C is calculated to be at least 24 months. Stability of the reagents in use is minimum 4 weeks. Recovery is 94-107 %. It is estimated that there is no Antigen hook effect in cystatin C samples below 25 mg/L, in addition the Synchron and UniCel instruments are programmed to not report any results above the highest calibrator. The sample matrix equivalence study showed that serum and EDTA/LiHeparin plasma give identical cystatin C results. Method comparison to another commercially available Cystatin C method showed a very good aqreement.

# Conclusion

When considering the comparison study between the Gentian Cystatin C Immunoassay on Architect and Synchron, and the instrument variation study between Synchron and UniCel, and the additional documentation supporting the Gentian Cystatin C Immunoassay on Synchron and UniCel Systems, it can be concluded that the Gentian Cystatin C Immunoassay when measured on the Beckman Coulter™ Synchron® and UniCel® Systems is as safe and effective as, and substantially equivalent to the Gentian Cystatin C Immunoassay when measured on the FDA cleared Abbott Architect c8000 analyzer.
