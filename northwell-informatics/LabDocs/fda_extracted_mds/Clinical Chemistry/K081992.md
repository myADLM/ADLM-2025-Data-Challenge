# 4. Device Description

The Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CSAE Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge is a pre-packaged in-vitro diagnostic test method (assay) that is specifically designed to be used on the Dimension Vista $\mathfrak { Q }$ Integrated system, a floor model, fully automated microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument system. The Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system was previously cleared with seven associated test methods (K05 1087). This Special $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ is submitted for a packaging modification to the Dimension® Cyclosporine Extended Range (CSAE) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge (K052017), an in-vitro diagnostic device that has been cleared under the $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ process for use on Dimension $\textcircled{1}$ clinical chemistry systems. The packaging change is to allow use on the Dimension Vista $\mathfrak { W }$ system. The modifications also include a change in method parameters (sample size and reagent volume) but the final concentration of sample/reagent ratio in test milieu remains the same.

The reagents contained in the Dimension Vista® CSAE Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Dimension $\mathfrak { P }$ CSAE Flex $\mathfrak { B }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Siemens analyzers. The packaging modification does not affect the intended use of the devices, nor does it alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device.

The CSAE method uses an immunoassay technique in which free and CSA bound antibody-cnzyme species are separated using magnetic particles. The CSAE Flex $\mathfrak { B }$ E reagent cartridge contains a pretreatment reagent, B-galactosidase-CSA antibody conjugate, CSA immobilized on chromium dioxide particles, chlorophenol red B-dgalactopyranoside (CPRG) substrate, and diluent to hydrate the tablets. To perform the CSAE assay, a sample cup containing the whole blood sample to be analyzed and a CSAE Flex $\mathfrak { W }$ reagent cartridge are placed appropriately on the Dimension Vista® system. The Dimension Vista® system mixes and lyses the whole blood sample. The lysed sample is then mixed with the antibody conjugate reagent. The CSA present in the sample is bound by the CSA antibody conjugate reagent. Magnetic particles coated with cyclosporine A are added to bind free (unbound) antibody-enzyme conjugate. The reaction mixture is then separated magnetically. Following separation, the supernatant containing the CSA antibody-enzyme complex is transferred to a cuvette and mixed with the substrate. B-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of CPRG (chlorophenol red B-dgalactopyranoside) to produce CPR (chlorophenol red) that absorbs light maximally at $5 7 7 \mathrm { { 1 } } \mathrm { { 1 } } \mathrm { { \ m } }$ . The change in absorbance at 577nm due to the formation of CPR is directly proportional to the amount of CSA in the patient's sample and is measured using a bichromatic (577, 700nm) rate technique.

# 5. Device Intended Use

The CSAE method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of cyclosporine A (CSA) in human whole blood on the Dimension Vista $\mathfrak { B }$ system. Measurements of CSA are used as an aid in the management of heart, liver and kidney transplant patients.

# 6. Summary of the devices technological characteristics

The Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CSAE Flex is substantially equivalent to other cyclosporine test systems, such as the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CSAE Flex® reagent cartridge (K052017). A comparison of features is provided.

# 7. Method comparison to the predicate

A split sample method comparison study was conducted on the Dimension Vista® CSAE Flex vs. the Dimension $\mathfrak { B }$ CSAE Flex using one hundred and sixteen (1 16) transplant samples. The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression and produced the following regression statistics:

Slope 0.92 Intercept 37.9 ng/mL r 0.990 n 116

# 8. Conclusion

The proposed Dimension Vista® CSAE method is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed device, the Dimension $\mathfrak { B }$ CSAE method in design, principle, and performance. They have the same intended use and indications for use. Comparative testing also demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.

Dear Ms. Lewis:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490.
