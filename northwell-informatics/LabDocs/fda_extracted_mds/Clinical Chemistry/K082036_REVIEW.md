K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: there are no claims made for traceability.

Stability:

An accelerated stability study suggested that lyophilized (unreconstituted) vials stored under recommended conditions were stable for 3 years. Real time stability studies demonstrated that lyophilized vials were stable for a minimum of 12 months.

Reconstituted vial stability stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ : All analytes are stable for 14 days with the following exceptions:

Carcinoembyonic Antigen (CEA) is stable for 11 days

Free and Total PSA is stable for 7 days.   
Thyroglobulin (Tg) is stable for 5 days.   
ACTH and calcitonin should be assayed immediately.

Reconstituted vials stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ to $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ are stable for 30 days with the following exceptions: there are no stability claims at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ to $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for ACTH and calcitonin.

Expected values:

Value assignments for each lot are performed by independent manufacturers and laboratories using FDA-exempt, cleared, or approved tests. Mean values for the three levels are derived from repeated analysis of each analyte. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own values and acceptable range. Values and ranges are lot specific.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable. b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable. c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.   
5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
