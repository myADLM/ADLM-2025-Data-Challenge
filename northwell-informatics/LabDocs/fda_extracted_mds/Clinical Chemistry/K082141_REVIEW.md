# Controls:

The controls contain human C-peptide (synthetic) in PBS buffer with heat inactivated horse serum and stabilizers. Preservatives used are ProClin 300 and ProClin 950. Each ARCHITECT C-Peptide Control kit contains 3 bottles of Controls $\mathrm { 8 . 0 \ m L }$ fill volume per bottle) with the following concentrations:

Control Low – 1 ng/mL, Control Medium – $4 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Control $\mathrm { H i g h } - 1 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

OIVD: Guidance for Industry - Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators; Final

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

Calibrators and controls are traceable to the WHO standard NIBSC code 84/510. The WHO standards are gravimetrically diluted to the target concentrations defined for the calibrators and controls to create reference materials. The reference materials are then used to standardize the consumer product.

Stability:

Freeze-thaw, open vial, and transport simulation studies were performed on the products. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria for these studies were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The ARCHITECT C-Peptide Calibrators and Controls are stable for 6 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Value Assignment:

Values for the calibrators and controls are listed in section I. Calibrators and controls are verified using Relative Light Unit (RLU) comparison between target material and test material using the ARCHITECT $i$ System. The consumer products are referenced to a secondary standard which is in turn referenced to the WHO standard mentioned above. Adjustments are performed if necessary so that the values of new calibrators are within the sponsor’s manufacturing criteria when compared to the reference.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable
