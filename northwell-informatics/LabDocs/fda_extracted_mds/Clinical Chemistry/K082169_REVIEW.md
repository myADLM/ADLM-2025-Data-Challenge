# L. Test Principle:

A glucose dehydrogenase sensor based on the carbon electrode adopting the amperometric assay is provided. The reaction utilizes the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are produced. Through the mechanism of the mediator, electrical current is generated and it is proportional to the quantity of glucose in the sample.

The reaction principle of reagent depends on following reaction equation:

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision studies were performed using ISO 15197 and CLSI Document EP5- A as guidelines. Three lots of test strips were tested with 10 TaiDoc glucose meters (TD-4230 model).

Within-day precision (repeatability) was performed by using venous whole blood which was spiked with dextrose to provide samples at five different glucose concentrations $( 3 0 - 5 0 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , $5 1 - 1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } .$ , $1 1 1 - 1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 5 1 - 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 5 1 - 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Blood samples were tested within 30 minutes and hematocrit was normal $( 3 8 - 5 4 \% )$ . 500 measurements were taken for this portion of the study (100 measurements of each sample).

For day-to-day precision (intermediate precision), three control solutions with concentrations of low, normal and high with target levels of $3 2 { \cdot } 5 2 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , 69- $9 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $1 9 6 { - } 2 6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were used to ensure no glycolysis effect. Dayto-day precision was performed over 10 days. 300 measurements were taken for this portion of the study (30 measurements per day; 10 measurements per control sample).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The claimed measuring range for this device is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . Nine spiked whole blood samples with different glucose concentration levels in the claimed range were tested:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucoseconcentration(mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>120</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>200</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>320</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>420</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>600</td></tr></table>

A YSI-2300 Analyzer was used to verify the glucose concentration of the samples, and then the samples were measured by two lots of TaiDoc Pro I Glucose Test Strips on a TD-4230 meter.

The samples were prepared and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used to perform on the TaiDoc Pro I Glucose Test Strips and the second aliquot was analyzed on the reference method. For each level solution, 10 consecutive tests (with 5 measurements per lot) were performed on each meter.

Linear regression statistics:   
range $= 2 2 . 4 - 5 8 7 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (as measured by the reference method)   
$\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 8 3 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 6 4$   
$\mathrm { ~  ~ \dot { ~ } { ~ R ~ } ~ } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 6$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibration: calibration of the test strip is done by entering measurement parameters into the meter before testing, which can be done by users either by inserting the code strip into the meter before testing or by selecting the code number from the meter before testing.

# Stability:

Storage Stability Study: The storage claims for this device are: 90 days for open vial of strips stored at $2 - 3 2 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } }$ and 24 months for unopened vials of strips stored at $2 \cdot 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . For the unopened vial stability claim, accelerated testing of the strips was performed. Currently, there is 18 months of real-time stability testing for unopened vials at the appropriate storage temperature. The study protocols, summary of results and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor has not conducted studies to determine the limit of detection (LOD), however, as supported by linearity studies, the sponsor has established the measuring range of $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the Pro I Glucose Test Strips.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Hematocrit: The potential effect of hematocrit was evaluated at $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $60 \%$ hematocrit levels. Testing was performed with spiked venous whole blood samples from normal, healthy donors. Samples with seven different glucose concentrations spaced across the claimed measuring range $( 2 0 - 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ at the different hematocrit levels were measured by using YSI 2300 as a reference method and by using TaiDoc Pro I Glucose Test Strips.

The data supports the sponsor’s claim that results generated by their device are comparable to the values of the YSI-2300 instrument at hematocrit levels between $20 - 6 0 \%$ .

Interference Study: Interference testing was conducted to determine the effect of selected endogenous and exogenous substances. Ascorbic acid, acetaminophen, dopamine, uric acid, bilirubin, triglyceride, fructose, galactose and maltose were tested as potential interferents.

Testing was performed in parallel (control versus test samples) and simultaneously to minimize the effects of glucose metabolism. The sponsor used seven blood samples and evaluated two glucose levels. Three to four levels of each compound were evaluated.

Paired differences of glucose measurements between drug-spiked samples and neat control samples were calculated to determine the bias. A criterion of $\pm$ $10 \%$ was used as the cutoff for interference. There is no interference observed in all interfering substances at therapeutic or physiological levels either at low or high glucose levels.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reference range(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration showingno interference(mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acetaminophen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1-2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ascorbic acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.8-1.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Dopamine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.4-1.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.25</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Uric acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td></tr></table>

Interference was seen for the following compounds at concentrations above the therapeutic range for the following: acetaminophen $( 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , dopamine $( 6 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , bilirubin $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and uric acid $( 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .

No interference was detected when triglyceride, fructose, galactose and maltose were tested.

Temperature/humidity study: A temperature and humidity study was performed to determine the effects of variation in temperature and humidity on the response of Pro I Glucose test strips with control solutions. Testing was conducted using 250 strips and ten glucose meters at three temperatures (10, 25 and $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and two levels of humidity (50 and $60 \%$ RH). 60 measurements for each test condition were obtained. Precision and accuracy was calculated for each test condition and found to be acceptable.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

# Comparison to a reference method (YSI-2300):

Testing was done comparing Pro I Glucose strips (using 5 TaiDoc meters: TD-4222, TD-4230, TD-4231, TD-3250, and TD-3260) against YSI-2300 at three different sites. 120 subjects, including both men and women of varied ages, were tested by professionals. Samples from 24 to $5 1 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were included. Each fresh capillary whole blood sample used was from a different individual, except for samples with concentrations less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and greater than $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For those specimens, a pooled capillary whole blood specimen spiked to the desired level was used. Three lots of strips were tested. The correlation data (regression analysis) is summarized as below:

$100 \%$ of the samples tested with the proposed device had measurements fall within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of the measurements obtained with the YSI-2300 for glucose concentrations less than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

$9 8 \%$ of the samples tested with the proposed device had measurements fall within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of measurements made with the YSI-2300 for glucose concentrations equal to or greater than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# Comparison to a predicate device:

A 510(k) cleared device, k040796, was used as the comparative method. This device comes from the same manufacturer. YSI-2300 analyzer is used as the reference method to check the accuracy of both test method and comparative method. The evaluation was done at 3 sites with 120 samples over 3 weeks with three different lots of strips and 5 different models of TaiDoc meters. Samples ranged from $2 4 - 5 1 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Fresh capillary whole blood from finger stick was used for samples $4 0 - 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For those specimens less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and greater than $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , a pooled capillary whole blood specimen was used and spiked to the desired level.
