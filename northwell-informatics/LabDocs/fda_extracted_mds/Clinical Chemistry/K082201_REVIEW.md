# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None referenced

# L. Test Principle:

Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor evaluated within-run precision of the device using whole blood collected in an EDTA collection tube. The blood was then spiked with glucose to create five different levels for testing. Each level was tested 50 times using a single lot of test strips and a single device lot. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average glucoseconcentration (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>87.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>129.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>217.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>367.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV (%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8</td></tr></table>

The sponsor evaluated day-to-day precision of the device using 3 levels of control solution. Each of the controls was measured twice a day, once in the morning (Run 1) and once in the afternoon (Run 2) during a month’s time. For each Run, two measurement readings were taken in which the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient variation percent $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ were calculated. The same test strip lot and device lot were used for the evaluation. In addition, the same lot of the 3 control solutions (low, normal, high) was used. Results are summarized below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average glucose concentration(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>109.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>302.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV (%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4</td></tr></table>

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To establish the linearity of the system through the range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 14 glucose adjusted whole blood samples (actual range tested was 20 to $6 0 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ according to YSI and 20.8 to $6 0 2 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when tested with the meters) were compared to YSI 2300 using 5 replicate measurements. Linear regression yields the following statistics:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r2}$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>G5 Infinity BGMS</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0006</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.3031</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9999</td></tr></table>

The sponsor claims $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The reference instrument used is the YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer and is calibrated by YSI 2747 Glucose Standard, a NIST traceable glucose standard.

The three control solutions (low, normal, and high) consist of buffered aqueous solutions of D $( + )$ -glucose containing stabilizers, preservatives, and other nonreactive ingredients.

Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution: The measured glucose levels of 3 lots of control solutions during the shelf lifetime period (26 months) are all within the acceptance criteria of $\pm 1 5 \%$ , and the average bias with respect to the mean value throughout the lifetime is less than $\pm 4 \%$ .

Opened Vial Stability of Control Solution: The measured glucose levels of 3 lots of control solutions during the use lifetime period (3 months) are all within the specified ranges $\mathrm { \zeta 5 0 \pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ for low level, $1 1 0 \pm 1 6 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for normal level, $3 0 0 \pm 4 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for high level solutions), and the average bias with respect to the mean value throughout the lifetime is less than $\pm 0 . 7 \%$ .

The expected values of the glucose control solutions were established by testing the solutions 5 times with YSI 2300. If the solutions are within the acceptance criteria, the solutions are then tested 5 times on the Nova Biomedical Stat Profile M.

Solutions that pass these two QC checks are then tested 100 times on the candidate device, and the reported range of the control solutions are based on the average of these 100 tests.

d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the system is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (above section M.1.b.).

e. Analytical specificity:

Spiked whole blood samples containing 3 levels of glucose (low glucose at ${ < } 6 0$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , normal glucose at $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and high glucose at ${ > } 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), with and without interfering substances, were prepared to test common endogenous and exogenous substances for interference. Each interferent was tested at five different levels, in accordance with CLSI EP7-P. The highest levels tested for which no interference was observed are summarized below:

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Interferent</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Acetaminophen</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Bilirubin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Gentistic Acid</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Uric Acid</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Levo-Dopa</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Creatinine</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Methyl-Dopa</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Tolazamide</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Dopamine</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ascorbate</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">EDTA</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">640</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Glutathione</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Heparin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ibuprofen</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Salicylic Acid</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Tetracycline</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Tolbutamide</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Urea</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">500</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Cholesterol</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">500</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Triglycerides</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Galactose</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Xylose</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Maltose</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">300</td></tr></table>

The acceptance criteria were as follows:

At $< 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ samples, interferences $\mathrm { o v e r } \pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $\mathrm { A t } \geq 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ samples, interferences over $\pm 1 5 \%$

Interference testing showed that the candidate device results were within the acceptance criteria at the above interferent concentrations. The sponsor states that acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic acid, and other reducing substances do not significantly affect results when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic concentrations. However, an abnormally high concentration may cause inaccurately high results. The sponsor also states that lipemic samples, with cholesterol up to 500 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ or triglycerides up to $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ do not significantly affect results.

An altitude study was performed in an altitude simulation chamber with capillary whole blood from volunteers which was then spiked to 3 levels (52, 153, and 352 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ). The simulation chamber was set to 10,000 feet. The test data using capillary blood samples using both meters showed that the bias versus YSI at 10,000 feet is the same bias versus YSI as that observed at sea level. These data indicate no additional effect due to altitude up to 10,000 feet.

To test the accuracy of the hematocrit effect, blood samples adjusted to hematocrit levels of $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $50 \%$ and $60 \%$ at glucose concentrations of 40, 70, 110, 160, 260, 350, 450, and $5 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested a total of 15 times at each concentration. The acceptance criteria were as follows:

At $\mathrm { \Omega } ^ { \cdot } < 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ sample, all data should be within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ difference and that over $90 \%$ of data within $\pm 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ difference (Test hematocrit range $20 \small \sim 6 0 \%$ )

$\mathrm { A t } \geq 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ sample, all data should be within $\pm 1 5 \%$ error and that over $90 \%$ of data within $\pm 1 0 \%$ error (Test hematocrit range $20 \small \sim 6 0 \%$ )

\*Difference $\mathrm { ( m g / d L ) }$ : assay value-average value of $40 \%$ Hct sample (at $< 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$

\* Error $( \% )$ : (assay value-average value of $40 \%$ Hct sample)/average value of $40 \%$ Hct sample $\textbf { \em x } 1 0 0$ (a $\mathrm { t } \geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the candidate device, trained specialists tested the capillary blood samples from the finger of 160 patients (with samples ranging from 38 to $4 9 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and compared the results to the results from a laboratory reference method (Hitachi 747) using samples taken at the same time. \*Samples with blood glucose levels below $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were obtained by glycolysis of patient samples, and samples above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were supplemented with glucose. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>System accuracy results for glucose concentration &lt;75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within ± 5mg/dL(within ± 0.28 mmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within ± 10 mg/dL(within ± 0.56 mmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within ± 15mg/dL(within ± 0.83 mmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>43/56 (77 %)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>56/56 (100%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>56/56 (100%)</td></tr></table>

The linear regression was $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 7 7 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 4 7 2 9 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 3 2$

Lay-user studies were also performed involving 150 individuals fluent in English at 3 clinical sites (50 users per site). Each participant was given a readability questionnaire and draft labeling and instructions for the US market. No other instruction was given. The participants performed their own fingersticks using the G5 Infinity system. These results were then compared to fingerstick results obtained by health care professionals within 5 minutes of the lay user test, also using the G5 Infinity. The acceptance criteria were as follows:

$9 5 \%$ of the individual glucose results shall fall within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of the results of the manufacturer's measurement procedure at glucose concentration ${ < } 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $20 \%$ at glucose concentration $( \geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .

The results are as follows:

The linear regression was $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 3 4 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 9 5 5 , ~ \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 4 9$

To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the candidate device using alternate sites, a study was performed with lay users who read the user manual on their own, without additional instruction on use of the device by technicians. Samples were taken by the lay users from the fingertip, palm, upper arm, forearm, thigh, and calf and were compared to the users fingerstick result. Samples ranged from 64 - 482 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Results are summarized below for samples $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ being within $\pm 1 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the G5 infinity fingerstick:
