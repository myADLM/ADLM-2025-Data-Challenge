# 2. Date Prepared

# 3. Device Name

May, 2008

Propriety name : GlucoDrT Plus System   
Common name : Blood glucose monitoring system   
Classification name : Glucose Test System Class II (21 CFR Scction 862.1345, Product Code : LFR, NBW) Quality control material Class I (21 CFR Section 862.1660, Product Code : JJX)

4. Predicate Device

We claim substantial equivalence to the Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Accu-Chek Aviva System. (K043474)

5. Device Description

The GlucoDr™ Plus system consists of GlucoDr™ Plus Test Meter, GlucoDrTM Plus Test strips and GlucoDr™M Plus control solution.

The GlucoDr™M Plus system is based on measuremcnt of electrical currents caused by the reaction of glucose with rcagents on the gold electrode strip. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose dehydrogenase and mediators. This reaction creates electrical currents. Thc subsequent electrical currents are proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood and converted to the equivalent glucose concentration by the algorithm programmed in the GlucoDr™ Plus test meter.

# 6. Intended use

The GlucoDr™M Plus system is intended for in vitro diagnostic use (i.e., for external use only) for quantitative measurement of glucose in venous whole blood and capillary whole blood. Testing sites include traditional fingertip site along with palm, arm and thigh.

The GlucoDr™M Plus system may be used by healthcare professionals or for self testing by diabetic lay users with diabetes mellitus at home as aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program.

The GlucoDr™M Plus system is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, nor intcnded for use on neonates.

The GlucoDrTM Plus control solution is for use with the The GlucoDr™ Plus meters and strips as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

# 7. Comparison to Predicate Device

The GlucoDr™M Plus system has equivalcnt technological characteristics as the Accu-Chek Aviva System. The GlucoDrTM Plus system also has the same intended uise as the Accu-Chek Aviva System.

# 8. Conclusion

The GlucoDr™ Plus system is substantially equivalent to the predicate device system.

Dear Ms. Kim:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbb { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore,market the device,subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general informatiòn on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
