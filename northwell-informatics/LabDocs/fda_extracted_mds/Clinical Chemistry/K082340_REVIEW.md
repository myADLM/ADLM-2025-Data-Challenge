# L. Test Principle:

Serum samples:

First, the serum sample is incubated with the folate pretreatment reagents to release bound folate from endogenous folate binding proteins. Then, the pretreated sample is incubated with the ruthenium labeled folate binding protein and a folate complex is formed, the amount of which is dependent upon the analyte concentration in the sample. Next, streptavidin-coated microparticles and folate labeled with biotin are added and the unbound sites of the ruthenium labeled folate binding protein become occupied, with formation of a ruthenium labeled folate binding protein-folate biotin complex. The entire complex is bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is then aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are washed away and application of a voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve.

Whole blood samples:

Whole blood treated with anticoagulants (heparin or EDTA) is diluted with ascorbic acid solution and incubated. Lysis of the erythrocytes takes place releasing the intracellular folate. The hemolysate is then used as a “pre-diluted” sample (analogously to serum) for subsequent measurement in the Elecsys Folate III assay. The hematocrit value determined in whole blood and the dilution effect brought about by pretreatment of the sample is to be taken into account when calculating the erythrocyte folate concentration.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the Elecsys Folate III was evaluated on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay analyzer. Serum linearity was determined by diluting three high analyte level serum patient samples. Samples 1 & 2 were diluted with Elecsys Universal Diluent and Sample 3 was diluted with low analyte level serum. Mixtures of 10 different concentrations of folate were tested. The expected values were generated using the concentrations measured in the diluted and the undiluted patient sample and then applying the dilution factors. The percent recovery was determined by dividing the measured concentration with the expected concentration. The sample concentrations tested ranged from $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $1 . 1 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . All of the results were within $\leq$ $0 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for results $\leq 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $\leq 1 5 \%$ for results greater than $5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The results demonstrated that the assay was linear across the claimed measuring range of 1.5 to $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

RBC linearity was determined by diluting one high level RBC hemolysate sample to concentrations evenly spaced across the measuring range. Eleven concentrations across the measuring range were tested. The linearity data were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials. In a first step, a linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic). The result has shown that higher orders are not significant. The sample concentrations tested ranged from $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $6 5 3 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . All of the results were within the sponsors acceptance criteria and demonstrated that the assay was linear across the claimed measuring range of 46.5 to $6 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The analyzer calculates this value by automatically correcting for the 1:31 pre-dilution that occurs during the hemolysis step.

This assay has a measuring range of $1 . 5 \mathrm { - } 2 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ for serum folate and 46.5- $6 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ for RBC folate.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The CalSet, CalCheck and the PreciControl Anemia products are assayed and compared to Roche master calibrators, which are traceable to an in-house standard, and target values and ranges are assigned. Values are assigned using multiple Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2010/ cobas $\mathrm { e } @$ 411 analyzers. Several runs are performed on each analyzer platform with duplicate determinations for each sample. The target value is then calculated as the median of the determined values.

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The CalSet, CalCheck, and PreciControl Anemia are stable until the expiration date printed on the vial when stored unopened at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Reconstituted CalSet vials are stable for 5 hours at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and 3 months at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Reconstituted CalCheck vials are stable for 4 hours at 20 - $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . PreciControl Anemia vials are stable for 8 hours at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 5 hours on the analyzers at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { \ i } }$ , 3 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and 3 months at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LOB) and Limit of Detection (LOD) were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A requirements. One human serum sample pool, free of analyte, was used in the LOB experiment. Five low-level human serum samples were used in the LOD experiment. Analyte levels were determined by testing on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay analyzer. Each of these samples was evaluated $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = 6 0 }$ on multiple runs over 3 days on multiple analyzers and reagent lots. The Limit of Blank was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples. In this case, after a top-down ranking of the 60 measured concentrations, the mean of the concentrations at position $\# 5 7$ and $\# 5 8 = \mathrm { L o B } = ( 0 . 6 3 2 + 0 . 6 3 4 ) / 2 = 0 . 6 3 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The LoB claim in the package insert is $0 . 6 4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The LOD was calculated as LOD $= \mathrm { L O B } + 1 . 6 5 2 9 \times \mathrm { S }$ D total $= 0 . 6 3 3 + 1 . 6 5 2 9 \times 0 . 2 8 2 7 = 1 . 1 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . In the labeling, Roche claims an LoD of $\leq 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

For calculating the limit of quantitation (LOQ), two human serum samples and three human serum sample pools (folate depleted) with concentrations ranging from 1.20 to $3 . 1 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were used to calculate the concentration which corresponds to an interassay coefficient of variation (CV) of $20 \%$ . The samples were tested once per day, for 10 days. The mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation for each sample were calculated. As a result, by linear interpolation, a concentration of approximately $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ generated a CV of $20 \%$ . The sponsor claims a functional sensitivity for the device of 2 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The lower end to the RBC measuring range is defined as $4 6 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ in the Package Insert. This concentration is derived from the serum/plasma Folate claimed LoD of $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (and dilution effect x31). Roche performed a functional sensitivity study. The study was performed using hemolysates on the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ $2 0 1 0 ~ /$ cobas $\mathrm { e } @$ 411 Immunoassay Analyzer. Eight hemolysates with concentrations ranging from 29.5 to $2 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were tested for 5 days, 2 runs per in singleton. The mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation for each sample were calculated. As a result, a concentration of $5 4 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ generated a CV of $1 5 . 8 \%$ . The claimed functional sensitivity of $2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for serum/plasma Folate III would correspond to a calculated value of $6 2 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for RBC Folate (based on the dilution effect x31).

This assay has a measuring range of $1 . 5 \mathrm { - } 2 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ for serum folate and 46.5-

$6 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ for rbc folate.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The effects of interference by Biotin, Lipemia, Bilirubin, Rheumatoid Factor, Human IgG and Human IgA on the quantitation of Folate by the Elecsys Folate III assay were determined on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay Analyzer. Human serum samples, spiked with varying levels of interferent, were divided into two aliquots after collection. One aliquot was spiked with the interferent while the other aliquot was spiked with the same volume diluent. The interferent spiked sample was then diluted into the unspiked aliquot in $10 \%$ increments. Percent recovery was calculated by comparing the measured folate concentration to the expected folate initial concentration. The sponsor defined significant interference as greater than $+ / .$ - $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , absolute deviation for samples $< / = 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and greater than $+ / .$ - $10 \%$ recovery for samples ${ > } 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The following results were obtained

The labeling states the following regarding hemoglobin interference: Hemolysis may significantly increase folate values due to high concentrations of folate in red blood cells. Therefore, hemolyzed serum samples are not suitable for use in this assay.

18 commonly used pharmaceuticals were examined for potential effect on folate determination by the Folate III test system. Each drug was added to folate serum samples in two defined concentrations and the resulting samples were tested in triplicate using the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay Analyzer. The median value was compared to the reference value (folate sample with no drug added) and the deviation from the reference value was calculated. The sponsor defined interference as $+ / - 3 \mathrm { S D }$ of the reference value or $+ / - 1 0 \%$ if the 3SD range $< + / - 1 0 \%$ . The results showed not significant interference at the concentrations below.

The sample donors tested had homocysteine concentrations ${ < } 1 5 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ , were between 18 and 65 years old, were apparently healthy and were fasting. Exclusion criteria were: pregnant and lactating women, body mass index ${ > } 3 0$ and subjects who take vitamins on the day of sample collection.

The data obtained in this reference interval study verifies data reported by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition data is provided in the labeling as an additional reference.

Elecsys RBC Folate Hemolyzing Reagent

The 262 Whole blood samples collected in this study were tested using the Elecsys RBC Folate Hemolyzing Reagent in combination with the Elecsys Folate III assay. As reported in the labeling, samples were tested on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay analyzer.

The reference interval for the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay analyzer for whole blood was $4 9 9 - 1 5 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (2.5th - 97.5th percentile) with a median value of $9 0 2 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The sample donors tested had homocysteine concentrations ${ < } 1 5 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ , were between 18 and 65 years old, were apparently healthy and were fasting. Exclusion criteria were: pregnant and lactating women, body mass index ${ > } 3 0$ and subjects who take vitamins on the day of sample collection.

For both studies, the Elecsys Folate III and the Elecsys RBC Folate, samples from the same 129 men and 133 women were tested.
