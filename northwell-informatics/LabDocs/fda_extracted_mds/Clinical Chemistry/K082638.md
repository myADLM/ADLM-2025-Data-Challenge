The ADVIA Centaur $\mathfrak { W }$ is a continuous operation, immunochemistry analyzer designed to perform in vitro diagnostic testing on clinical specimens.

The StreamLAB $\mathbf { \mathfrak { B } }$ Analytical Workcell is a laboratory automation system (LAS) designed to automate sample handling and processing in the clinical laboratory.

The ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ with StreamLAB $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Analytical Workcell combines the features of both the analyzer and the laboratory automation system.

The StreamLAB routes samples to the Centaur analyzer based on test request information it (StreamLAB) receives from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and the test map established for the Centaur analyzer. StreamLAB and Centaur communicate sample and analyzer status via Centaur's Laboratory Automation System (LAS) interface. Via its LIS interface, the Centaur analyzer interfaces separately with the hospital's LIS to receive its test instructions (test requests) and to report results for each sample. Centaur's test instructions and test results for each sample are not processed through the StreamLAB.

The StreamLAB performs the following pre and post-analytical functions.

• Sample bar code identification (previously performed by the Centaur) Sample transport and tracking Sample centrifugation (optional functionality) Sample de-capping (optional functionality) Sample transport and tracking Tube sealing (optional functionality)

The Centaur continues to perform the following functions, when connected to the StreamLAB.

All functions except reading the sample tube bar code. When Centaur is connected to StreamLAB, samples can be loaded directly onto Centaur and/or loaded onto StreamLAB and routed to Centaur. For samples loaded onto StreamLAB, StreamLAB reads the sample tube bar code (sample identification) and passes it electronically to Centaur via the LAS interface to Centaur.

The ADVIA Centaur with StreamLAB $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Analytical Workcell is an automated immunoassay analyzer designed to perform in vitro diagnostic immunochemical assay analysis on clinical specimens. The system menu will include assays based on chemiluminescent technology, such as Thyroxine, along with other various chemiluminescent assays that may be adaptable to the analyzer depending on the reagent used to induce the chemiluminescent reaction.

The ADVIA Centaur T4 assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of thyroxine (T4) in serum on the ADVIA Centaur and ADVIA Centaur XP systems. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid diseases.

# 6. Medical device to which cquivalence is claimed

The ADVIA Centaur $\mathfrak { W }$ with StreamLAB $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Analytical Workcell is substantially equivalent to the ADVIA Centaur (K041 133). The devices have same / similar design and modes of operation. The key features are summarized in the table.
