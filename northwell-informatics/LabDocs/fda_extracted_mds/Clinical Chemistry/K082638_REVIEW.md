. Special instrument requirements: ADVIA Centaur with StreamLAB $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analytical Workcell

# I. Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur is a continuous operation, immunochemistry analyzer designed to perform in vitro diagnostic testing on clinical specimens.

The StreamLAB $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analytical Workcell is a laboratory automation system (LAS) designed to automate sample handling and processing in the clinical laboratory.

The ADVIA Centaur with StreamLAB $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analytical Workcell combines the features of both the analyzer and the laboratory automation system.

The StreamLAB routes samples to the Centaur analyzer based on test request information it (StreamLAB) receives from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and the test map established for the Centaur analyzer. StreamLAB and Centaur communicate sample and analyzer status via Centaur’s Laboratory Automation System (LAS) interface. Via its LIS interface, the Centaur analyzer interfaces separately with the hospital’s LIS to receive its test instructions (test requests) and to report results for each sample. Centaur’s test instructions and test results for each sample are not processed through the StreamLAB.

The StreamLAB performs the following pre and post-analytical functions.

• Sample bar code identification (previously performed by the Centaur)   
• Sample transport and tracking Sample centrifugation (optional functionality) Sample de-capping (optional functionality) Sample transport and tracking   
• Tube sealing (optional functionality)

The Centaur continues to perform the following functions, when connected to the StreamLAB.

All functions except reading the sample tube bar code. When Centaur is connected to

StreamLAB, samples can be loaded directly onto Centaur and/or loaded onto StreamLAB and routed to Centaur. For samples loaded onto StreamLAB, StreamLAB reads the sample tube bar code (sample identification) and passes it electronically to Centaur via the LAS interface to Centaur.
