#

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 862.1150 Calibrator, secondary

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product code: JIT

4. Panel: 75 Chemistry

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The LOCI NTP CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the Nterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide methods on the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EXL integrated chemistry system with LOCI $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Module.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EXL integrated chemistry system with LOCI $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Module

# I. Device Description:

The LOCI NTP CAL is a frozen liquid product containing synthetic human Nterminal peptide in bovine albumin matrix with stabilizers and preservative. The kit consists of ten vials, two vials per level (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial.

The calibrator contains human source material. Each donor unit used in the preparation of this product was tested by FDA-approved methods for the presence of antibodies to Human immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and Type 2 (HIV-2), and found to be negative (not repeatedly reactive).

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The LOCI NTP CAL is a liquid product packaged as ten vials, two vials at each of five levels, to be stored at $\mathbf { - 2 0 } ^ { \textrm { o } } \mathbf { C }$ . The artificial matrix is BSA based spiked with synthetic NT-proBNP peptide. The master pool is a multi-level liquid BSA-based artificial matrix spiked with synthetic NT-proBNP peptide stored at $\mathbf { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Values are assigned to each lot of calibrator from the master pool using the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EXL NTP method. Values are assigned to the master pool from the patient sample anchor pool which has been assigned on the Elecsys PBNP assay to which the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EXL NTP method is traceable.

The LOCI NTP CAL is stored at $- 2 0$ to $\mathbf { \Pi } _ { - 1 0 } \mathbf { \Pi } ^ { \mathbf { 0 } } \mathrm { C }$ and is stable until the expiration date. Thawed unopened product is stable for 30 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ . Once the vial is opened, assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ . The shelf life and open stability of the calibrator have been demonstrated using real time data. Shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $- 2 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ with the control material stored at $\mathbf { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Open vial stability is determined by comparing results of vials thawed, opened and recapped stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ up to 31 days with the control material and test material stored at $\mathbf { - 7 0 \Omega ^ { \mathrm { o } } C }$ and $- 2 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable b. Clinical specificity:

Not applicable c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Values for the calibrator materials are provided on the labels.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
