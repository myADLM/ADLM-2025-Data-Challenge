# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

SD CHECK GOLD blood glucose system is applicable to monitor blood glucose in capillary whole blood.

SD CHECK GOLD blood glucose monitoring system is comprised of the following.

- SD CHECK GOLD blood glucose meter - SD CHECK GOLD blood glucose test strip SD CHECK GOLD control solution SD CHECK GOLD check strip

A drop of blood sample from the finger prick works with glucose oxidase and the mediators in the test strip to make a small electric current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood. The meter reads the current and displays the blood glucose result equivalent to the current.

# INDICATION FOR USE

SD CHECK GOLD Blood glucose monitoring system is indicated for monitoring glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip, palm, forearm or upper arm.

SD CHECK GOLD meter must be used with SD CHECK GOLD blood glucose test strip and SD CHECK GOLD control solutions.

The SD Check Gold control solutions Level M and Level H are for use with SD Check Gold test system as quality controls to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

Testing is done outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use).

This system is indicated for home (over-the-counter; OTC) by person with diabetes, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.

This system should not be used for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes or for testing newborns.

# COMPARISION TO PREDICATE DEVICE

The SD CHECK GOLD blood glucose monitoring system of Standard Diagnostics, Inc. is substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed ACC-CHEK Advantage System of Roche Diagnostics Corp and ONE TOUCH® UItra® of Lifescan, Inc.
