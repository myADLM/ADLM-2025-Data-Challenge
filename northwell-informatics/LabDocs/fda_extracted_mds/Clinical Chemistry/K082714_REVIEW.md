# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Audit™ MicroCV™ Therapeutic Drug (TDM) Linearity Set consists of five levels in Human and Bovine serum albumin matrix. Each level contains the following analytes: Acetaminophen, Amikacin, Carbamazepine, Digoxin, Gentamicin, Methotrexate, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Quinidine, Salicylate, Theophylline, Tobramycin, Valproic Acid and Vancomycin. The five levels demonstrate a linear relationship to each other for their respective analytes, reagents, and instruments.

This product may be used for proficiency testing in interlaboratory surveys and to perform CLIA directed calibration verification for these same analytes with similar reagents on similar instrumentation in accordance with current CLIA-88 guidelines and regulations.

In addition, Level A – E of this product may be used as unassayed quality control material for these analytes or as an assayed quality control material for the analyzer systems specified in the package insert. It is not intended to be used as an assayed quality control material for any other analyzer systems.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For professional use only.

Special instrument requirements: The labeling lists instruments on which the device is meant to be used:

# I. Device Description:

The Audit MicroCV Therapeutic Drug (TDM) Linearity Set is a human based, lyophilized, five level set of QC material, with each level containing 14 analytes. It is used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of Therapeutic Drug (TDM) methods for the analytes listed in the Indications for Use. Level A is near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit of instruments. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

Each serum, plasma or whole blood donor unit used in the preparation of this material was tested by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved methods and found to be negative for antibodies to HIV and HCV and nonreactive for HBSAg.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

Materials used in the production of this device are ACS or USP grade pharmaceuticals which are authenticated from the vendor’s certificate of analysis. The product is tested throughout the manufacturing process with primary analytical standards traceable to USP standard references. Materials are obtained from approved vendors and put through an internal quality control process.

Stability:

The stability protocols and acceptance criteria for this product were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The product has an open-vial stability of 5 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . An accelerated stability study determined a shelf life stability of 2 years when stored at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and real-time studies are ongoing.

Value Assignment:

Quality control protocols for value assignments were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Level A (low pool) all analytes are adjusted to be within 5- $10 \%$ of the lowest limit of measurability for their corresponding analyte. For Level E (high pool), all analytes are adjusted to be within $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the highest limit of measurability for their corresponding analyte. Levels are then

diluted to the following:

Level $\mathbf { A } = 1 0 0 \%$ Low Pool Level $B = 7 5 \%$ Low Pool, $2 5 \%$ High Pool Level $C = 5 0 \%$ Low Pool, $50 \%$ High Pool Level $D = 2 5 \%$ Low Pool, $7 5 \%$ High Pool Level $\mathrm { E } = 1 0 0 \%$ High Pool

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:
