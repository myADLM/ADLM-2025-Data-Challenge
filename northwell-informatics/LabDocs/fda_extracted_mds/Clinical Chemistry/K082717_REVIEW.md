# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.   
2. Indication(s) for use: The Audit™ MicroCV™ Tumor Markers Linearity Set consists of five levels in Human based serum. Each level contains the following analytes: Alpha fetoprotein (AFP), Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA-125, CA 15-3, Prostate specific antigen-free (free PSA), total PSA. The five levels demonstrate a linear relationship to each other for their respective analytes, reagents, and instruments. This product may be used for proficiency testing in interlaboratory surveys.   
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Prescription use only.   
4. Special instrument requirements: Quality control material for the analyzer systems specified in the package insert.

# I. Device Description:

The Audit™ MicroCV™ Tumor Markers Linearity Set is a human serum based, lyophilized, five level set of QC material, with each level containing 6 analytes. It is used to confirm the linear operating range of Tumor Marker methods for the analytes listed.

Level A is near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit of instruments. Levels $\mathrm { B } - \mathrm { D }$ are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E. Each serum, plasma or whole blood donor unit used in the preparation of this material was tested by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved methods and found to be negative for antibodies to HIV and HCV and nonreactive for HBSAg.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

Materials are obtained from approved vendors and put through an internal quality control process.

Stability:

The stability protocols and acceptance criteria for this product were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The product has an open-vial stability of 7 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . An accelerated stability study determined a shelf life stability of 2 years when stored at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and real-time studies are ongoing.

Value Assignment:

Level A (low pool) all analytes are adjusted to be within $5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 \%$ of the lowest limit of measurability for their corresponding assay. For Level E (high pool), all analytes are adjusted to be within $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the highest limit of measurability for their corresponding assay. Levels are then diluted to the following:

Level $\mathbf { A } = 1 0 0 \%$ Low Pool Level $B = 7 5 \%$ Low Pool, $2 5 \%$ High Pool Level $C = 5 0 \%$ Low Pool, $50 \%$ High Pool Level $D = 2 5 \%$ Low Pool, $7 5 \%$ High Pool Level $\mathrm { E } = 1 0 0 \%$ High Pool
