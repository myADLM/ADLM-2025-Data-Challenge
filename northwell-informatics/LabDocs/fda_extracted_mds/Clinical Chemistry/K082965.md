Proprietary Name: DS-A Blood Glucose Monitoring System • Common Name: Blood Glucose Monitoring System • Classification Name: SYSTEM, TEST, BLOOD GLUCOSE, OVER THE COUNTER, Class II Product Code: NBW

# 2.2. Safety and Effectiveness Information

Predicate Device:   
Claim of Substantial Equivalence (SE) is made to ACCU-CHEK Aviva System (k043474).   
Device Description: Based on an electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action, DS-A Blood Glucose Monitoring System only needs a small amount of blood. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and your blood glucose result is precisely and displayed in 6 seconds.   
The Draw-In blood glucose test strip is designed to provide an easy, accurate method for the determination of blood glucose in fingertip capillary whole blood. When the blood is applied to the edge of reaction zone, the blood is drawn into the reaction chamber and will display a reading on the meter. Only a small amount of blood is needed. The test strip for the quantitative measurement of blood glucose in the range is from 20-600 mg/dL (1.1-33.3 mmol/L).

# Intended Use:

The A-CHECK DS-A Blood Glucose Monitoring System is used with DS-A Test Strips and 3-level Controls for the measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger. Testing is done outside the body ( in vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home ( over the counter [OTC] ) by person with diabetes, or in clinical setting by health care professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates.

The DS-A Test Strips are intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. DS-A Test Strips must be used with the A-CHECK DS-A Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). They are indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. They are not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates.

The Alliance Blood Glucose 3 levels Control Solution are for use with the A-CHECK DS-A Blood Glucose Monitoring System and DS-A Test Strips as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

# Substantial Equivalence (SE)

A claim of substantial equivalence is made to ACCU-CHEK Aviva System (k043474). Both of them have the same working principle and technologies. The differences are coding method, sample volume, meter dimension, weight, HCT range, and memory data number. Besides, the subject device is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger but the predicate device can test whole blood include traditional fingertip site along with palm, forearm, upper arm, thigh, and calf. Thus the differences are due to the feature design aspects, not relating to the safety or effectiveness aspects. They are substantially equivalent.
