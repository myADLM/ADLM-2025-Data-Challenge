# Section VI 510(k) Summary Technological Characteristics

# Device Description

The TearLab Osmolarity System is intended to measure the osmolarity of human tears to aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs or symptoms of dry eye disease, in conjunction with other methods of clinical evaluation. The device consists of the following components and accessories: One Tearl ab Reader, Two TearLab Pens, Two TearLab Electronic Check Cards, Single Use TearLab Osmolarity Test Cards, and TearLab Control Solutions.

The TearLab Osmolarity Test Card, in conjunction with the TearLab Osmolarity System, provides a quick and simple method for determining tear osmolarity using nanoliter (nL) volumes of tear fluid collected directly from the eyelid margin.

To perform a test, a new Test Card containing a microfluidic capillary channel is attached onto the Pen. The tip of the Test Card is touched to the inferior tear meniscus located above the lower eyelid and collects 40-50 nanoliters of tear fluid by passive capillary action.

After a successful collection, the Pen in conjunction with the electrodes embedded on the Test Card, measures and stores the tear fluid impedance. The Pen is then docked to the Reader.

The Reader downloads impedance data from the Pen in order to calculate and display the final osmolarity as a numerical value displayed in units of mOsms/L.

The TearLab Osmolarity System simplifies the tear collection process by reducing the required specimen volume to nanoliters, eliminating the need to transfer tear fluid and reducing the risk of evaporation.

# Principles of the Procedure

The TearLab Osmolarity test utilizes an electrical impedance measurement to provide an indirect assessment of osmolarity. After applying a lot-specific calibration curve, osmolarity is calculated and displayed as a quantitative numerical value.

# External Method Comparison

At each of three physician office sites, forty contrived tear specimens across seven levels of the clinically significant range were prepared and measured on the TearLab Osinolarity System. The physician office laboratories did not have access to the Wescor 5520 Vapro vapor pressure osmometer. Wescor values were deterrnined by an average of 2-3 measurements on each level of osmolarity immediately prior to the beginning of the study.

Performance Testing Summary

# Expected Values & Reference Ranges

Reference tear osmolarity values for normal and dry eye disease patients: Normal: 288-331 m0sms/L $9 0 \%$ Cl 288-331, mean 309.9 ± 11.0) Dry Eye Disease: 291-382 mOsms/L (90% Cl 284-392, mean 324 ± 20.8) Osmolarity may differ from left and right eye, and each eye should be tested and assessed to determine which eye represents the higher osmolarity.

# Calibration Data

To determine clinical performance for tear film hyperosmolarity in the diagnosis of Dry Eye Disease (DED) a meta-analysis was performed on historical published data for tear osmolarity in samples of normal and dry eye subjects. An osmolarity referent 316 mOsms/L was found to yield sensitivity of $6 9 \% ,$ EPY specificity of $9 2 \%$ and an overall predictive accuracy of $8 2 \%$ for the diagnosis of dry eye syndrome. Studies in the meta-analysis used earlier osmolarity devices, not TearLab.

# Performance on patients with objective signs of dry eye

140 subjects were enrolled in a multicenter study $( n = 4 5 \mathsf { N O } \mathsf { r } \mathsf { m } ) \mathsf { a }$ $n = 9 5$ Dry Eye). To qualify as a Dry Eye patient, subjects were required a positive score on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OsDl) and 2 or more positive indications of Tear Film Breakup Time (TBUT), Schirmer Test, Corneal Staining, Conjunctival Staining, or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. Performance of the TearLab™ Osmolarity System using these selection criteria are shown below in Table 2:

# Substantial Equivalence

The intended use of the TearLab Osmolarity System, like the predicate Wescor osmometer, is to measure the osmolarity of body fluid. Although the TearLab System is specifically indicated for use in the measurement of osmolarity of human tears, while the Wescor osmometer is indicated for use more generally in body fluids, the indications for use of the Wescor encompass the indications for use of the TearLab. In addition, compared to the other predicate devices, the TearLab System has similar indications for use in assessing human tears as the predicate Schirmer strips and Touch IgE microassay, which are also indicated for evaluation of human tears. The TearLab Osmolarity System has the same technological characteristics as its predicate devices, and any technological differences between the TearLab and the predicates do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness. Performance data demonstrale that the TearLab is as safe and effective as the Predicate Devices. Thus, the TearLab Osmolarity System is substantialy equivalent to other legally marketed tear collection and measurement devices.
