TearLab Osmolarity System

# I. Device Description:

The device consists of the following components and accessories: one TearLab Reader, two TearLab Pens, two TearLab Electronic Check Cards, Single Use TearLab Osmolarity Test Cards, and TearLab Control Solutions. The TearLab Osmolarity Test Card, in conjunction with the TearLab Osmolarity System, provides method for determining tear osmolarity using nanoliter (nL) volumes of tear fluid collected directly from the eyelid margin.

To perform a test, a new Test Card containing a microfluidic capillary channel is attached onto the Pen. The tip of the Test Card is touched to the inferior tear meniscus located above the lower eyelid and collects 40-50 nanoliters of tear fluid by passive capillary action. After a successful collection, the Pen in conjunction with the electrodes embedded on the Test Card, measures and stores the tear fluid impedance. The Pen is then docked to the Reader. The Reader downloads impedance data from the Pen in order to calculate and display the final osmolarity as a numerical value displayed in units of mOsms/L.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To establish the linearity of the system through the range of 282-391 mOsms/L, seven samples in a dilution series ranging from $2 5 1 - 4 2 8 \mathrm { m O s m s / L }$ were each run in four replicates on one lot of test cards, one TearLab Reader and two Pens. For the lowest and highest samples tested (251 and $4 2 8 ~ \mathrm { { m O s m s / L } }$ respectively), TearLab indicated that the value was either below or above the detectable range. The Pens were randomly assigned. Samples were also run in duplicate on the Wescor 5520 Vapor Pressure Osmometer. Results are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): OcuSense TearLab Control Solutions are two levels of aqueous salt solution sealed within glass ampoules. These solutions are formulated gravimetrically at two different sodium concentrations. Product stability is established based on real time studies. Samples were analyzed at predetermined intervals with failure defined as greater than a $2 \%$ change in sodium concentration.

Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution: control solutions contained within sealed glass ampoules were evaluated at two temperatures, $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The sodium concentration was determined using a flame photometer analyzer $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ . The mean and percent change was calculated after 36 months after the date of manufacture. The sponsor determined that the control solutions contained within a single use glass ampoule is stable for 36 months when stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The TearLab Osmolarity Systems are calibrated against a set of precision resistors and temperature references. This procedure has been established to ensure that all TearLabs operate within identical tolerance limits.

# d. Detection limit:

The upper and lower limit of detection of the TearLab Osmolarity System is 275-400 based on replicates of two levels of contrived tears, at 275 mOsms/L (7 replicates) and $4 0 0 \mathrm { { m O s m s / L } }$ (21 replicates), respectively, tested on one lot of test cards with one TearLab Reader and one Pen. Paired with the linearity testing performed above in section L.b., the sponsor has demonstrated that the device is capable of reading values as low as $2 7 5 \mathrm { \ m O s m s / L }$ and as high as $4 0 0 \mathrm { { m O s m s / L } }$ with linearity established from $2 8 2 { - } 3 9 1 ~ \mathrm { m O s m s / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To establish the effects of matrix components on the osmolarity of human tears, sodium chloride solutions were compared to a complex mixture of mono- and divalent ions formulated to mimic human tears. Both matrices were analyzed on a Wescor 5520 Vapro vapor pressure osmometer calibrated using a $2 9 0 \mathrm { m m o l / k g N I S T }$ traceable NaCl solution. The fluid samples were also measured for impedance on a TearLab device.

Linear regression analysis showed that the difference between sodium chloride solution and a complex mixture of mono- and divalent ions meant to mimic human tears was approximately 750 Ohms across a range of osmolarities, representing a shift of $8 \mathrm { m O s m s / L }$ . Because physiological variance in electrolyte ratios is expected to be less than $1 - 1 0 \%$ of each electrolyte, the expected change in osmolarity resulting from these variations is 0.08 to $0 . 8 \mathrm { m O s m s / L }$ . As this range is not clinically relevant, the sponsor concludes that there are no measurable matrix effects from the physiological variance in electrolyte composition in human tears.

Linear regression analysis showed that the difference between artificial tears comprised of of monovalent ions, divalent ions, and tear proteins (specifically, lysozyme, immunoglobulins and albumin), as compared to the same matrix without tear proteins, was less than the measurable precision of the TearLab $( < 3 \mathrm { m O s m s / L } )$ . Because physiological variance in protein ratios is expected to be much less than the $100 \%$ difference within this experiment, there are no expected matrix effects from physiological variance in protein composition in human tear.

Linear regression analysis showed that the difference between artificial tears comprised of of monovalent ions, divalent ions, tear proteins, lipids and mucins as compared to the same matrix without lipids and mucins, was less than the measurable precision of the TearLab $( < 3 \mathrm { m O s m s / L } )$ ). Because physiological variance in protein ratios is expected to be much less than the $100 \%$ difference within this experiment, there are no expected matrix effects from physiological variance in lipid and mucin composition in human tear.

Therefore, there are no expected matrix effects from physiological variance in electrolyte composition, protein composition, or lipid and mucin composition in human tears.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor gives the following as the reference tear osmolarity values for normal and dry eye disease patients based on the validation of cutoff study found above in section 3.c.:

Normal: 288-331 mOsms/L $90 \%$ CI 288-331, mean $3 0 9 . 9 \pm 1 1 . 0 $ Dry Eye Disease: 291-382 mOsms/L $90 \%$ CI 284-392, mean $3 2 4 \pm 2 0 . 8 )$

N. Instrument Name: TearLab Osmolarity System

# O. System Descriptions:

Each test card is single use and must be replaced with a new card for additional readings.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X____ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with tears from the lateral (temporal) extent of the eyelid. Since the tear sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

The manufacturer calibrates the TearLab Osmolarity System against a reference standard solution prepared from dried, high-purity sodium chloride traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Calibration by the user is not required.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor has two levels of controls available for this device with both normal and high osmolarity control solutions available in single-use glass ampoules. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on control package insert. The user is instructed to not use the device if the control solutions are outside of the range indicated and to contact the distributor.

The Electronic Check Cards (ECC) will also verify TearLab function. The Electronic Check Card contains precision resistors on a printed circuit board to provide a known standard signal to simulate tear impedance. The user attaches the ECC to the Pen, which converts the precision resistor signal of the ECC into an osmolarity test result that should be compared to the allowable range as indicated in the ECC instructions for use. In this manner, the user can verify that the Pen and Reader hardware and software are performing as expected.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Rationale For Contrived Tears

To perform the within-run, between instrument, lot-to-lot, and method comparison studies presented in this submission, approximately one half liter of tear fluid would be necessary which is equivalent of fifty thousand tear collections. Comparison of sequential tear collections on the predicate Wescor and TearLab osmometer are also made impractical by the small volume of accessible human tear fluid per subject. Additionally, split sample in vitro tests of tear fluid were found by the sponsor to be unsuitable for the external clinical sites enrolled to examine the performance of the TearLab.

In order to mitigate errors due to evaporation or dilution from reflex tearing during performance testing of the TearLab, the sponsor synthesized artificial tears that accurately represented the impedance-osmolarity relationship of human tear fluid. To demonstrate the acceptability of using contrived tears in place of human tears, roughly one half liter of contrived tear solution was synthesized under an ISO 13485 quality system in an independent reference laboratory. The composition of the contrived tear contained a complex mixture of mono- and divalent ions, proteins, lipids and metabolites to mimic the human tear matrix. The contrived tears were then diluted to produce seven osmolarity specimens representing the clinical range of tear osmolarity (280, 287, 294, 305, 316, 345, $3 7 2 ~ \mathrm { { m O s m s / L } }$ ). Samples were analyzed on a Wescor 5520 osmometer calibrated using a $2 9 0 \mathrm { m m o l / k g }$ NIST traceable NaCl solution and an OcuSense TearLab device. The contrived tear solution was split into $0 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$ aliquots in individually sealed vials that were then disseminated to the performance testing sites.

In addition, to demonstrate the performance of human tear fluid measurement with the Tearlab osmometer, a pool of human tears was collected from 43 different people, of which a portion was split into four fractions and partially lyophilized to increasing levels of osmolarity. The fractions were then measured on both the TearLab and Wescor 5520 osmometers.

The impedance-osmolarity relationship of the contrived tears used for performance testing was identical to that of human tears.
