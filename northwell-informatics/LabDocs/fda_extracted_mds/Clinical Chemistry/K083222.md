# Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed:

CATCH Incorporated, Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent, k062808.

# Intended Use of Device:

The Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent is intended for in vitro quantitative determination of total homocysteine in human serum and plasma. The device can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients suspected of having hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria.

# Description of Device:

The Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent Test System includes two reagents and two calibrators.

The first reagent (Reag 1) includes Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Serine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced di-sodium salt (NADH), tris [2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP) reductant, with buffers and stabilizers (Trizma Base and Trizma Hydrochloride), and preservative (Sodium Azide).

The second reagent (Reag2) includes Cystathionine beta-Synthase (CBS) and Cystathionine beta-Lyase (CBL) cycling enzymes with preservative (sodium azide).

The Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent kit will also include two calibrators; Calibrator "0" (0 μmol/L) and Calibrator "28" (28 μmol/L).

# Principle of the Assay

Bound or dimerised homocysteine (oxidised form) is reduced to free homocysteine, which then reacts with serine catalysed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) to form cystathionine. Cystathionine in turn is broken down by cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) to form homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia. Pyruvate is then converted by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to lactate with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as coenzyme. The rate of NADH conversion to NAD' is directly proportional to the concentration of homocysteine (∆ A340 nm).

Reduction: Dimerised homocysteine, mixed disulfide, and protein-bound forms of HCY in the sample are reduced to form free HCY by the use of tris [2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP).

TCEP HCY-SS-HCY (dimerised homocysteine) R1-SS-HCY (R1 $\approx$ thiol residue) Homocysteine (HCY) Protein-SS-HCY

Enzymatic Conversion: Free HCY is converted to cystathionine by the use of cystathionine beta-synthase and excess serine. The cystathionine is then broken down to homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia. Pyruvate is converted to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase with NADH as coenzyme. The rate of NADH conversion to $N A D +$ (∆ A340 nm) is directly proportional to the concentration of homocysteine.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent and CATCH Incorporated Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent are both two reagent clinical chemistry enzymatic assays for the quantitative determination of total homocysteine in human serum and plasma. The reagent and calibrator formulations and the assay methodology of the Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent assay are essentially equivalent to the CATCH Incorporated Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent assay. The difference between the assays is the concentration of Cystathionine beta-Synthase in Reagent 2. The Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent assay contains 0 748 KU/L Cystathionine beta-Synthase, whereas the CATCH Incorporated Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent contains 20 kU/L Cystathionine betaSynthase!

# Summary of Non-Clinical Performance:

The Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent assay is substantially equivalent to CATCH Incorporated Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent assay in terms of precision, limit of detection (sensitivity) and specificity (interferences) as demonstrated in non-clinical performance data in this 510(k) submission.

# Summary of Clinical Performance:

The Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent assay demonstrated substantially equivalent performance to the CATCH Incorporated Liquid Stable (LS) 2- Part Homocysteine Reagent assay indicated by a method comparison study.

Passing-Bablok linear regression method comparison was performed on 94 plasma specimens in the range of 6.5 to $4 9 . 0 ~ \mu m o l / L$ homocysteine. The Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homoçysteine Reagent assay versus the CATCH Incorporated Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent gave a slope of $\textcircled { 9 9 9 }$ $( 9 5 \%$ Confidence interval $0 . 9 8 0 \ : 1 0 \approx 1 0 0 1 )$ and an intercept of $0 . 1 6 5$ $( 9 5 \%$ Confidence interval $\textcircled { 1 } \textcircled { 2 } \textcircled { 1 } \textcircled { 1 } \textcircled { 1 } \textcircled { 2 }$ $\textcircled { 1 } 2 9 \textcircled { 2 } )$ The Axis-Shield Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent assay versus CATCH Incorporated Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent gave an r value of 1.00 $( 9 5 \%$ Confidence interval 1.00 to 1.00). The average percent bias exhibited by Axis-Shield Liquid Stable 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent versus CATCH Incorporated Liquid Stable 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent in this study was $\textcircled { 1 } \textcircled { 1 } 1 \%$ $( 9 5 \%$ Confidence interval of the average percent bias is $\sim 0 . 1 0 1 0 0 0 7 \% )$ .
