# Device Description

The SymCare Diabetes Management Program (DMP) is an online tool that helps patients to manage their diabetes and communicate their blood glucose readings to their healthcare providers, healthcare providers manage their diabetes patient population, and insurance companies manage their diabetes patient and health care provider populations. The DMP enables a blood glucose meter to connect via a Bluetooth accessory, the Polymap Wireless Polytel $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ GMA Glucose Meter Accessory (GMA), to a cellular phone. Once the mobile phone has gathered the data from the meter, it transmits the data to a centralized repository database. The data is analyzed to recognize health patterns, show trends, and offer personalized health information.
