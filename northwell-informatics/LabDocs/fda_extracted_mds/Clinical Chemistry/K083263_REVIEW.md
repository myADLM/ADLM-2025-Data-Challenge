2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

Data transmission was validated to be accurate from the glucose meter to the Polytel GMA and to the SymCare Database. The validation process included the following steps 1.) The 510(k) cleared PolyMap Wireless Polytel Glucose Meter Accessory (GMA) was connected to a One Touch Ultra 2 Meter, Blood Glucose Readings were taken following the Ultra 2 Meter directions for use and comments were added to the readings using the Meter. 2.) These readings and comments were sent to the PolyMap when the Blood Glucose Test Strip was removed from the meter (as defined by normal PolyMap operation). 3.) The PolyMap then sends the data to transient storage on the mobile phone application. 4.) The mobile phone application then sends the PolyMap data log to the SymCare data receiver. 5.) These data are then imported into the SymCare Diabetes Management Program (DMP) 6.) The meter was then connected to the One Touch Data Management Software (OT DMS) to retrieve the initial readings and verified accurate data. Data elements used for validation were glucose readings, comments, time and date.

Additionally a human factor’s study was performed as follows:

Participants:

A total of 14 participants included in the study were defined as those diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes and who were between the ages of 18 and 64. Participants were undergoing treatment for their Diabetes with either insulin or an oral agent and were regularly performing self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), without assistance, at a minimum of 2-3 times per day using the LifeScan Ultra or Ultra2 meter.

Health Care Professional Participants:

Health Care Professionals( HCP’s) who participated in the study can be defined as those involved in the care and management of patients with diabetes type 1 and type 2 who are on insulin or a type of oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. There were 4 Medical Doctors, 1 Registered Nurse, and 1 Registered Dietician.

Methods:

Participants who were already proficient in SMBG using the LifeScan Ultra or Ultra2 meter utilized the Symcare Diabetes Management Program for a 7-day period. Following use of the device for a period of 7 days the participants provided evaluation of the Symcare Diabetes Management Program via a Human Factors Task Assessment and a User Comprehension Questionnaire on Day $7 ( + 3$ day window). These were administered by a study doctor or coordinator and took place at In-Center Visits on Day 5 and Day 7 $( + 3$ day window). Medical team members also utilized the Symcare Diabetes Management Program during the 7-day period. An evaluation of the system was provided through a Human Factors Task Assessment and User Questionnaires administered by a Study doctor or coordinator, which specifically focused on the medical team user experience. It was noted that some patient’s data did not transfer rapidly to the Symcare Diabetes Management Program secure website. The Symcare Diabetes Management Program allows for the transfer of a maximum of 100 readings from the meter at one time.

Discussion and Overall Conclusions:

The Primary Endpoint was met for each questionnaire for health care professionals and participants, which assessed human factors tasks, labeling comprehension and ease of use.

# K. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# L. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
