# 5.8Device Description:

The microdot® Xtra Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the microdot® Xtra Blood Glucose Meter, microdot® Xtra Test Strips, microdot® Control Solutions and a commercially available (510(k) cleared) lancing device and lancets.

The microdot® Xtra Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for invitro diagnostic use and for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood. The modified device ie microdo® Xtra Blood Glucose Monitoring Systm, and it predicate device, microdot® Blood Glucose Monitoring System are intended for use by persons with diabetes or by healthcare professionals in home settings or healthcare facilities.

The modified microdot® Xtra Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent in form, firmware, fundamental scientific technology and specifications as the predicate system. The microdot® Xtra Blood Glucose Monitoring System relies on quantitative electrochemical biosensor technology to measure current generated on disposable test strips.

The strip remains unchanged since the last submission approval, microdot® Blood Glucose Monitoring System (k070524). The Test Strip manufacturing and performance characteristics are unchanged. The test strips are designed to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary blood from the fingertip by persons with diabetes or by healthcare professional in home or healthcare facilities. Both the predicate strips, microdot® Test Strips (k070524) and the microdo® Xtra Test Strips use the reagent glucose dehydrogenase with nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide as co-factor.

The predicate meter uses lot specific calibration code number marked on the strip vial label. The specific code number on the strip vial label allows the meter to convert electrical current into glucose readings via the embedded software in the meter. The user calibrates their meter each time they open a new vial of strips.

Each lot of strips is calibrated to give plasma equivalent glucose readings. The meter is turned on by strip insertion, the user applies a drop of blood or control solution to the test strip and the meter starts the measurement. After 10 seconds, the meter displays the glucose concentration and time and date on the LCD display.

The microdot® Xtra Blood Glucose Monitoring System is pre-programmed with a predetermined code number, thus removing the requirement to load a code number specific to the strip vial.

# 5.9 Substantial Equivalence Information:

Dear Ms. Yon-Hin:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
