# 4. Device Description(s):

The Dimension $\mathfrak { P }$ RxL Max® Chemistry System is a continuous operation chemistry analyzer designed to perform in vitro diagnostic testing on clinical specimens and is a family member of the Dimension $\textcircled{1}$ XL Clinical Chemistry System (traditional 510(k) filed in 1994 K944093). The Dimension $\mathfrak { \widehat { B } }$ RxL ${ \bf M a x } \langle \overbrace { { \mathbb { R } } } \rangle$ Chemistry System has also been cleared with StreamLab Analytical WorkCell and Sample Transfer Module (K043546)

The ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Modular Automation System (AMAS) is a laboratory automation system (LAS) designed to automate sample handling and processing in the clinical laboratory. AMAS is available as two products ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LabCell $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WorkCell. These

LAS systems are made up of the same components and are controlled by common software. The systems differ in their expansion capabilities:

ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WorkCell is an ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automation solution that is limited to three fixed configurations supporting up to a total of five interface stations.

ADVIA $\mathfrak { P }$ LabCell $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ is customizable ADVIA $^ \mathrm { ( 1 3 ) }$ Automation solution that is configurable with up to 16 interface stations.

Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ RxL Max $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry System (Dimension) with Sample Transfer Module and the ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Modular Automation System combines the features of both the analyzcr and the laboratory automation system.

The ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Modular Automation System (AMAS) routes samples to the Dimension analyzer based on test request information received from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and the test map established for the Dimension analyzer. AMAS and Dimension communicate sample and analyzer status via Dimension's Laboratory Automation System (LAS) interface. Via its Laboratory Information System (LIS) interface, the Dimension analyzer interfaces separately with the hospital's LIS to receive its test instructions (test requests) and to report results for each sample. Dimension's test instructions and test results for each sample are not processed through the AMAS.

AMAS performs the following pre and post-analytical functions.

Sample bar code identification (previously performed by the Dimension)   
√ Sample transport and tracking (pre-Analytical)   
√ Sample centrifugation (optional functionality) Sample de-capping (optional functionality) Sample transport and tracking (post-Analytical)

The Dimension continues to perform the following functions, when connected to AMAS.

All functions except reading the sample tube bar code. When Dimension is connected to AMAS, samples can be loaded directly onto Dimension and/or loaded onto AMAS and routed to Dimension. For samples loaded onto the AMAS, which reads the sample tube bar code (sample identification) and passes it electronically to Dimension via the LAS interface.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ RxL Max $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Clinical Chemistry System with Sample Transfer Module and the ADVIA $\mathfrak { P }$ Modular Automation System is a discrete random access,   
microprocessor controlled, integrated instrument/chemistry system that measures a variety of analytes, including enzyme activities in body fluids. The system menu will include assays, such as Calcium, along with other various assays that may be adaptable to the analyzer depending on the reagent used.   
Calcium is intended to quantitatively measure Calcium in human serum or plasma. Calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany.

# 6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed

Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ RxL Max $\mathfrak { D }$ Clinical Chemistry System is a family member of the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XL Clinical Chemistry System (traditional 510(k) filed in 1994 K944093). The devices have same / similar design and modes of operation. The key features are summarized in the following table.
