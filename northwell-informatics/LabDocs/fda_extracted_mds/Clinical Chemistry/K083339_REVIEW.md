4. Special instrument requirements: Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ RxL Max $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Clinical Chemistry System with Sample Transfer Module and the ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Modular Automation System (LabCel $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ /WorkCell)

# I. Device Description:

The Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ RxL Max $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry System is a continuous operation chemistry analyzer designed to perform in vitro diagnostic testing on clinical specimens.

The ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Modular Automation System (AMAS) is a laboratory automation system (LAS) designed to automate sample handling and processing in the clinical laboratory. AMAS is available as two products, the ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ LabCel $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WorkCell. These LAS systems are made up of the same components and are controlled by common software. The systems differ in their expansion capabilities:

ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WorkCell is an ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Automation solution that is limited to three fixed configurations supporting up to a total of five interface stations. ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ LabCel $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ is customizable ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Automation solution that is configurable with up to 16 interface stations.

Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ RxL Max $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry System (Dimension) with Sample Transfer Module and the ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Modular Automation System combines the features of both the analyzer and the laboratory automation system.

The ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Modular Automation System (AMAS) routes samples to the Dimension analyzer based on test request information received from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and the test map established for the Dimension analyzer. AMAS and Dimension communicate sample and analyzer status via Dimension’s Laboratory Automation System (LAS) interface. Via its Laboratory Information System (LIS) interface, the Dimension analyzer interfaces separately with the hospital’s LIS to receive its test instructions (test requests) and to report results for each sample. Dimension’s test instructions and test results for each sample are not processed through the AMAS.

AMAS performs the following pre and post-analytical functions.   
• Sample bar code identification (previously performed by the Dimension) • Sample transport and tracking (pre-Analytical)   
• Sample centrifugation (optional functionality)

• Sample de-capping (optional functionality) • Sample transport and tracking (post-Analytical)

The Dimension continues to perform the following functions, when connected to AMAS.

• All functions except reading the sample tube bar code. When Dimension is connected to AMAS, samples can be loaded directly onto Dimension and/or loaded onto AMAS and routed to Dimension. For samples loaded onto the AMAS, which reads the sample tube bar code (sample identification) and passes it electronically to Dimension via the LAS interface.

L. Test Principle: The calcium measurement on the Dimension System is done photometrically.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The precision of RxL Dimension with AMAS was evaluated by analyzing three levels of a quality control product for calcium in replicates of five per day over five (5) days on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ RxL Max $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ with and without ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Modular Automation System (AMAS). The data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the difference between the instrument with and without the AMAS attached is statistically significant. The results are similar to the cleared claims.
