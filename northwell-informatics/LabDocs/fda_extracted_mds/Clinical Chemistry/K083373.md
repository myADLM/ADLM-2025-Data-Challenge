# 1.5 Description of Device

The IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 is a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with monoclonal murine anti-T4 antibody. The liquid phase consists of alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to T4.

The patient sample and the reagent are incubated together with the coated bead for 30 minutes. During this time, free T4 in the sample competes with enzyme conjugated T4 in the buffer for a limited number of antibody binding sites on the bead. Unbound patient sample and enzyme conjugate are then removed by centrifugal washes. Finally, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the reaction tube containing the bead and the signal is generated in proportion to the bound enzyme.

The IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 procedure is a direct or single test assay, in the sense that its results are not calculated as a function of total T4, but interpolated from a (stored) standard curve calibrated in terms of free T4 concentrations.1 In this respect it differs from so-called free T4 index determinations. Unlike the classic equilibrium dialysis methods, it requires neither a pre-incubation step nor preliminary isolation of the free fraction by dialysis or column chromatography.

Incubation Cycles: $1 \times 3 0$ minutes Time to First Result: 35 minutes

# 1.6 Indications for Use

The revised IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 assay, described in this submission, is predicated on the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics ADVIA . Centaur Free T4 (FrT4) assay (k961510/k971418).

A summary of the features of the IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 assay and the predicate device ADVIA Centaur FrT4 is presented below.

Performance of the IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 assay was determined in analytical performance validation studies and in method comparison studies comparing the IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 with the predicate device.

# 1.9 Expected Results

The expected results for the IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 assay are based on the established ranges of the ADVIA Centaur Free T4 assay (Predicate Device). Ranges for the ADVIA Centaur FrT4 assay were established using serum obtained from 388 apparently healthy individuals. Serum was analyzed with the ACS: $1 8 0 ^ { \textcircled { 8 } }$ FrT4 assay and confirmed for the ADVIA Centaur FrT4 assay by analyzing 283 samples in the range of 0.14 - 11.1 ng/dL (1.81 to 143 pmol/L). Expected results are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Clinical Condition</td><td>FT4 Range (ng/dL)</td><td>FT4 Range (pmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td>Euthyroid</td><td>0.89 - 1.76</td><td>11.5- 22.7</td></tr><tr><td>Hypothyroid</td><td>less than 0.89</td><td>less than 11.5</td></tr><tr><td>Hyperthyroid</td><td>greater than 1.76</td><td>Greater than 22.7</td></tr></table>

As with all in vitro diagnostic assays, each laboratory should determine its own reference range(s) for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.

Linear regression of Observed versus Expected doses demonstrated excellent Goodness-of-Fit $( R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 5 )$ with the following equation:

Observed 0.97(Expected) + 0.062
