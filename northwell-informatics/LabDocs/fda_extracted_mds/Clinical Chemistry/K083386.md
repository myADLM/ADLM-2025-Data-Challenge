# E. Regulatory Information:

ADVIA Chemistry Calcium_2 Method   
1. Regulation section: 21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1145 Calcium test system. 2. Classification: Class II   
3. Product Code: CJY, azo dye, calcium   
Panel: Clinical Chemistry

# F. Predicate Device:

ADVIA Chemistry Calcium_2 Method is substantially equivalent to the ADVIA Chemistry 1650 Calcium method cleared under K991576.

# G. Device Description:

Summary and Explanation: the Calcium_2 (CA_2) method is based on the work of Michaylova and Illkova, (Anal Chem Acta 1971; 53: 194), who found that Arsenazo III could form a stable complex with calcium with high selectivity at low pH.

Principles of the Procedure: Calcium ions form a colored complex with Arsenazo III, which is measured at $6 5 8 / 6 9 4 \ \mathrm { n m }$ . The amount of calcium present in the sample is directly proportional to the intensity of the colored complex formed.

Reaction Equation: $C a ^ { 2 + } +$ Arsenazo IIICa-Arsenazo IIComplex (purple

# H. Intended Use:

For in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of calcium in human serum, plasma, and urine on the ADVIA Chemistry systems. Such measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal failure, and tetany

# I. Substantial Equivalence Information:

The ADVIA Chemistry Calcium_2 Method and ADVIA 1650 Calcium methods were compared. A comparison of the important similarities and differences between the device and the predicate is provided in the following tables:
