# L. Test Principle:

The Calcium_2 (CA_2) method is based on the work of Michaylova and Illkova, who found that Arsenazo III could form a stable complex with calcium with high selectivity at low pH. The ADVIA 1650 system automatically predilutes the sample with saline by 5-fold. The sample predilution allows for very small sample volumes to be used for multiple tests run in random access on the analyzer. From the diluted sample, $4 \mathrm { u L }$ is added to $1 0 0 { \mathrm { u L } }$ of the reagent, mixed, and incubated for 5 minutes at 37C. Calcium ions form a colored complex with Arsenazo III, which is measured at $6 5 8 \mathrm { n m }$ . Absorbances of test samples are compared with that of the Calibrator to convert signal into calcium concentrations reported to the customer. The amount of calcium present in the sample is directly proportional to the intensity of the colored complex formed.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated using CLSI document EP05-A2 as a guideline. Samples from two serum controls, two urine controls, one spiked serum pool, and one spiked, urine pool were tested. Each sample was assayed 2 times per run, 2 runs per day for 10 days, totaling 40 replicates using the ADVIA 1650 system. The experiment was run using one reagent lot on two systems for serum and one reagent lot on one system for urine. Medical decision levels, as well as normal range and abnormal range of the assay were challenged in this experiment.

The precision data are summarized as follows:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated by comparing observed values versus expected values for 9 equally-spaced diluted samples prepared from high and low pools (separately for serum and urine). Each sample was measured in replicates of 3 using the ADVIA 1650 analyzer. The percent recovery for serum samples was within $1 0 0 - 1 0 5 . 5 \%$ and for urine samples it was within $1 0 0 - 1 0 6 . 1 \%$ .

In addition, the expected values (X) were plotted against the observed values (Y) and a line fit was plotted. The linear regression for serum samples is $\mathrm { Y = }$ $1 . 0 0 2 6 X + 0 . 1 6 7 9$ , $\Gamma { = } 0 . 9 9 9 8$ . For urine samples, the linear regression is $\mathrm { Y } =$ $0 . 9 9 7 1 \mathrm { X } = 0 . 3 7 7 5$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 8$ .

The data provided supported the sponsor’s claim that this assay has a reportable range of $1 - 1 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum samples and $1 - 3 2 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ for urine samples.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The ADVIA CA_2 method is traceable to an internal Siemens reference method (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission), which uses reference materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), via patient sample correlation.

Stability:

The reagent has an on-board stability of 30 days on the ADVIA 1200, ADVIA 1650/1800, and ADVIA 2400 systems. Unopened reagents are stable until the expiration date when stored at $1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Reagents should not be frozen.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of the blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were determined in accordance with the guidelines of CLSI document EP17-A using the ADVIA 1650 analyzer. Deionized water, low serum control material and low urine sample material were used to determine the LoB and LoD. Functional sensitivity of the assay was not calculated. Testing was conducted over a period of 10 days, with 2 runs per day using one system and one reagent lot. A total of 40 replicates of the blank sample, and 40 replicates of the low samples were run. The results are as follows:

LoB (serum) $\mathrm { \Omega } = 0 . 1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ LoB (urine) $= 0 . 0 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ LoD (serum $) = 0 . 3 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ LoD (urine) $= 0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$

The assay has a reportable range of $1 - 1 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum samples and 1 – $3 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine samples.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# i. Interference from endogenous substances:

Potential interfering substances [unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin, triglycerides (using Intralipid and avian TRIG), and hemoglobin] were spiked into two pools of human serum samples. The calcium concentrations of the two pools were $6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Two chelated Gadolinium contrast agents were also tested for interference, gadodiamide (Omniscan) and gadoversetamide (Optimark). Unspiked aliquots served as the control, and the analysis was performed using an ADVIA 1650 analyzer. The sponsor claims no significant interference if the $\%$ recovery is $< 1 0 \%$ between the tested and the control samples. Percent recoveries ranged from 100 to $1 0 9 . 8 \%$ . No significant interference was observed for the following levels of interferents:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed using 172 serum samples ranging from $1 . 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $1 5 . 5 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 50 urine samples ranging from 1.15 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $2 5 . 7 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Two serum samples were excluded for not being within the measuring range of the assay. The studies were performed on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer using the CA_2 assay (new device) and the CA assay (predicate).

The regression correlation is summarized as follows:

ADVIA 1650 CA_2 (Candidate Device $\mathbf { \mu } = \mathbf { y }$ ) vs. ADVIA 1650 CA (Predicate Device ${ \bf \mu } = { \bf x } { \bf \dot { \sigma } }$ )

b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was performed using 25 paired serum and Liheparinized plasma samples containing calcium across the assay range.

Samples above the normal reference range were spiked. Testing was performed using one ADVIA 1650 analyzer on one reagent lot over 2 days.

One sample was beyond the range of the assay and was excluded from the calculations.

The linear regression correlations are summarized as follows (plasma ${ \mathbf { \mu } } = { \mathbf { y } } _ { \mathrm { : } }$ , serum ${ \mathbf { \mu } } = { \mathbf { \mu } } _ { \mathbf { X } } { \dot { \mathbf { \sigma } } }$ ):

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The serum/plasma reference range was determined by using 148 serum samples from apparently healthy adult volunteers (77 females and 71 males). The samples were assayed in duplicate on the ADVIA 1650 system using one reagent lot with non-parametric analysis to calculate the values at the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile. These results show that 95 percent of specimens fell within the calcium concentrations of $8 . 7 - 1 0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 2 . 1 8 - 2 . 6 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , with samples ranging from $8 . 5 - 1 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 2 . 1 3 - 2 . 7 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ). Since the equivalency between serum and plasma samples with the CA_2 method was shown in a matrix comparison study (section M.2.b), this reference range applies to both serum and plasma samples.

For urine ranges, a literature reference was used (Tietz NW. Clinical Guide to Laboratory Tests. Third Edition. Philadelphia, PA: WB Saunders Company; 1995:102-105). Expected results are as follows:
