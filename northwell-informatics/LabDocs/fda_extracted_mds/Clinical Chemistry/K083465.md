G. Device Description:

Dimension Vista® (CKI) Flex® Reagent Cartridge (K2038) In a coupled enzyme reaction, the creatine kinase in patient samples catalyzes the transphosphorylation of phosphate from creatine phosphate to adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) producing adenosine-triphosphate (ATP). Hexokinase (HK) phosphorylates glucose from the ATP to phosphorylate glucose. The resulting glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) with the simultaneous reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The rate of formation of NADPH is directly proportional to the CK activity in the sample and is measured bichromatically at 340 and 540 nm.

# Dimension Vista® (MBI) Flex® Reagent Cartridge (K2032)

The activity of the CK-MM isoenzyme is inhibited by an antibody specific for the CK-M subunit. The activity of the B subunit of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme is not inhibited, and it is on this basis that CK-MB can be measured.

In an enzyme coupled reaction, creatine kinase in patient samples catalyzes the transphosphorylation of creatine phosphate to adenosine-diphosphate (ADP), producing adenosine-triphosphate (ATP). Hexokinase (HK) uses the ATP to phosphorylate glucose. The resulting glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) with the simultaneous reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to NADPH.

The rate of formation of NADPH is measured bichromatically at 340, 540 nm and is directly proportional to CK-B activity in the sample

H. Intended Use:

Dear Mr. Carrio:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IⅢI (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
