# Introduction:

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to submitter's previously cleared device. The modifications do not affect the intended use of the device or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. The major modifications are the addition of an automatic code identification feature, and the user interface applications: alarms and post-meal flagging.

Date Summary was Prepared: November 6, 2008

# Device Name:

Trade name: CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System Common Name: Blood Glucose Test System Classification Name: Class II, 862.1345 Glucose Blood Tester

# Predicate Device:

We claim substantial equivalence to submitter's previously cleared CareSens Blood Glucose Monitoring System ("CareSens BGMS")

systems by i-SENS, Inc. (k080923) and the OneTouch® Ultra® Blood Glucose Monitoring System by LifeScan, Inc. (k024194).

# Device Description:

CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System ("CareSens N BGMS") is an in vitro diagnostic device designed to measure the concentration of glucose in capillary whole blood with CareSens N Test Strips. The CareSens N model consists of the CareSens N meter (Model GM505IA, GM505IB, GM505IC: IA, IB and IC indicates the color of the devices, respectively, black, white, and light blue.), CareSens N test strips, and CareSens control solutions for two different glucose concentration ranges (called "Normal" and "Middle" ranges), lancing device, lancets, user manual, quick reference guide and a logbook.

# Comparison to Submitter's Previously Cleared Device (k080923):

The glucose measurement test principle: same as CareSens BGMS Intended Use: same as CareSens BGMS Fundamental scientific technology: same as CareSens BGMS

# Modifications:

Automatic code identification by the meter through detection of a marked pattern on each strip, so that the user does not input code information.

For the meter, the only difference is the addition of code identification sensors in the meter, while all other major elcctronic components are the same as thosc of CareSens BGMS. Please refer to Page 3 of Section 10 Specifications for details.

For the strip, the only difference is printing code-specific marks on the back side of each strip with infrared absorbing ink, while all the reagent components and mcasurement process are the same as those of CareSens BGMS. Please refcr to Page1 1 of Section 10 Specifications for details.

Alarms (Three time set alarms, and 2-hour post meal alarm) Post-meal flagging of test results Number of Buttons on the meter is three

Since for CareSens N, the glucose measurement test principle, intended usc, and fundamental scientific technology are the same as the submitter's unmodified device (k080923), there is no reason to expect that the performance would be different, but most of the performance evaluation tests done for the unmodified device were repeated to confirm that performance still satisfies the acceptance criteria. For performance evaluation, the following summary table shows the tests that were repeated.

Additionally, the substantial equivalence report for comparison to OneTouch $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Ultra $\textcircled{8}$ is provided in Section 11.

Dear Hyun Joon Oh:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k).premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate coinmerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device s classified(see above)into either lass II (Special Controls)or lass II (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must coly with al he Act' requirements, including, but ot lmited o: regstration and listg (1 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number (if known): K083468

Device Name: CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indication For Use: The CareSens N Meter is used for the quantitative measurement of glucose level in capillary whole blood as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management at home or in clinical settings. CareSens N Blood Glucose System should be used only for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). Do not use the system for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes. Testing sites include the traditional fingertip testing along with alternate sites testing on forearm, palm, thigh and calf.

CareSens N Test Strip is used with the CareSens N Blood Glucose Meter for quantitatively measuring glucose in capillary whole blood. The CareSens N Test Strip is intended for selftesting outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). Do not use the system for the diagnosis of diabetes without the guidance of healthcare professional. Testing sites include the traditional fingertip testing along with alternate sites testing on forearm, palm, thigh and calf.

CareSens Control A&B Solutions are a red liquid to check that both the meters and test strips are working together properly. It contains a known range of glucose as written on the bottle.
