K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: The control is traceable to an $8 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ standard of NIST Standard Reference Material 917b as analyzed using a commercially available chemistry analyzer. The $8 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ standard was manufactured in accordance with the NIST “Instructions for Use as a Standard in Clinical Applications” which accompanies the certificate of analysis for SRM917b.

Stability:

Stability testing protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The product has a closed-vial stability developed through real-time testing of 24 months at $2 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open-vial stability is 90 days after opening at $2 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , but should not exceed the printed expiration date.

Value Assignment:

The control lot is tested using a commercially available clinical chemistry analyzer with an expected value of $8 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Value assignment protocols for the FreeStyle and FreeStyle Lite blood glucose monitors involve repeat testing to obtain the mean value. The assigned range is based upon a percentage of the obtained mean. The expected results may vary slightly with each lot. The expected range is listed in the product insert for both the FreeStyle and FreeStyle Lite blood glucose monitors. In addition, the product insert for this device alerts the user to use the range indicated in this control’s product insert rather than the range provided in the glucose test strip product’s insert that applies to another commercially available control material.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not Applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
