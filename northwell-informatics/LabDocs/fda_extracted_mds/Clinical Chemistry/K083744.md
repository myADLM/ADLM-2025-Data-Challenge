# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

Ine BinaxNOW® Malaria Positive Control is a recombinant antigen control containing a mixture of HRP I (histidine-rich protein ), which s specic or Plasmodium falciparum.. and a pan-alarial protein. The source of the cloned nucleic acid regions was Plasmodium falciparum DNA. The BinaxNOw® Malaria Positive Control can be used as a quality control sample representative of a positive test result and to verify proper performance of the procedure and reagents of the BinaxNOw Malaria test, when it is used in accordance with the BinaxNOw® Malaria test product instructione

The BinaxNOw® Malaria Positive Control is supplied lyophilized and is reconstituted using deionized water. The reconstituted control is then added to a pool of presumed negative EDTA human whole blood for use in the BinaxNOw® Malaria Test. When run on the BinaxNOW® Malaria Test, the positive control should always generate positive results on both the P.. specific (HRP ) test ine and on the pan malarial test line. This demonstrates that the test reagents are working as expected and that the operator performed the test procedure correctly.

# INTENDED USE

Ine BinaxNOw Malaria Positive Control is intended for use as an assayed positive external quality control with the qualitative BinaxNow® Malaria Test. It is designed for routine use to aid in veriying proper performance of the procedure and the antigen detection reagents of the BinaxNow® Malaria

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS COMPARED TO PREDICATE DEVICE

Yov v Ivialaria Positive Control and the predicate Bio-Rad Laboratories (Blackhawk BSystems, Inc.) CryptoTro!™utilize different matrices and forms. The BinaxNOw® Malaria Positive Control uses recombinant malaria antigens and is supplied lyophilized, while the Bio-Rad CryptoTrol™ conrol utilizes purified C. neoformans antigens and is supplied in liquid form.Both controls are used in qualitative antigen detection tests for quality control purposes.

# PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

oapity Studies have been performed to determine the stability and shelf life of the' BinaxNOw® Malaria Positive Control in both its lyophilized (closed vial) form and its reconstituted (open vial) form. Product claims are as follows:

Lyophilized (closed vial) form: 5 months when stored at 2-8°C. Reconstituted (open vial) form: 5 months when stored at -20°C. Real time studies will be on-going to support and extend the shelf-life of this product.

Dear Ms. Jepson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
