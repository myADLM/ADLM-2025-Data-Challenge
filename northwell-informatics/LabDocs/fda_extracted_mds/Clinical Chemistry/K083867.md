# Intended Use:

The Access SHBG assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. The Access Sex Hormone Binding Globulin assay is indicated for use in the assessment of androgen disorders.

The Access SHBG Calibrators are intended to calibrate the Access SHBG assay for the quantitative determination of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems.

The Access SHBG QC is intended for monitoring system performance of the Access SHBG assay.

# Device Description:

The Access SH8G assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic ("sandwich") assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with paramagnetic particles coated with anti-SHBG antibody. During incubation, the SHBG antigen in the sample binds to the immobilized anti-SHBG antibody on the solid phase. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-SHBG antibody is then added and reacts with a different antigenic site on the SHBG molecule. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of SHBG in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

A polynomial regression of all imprecision data (4 samples spanning the range of the assay), provides an overall estimation of the imprecision. Data was further analyzed utilizing linear modeling plotting the log of the sample concentration by the log of the standard deviation, as shown in the following table, and determining the upper limit of $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of this regression fit.

# Analytical Sensitivity:

Limit of Blank (Analytical Sensitivity) Limit of Blank (LoB) for Access SHBG was determined to be 0.017 nmol/L. LoB was tested using a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A. The $9 7 . 5 \%$ upper confidence limit of this estimate was determined as LoB.

Limit of Detection   
Limit of Detection (LoD) of Access SHBG assay was determined to be 0.33 nmol/L, based on the lowest level sample where the beta-percentile (defined as the percentage of observations below LoB) was $5 \%$ or less. The LoD study was run under a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A.

Dilution Recovery (Linearity): Dilution recovery studies were performed by diluting three serum samples at 206.58 nmol/L (sample 1), 35.81 nmol/L (sample 2), and 2.90 nmol/L (sample 3) respectively, with Access Wash Buffer II. Sample mean recovery values were $103 \%$ Mean Recovery for sample 1, $101 \%$ Mean Recovery for sample 2. and $100 \%$ Mean Recovery for sample 3.

# Methods Comparison (External Site):

A comparison of 158 values, with a range of observations of 5.7-184.5 nmol/L, using the Access SHBG assay on the UniCel Dxl 800 immunoassay system and a commercially available enzyme immunoassay system gave the following statistical data using Passing Bablok calculations:

Intercept $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval $) = 1 . 8 4$ (0.54-3.00) nmol/L Slope $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval) $= 1 . 0 9$ (1.06-1.12) Correlation Coefficient $( r ^ { 2 } ) { = } 0 . 9 4$

Analytical Specificity: There was no significant interference from compounds tested based on EP7-A2. Compounds include Acetaminophen, Acetylsalicylic acid, Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), conjugated and unconjugated Bilirubin, Cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, 5α-dihydroxytestosterone, Hemoglobin, Heparin, Human serum albumin (HSA), Ibuprofen, Estradiol, GAS6, Laminin, Multivitamin supplement, Protein S, Testosterone, Thyroglobulin (Tg), Thyroxine-binding Globulin (TBG), Transferrn, Triglycerides (Intralipid).

Additionally, there was no cross-reactivity for molecules tested based on EP7- A2. Molecules include Alpha-Fetoprotein, Cortisol, 5α-dihydroxytestosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, Estradiol, GAS6, Laminin, Protein S, Testosterone, Thyroglobulin (Tg), Thyroxine-binding Globulin (TBG), Transferrin.

Stability: SHBG reagents are stable for 28 days after opening, calibrators are stable for 28 days after opening, and controls are stable for 28 days after opening. The calibration curve is stable for 28 days.

# Conclusion

As summarized above the Access SHBG, SHBG Calibrators, and SHBG QC on the Access Immunoassay Systems are substantially equivalent to the DPC Immulite SHBG assay for the measurement Sex Hormone Binding Globulin in serum or plasma. Substantial equivalence for the reagent and calibrators has been demonstrated as recommended by the FDA guidance for Industry "Format for Traditional and Abbreviated $5 1 0 ( k ) \ s ^ { \prime \prime }$ (Issued on August 12, 2005) and for controls as recommended by the FDA Guidance for Industry "Points to Consider Document on Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material" (Draft Guidance released for comment on February 3, 1999).

Dear Mr. Foutch:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
