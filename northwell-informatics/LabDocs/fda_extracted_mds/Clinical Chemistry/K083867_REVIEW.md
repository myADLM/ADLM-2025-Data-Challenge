# L. Test Principle:

The Access SHBG assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with paramagnetic particles coated with anti-SHBG antibody. During incubation, the SHBG antigen in the sample binds to the immobilized anti-SHBG antibody on the solid phase. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-SHBG antibody is then added and reacts with a different antigenic site on the SHBG molecule. After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added and the light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of SHBG in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

All performance characteristics were performed on the UniCel DxI 800 analyzer.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the proposed device was evaluated using a method based on the guideline CLSI EP5-A2 using 4 patient samples. Sample 1 was a serum pool, partly depleted with anti-SHBG paramagnetic particles.

Sample 2 and 3 were unaltered serum pools. Sample 4 was pooled serum spiked with human SHBG. The samples were assayed in duplicate, twice a day (2 runs per day) for 20 days over a 28 day period for a total of 480 measurements per sample. Three separate pack lots and 2 Access UniCel $\mathrm { D x l } 8 0 0$ instrument were used for the study. The results are summarized below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were performed using 3 serum samples. Sample 1 was spiked with human SHBG to approximately $2 0 0 \mathrm { n M }$ . Sample 2 was an unaltered sample with approximately $3 5 \mathrm { n M }$ SHBG. Sample 3 was partly depleted with anti-SHBG paramagnetic particles to approximately 3nM SHBG. At least 6 serial dilutions were prepared from each sample using Access Wash Buffer II. Each dilution was tested in 4 replicates; neat sample concentrations were determined as the mean of 8 replicates. The data was analyzed using linear and quadratic models. The quadratic fit was found to be significant. Therefore, the degree of non linearity was assessed by calculating the $\%$ difference between the linear and non-linear model at each concentration. The results are summarized below:

Based upon the linearity study and the limits of detection, the claimed measuring range is 0.33 to $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

The package insert states:

Samples can be accurately measured within the analytical range of   
the lower limit of detection $( 0 . 3 3 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ and the highest   
calibrator value (approximately $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ ). If a sample contains less than the lower limit of detection for the assay, report the results as less than that value (i.e., $< 0 . 3 3$ nmol/L). If a sample contains more than the stated value of the highest Access SHBG Calibrator (S5), report the result as greater than the value of the highest calibrator. Alternatively, dilute one volume of sample with 9 volumes of Wash Buffer II.

High-dose hook effect: The potential for a high-dose hook effect was evaluated using one patient sample spiked to approximately 49,500 nmol/L SHBG and a second sample obtained by dilution an SHBG stock solution in serum to create a sample with approximately $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ SHBG. The relative light units at $4 9 { , } 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ and at $8 6 3 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ did not fall below the relative light units generated by the highest SHGB calibrator (S5).

The product insert states:

The access SHBG assay does not demonstrate any “hook” effect up to $4 9 { , } 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Access SHBG calibrators (0, 3, 9, 27, 80 and 200 nmol/L) and controls (10 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ ) are traceable to WHO 95/560 reference material. They are sold separately.

Real-time stability including shelf-life and open vial stability studies were performed for the controls and calibrators. The study protocols and statistically calculated acceptance limits were reviewed and found to be acceptable. At the time of submission, the sponsor has demonstrated acceptable unopened shelf life of 12 months for the controls and calibrators when stored at 2 to $8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The sponsor has demonstrated acceptable open vial stability of 28 days for the calibrators and controls when stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Calibration Frequency: The calibration curve is stable for 28 days.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed in accordance to CLSI EP17-A. For LoB, 156 replicates of the S0 calibrator were measured. The $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the replicates was estimated using a non-parametric approach and the $9 7 . 5 \%$ upper confidence limit of this estimate was used to estimate the LoB. For LoD, 180 replicates of 5 low level samples were measured.

The LoB was estimated to be $0 . 0 1 7 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ The LoD was estimated to be 0.33 nmol/L

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference from various compounds was evaluated on serum samples containing approximately $1 3 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ and $1 4 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ SHBG. The sponsor defined noninterference as $< 1 0 \%$ deviation from the un-spiked samples.

To evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of various compounds whose structure is similar to SHBG the substances were spiked in the Access SHBG calibrator $80 \%$ cross reactivity was calculated as follows:

[(mean test value-mean control value) $\textbf { X } 1 0 0 ]$ /concentration of compound tested.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

To compare the performance of the Access SHBG assay to the predicate device, a total of 158 unaltered serum samples ranging from 5.7 to 184.5 nmol/L SHBG were assayed on both devices. The slope, intercept and confidence interval (CI) were determined using Deming regression; the correlation coefficient $( \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } )$ was determined by linear regression. The results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept (nmol/L) (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$r^{2 }$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>158</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.09 (1.06 to 1.12)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.84 (0.54 to 3.00)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.94</td></tr></table>

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

A comparison study was performed following the recommendations in CLSI EP14-A2 with a total of 61 matched serum and plasma (heparin)

samples. All samples were unaltered and ranged from approximately 10 to $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ SHBG. Serum samples were collected in plain and gel (SST) tubes. Samples were assayed in 3 replicates on one Access UniCel $\mathrm { D x l } 8 0 0$ instrument. The slope, bias, y-intercept and confidence intervals (CI) were determined using a Deming regression and the correlation coefficient $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { r } } ^ { 2 } )$ was determined by linear regression. The results are summarized in the tables below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope(95%CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept (nmol/L) (95%CI</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum gel vs. serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00 (0.97 to1.063)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.84 (-3.04 to -1.36)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.994</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plasma (heparin) vs.serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99 (0.97 to1.01)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.48 (-2.17 to 1.21)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996</td></tr></table>
