Device description: VALIDATE® THY Calibration Verification Test Sets are human serum based calibration verification / linearity materials containing multiple levels used to establish the relationship between theoretical operation and actual performance of the included analytes. Each test set consists of one bottle each of Levels 1 through 5. One bottle of Base Matrix is also included. There exists a linear relationship among Levels 1 through 5.

Intended use:Each-VALIDATE® THY-Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set consists óf two_sets_of bottles,a THY Set-and-a.ET4_Set. The THY set consists of five (5) levels of the following four analytes: triodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), human thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and cortisol, and the FT4 set consists of five (5) levels containing Free T4.

VALIDATE®THY Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set solutions are intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of linearity, calibration verification and verification of reportable range in automated, semi automated, and manual chemistry systems.

# Summary:

Dear Ms. Cressman:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
