JJX

PREDICATE DEVICES :

LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Control Set Reference K071480

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

# INTENDED USE:

The DiaSorin LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Calibration Verifiers are assayed quality control materials intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative verification of calibration and reportable range of the LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Assay when performed on the LIAISON® Analyzer.

# KIT DESCRIPTION:

The LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Calibration Verifiers consist of four human serum-based total vitamin D levels with buffer salts and sodium azide. Each vial contains $5 . 0 m L$ of ready to use liquid material. The set is provided with targeted total vitamin D concentrations. The individual Calibration Verifier concentrations were chosen to represent values closest to the important decision limits used to determine Vitamin D sufficiency status in individual patients.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

# REPRODUCIBILITY

Precision studies were conducted to verify the DiaSorin established performance of the LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Calibration Verifiers. Three Calibration Verifier lots were tested on 3 LIAISON® Analyzers.Each Caliration Verifer A-D) was test quadruplicate, one run per day for 5 days. CLSl EP15-A2 was consulted in the study design. The LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Controls were tested as daily quality control for the assay.

The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variance $( \% C V )$ for within run, between run, total by instrument, and overall were computed for each of the tested Calibration Verifiers.
