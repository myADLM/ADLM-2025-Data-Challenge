# Trade Name:

Neonatal Biotinidase kit

Common Name:

Neonatal Biotinidase kit

Classification Name:

System, Test, Biotinidase (21 CFR 862.1118/ Product Code NAK)

Predicate device:

Astoria-Pacific SPOTCHECK® Biotinidase 50-Hour Reagent Kit, (K010844)

# Device Description:

Biotinidase is found in the blood sample itself. Filter paper disks from newborn dried blood spot samples, calibrators and controls are punched into the wells of a microplate. When biotin substrate reagent containing biotin 6-aminoquinoline (6- AQ) is added to a well containing a punched dried blood spot, the reagent extracts and reconstitutes the proteins and enzymes in the spot. The biotinidase enzyme in the sample cleaves the substrate to biotin and fluorescent 6-AQ The addition of the ethanol stops the reaction and precipitates the proteins to cover the bottom of the well and the extracted spot. The fluorescent product (6-AQ) formed during the reaction is measured with a fluorometer. .The biotinidase activity is defined against a calibration curve. The biotinidase activity of the sample is determined by comparing the fluorescence intensity of the sample to a calibration curve.

# Intended Use:

The Neonatal Biotinidase kit is intended for the semiquantitative determination of biotinidase activity in blood specimens dried on filter paper as an aid in screening newborns for biotinidase deficiency.

# Device Comparison:

# Method Comparison

The method comparison was determined in accordance with NCCLS document EP9-A2.

The PerkinElmer Neonatal Biotinidase kit was compared with the Astoria-Pacific Biotinidase 50-Hour Reagent kit (k010844). The samples used in the study included 1516 newborn dried blood spot specimen representing US population analyzed as singlicates with the Neonatal Biotinidase kit and with a commercially available assay. The samples consisted of 1496 routine screening specimens and 20 retrospective specimens diagnosed positive for biotinidase deficiency. The cutoffs were determined according to each method's respective labeling $( 3 0 \%$ of mean $\pm 2$ SD for the Neonatal Biotinidase and $3 7 \%$ of the mean for predicate). All of the 20 clinically confirmed deficient samples were positive by both methods. The observed activities are shown in the following figure.
