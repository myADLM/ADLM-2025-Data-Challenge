# L. Test Principle:

The Neonatal Biotinidase kit is based on a semi-quantitative fluorometric assay. A schematic presentation of the BTD enzymatic reaction is shown below.

biotin 6-AQ \* Fluorescent product

6-AQ\* + biotin

BTD is found in the blood sample itself. Filter paper disks from newborn DBS samples, calibrators and controls are punched into the wells of a microplate. When biotin substrate reagent containing biotin 6-aminoquinoline (6-AQ) is added to a well containing a punched DBS, the reagent extracts and reconstitutes the proteins and enzymes in the spot. The BTD enzyme in the sample cleaves the substrate to biotin and fluorescent 6-AQ. The addition of the ethanol stops the reaction and precipitates the proteins to cover the bottom of the well and the extracted spot. The fluorescent product (6-AQ) formed during the reaction is measured with a fluorometer. The BTD activity of the sample is determined by comparing the fluorescence intensity of the sample to a calibration curve. The measurement is expressed as U. $1 \ \mathrm { U } = 1$ nmol of the end-product that is formed during one minute and in one deciliter of blood (1 nmol/min/dL).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the proposed device was determined according to CLSI EP5- A2. The variation of the assay was determined using DBS samples with 6 different activity levels, 3 kit lots, 3 instruments, and 3 operators. The study was performed on 20 separate measurement days. Each run included 4 replicates per sample level. A nested, balanced random effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to calculate the estimates of precision. The results are summarized below:

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP6-A. A regression analysis was performed with DBS samples ranging from 13.8 to $3 9 0 \mathrm { U }$ . The fitted regression model is: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 8 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 6 6$ $( \overline { { \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } } } = \overline { { 0 . 9 9 9 } } )$ where:

$\mathbf { y } =$ observed BTD activity $\mathbf { X } =$ expected observed BTD activity

The sponsor concluded that the assay is linear from $1 6 \mathrm { U }$ to $3 9 0 \mathrm { U }$ . The claimed measuring range is $1 6 \mathrm { U }$ up to the highest calibrator (nominal value approximately $3 5 0 \mathrm { U }$ ).

The package insert includes the following recommendations:

Samples that result in values below $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 6 U }$ are recommended to be reassayed as duplicates. If the values are still below the limit of detection, they are recommended to be reported as $" < 1 6 ~ \mathrm { U " }$ . The result should be considered positive [for biotinidase deficiency]. Sample values above the measuring range are reported as the activity of the highest calibrator of the kit. These samples should be considered negative [for biotinidase deficiency]. To accurately quantitate values above the calibration curve, another method should be used.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): There is no international reference preparation or reference method for BTD. The Neonatal Biotinidase Kits are traceable to commercially available 6-AQ. The BTD activity is assigned to the units using synthetically prepared reagent, 6-AQ (reaction end-product), as the gravimetric standard. The purity of the 6- AQ reagent is analyzed using quantitative $\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ -NMR.

Calibrators are prepared from porcine whole blood with a preservative spotted onto filter paper. Kit quality control materials are prepared from human blood (hematocrit adjusted to $5 5 \%$ ) with a preservative spotted onto filter paper.

Value Assignment: Each level of control and calibrator material is assayed multiple times on multiple fluorometers. The mean of the data obtained is calculated and presented in the quality control certificates for the calibrators and controls. The secondary calibrators (which are value assigned against the primary calibrators) are used to value assign the kit controls and calibrators. The SD presented for the controls is taken from the precision study performed to characterize the assay’s precision.

Real-time stability including shelf-life, transport, and in-use stability studies for the entire kit were performed, including the controls and calibrators. Additionally, accelerated stability studies were performed separately for the kit calibrators and controls.

The shelf life of the kit (including calibrators and controls) is 18 months when stored at -16 to ${ } _ { - 3 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Once opened, the calibrators and controls are stable for one month when stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The limits of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were determined according to CLSI EP17-A.

For the LoB, 180 measurements were carried out using 5 analyte-free DBS samples on filter paper. The limit of blank (LoB) was determined as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the ranked results. The LoB of the assay is $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ .

For the LoD, 48 measurements were carried out on each of 8 low level samples (DBS samples on filter paper). The LoD was defined as the lowest sample data where less than $5 \%$ of the values were below the LoB. The LoD of the assay is $1 6 \mathrm { U }$ . The $C V \%$ at this level was $< 1 0 \%$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The proposed device was evaluated for interference in accordance with CLSI document EP7-A2. Whole blood pools with approximate target BTD activities of 20, 55, 80 and $1 6 0 \mathrm { U }$ were used in the studies. The potential interfering compounds were added to the one set of blood pools to create the test pools. Solvent only was added to the other set of blood pools to create the control pools. The test and control pools were used to prepare DBS samples on filter paper. The following potential interfering compounds were evaluated:

To address the observed interference, the sponsor included the following black box warning, limitations and statement in the package insert:

Black box warning: This warning was included under the intended use statement, under “limitations of the assay” and in the “interference” section of the product insert.

Warning: Neonate albumin levels above normal (2.8 to $4 . 4 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ ) can interfere with this test by increasing biotinidase activity. This could result in the misclassification of a patient with a biotinidase result near the cutoff value as ‘normal’ when in fact, the patient should be classified as ‘deficient’. A patient with known or clinically suspected elevated blood albumin concentration should be screened with an alternative method and confirmed according to local requirements for follow-up testing.

Limitations: These statements were included under “limitations of the assay” and in the “interference” section of the product insert.

Kanamycin sulphate, glutathione, sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole, and trimethoprim can interfere with this test by increasing biotinidase activity. This could result in the misclassification of a patient with a biotinidase result near the cut-off value as ‘normal’ when in fact, the patient should be classified as ‘deficient’. Patients or mothers known to have received kanamycin sulphate, glutathione, sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole or trimethoprim should be screened with an alternative method and confirmed according to local requirements for follow-up testing.   
• Gammaglobulin ( $1 . 8 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ at biotinidase activity level of $5 5 \mathrm { ~ U ~ }$ and 1.5 $\mathrm { g / d L }$ at biotinidase activity levels of $^ { 8 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ and $1 6 0 \mathrm { U }$ ) caused a decrease in biotinidase activity. This could result in a false positive result (biotinidase deficient) in normal patients with biotinidase values near the cut-off value. However no interference was observed with gammaglobulin (6 $\mathrm { { g } / \mathrm { { d L } ) } }$ at a biotinidase activity level of $^ { 2 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ . Triglycerides (Intralipid at $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for biotinidase activity levels of 55 U and $^ { 8 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ , $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at biotinidase activity of $^ { 2 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at biotinidase activity of $1 6 0 \mathrm { U } )$ caused a decrease in biotinidase activity. This could result in a false positive result (biotinidase deficient) in normal patients with biotinidase values near the cut-off value. Biotin $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ at biotinidase activity level of $5 5 \mathrm { ~ U ~ }$ caused a decrease in biotinidase activity. This could result in a false positive result (biotinidase deficient) in normal patients with biotinidase values near the cut-off value.   
• Ampicillin $\mathrm { 0 . 5 6 \ m g / d L ) }$ , penicillin G potassium ( $1 8 . 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), sodium phenobarbital $( 5 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and phenytoin $( 1 . 8 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ at biotinidase activity level of $1 6 0 \mathrm { U }$ caused an increase in response, whereas no interference was observed at biotinidase levels of $^ { 2 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ , $5 5 \mathrm { ~ U ~ }$ and $^ { 8 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ . Valproic acid $( 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ at biotinidase activity levels of $^ { 8 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ and $1 6 0 \mathrm { U }$ caused an increase in response, whereas no interference was observed at biotinidase activity levels of $^ { 2 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ and $5 5 \mathrm { ~ U ~ }$ .

Statement: This statement was included in the “interference” section of the product insert.

The following substances were found not to interfere at the concentrations indicated; adreno-corticotropic hormone $( 1 5 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ , ampicillin (2.8 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for biotinidase activities of 20 U, $5 5 \mathrm { ~ U ~ }$ and $8 0 \mathrm { U }$ ), ascorbic acid (3 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ), biotin $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ for biotinidase activities of 20 U, $^ { 8 0 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ and 160 U), conjugated bilirubin $( 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , unconjugated bilirubin $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ,

The positive percent agreement was $9 0 . 9 \%$ (20/22) and the overall percent agreement was $9 9 . 8 \%$ $( { 2 0 + 1 4 9 3 } ) / 1 5 1 6 )$ .

$b$ . Matrix comparison: Not applicable. The device should only be used with neonatal whole blood spotted on filter paper obtained from heel prick.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off:

BTD deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A newborn with profound BTD deficiency is homozygous and usually has enzyme activity that is less than $10 \%$ of the average of the normal population and sometimes there is almost no activity at all. Newborns classified as having partial BTD deficiency are heterozygous and have intermediate levels of BTD activity, typically $1 0 -$ $30 \%$ of normal.

The proposed device was not designed to differentiate between partial and profound BTD deficiency. Therefore, the device has one cut-off that differentiates between ‘normal’ and ‘deficient’. The cut-off of the proposed device determined in the submission and recommended in the package insert is 30 $\%$ of the mean of the distribution of BTD activity of a normal newborn population $\pm 2$ SD.

The package insert states that samples with BTD activities below the chosen cutoff should be considered as presumptive positive. These samples should be reanalyzed with a different method and confirmed according to local requirements for follow-up testing.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The distribution of BTD activity of a normal newborn population (USA) was established using the proposed device by determining the BTD activity of 1496 routine newborn specimens in a neonatal screening laboratory. The following descriptive statistics and percentile cut-offs are included in the package insert:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Activity</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Range</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Mean</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Median</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=5>Lower percentiles</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Proposed (U)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1496</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>31.5 - 388</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>163.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>160.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>62.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>70.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>85.9</td></tr></table>

The package insert includes precautionary language that each laboratory should establish its own cut-off values and that cut-offs based on data collected with any other BTD assay should not be used.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
