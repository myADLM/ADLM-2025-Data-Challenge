# L. Test Principle:

The FORA G30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses electrochemical methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose level using an amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor’s precision studies were based on ISO 15197 and CLSI EP5-A recommendations. The within-run precision study samples used were venous blood (hematocrit range $3 8 \% - 5 4 \%$ ) spiked with dextrose to create 5 levels of blood glucose. Three lots of test strips and 10 meters were used in the study, with 10 tests performed on each meter for a total of 100 tests per blood glucose level.

The results are as follows:

The day-to-day run precision study samples used were glucose control solutions. Low, medium, and high levels were used. Three lots of test strips and 10 meters were used in the study, with 1 test performed on each meter per day for 10 days, for a total of 100 tests per control level.

The results are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Samples</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No. of Tests</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>StandardDeviation(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Coefficient ofVariation (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>82.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.51</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.04</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Medium Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>145.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.09</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.13</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>334.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.61</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor indicated that the linearity study protocol was developed according to CLSI EP6-A. The candidate device was tested to verify linearity of the system using blood samples with glucose concentrations between $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . Venous blood samples were used. Samples were spiked with dextrose in order to create nine glucose levels (20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 200, 320, 420, $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Testing was performed using the FORA G30 meter (candidate device) and the YSI-2300 glucose analyzer (reference method). Two lots of test strips were used in the study with 5 tests per lot performed on each meter, for a total of 10 tests per blood glucose level.

The stated reportable range of the meter is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$

The results are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Linear Regression</td><td>Correlation coefficient (R2)</td></tr><tr><td>y = 0.9819x + 1.9316</td><td>0.9997</td></tr></table>

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The FORA G30 system (including meter and test strips) has an operating environment of $1 0 - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and relative humidity below $8 5 \%$ . Performance testing supports this range. The system was also tested in extreme conditions to determine if it could operate correctly in its indicated range after being exposed to harsher conditions. Temperature exposure limits of the system were determined to be $^ { - 2 0 - }$ $6 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ , and humidity exposure limits of $5 - 9 5 \%$ relative humidity. Drop tests and vibration tests were also performed on the device.

Test strips were examined using accelerated stability studies to determine unopened shelf life. The sponsor currently has real time stability testing to support unopened shelf life of the test strips for 12 months when stored between $4 - 4 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ . In-use stability of the test strips is 90 days after the first opening.

In-use stability of the glucose control solution (cleared under k041107) is 90 days after the first opening when stored between $2 - 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the system is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b.).

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Interference Study:

The sponsor indicated that the interference study protocol was developed according to CLSI EP7-A. Blood samples were collected in an anti-coagulant (Li-EDTA) vacuum tube from seven volunteers, and glucose levels were adjusted to a low $( 7 5 { - } 8 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and a high $( 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ level using the YSI 2300 as a reference instrument. The percent bias caused by various interferences must be less than $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Interferents causing a bias greater than $10 \%$ are examined using a dose-response test to interpolate the concentration at which $10 \%$ bias would be observed.

# Altitude Study:

An altitude study was performed on a mountain in Wuling, Taiwan with an elevation of 10,744 ft. The capillary blood glucose results of 20 volunteers were tested using the FORA G30 meter at high altitude and compared to the Roche Accu-Chek meter at high altitude. The results of this study are acceptable: $9 5 \%$ of the measurements must have a deviation less than $20 \%$ at $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and less than $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $< 7 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# Hematocrit Study:

To test accuracy due to the hematocrit effect, venous blood samples were collected in an anti-coagulant (Li-EDTA) vacuum tube, and glucose levels were adjusted to the following ranges; $4 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $7 0 { - } 1 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 2 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $2 4 0 { - } 2 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $4 2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 4 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $4 8 0 { - } 5 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were then adjusted to hematocrit levels of $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $60 \%$ . The YSI 2300 was used as the reference method.

The results of the hematocrit study were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

2. Comparison studies: a. Method comparison with predicate device:

# Reference Method Comparison:

This study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP9-A and ISO 15197. Three clinical sites were used with 122 total patients (with samples ranging from 35 to 522 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ). Samples below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were obtained by allowing patient samples to glycolize, and then spiked to the appropriate level. Samples above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were spiked. Health care professionals tested capillary whole blood using the FORA G30 (the candidate device) and the YSI 2300 (the reference method) and each site met the ISO 15197 standard where ninety-five percent $( 9 5 \% )$ of the individual glucose results shall fall within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of the results at glucose concentrations $< 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 2 0 \%$ at glucose concentrations $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

A Clarke error grid analysis was also presented; $9 9 \%$ (121/122) of results fall in zone A – clinically accurate. $1 \%$ (1/122) fall in zone B - deviating from the reference method by more than $20 \%$ but would lead to benign or no treatment. These results are the same for both the FORA G30 and the Clever Chek TD-4230.

# Alternate Site Testing Comparison:

This study was performed in accordance with NCCLS EP9-A and ISO 15197. 120 lay users at 3 different locations tested themselves using each alternate site with the FORA G30 blood glucose meter. Lay users were given the user manual in English, and were given no additional instructions. The lay user then obtained a fingertip blood sample, and the fingertip glucose result was compared to the AST glucose result.

The results are as follows:
