# G.Device Description:

The Dimension Vista® ECREA Flex® reagent cartridge is a prepackaged in-vitro diagnostic test method that is specifically designed to be used on the Dimension Vista@ System. The reagents contained in the Dimension Vista® ECREA Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EY reagent cartridge are: Reagent 1 - TAPS buffer, creatinase, sarcosine oxidase, HTIB; Reagent 2 - TAPS buffer, creatininase, horseradish peroxidase, 4- aminophenazone, and potassium hexacyanoferrate (II).

The Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ECREA CAL is an ECREA CAL is a liquid, bovine serum albumin, based product containing creatinine. The kit consists of six vials, three vials per level (A, B), $2 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ per vial. Description of the manufacturing, value assignment and stability testing process are provided in this submission report.

# H. Intended Use:

The ECREA method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of creatinine in human serum, plasma and urine on the Dimension Vista $\otimes$ System. Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for other urine analytes.

The ECREA CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the Enzymatic Creatinine (ECREA) method on the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System.
