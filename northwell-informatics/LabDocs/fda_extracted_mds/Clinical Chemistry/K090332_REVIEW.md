• CLSI EP-07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, 2005   
• CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Methods, 2003

# L. Test Principle:

The sample (whole blood) is drawn by capillary action at the tip of the test strip. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose oxidase (GOD) and Hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride in the test strip. This produces Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride. Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride is produced in proportion to the glucose concentration of the blood sample. Oxidation of the Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride produces an electric current. The meter converts the current to the glucose concentration and displays it as the test result:

β-D-glucose + Hexammineruthenium (III) chloride GOD D-Glucono-δLactone $^ +$ Hexammineruthenium (II) chloride   
Hexammineruthenium (II) chloride Hexammineruthenium (III) chloride + e

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Testing was performed consistent with ISO 15197 using fresh venous whole blood obtained from several non-diabetic volunteers and adjusted to a pO2 of 60 to ${ 8 0 } \mathrm { m m H g }$ and hematocrit of $42 \%$ . The whole blood was spiked to obtain 5 glucose concentrations encompassing the $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ range.

Within-Day precision tests consisted of 10 measurements of each of the five spiked whole blood glucose samples using 10 meters for each sample for a total of 500 measurements. The within-run precision for all meters and concentrations tested was as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose Conc.(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard Deviation(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Coefficient ofVariation (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>41.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.33</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.67</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>83.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.85</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.41</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>125.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.08</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.47</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>208.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.97</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>344.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10.64</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.09</td></tr></table>

The Day to Day precision testing was performed using three glucose levels of control solutions; ten individual users performed this evaluation using ten meters over a period of ten days. This was repeated with three lots of test strips. A total of nine hundred test strips were used from more than ten vials of each of the three different lots of the test strips.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range of the device is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . A linearity study was conducted consistent with CLSI EP6-A using venous whole blood collected in a $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ vacuum sample tube. Glucose was adjusted to 11 concentration levels ranging from 13 to $7 0 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (The Lo and Hi detection was disabled for this testing). Ten measurements were taken at each glucose concentration. The linear regression line for three lots was:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 9 2 6 \mathbf { x } + 2 . 6 , \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 5
$$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The controls supplied with this device were previously cleared under k053079.

Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have a twenty-four month life-span and a three month shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened.

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limit is $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . See linearity/assay reportable range above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

A total of 15 readings were taken for each glucose level and concentration of interferent (5 unique test strips per each of 3 lots). Three glucose levels were tested for each interferent including a low $\mathrm { ( 5 0 - 8 0 ~ m g / d L }$ range), medium $( 1 2 5 - 1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ range), and high $( 3 1 0 - 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ range). Bias was calculated as the mean difference in glucose reading between the test and control concentration groups.

Standard deviations and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean bias were also calculated. Percent bias was calculated as the bias divided by the mean glucose level at the control concentration. Standard deviations and $9 5 \%$ CIs for percent bias were also reported.

For glucose levels less than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the sponsor defined acceptable bias as when the lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI for bias $\mathrm { w a s } \geq - 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the upper bound w $\mathrm { \Omega / a s } \leq 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For glucose levels $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the sponsor defined acceptable bias as when the lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI for percent bias was $\ge - 1 0 \%$ and the upper bound was $\leq 1 0 \%$ .

Based on these criteria, the following substances were found to interfere:

Ascorbic Acid at $6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Dopamine at $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Ephedrine at $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Interferents are noted in the labeling as follows:

Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic concentrations, does not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high concentrations in blood may cause inaccurately high results.

Externally taken drugs dopamine and ephedrine will not interfere with blood glucose results when taken at therapeutic concentrations. However, abnormally high concentrations in blood may cause inaccurate results.

Using the same criteria, the following substances were found not to interfere:

Acetaminophen up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Acetyl-Salicylic Acid up to $6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Cholesterol up to $6 6 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# Altitude Study

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the Arkray Assure Pro meter using the new glucose strips. Venous blood was collected from a donor in a sodium heparin tube and allowed to undergo glycolysis at room temperature to lower the endogenous glucose to approximately $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sample was separated into 4 aliquots and spiked with glucose to levels of approximately 60, 125, 300 and $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . After spiking to obtain the 4 different levels, the glucose values were confirmed with the YSI glucose analyzer. The tests were performed at 967 feet and at 10,000 feet aboard an unpressurized small airplane. At each location, venous blood at each of the 4 levels of glucose was tested on the same test strip lot. The meter readings obtained at 10,000 feet were compared to the meter readings at sea level and the $\%$ bias was determined at each level.

Results recovered within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at blood glucose levels of $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\pm 1 5 \%$ at glucose levels $> 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when compared to the readings near sea level. The labeling states that the Arkray Assure Pro test strips can be used at elevations up to 10,000 feet above sea level.

# Hematocrit Study

The sponsor performed hematocrit studies comparing the Assure Pro result at various hematocrits across the glucose measuring range to the Assure Pro at a normal hematocrit and to a reference analyzer. Hematocrit levels tested were 30, 37, 42, 53, and $5 5 \%$ and glucose levels tested were approximately 26, 52, 69, 119, 172, 335, 437, and $5 1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . All of the comparisons to the reference analyzer and to a normal hematocrit showed a bias of less than $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at glucose concentrations less than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or less than $\pm 1 5 \%$ at glucose concentrations $\geq 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional reading.

2. Software: FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types. Yes ___X___ or No

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip

as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

The user is instructed to insert the code chip when the meter is turned off, and then to insert a test strip, which turns the meter on. The meter automatically detects the code number when a test strip is inserted. The user must check to see if the code number the meter displays matches the number on the test strip vial. If the number matches, the user is instructed to begin testing. If the number does not match, the user is instructed not to test and to call customer service. No other calibration is required from the user.

# 6. Quality Control:

Two levels of control are supplied with the device. Users are instructed to run controls when the meter is first used in order to verify that they can use the meter correctly. In addition they are instructed to run a control when a new vial of test strips is opened, when they suspect the meter or strips are not working correctly, if test results appear to be abnormally high or low, or are not consistent with the patient's symptoms, if the meter is dropped, to check their technique, if the test strip bottle had been left open or stored outside its recommended temperature range, or when the meter has been stored outside its recommended temperature range, and each time the batteries are changed.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling and states that the user manual, strip insert, and control insert are at an eighth grade reading level or below.
