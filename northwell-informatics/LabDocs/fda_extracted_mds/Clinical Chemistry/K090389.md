# 2.2. Safcty and Effectiveness Information

Predicate Device:   
Claim of Substantial Equivalence (SE) is made to EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K062538)   
Device Description: Based on an electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action, AP-1000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System only needs a small amount of blood. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and your blood glucose result is precisely and displayed in 6 seconds.

# − Intended Use:

The AP-1000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. Testing is done oulside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates.

The AP-1000 Meter is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. AP-1000 Blood Glucose Test Strips must be used with the AP-1000 Meter. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.

The AP-100o Blood Glucose Test Strips are intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. AP-1000 Blood Glucose Test Strips must be used with the AP-1000 Blood Glucose Meter. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). They are indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.

MAJOR Level I/Level II Control Solutions are for use with the AP-1000 meter and AP-1000 Blood Glucose Test Strips as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

# √ Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

Pre-clinical and clinical data are employed upon submission of this 510(K) premarket notification according to the Guidance Document_ for In Vitro Diagnostic Test System; Guidance for Industry and FDA document provided by CDRH/FDA.

# − Substantial Equivalence (SE)

A claim of substantial equivalence is made to EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K062538). Both of them have the same working principle and technologies. The differences are test time, coding method, test range, sample volume, meter dimension, weight, HCT range, and memory data number. Besides, the subject device is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger but the predicate device can test whole blood from the finger, forearm and palm. Thus the differences are due to the feature design aspects, not relating to the safety or effectiveness aspects. They are substantially equivalent.

Dear Ke-Min Jen:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class  (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical devicerelated adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
