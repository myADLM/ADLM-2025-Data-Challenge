# 7. Device Description

The LipidPro system is a device which combines measuring systems for total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride, and a blood glucose monitoring system into one convenient device. The glucose monitoring system function of the device utilizes Infopia's Evolution™M monitoring system cleared under K072369.

T L . The five types of the test strips are for total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), triglyceride (TG),a lipid profile (which combines TC, HDL-C, TG tests) and glucose test respectively. The four types of the control solutions are for total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and glucose test respectively.

LDL value is calculated from TC, HDL-C, and TG values using the following numerical formula. When TG is over $3 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , LDL is not calculated.

Lpirglucoe  ystem  denical the VTI gucoe est sstem cleareun K072369. LipidPro glucose test strip is the same as the EVOLUTION glucose test strip except the cprit desThe ize net re he same.Lipigucse st met s enl t the EVUTO glucose st meter except the exteal desig and having a lpid proile (TC/TG/HDL-C) test part on the other side of the meter. This does not affect to the safety and effectiveness for glucose test and data.

The test range of LipidPro™ system is 100-400mig/dL for total cholesterol, $2 5 { \cdot } 8 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for HDLcholesterol, $7 0 { \cdot } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for Triglyceride and $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ for glucose. LDL cholesterol should be estimated from measurement of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.

LipidPro™ system has two kinds of test principle according to test items: one for glucose and the other for a lipid profile (TC, HDL-C, and TG).

Lipid profile test results are based on reading reflection density. When the blood is applied, the color changes in test area through an enzyme reaction. The meter records this change in color and converts the measurement signal to the displayed result using the data previously entered via the code. The deeper the color is, the higher the lipid level is.

Glucose in the blood sample will react to the electrodes in the gucose test strip, generating an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is measured by LipidPro™ meter and displayed as your blood glucose result.

# 8. Intended Use

LipidPro system is intended for in home (self-testing) or health care professionals and for testing measures total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and glucose in capillary whole blood.

Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. Lipoprotein measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders (such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis and various liver and renal diseases.Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid metabolism, r various endocrine disorders. Calculated LDL-cholesterol values are reported only when triglycerides are $\leq 3 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; when triglycerides are $> 3 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , calculated LDL-cholesterol are not reported.

Glucose measurement is for the quantitative measurement of the concentration of glucose in capillary whole blood that can be taken from the fingertip, ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm, forearm, calf and/or thigh by diabetic patients or health care professionals as an aid in the management of diabetes. Glucose measurement is not to be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternate site testing should be done during steady- state times when glucose is not changing rapidly.

LipidPro™M Total Cholesterol control solution, HDL-cholesterol control solution, Triglyceride control solution, and Glucose control solution are used to test the precision of the LipidPro™ system and to detect systematic analytic deviations that may arise from reagent or analytical variation and they are for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only.) LipidPro control solutions are intended fr in home and health care professionals use.

# 9. Comparison of Technological Characteristics with Predicate

Device Name: LipidPro™ system (ILM-0001A), LipidPro™ Total cholesterol (TC) control , ipiHi ensy o holesol cno solutn, Lipi Triglyceride (TG) control solution and LipidPro™ Glucose control solution

# Indication For Use:

LipidPro™ system is intended for in home (self-testing) or health care professionals and for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). LipidPro™ system which consists of meter and test strips, measures total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and glucose in capillary whole blood.

Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. Lipoprotein measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders (such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis and various liver and renal diseases. Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid metabolism, or various endocrine disorders. Calculated LDLcholesterol values are reported only when triglycerides are $\leq 3 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; when triglycerides are $>$ $3 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , calculated LDL-cholesterol are not reported.

Glucose measurement is for the quantitative measurement of the concentration of glucose in capillary whole blood that can be taken from the fingertip, ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm, forearm, calf and/or thigh by diabetic patients or health care professionals as an aid in the management of diabetes. Glucose measurement is not to be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternate site testing should be done during steady- state times when glucose is not changing rapidly.
