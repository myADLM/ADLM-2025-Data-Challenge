# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below

2. Indication(s) for use:

LipidPro™ system is intended for in home (self-testing) or health care professionals and for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). LipidPro™ system which consists of meter and test strips, measures total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and glucose in capillary whole blood.

Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. Lipoprotein measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders (such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis and various liver and renal diseases. Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid metabolism, or various endocrine disorders. Calculated LDL-cholesterol values are reported only when triglycerides are $\leq$ $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; when triglycerides are $> 3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , calculated LDL-cholesterol are not reported.

Glucose measurement is for the quantitative measurement of the concentration of glucose in capillary whole blood that can be taken from the fingertip, ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm, forearm, calf and/or thigh by diabetic patients or health care professionals as an aid in the management of diabetes. Glucose measurement is not to be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternate site testing should be done during steady- state times when glucose is not changing rapidly.

LipidPro™ Triglyceride control solution

LipidPro™ Glucose control solution

LipidPro™ Total Cholesterol control solution, HDL-cholesterol control solution, Triglyceride control solution, and Glucose control solution are used to test the precision of the LipidPro system and to detect systematic analytic deviations that may arise from reagent or analytical variation and they are for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only.)

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For over-the-counter and prescription use

Not for neonatal use, not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

Critically ill patients should not be tested with blood glucose meters. Inaccurate results may occur in severely hypotensive individuals or patients in shock. Inaccurate low results may occur for individuals experiencing a hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis.

The sponsor has the following recommendation in the labeling:

“Use LipidPro™ system at the frequency your doctor recommends testing for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride.”

4. Special instrument requirements:

LipidPro™ meter

# I. Device Description:

The LipidPro™ test system consists of a meter, five types of test strips, and four types of control solutions. The five types of the test strips are for total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), a lipid profile (which combines TC, HDLC, and TG tests) and glucose test respectively. The four types of control solutions are for total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and glucose test respectively. LDL value is calculated from TC, HDL-C, and TG values using the

numerical formula: LDL $\ c =$ TC-HDL-(TG/5). When TG is over $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , LDL is not calculated.

# L. Test Principle:

LipidPro system has two different test principles: one for glucose and the other for the lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride)

The LipidPro blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the test strip. The blood sample is drawn into the end of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose oxidase and hexaammineruthenium chloride, generating a current that is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The result is shown on the meter display after 3 seconds.

The LipidPro profile test results are based on reading reflection density. When the blood is applied, the color changes in the test area through an enzyme reaction. The meter records this change in color and converts the measurement signal to the displayed result using the data previously entered via the code. The color changes are proportional to the lipid concentration in the sample. The result is shown on the meter display after 2 minutes.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

Total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN) as meeting the National Cholesterol Education Program’s (NCEP) performance criteria for accuracy and precision. CRMLN certifications for specific device is available at http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/crmln.htm

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI EP06-A guideline. Linearity was performed using the LipidPro meter and the LipidPro glucose test strips, total cholesterol test strips, HDL-cholesterol test strips, and triglyceride test strips.

i.) EDTA venous whole blood was spiked or glycolyzed to produce two levels of glucose concentrations (low and high level). These two glucose concentrations were mixed in proportion to create 12 glucose concentrations with equally spaced concentrations. A total of 14 glucose concentrations were prepared with glucose concentrations ranged from 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each concentration was tested five times by the LipidPro meter and in duplicate by the YSI 2300 analyzer. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the LipidPro method and the YSI method: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 8 3 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 9 6 7$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { = } 0 . 9 9 9 9$

ii.) EDTA venous whole blood samples were used to prepare two levels of concentrations (low and high level) of cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride. These two levels were then used to prepare four levels of intermediate concentrations. Each concentration was tested five times by the LipidPro meter and in duplicate by another laboratory method. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the LipidPro meter and the laboratory method. Results are summarized below:

For Total cholesterol: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 6 \mathrm { X } + 1 . 7 2 1 2$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 8$ , samples ranged from 100- $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

For HDL-cholesterol: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 7 8 \mathrm { X } + 1 . 7 7 9$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 4 6$ , samples ranged from 25-80 mg/dL

For Triglyceride: $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 0 0 2 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 7 0 0 5$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 9$ , samples ranged from 70-600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed that the glucose test is linear from $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ , total cholesterol test is linear from $1 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , HDLcholesterol test is linear from $2 5 { - } 8 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and triglyceride test is linear from 70- $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The LipidPro glucose measuring system is traceable to NIST SRM 917b reference material. Method comparison information demonstrated accuracy to YSI 2300 analyzer.

Infopia Co. has documented traceability to the NCEP’s recommended accuracy base for Total Cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol by performing a direct comparison with a

Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network laboratory using fresh human specimens which cover the NCEP medical decision points.

Triglyceride does not have a reference material; it is traceable to a commercially available laboratory method through an internal procedure.

There is no calibration required to perform the LipidPro lipid profile and glucose tests; however, a lot specific code is provided with each test strip. Calibrations were done inhouse and parameters were coded into the test strip. The user must check and make sure that the code number printed on the test strip vial matches the code number in the LipidPro meter before testing.

Value assignment:

The value assignment of the LipidPro control solutions were determined by an in-house procedure. The range of the control solutions was determined by assaying multiple runs of the control solutions on ten LipidPro meters. For total cholesterol control solution level 1 and 2, ranges were set at mean $\pm 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; for HDL-cholesterol control solution level 1 and 2, ranges were set at mean $\pm 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; for triglyceride control solution level 1 and 2, ranges were set at mean $\pm 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; for glucose control solution level 1, 2 and 3, ranges were set at the following:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose controlsolution level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Targetconcentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acceptablerange</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1 (low)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean ± 15mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2 (medium)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean ± 20%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3 (high)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean ± 15%</td></tr></table>

Real time stability was performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability of the control solutions and test strips for all the analytes measured (cholesterol, HDLcholesterol, triglyceride and glucose). Stability studies protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be adequate. The sponsor claimed that the unopened test strips have a 12 month shelf-life and are stable for 3 months after first use when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Unopened control solutions have a 12 month shelf life and are stable for 3 months after first use when stored at $8 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

i.) Endogenous and exogenous interferent effects:

An interference study was conducted to determine the effect of common interference substances based on the CLSI EP07-A guideline. Common interferences were evaluated by spiking venous blood with different analyte concentrations. Each of these concentrations was then spiked with the interfering compound at different concentrations to make the interference samples. Three levels of glucose concentrations (40, 160, and $3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and one level (around medical decisions point) of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides were tested. The $\%$ bias was calculated based on the differences between the spiked sample and the control sample. The sponsor defined no significant interference (NI) as bias $\leq \pm 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for glucose values $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ for glucose values $\mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { : } \geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for glucose test; bias $\leq 1 5 \%$ for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride. If there is interference detected, the substance will be listed as an interference (I) substance in the table below and in the package insert. Based on the data, the sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and concentrations listed in the table below:

ii.) Hematocrit effect:

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit on EDTA whole blood samples spiked with five hematocrit levels (20, 30, 40, 50, and $60 \%$ ) at eight glucose concentrations between $4 5 - 5 4 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was tested 15 times on the LipidPro meter. These values were compared to values from an YSI-2300 analyzer of plasma glucose values at the hematocrit of $40 \%$ (reference method). The sponsor defined no significant interference as bias of $\leq \pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for glucose values ${ < } 7 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\leq \pm 1 5 \%$ for glucose values $\geq 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The sponsor concluded that hematocrit between $30 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \%$ range did not show any significant hematocrit effect on the glucose results.

Another hematocrit study was performed using EDTA whole blood samples spiked with six hematocrit levels (30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and $5 5 \%$ ) at the following analytes concentrations: Four levels of cholesterol $( 1 3 2 - 2 8 3 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), five levels of HDLcholesterol $( 2 5 { - } 6 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and five levels of triglyceride ( $\mathrm { 7 4 - 3 5 5 m g / d L } )$ . Each sample was tested 15 times on the LipidPro meter. These values were compared to values from the laboratory method of analytes values at the hematocrit of $40 \%$ (reference method).

The sponsor concluded that hematocrit between $30 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \%$ range did not show any significant hematocrit effect $( < 5 \% )$ on the total-cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride results.

The sponsor states in their labeling that hematocrit levels less than $30 \%$ may cause falsely high reading and hematocrit levels greater than $5 5 \%$ may cause falsely low reading for all analytes.

iii.) Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the device can be used from 18 to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 6 4 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ relative humidity for all analytes measured. An altitude study was performed and demonstrated that meter performance for glucose was not significantly affected by altitudes $\leq 1 0 { , } 0 0 0$ feet.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

i.) For LipidPro glucose test:

One forty-seven layusers performed a fingerstick test using the LipidPro glucose measuring system (LipidPro meter and LipidPro glucose test strips). A healthcare professional then performed the test on the LipidPro glucose measuring system and the Evolution Blood Glucose Monitoring System (predicate device). A venous sample was obtained and plasma samples from these patients were performed on the Hitachi 747 analyzer (reference method). The range of glucose values for the fingerstick samples was $5 8 { \mathrm { - } } 4 8 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . In order to obtain sufficient samples in the lowest and highest concentration intervals, 13 glucose concentrations were adjusted by collecting blood in a heparin tube. Eight samples less than $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (33-48 mg/dL) were hydrolyzed and five samples greater than $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 5 1 1 - 5 6 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ were spiked with glucose. The linear regressions were as follows:

Between the lay user’s finger-stick and the venous samples:

Patient’s results on LipidPro (Y) vs Hitachi 747 (X):

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 8 9 \mathrm { X } + 3 . 3 3 6 0 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 6 7 , \mathrm { N } = 1 6 0
$$

Healthcare professional’s results on LipidPro (Y) vs Hitachi (X):

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 0 8 5 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 2 9 2 4 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 3 9 , \mathrm { N } = 1 6 0
$$

Based on the ISO Standard 15197 document, how well the LipidPro glucose measuring system when lay users tested themselves using a fingerstick sample as compared with the laboratory method is shown in the tables below:

Note: When meter results are compared to the laboratory results, results below 75 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ are compared in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

ii.) For LipidPro total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride tests:

Four hundred patients performed a fingerstick test using the LipidPro Total Cholesterol Testing System. A healthcare professional then performed the test on the LipidPro Total Cholesterol Testing System and the Cardiocheck System (predicate device). A venous sample was obtained and plasma samples from these patients were performed on the Architect c16000 analyzer (reference method). The same test protocol was used for the HDL-Cholesterol and Triglyceride testing

systems. The linear regressions were as follows:   
The range of total cholesterol values for these samples was $1 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Between the lay user’s finger-stick and the venous samples:   
Patient’s results on LipidPro (Y) vs Architect c16000 (X):

In addition, 259 patients performed a fingerstick test using the LipidPro lipid profile test strips on the LipidPro meter. A healthcare professional then performed the

same test on the LipidPro meter and the Cardiocheck System (predicate device). A venous sample was obtained and plasma samples from these patients were performed on the Abbott Architect c16000 analyzer (comparative method). The linear regressions of the lipid results were as follows:

iii.) Alternative testing sites for blood glucose measurement: Upper arm, forearm, calf, thigh, ventral palm and dorsal hand testing has been performed by the patients and the healthcare professionals to show comparable performance at times of steady state conditions. A venous whole blood sample was drawn at the same time and tested on the Hitachi 747 analyzer (comparative method). The range of glucose values for these samples was $6 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (by the finger), $\mathrm { N } { = } 1 5 0$ . The linear regressions were as follows:

# N. Instrument Name:

LipidPro™ meter

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings. There are two separate test strip insertion ports. The glucose strip measurement connector is at the top part of the meter and the lipid strip inserting part is at the bottom part of the meter. The glucose sample volume is $0 . 3 \mu \mathrm { l }$ while the lipid sample volume is $5 \mu \mathrm { l }$ .

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ____X____ or No _

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, ventral palm, dorsal hand, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action. Venous EDTA samples may be used by the healthcare professionals.

The lipid tests are intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. A capillary rod is used to pick up the blood samples before applying onto the test strips. Venous EDTA and heparin samples may be used by the healthcare professionals.

5. Calibration:

There is no calibration required for the LipidPro meter by the user; however, the user must check to make sure the code number of the test strip matches the code number displays on the meter before running any test. There are two ways to code the meter: The glucose test strip has a color-tag at the back of the strip which enables the meter to recognize its code number through the RFID tag on the meter. The lipid test strip has a RFID-tag on each test strip’s vial which enables the meter to recognize its code.

The LipidPro glucose measuring test system is plasma-calibrated.

6. Quality Control:

Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations and lipids control solutions at two different concentrations can be run with this device. The user must select the control mode using the mode button to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as patient result. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
