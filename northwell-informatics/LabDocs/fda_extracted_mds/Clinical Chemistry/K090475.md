Summary prepared on: February 23, 2009

Device classification name: Multi-Analyte Controls, All Kinds (Assayed and Unassayed)   
Device description: Quality control material (assayed and unassayed)\*   
Proprietary Name: VALIDATE CM2 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set   
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660   
Product Code: JJY\*

\*Note: There is no FDA product code for calibration verification / linearity materials. Therefore, as with previous submissions by Maine Standards and other calibration verification / linearity manufacturers, JJY has been selected as the "best fit" FDA code for this product.

Class I

# Predicate Device:

VALIDATE® CM1 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set, Maine Standards Company, Windham, ME.

Device description: VALIDATE® CM2 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Sets are human based calibration verification materials containing multiple levels used to establish the relationship between theoretical operation and actual performance of the included analytes. There exists a linear relationship among each set of solutions.

Intended use: The VALIDATE® CM2 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Sets are used by trained laboratory professionals for quantitatively verifying calibration, validating reportable ranges, and determining linearity in automated, semi-automated and manual chemistry systems for the analytes listed on the package insert. These materials are not intended for use as routine quality control materials or as calibration materials.

Comparison of VALIDATE® CM2 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set to the predicate device:

Table 1 compares characteristics of the VALIDATE® CM2 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set with those of the VALIDATE® CM1 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set.

Re: k090475 Trade/Device Name: VALIDATE CM2 Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Set Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660 Regulation Name: Quality Control Material (assayed and unassayed) Regulatory Class: Class I, reserved Product Code: JJY Dated: February 23, 2009 Received: February 24, 2009

Dear Ms. Cressman:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or classⅢ (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The FDA fnding of substantial equivalence of your device to a lgally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
