# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys PreciControl Universal is a lyophilized product consisting of added antigens in a human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analytes are spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Reagents - working solutions

• PC U1: 2 bottles for $2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of control serum (human)   
• PC U2: 2 bottles for $2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of control serum (human)   
Safety data sheet available for professional user on request.   
All products derived from human blood are prepared exclusively   
from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be free   
from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The initial thyroid glandular tissue extract containing the human thyroglobulin has shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced in the submission.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Roche Diagnostics maintains a set of master calibrators for each assay that have values assigned that are traceable to the various standards such as WHO, NIST, or in-house developed standards. The Elecsys PreciControl products are assayed and compared to these reference preparations and target values and ranges are assigned.

Each control level was tested on a multiple analyzers using Elecsys reagents. Two series of measurements were performed on each instrument. Samples were tested in duplicate and concentrations were read against the respective master calibrator curve. The target value is then calculated for each analyzer platform and set as the median of the determined values.

The protocols for establishing shelf-life and open-vial stability were reviewed and adequate. An accelerated stability study was performed to simulate a shelf life of 24 months at normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Data supports the package insert claims that reconstituted Elecsys PreciControl Universal is stable: on the analyzer up to 5 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; after thawing, 3 days at 2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; after reconstitution, ${ } _ { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ for one month. Data supports the package insert claims that insulin within the reconstituted Elecsys PreciControl Universal is stable: on the analyzer up to 5 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; and after reconstitution, ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for one month. Protocol for real time stability and 9 month data are provided.
