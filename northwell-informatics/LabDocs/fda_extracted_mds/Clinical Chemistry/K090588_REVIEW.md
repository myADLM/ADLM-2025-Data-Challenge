# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indication(s) for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The basic Power Processor is an automated sample handling system which processes sample tubes from the pre-centrifugation, pre-sorting step to presentation of centrifuged and decapped samples into Generic or Personality Racks for specific instruments. The Power Processor can be configured with optional software and hardware to allow processing of sample tubes on Generic Connection Instruments. The Power Processor performs all pre-analytical sample tube preparation, and then sorts the sample tubes directly to Generic Connection Modules where the samples are pipetted by the Generic Connection instrument for testing. After the samples are pipetted, the tubes can route to other instruments for additional testing or to Outlet Racks.

The UniCel DxI 800 Access Immunoassay System with laboratory automation connection is a microcomputer-controlled, random and continuous access analyzer that includes an external computer. This computer stores the system user interface (UI) software and allows the operator to interface with and direct the instrument software. The UniCel DxI 800 System uses enzyme immunoassays (utilizing paramagnetic particle solid phase and chemiluminescent detection) for determination of various analytes, such as Vitamin B12, Ferritin, Folate and hTSH along with other various enzyme immunoassays assays that may be adaptable to the analyzer depending on the reagent used to induce the enzyme immunoassay reaction. The UniCel DxI 800 System is an in vitro diagnostic device for use in the clinical laboratory.

The Access Ferritin assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent assay for the quantitative determination of ferritin levels in human serum and plasma (heparin) using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Measurements of ferritin aid in the diagnosis of diseases affecting iron metabolism.

The Access Folate assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, plasma (heparin) and red blood cells using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Folic acid measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of megaloblastic anemia.

The Access HYPER sensitive hTSH assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent assay for the quantitative determination of human thyroidstimulating hormone (thyrotropin, hTSH) levels in human serum using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary are used in the diagnosis of thyroid or pituitary disorders.

The Access Vitamin B12 assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent assay for the quantitative determination of vitamin B12 in human serum and plasma (heparin) using Access Immunoassay Systems. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of anemias of gastrointestinal malabsorption.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Prescription use

4. Special instrument requirements: UniCel DxI 800 Access Immunoassay System

# I. Device Description:

The Power Processor is a scalable laboratory automation system (LAS) designed to streamline pre-analytical processes in the clinical laboratory. A basic Power Processor System is comprised of a Line Control Computer, Preplink™ Computer, Inlet Module, Hematology Module, Centrifugation Module, Decapper Module, and Outlet Module. In the basic configuration, patient sample tubes are loaded onto the Power Processor system to be sorted to a Hematology Module, or to be centrifuged, decapped, and sorted to Personality Racks for further processing on other instruments. Additional modules may be added for aliquot capability, sample capping, and refrigerated storage.

The Power Processor is an open architecture system that can connect to a variety of clinical analyzers. Connection modules are extensions of the Power Processor track system that link with an analyzer’s existing LAS interface. Connection modules support one of two types of sample transfer methods: onboard or outboard sampling. Onboard sampling physically transfers the sample tube/rack from the automation track to the analyzer’s sample load and identification area. With outboard sampling, the connection unit performs the sample bar code read function, presents the sample ID to the connected analyzer, and then signals for direct sampling of the open tube by the connected instrument at an aspiration point on the automation track. The Power Processor Generic Connection Module is specifically designed to support the outboard sampling method based on point-in space pipetting technology aligned with the CSLI guidelines. This method is used to establish connection with Beckman Coulter’s UniCel DxI 800 Immunoassay System. Power Processor software version 3.5 establishes a dynamic or “smart” connection with the UniCel DxI 800 System to enable sample routing based on reagent and calibration status.

The assay test menu was selected by the evaluator and specimen selection was based on the site test requests. In the study, two blood samples were drawn from each patient. One sample tube was processed through the laboratory protocol using the Power Processor System with Generic Connection Module interface to the $\mathrm { D x I } 8 0 0$ analyzer, and the other tube was processed on the AutoMate system and manually loaded on the analyzer.

The Deming regression analysis demonstrates comparable performance across the range of sample concentrations tested for each representative assay.

# N. Instrument Name:

Power Processor Sample Processing System with Generic Connection Module

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Power Processor system can consist of the following interfaces: Instrument Manager, PrepLink, and Line Control Computer. The LIS sends sample programming to the PrepLink through the optional Instrument Manager in some software setups. Sample programming information is used to determine where to sort sample tubes. The Instrument Manager consolidates multiple sample programming requests for each sample tube, allowing the Power Processor system to sort sample tubes to the appropriate racks.

The PrepLink receives sample programming information which is used to determine the routing information when queried by the Line Control Computer. PrepLink sorts sample tubes to racks based on sample programming and rack configurations specified by the operator during setup.

The Line Control software communicates with the PrepLink software to keep track of sample tubes on the Power Processor system. The Line Control software sends and receives information from the PrepLink software and the Power Processor track. This information is contained in the Systems Error Log and the Operations Error Log (both can be used to evaluate and correct processing problems). The Line Control Computer Main screen displays a graphical representation of the automation line.

The Power Processor can be configured with optional hardware to automatically load centrifuged and decapped sample tubes onto Beckman Coulter’s $8 0 0 \mathrm { \ D x } \mathrm { I }$ System. The Connection Modules operate identically and are designed to support an onboard sampling mechanism, where the sample tubes are transferred directly to the connected analyzer sample load area and read by the system barcode reader.

The Power Processor can be configured with optional software and hardware to allow processing of sample tubes on Connection Instrument. The Power Processor performs all pre-analytical sample tube preparation, and then sorts the sample tubes directly to Connection Module where the samples are pipetted for testing. After the samples are pipetted, the tubes can route to other instruments for additional testing or to Outlet Racks. Routing decisions are made by the PrepLink, and are based on the sample programming of each sample tube, the availability of the Connection instrument, and configuration parameters set by the operator.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X_ _ or No

The applicant provided software documentation that supports the device was designed and developed under good software LifeCycle processes.

3. Specimen Identification: Bar code

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

On the $\mathbf { D x I 8 0 0 }$ connection, the Connection Module reads the sample bar code read prior to releasing the sample from the aspiration point, resulting in the following sequence from the DxI perspective:

• Read sample data   
• Verify sample data matches software queue   
• Aspirate sample from tube Read sample data again Does sample data read before and after aspiration match? If Yes, keep sample and perform analysis; if No, discard sample and do not perform analysis   
• Release Sample from Aspiration point
