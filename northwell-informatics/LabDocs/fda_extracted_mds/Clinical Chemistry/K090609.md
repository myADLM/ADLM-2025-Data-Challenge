# 2.2. Safety and Effectiveness Information

Predicate Device: Claim of Substantial Equivalence (SE) is made to PRODIGY Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K073118) − Device Deseription: Based on an elcctrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action, Okmeter Match Blood Glucose Monitoring System only needs a small amount of blood. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and your blood glucose result is precisely and displayed in 6 seconds. The device including two test strips there are identical in structure design and test performance, the only difference in colors (White for strip A and Green for strip B).

# Intended Use:

The Okmeter Match Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the following alternative sites: the palm, the forearm, the upper-arm. the calf and the thigh. lt is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or sereening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates. The alternative site testing in this system can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions. The meter has some audible features but it is not for use by the visually impaired.

The Okmeter Test Strips are intended for the quantitative measurement of glucosc in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. Okmeter Test Strips must be used with the Okmeter Match Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). They are indicated for usc at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. They are not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and are not intended for use on neonates.

The Okmeter 2 levels (Normal and High) Control Solution are for use with the Okmeter Match Blood Glucose Monitoring System and Okmeter Test Strips as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

# Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

Pre-clinical and clinical data are employed upon submission of this 510(K) premarket notification according to the Guidunce Document_ for In Viro Diagnostic Test System: Guidance for Industry and FDA document provided by CDRH/FDA.

# Substantial Equivalence (SE)

A claim of substantial equivalence is made to PRODIGY Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K073118). Both of them have the same working principle and technologies including sample volume. measuring time, detecting range, HCT range, calibration method, voice function, and memory data number. The major differences for the two devices are meter dimension. weight; and the subject has two test strips. Besides, the subject device and predicate device is samc intended for use in the quantitative measurcment of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the following alternative sites: the palm, the forearm, the

upper-arm, the calf and the thigh. Thus the differences are due to the feature design aspects. not relating to the safety or effectiveness aspects. They are substantially equivalent.

Dear Dr. Ke-Min Jen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. ·Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
