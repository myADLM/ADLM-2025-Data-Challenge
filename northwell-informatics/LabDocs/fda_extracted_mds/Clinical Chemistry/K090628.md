Device: Trade/ Proprietary Name: Didget Common/Usual Name: Blood Glucose Meter

# Classification:

Contour Blood Glucose Meter (K062058, K060470)

Device Description:

The Didget Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of:

1. Didget Blood Glucose Monitor   
2. Contour Blood Glucose Test Strips   
3. Contour Control Solution

Intended Use:

The Didget blood glucose monitoring system (meter, strips, and controls) is intended for self-testing by people with diabetes to monitor glucose concentrations in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip only. It is intended for those ages four and older, with adult supervision as needed. The Didget blood glucose monitoring system is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus and is not intended for use on neonates.

Technological Characteristics:

There were no changes to the fundamental scientific technology

Comparison to Predicate Device:

The modifications to the device encompass meter size/shape design changes. There has been no change to the operating principle. An interface for a Nintendo gaming system was added. The inidication was modified.

Assessment of Performance:

An evaluation of the Didget Blood Glucose Monitoring System was studied in the laboratory and in a clinical setting using persons with diabetes, ages 5 through 24. The results were compared to results from the currently marketed Contour system and to a laboratory method. The studies showed equivalent performance with the current Contour system.

# Conclusion:

The results of clinical evaluations of the Didget Blood Glucose Monitoring System demonstrated that the device can produce blood glucose results that are substantially equivalent to results obtained on the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Brocchi:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
