# L. Test Principle:

Once a whole blood sample is applied to the sample chamber of the test strip, glucose measurement commences. Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Venous blood (hematocrit value of $4 5 \% + / - 1 \%$ ) was tested at five glucose concentration ranges: 30 – 50, 51 – 110, 111 – 150, 151 – 250 and $2 5 1 - 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Ten DIDGET meters with 10 replicates per meter $\mathrm { \Pi } ^ { \mathrm { - 1 0 0 } }$ ) were used. The glucose concentration of each sample was checked by reference method immediately before the first and after the last measurement of meters. The within-run precision for all meters and concentrations tested were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose Conc.(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard Deviation(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Coefficient ofVariation (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>39.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.90</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.29</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>81.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.14</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.63</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>131.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.99</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.52</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>197.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.39</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.72</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>331.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.08</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.14</td></tr></table>

The Day to Day precision testing was performed using three levels of glucose control solutions using ten meters over a period of 10 days. The results are tabulated below.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The assay measuring range of the device is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sponsor conducted linearity studies to demonstrate that glucose measurements using their device are linear. Venous whole blood was collected and glucose adjusted to 7 concentration levels (0, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, and $5 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Eight DIDGET meters were tested at each glucose concentration with 3 replicates. The linear regression line for three lots was: y $= 0 . 9 9 4 ( \mathrm { x } ) + 0 . 0 4 9 2$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Shelf life studies show that control solutions have a twenty-four month life-span and a six month shelf-life once control solution bottle is opened. The recommended storage temperature is $5 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ . Traceability for controls is referenced to the NIST SRM 917a (dry D-glucose).

d. Detection limit:

The detection limit is $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as supported by the linearity study described above.

e. Analytical specificity:

The interference studies including hematocrit effect for blood glucose measurement were established in the sponsor’s predicate device (Contour Glucose Monitor – k062058) that uses the same glucose test system.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: A method comparison study was performed with 123 subjects between the ages of 4 and 24 years. Capillary finger-stick testing was done where participants aged 8 and above tested themselves and the parent/guardian assisted with, or performed, testing for participants ages 4 to 7. The distribution of gender, diabetes type, and age for all 123 subjects were as follows.

Of the 123 subjects used, 2 samples were excluded from testing as there were no YSI results. The range of concentrations of 121 samples was $5 3 - 4 6 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ by the reference method. The linear regression line for the accuracy study was, $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 \mathrm { x } -$ 0.72, $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 6 9$ . The accuracy for DIDGET meter vs. YSI in the format of ISO 15197 is given below.

The glucose distribution of natural capillary samples did not cover the entire assay measuring range of the device. In order to achieve glucose concentrations across the entire measuring range of the meter, 47 venous blood samples were spiked or glycolyzed to obtain high or low glucose concentrations for testing. The range of concentrations for all 168 samples (capillary and modified) was $2 5 - 5 6 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ by the reference method. The linear regression line for the accuracy study was, $\mathbf { y } =$ $1 . 0 2 \mathrm { x } - 3 . 4 3$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 1$ . The accuracy for DIDGET meter vs. YSI in the format of ISO 15197 is given below.

N. Instrument Name: DIDGET Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional reading.

2. Software: FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types: Yes ___X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification: There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly

to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger tip only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

No calibration is required from the user. The meter accommodates auto-coding, in that each strip is designed and manufactured to code the meter appropriately when the strip is inserted.

6. Quality Control:

Three levels of control are supplied with the device. Users are instructed to test control solutions when the meter is first used in order to verify that they can use the meter correctly. In addition they are instructed to run a control when a new vial of test strips is opened, when they suspect the meter or strips are not working correctly, if test results appear to be abnormally high or low, or are not consistent with the patient's symptoms. The user is referred to the troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall outside the assigned ranges.
