# 3.NAME OF DEVICE:

Trade Name:

# Easy Step Blood Glucose Monitoring System DIACHEX\* PRO Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# Common Names/Descriptions: Classification Names:

Blood Glucose Monitoring System Glucose test system, product code 75CGA and "System, test, blood glucose, over the counter", product code 75NBW, 21 CFR 862.1345

# 4.DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The Easy Step / DIACHEX\* PRO Blood Glucose Monitoring System designed by Tyson Bioresearch Inc., an amperometric biosensor, is adopted for its ease of use, its ability to process accurate results utilizing only a small volume of blood, and its quick response time. Easy Step / DiACHEX\* PRO provide a convenient and safe monitoring system for diabetes health care professionals, hospitals and most importantly, people with diabetes.

The Easy Step / DIACHEX\* PRO Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitatively measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and the alternative sites: the palm and the forearm. The Easy Step / DIACHEX\* PRO Blood Glucose Test Strips are for testing outside the

body (in vitro diagnostic use). When the edge of the test strip is touched to a drop of blood, the test strip draws the blood into the sample chamber and the glucose reading is displayed on the meter after 5 seconds. The test measures glucose from 20 mg/dL (1.1mmol/L) to 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L). The test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow the comparison of results with laboratory methods.

# 5.INTENDED USE:

The Easy Step / DIACHEX\* PRO Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitatively measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and the alternative sites: the palm and the forearm. The Easy Step / DIACHEX\* PRO Blood Glucose Test Strips are for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The Easy Step / DlACHEX\* PRO Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical setting by healthcare professionals as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus. The alternative site testing in the systems can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions. It is not intended for neonatal testing.

# 6. TEST PRINCIPLE

The test principle is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose oxidase. Glucose is oxidized to gluconic acid and electrons are produced from the reaction. The electrons are then trapped by a chemical mediator, potassium ferricyanide. Once the enzymatic reaction is complete, a potential is provided by the meter for a further electrochemical reaction in order to generate a current from the release of trapped electrons. This current is then measured and correlated to the glucose concentration in the whole-blood sample. The test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow easy comparison of results with laboratory methods.

This 510(K) amendment addresses the changes of the DIACHEX\* INFINITY Blood

# Page 56 of 240

Glucose Monitoring System (k073492). The modifications encompass the change for operating process, addition of selectable backlight on/off function, addition of graphic indicator for pre-meal and post-meal test results on the LCD result display of Easy Step / DIACHEX\* PRO meter and the removal of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic alarm setting function and the change for meter outside looking of Easy Step Glucose meter only. All the main internal electronic component, function and detection algorithm of proposed devices remain the same as DIACHEX\* INFINITY Blood Glucose Meter. The chemical formula and used enzyme of the Easy Step / DIACHEX\* PRO test strip is identical to the original cleared device test strip (K062829) without ant change. The table below lists the differences between the Easy Step and DIACHEX\* PRO device from the predicate DIACHEX\* INFINITY device.

From the above test results, we conclude that the modification of the DiACHEX\* INFINITY Meter do not affect the effectiveness and safety of the device. The proposed device Easy Step / DIACHEX\* PRO Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantial equivalent to the original cleared device. The performance characteristics of the proposed system under various conditions including temperature effect, altitude effect, hematocrit levels, interference study, sensitivity and linearity has been established in the previously device cleared under k073492. Easy Step / DlACHEX\* PRO system are suitable for its intended use. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
