# L. Test Principle:

The sample (whole blood) is drawn by capillary action at the tip of the test strip. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose oxidase (GOD) and Hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride in the test strip. This produces Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride. Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride is produced in proportion to the glucose concentration of the blood sample.

Oxidation of the Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride produces an electric current. The meter converts the current to the glucose concentration and displays it as the test result:

$\beta$ -D-glucose $^ +$ Hexammineruthenium (III) chloride GOD > D-Glucono-δLactone $^ +$ Hexammineruthenium (II) chloride Hexammineruthenium (II) chloride Hexammineruthenium (III) chloride $^ +$ e

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Testing was performed using fresh venous whole blood obtained from several nondiabetic volunteers and adjusted to a pO2 of 60 to ${ 8 0 } \mathrm { m m H } \mathrm { g }$ and hematocrit of $42 \%$ . The whole blood was spiked to obtain 5 glucose concentrations ranging from 43 – $3 7 4 { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ .

Within-Day precision tests consisted of 10 measurements of each of the five spiked whole blood glucose samples using 10 meters for each sample for a total of 500 measurements. The within-run precision for all meters and concentrations tested was as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose Conc.(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard Deviation(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Coefficient ofVariation (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.49</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.52</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>94.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.44</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>134.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.79</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.31</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>217.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.79</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.66</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>373.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.46</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.26</td></tr></table>

The Day to Day precision testing was performed using three glucose levels of control solutions; ten individual users performed this evaluation using ten meters over a period of ten days, for a total of 100 measurements per level. This was repeated with three lots of test strips.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range of the device is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . A linearity study was conducted consistent with CLSI EP6-A using venous whole blood collected in a $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ vacuum sample tube. Glucose was adjusted to 11 concentration levels ranging from 13 to 708 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ (The Lo and Hi detection was disabled for this testing). Ten measurements were taken at each glucose concentration. The linear regression line for three lots was: $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 \mathbf { x } + 3 . 5 6 . } \end{array}$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor assigned control values based on data collected with the PocketChem EZ Blood Glucose Meter and the new strips.

Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have a twenty-four month lifespan and a three month shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. The recommended storage temperature is $3 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

d. Detection limit:

The detection limit is $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . See linearity/assay reportable range above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

A total of 15 readings were taken for each glucose level and concentration of interferent (5 unique test strips per each of 3 lots). Three glucose levels were tested for each interferent including a low $( 5 0 - 8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ range), medium (125 – 160 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ range), and high $( 3 1 0 - 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ range). Bias was calculated as the mean difference in glucose reading between the test and control concentration groups.

Standard deviations and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean bias were also calculated. Percent bias was calculated as the bias divided by the mean glucose level at the control concentration. Standard deviations and $9 5 \%$ CIs for percent bias were also reported.

No significant interference was defined by the sponsor as follows: for glucose levels less than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ there is no interference if the lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI for bias $\mathrm { i } \mathrm { s } \geq - 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the upper bound $\mathrm { i s } \leq 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and for glucose levels $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ there is no interference if the lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI for percent bias i $s \geq - 1 0 \%$ and the upper bound is $\leq 1 0 \%$ .

Based on the definition of interference above, ascorbic acid at $6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was found to interfere. This is described in the labeling as:

Ascorbic acid (Vitamin $C _ { \nu }$ ), when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic concentrations, does not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high concentrations in blood may cause inaccurately high results.

The following substances were found not to significantly interfere based upon the definition of interference above:

Acetaminophen up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Acetyl-Salicylic Acid up to $6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Cholesterol up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Conjugated bilirubin up to $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Creatinine up to $5 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Dopamine up to $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Ephedrine up to $0 . 0 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Fructose up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Galactose up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Gentisic Acid up to $1 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Glutathione up to $3 . 0 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ Hemoglobin up to $7 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Ibuprofen up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ L-DOPA up to $1 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Lactose up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Maltose up to $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Maltotetraose up to $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Maltotoriose up to $2 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Mannitol up to $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Mannose up to $1 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Methyl-L-Dopa up to $1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Salicylic Acid up to $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Sorbitol up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Tetracycline up to $1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Tolazamide up to $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Triglyceride up to $3 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Tolbutamide up to $6 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Unconjugated Bilirubin up to $3 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Urea up to $2 8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Warfarin up to $1 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Xylitol up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Xylose up to $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# Altitude Study

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the PocketChem EZ Blood Glucose Meter using the new glucose strips. Venous blood was collected from a donor in a sodium heparin tube and allowed to undergo glycolysis at room temperature to lower the endogenous glucose to approximately $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sample was separated into 4 aliquots and spiked with glucose to levels of approximately 60, 125, 300 and $4 8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . After spiking to obtain the 4 different levels, the glucose values were confirmed with the YSI glucose analyzer. The tests were performed at approximately 900 feet and at 10,000 feet. At each altitude, venous blood at each of the 4 levels of glucose was tested on the same test strip lot. The meter readings obtained at 10,000 feet were compared to the meter readings at sea level and the $\%$ bias was determined at each level.

Results recovered within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at blood glucose levels of $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\pm$ $1 5 \%$ at glucose levels $> 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when compared to the readings near sea level. The labeling states that the Arkray Assure Pro test strips can be used at elevations up to 10,000 feet above sea level.

# Hematocrit Study

The sponsor performed hematocrit studies comparing the PocketChem EZ result at various hematocrits across the glucose measuring range to the Assure Pro at a normal hematocrit and to a reference analyzer. Hematocrit levels tested were 30, 37, 42, 53, and $5 5 \%$ and glucose levels tested were approximately 31, 51, 75, 121, 180, 342, 452, and $5 2 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . All of the comparisons to the reference analyzer and to a normal hematocrit showed a bias of less than $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at glucose concentrations less than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or less than $\pm 1 5 \%$ at glucose concentrations $\geq 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

An additional 21 values were obtained from capillary blood that was allowed to undergo glycolysis to lower glucose or were spiked with glucose to raise values, for a total of 140 measurements. The range of concentrations of unaltered samples was 47 $- 5 2 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ by the reference method. The total range of concentrations, with the contrived samples, was $3 6 - 5 7 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ by the reference method.

The linear regression line for this study was:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 \mathbf { x } - 7 . 7 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9

# N. Instrument Name:

PocketChem EZ Blood Glucose Meter

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional reading.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and palm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

The user is instructed to insert the code chip when the meter is turned off, and then to insert a test strip, which turns the meter on. The meter automatically detects the code number when a test strip is inserted. The user must check to see if the code number the meter displays matches the number on the test strip vial. If the number matches, the user is instructed to begin testing. If the number does not match, the user is instructed not to perform a test and to make sure the correct code chip is being used for that bottle of strips. No other calibration is required from the user.

# 6. Quality Control:

Two levels of control are supplied with the device. Users are instructed to test control solutions when the meter is first used in order to verify that they can use the meter correctly. In addition they are instructed to run a control when a new vial of test strips is opened, when they suspect the meter or strips are not working correctly, if test results appear to be abnormally high or low, or are not consistent with the patient's symptoms, if the meter is dropped, to check their technique, if the test strip bottle had been left open or stored outside its recommended temperature range, and each time the batteries are changed.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling and states that the user manual, strip insert, and control insert are at an eighth grade reading level or below. Note: the strip insert was determined to be at a reading level of 8.7 when the technical section targeting professional users was included. When this section was not included, the reading level drops to 7.4.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
