# 3. Predicate Device:

GlucoLab ™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System(Infopia co., Ltd.) K051285

# Infopia co.,Itd Blood Glucose Monitoring System 510(k) for In Vitro Diagnostic Device

# 4. Description:

Data transmitted by the Eocene™ system is available online for you or your designed healthcare professionals to review within the Eocene Secure website. To register your Eocene cradle or use with he Eocene systems, contact the dealer you purchased your device from or visit www.eocenesystems.com for more information. For best results, follow the daily testing frequency prescribed by your and upload your data at least once a week or as indicated by your provider.

The Eocene™ system may be used with GlucoLab™ or Eclipse™ Diabetes Monitoring Systems.

# 5. Indications for use:

The GLUCOLABTM Diabetes Monitoring System and EOCENE™M System is used for the quantitative measurement of glucose level in whole blood as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management in the home and in clinical settings., including physician's office laboratories and point of care sites . The GLUCOLABTM System and EOCENETM System provide plasma equivalent results. The GLUCOLABT System and EOCENET System is not intended to be used with neonatal blood samples. The GLUCOLAB™M System and EOCENE™ System is for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only).

Testing sites include the traditional fingertip testing along with alternate site testing on the forearm, upper arm, palm, calf and thigh.

GlucoLab™ control is used with GlucoLab™ Brand System to check that the meter and test strips are working together as a system and that you are performing the test correctly. It is very important that you do control solution tests routinely to make sure you are getting accurate results.

Control Solutions are sold separately.

# 6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics with Predicate:

The GLUCOLAB™M Diabetes Monitoring System stil operates under the same technological characteristics as the predicate device cleared under K051285.

This Eocene™ System is used with the GLUCOLAB™ Diabetes Monitoring System. It is composed of the Eocene cradle, DC 5V Adaptor, and phone line.

# Infopia co.,Itd Blood Glucose Monitoring System 510(k) for In Vitro Diagnostic Device

It allows to use the phone line to upload GlucoLab™ data to a database server. This does not affect to the safety and effectiveness of the GlucoLab data.

# 7. Performance Data:

Non-clinical: Verification, validation and testing activities were conducted to establish the performance, functionality and reliability characteristics of the EGosTeleiationTen nvol  riati software requirement specifications, product requirement specifications and user interface requirement specifications from the risk analysis. The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

# 8. Conclusion

The data from non clinical tests show that the use of the Eocene' Glucose Telecommunication system is as safe and effective as the legaily marketed predicate device (GlucoLabTM).

Therefore we conclude that the Eocene™ Glucose Telecommunication system is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear: Ms. Griffin,

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
