Device Name:

Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS)

Classification Name:

Blood specimen collection device, JKA

Assay, Glycosylated hemoglobin, LCP

Predicate Devices:

VARIANTTM II Hemoglobin A1c Program, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., K070452 - Wash/Diluent Solution

D-10TM Hemoglobin A1c Program, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., K031043 - Wash/Diluent Solution

Intended Use:

The Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) is intended for the collection of human whole blood for the percent determination of hemoglobin Alc using Bio-Rad HPLC methods.

For in vitro diagnostic use.

Indications For Use:

The measurement of percent hemoglobin A1c is effective in monitoring long-term glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.

Description of the Device:

Each Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) contains a combination of the following components (quantity is dependent upon kit size):

1. Sample Preparation Vials: clear microvials with blue pierceable caps, each contains 1.5 mL of the HCCS reagent.

2. Capillaries: plastic capillaries $( 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } )$ in a dispenser.

3. Capillary Holder: holder for manipulating the capillaries.

4. Labels: to label prepared samples.

The HCCS provides the necessary materials for a professional user to collect and prepare whole blood samples (capillary or venous blood) for analysis with the VARIANTTM II Hemoglobin A1c Program run on the VARIANTTM II Hemoglobin Testing System or the D-10TM Hemoglobin A1c Program run on the D-10TM Hemoglobin Testing System.

Technical Characteristics Compared to the Predicates:

The Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) reagent is intended to dilute whole blood samples in the same way that the predicate Wash/Diluent Solutions of the VARIANTTM II Hemoglobin A1c Program and D-10TM Hemoglobin A1c Program are used to dilute whole blood samples; in preparation for the percent determination of hemoglobin A1c in human whole blood using ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The similarities and differences between the HCCS and the predicates are summarized in the following table:

Testing to Establish Substantial Equivalence:

# Method Comparison:

A method comparison study was conducted at an external site to determine if there is a significant difference in the hemoglobin A1c values of capillary samples collected and prepared with the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) versus the values obtained from the corresponding venous whole blood samples when analyzed with the VARIANTTM II Hemoglobin A1c Program on the VARIANTTM II Hemoglobin Testing System and with the D-10TM Hemoglobin A1c Program on the D- $1 0 ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ Hemoglobin Testing System. One HCCS capillary sample and one venous EDTA primary tube sample were collected from each patient; the samples were then analyzed with the VARIANTTM II Hemoglobin A1c Program or the D- $1 0 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Hemoglobin A1c Program. The results of the study are summarized in the tables below:

# Conclusion:

The results of the method comparison study and performance evaluation studies of the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) show that there is no significant difference in the hemoglobin Alc values for whole blood samples prepared with the HCCS versus whole blood samples diluted with the predicate Wash/Diluent Solutions of the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program and D-10 Hemoglobin A1c Program. Therefore, we trust that the information provided in this 510(k) Submission will support a decision of substantial equivalence of the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS).
