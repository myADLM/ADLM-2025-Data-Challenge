# L. Test Principle:

The Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) reagent hemolyzes the Red Blood Cells in the blood sample, removes the Schiff base and preserves the sample. Once the sample is collected and prepared it is ready for immediate analysis, storage for future analysis or shipment for analysis at another site.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were conducted by testing three patient whole blood samples at approximately the following levels; low $4 \%$ , mid $6 \text{‰}$ and high $8 \mathrm { - } 1 2 \%$ . The samples were assayed twice a day for twenty days using one VARIANT II and one D-10 Hemoglobin testing systems. The results are presented in the table below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by inter mixing the level 1 sample of the Bio-Rad Lyphochek hemoglobin A1c linearity set $( \sim 3 . 5 \%$ HbA1c) with a high patient sample $( \sim 1 8 . 5 \%$ HbA1c) creating three pooled sample sets each with 5 levels of HbA1c. One set of samples was diluted with the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) reagent and two other sets of samples were diluted with the Wash/Diluent solutions one with the VARIANT II and the other with the D-10 Hemoglobin Testing Systems. Each sample was tested in duplicate on each system. Results are presented below:

The VARIANT II test system has a reportable range of $3 . 1 \mathrm { - } 1 8 . 5 \%$ A1c.   
The D-10 test system has a reportable range of $3 . 8 \mathrm { - } 1 8 . 5 \%$ A1c.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor has documented traceability to the NGSP’s recommended accuracy base for HbA1c by performing a direct comparison with a Secondary Reference Laboratory (SRL) using 40 fresh human specimens. At this time, the assay is NGSP certified. However, NGSP certification expires at the end of one year. For current certifications see the NGSP website at:   
http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index2.html

Accelerated stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored at room temperature the shelf life of the HCCS device is 24 months.

Stability of whole blood samples prepared with the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) has been conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. Samples when stored at 2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ are stable for 4 weeks, $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ stable for 2 weeks and $4 2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ stable for 4 days.

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range for the VARIANT II is 3.1 to $1 8 . 5 \%$ HbA1c and the D-10 is 3.8 to $1 8 . 5 \%$ HbA1c. See the linearity study above for data on recovery of samples across the measuring range.

# e. Analytical specificity:

A study was conducted to determine if the level of interference for Liable A1c and Carbamylated Hemoglobin in patient samples differs when diluting samples using the HCCS to diluting the sample with Wash/Diluent for the VARIANT II and D-10 Hemoglobin A1c Programs. Two venous whole blood samples representing normal and diabetic A1c levels were split into 2aliquots. One aliquot of each pool was treated to elevate the Labile A1c. The other aliquot was treated to elevate the Carbamyated Hemoglobin. Next set was diluted using the HCCS reagent and the other with the Wash/Diluent solution of the assay being studied. Samples and controls were run in duplicate on each system. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria states that the $\%$ difference of HbA1c for samples diluted with HCCS method as compared to samples diluted with Wash/Diluent Solution must be less than $\leq 0 . 3 \%$ HbA1c for normal samples and $\leq 0 . 5 \%$ HbA1c for diabetic samples. The study showed that these criteria were met.

To evaluate the effect on hemoglobin variants such as Hb S, C, D and E when tested using the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS), samples with known hemoglobin variants were tested. One sample was prepared using the Wash/Diluent solution (control) and one using the HCCS device (candidate). The sponsor’s acceptance criterion required that the $\%$ difference of HbA1c between the control and the candidate devices were within $+ / - 0 . 2$ $\%$ HbA1c. The studies found that samples containing HbS, HbC, HbD and HbE showed no significant interference.
