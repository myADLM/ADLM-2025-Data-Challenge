(1) Estimated from WaveSense Presto test strip lots published ranges. (2) Estimated from Liberty Normal Control Solution published control ranges.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Evaluation of the Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;   
Approved Guideline—Second Edition (CLSI EP5-A2).

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The D-Glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose preparation which is traceable to the NIST standard 917b. Values are assigned by repeat analysis using three different lots of AgaMatrix WaveSense Presto test strips and one AgaMatrix WaveSense Presto Blood Glucose Monitor. The mean and standard deviation are used to establish the acceptable range for the AgaMatrix WaveSense Presto Blood Glucose Monitor.

Stability characteristics of the AbT Glucose Control Solution were determined using accelerated and real-time studies. The unopened shelf-life is 24 months and the open vial stability is 90 days at the recommended storage of $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ to $8 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

An acceptable range for the AbT glucose control used with the AgaMatrix WaveSense Presto blood glucose monitoring system is printed on the control vial label. When using this control material, users are to compare their control result to the range on the control vial (rather than the range printed on the test strip vial).

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision
