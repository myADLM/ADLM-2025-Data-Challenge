# I. Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur (DHEAS) Master Curve Materials (MCM) are 5 levels of varying concentrations of DHEAS in delipidated, steroid stripped, human defribrinated plasma with preservative. The MCM have expected values (lot specific) of approximately 0, 60, 300, 900 and $1 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . The MCM ( $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial) are liquid and ready to use.

All human source materials used in the preparation of the proposed device were tested using FDA-approved methods and found to be non-reactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff – Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: The ADVIA Centaur DHEAS Master Curve Material are traceable to an internal standard manufactured using purified DHEAS.

Value assignment: Each of the five MCM levels is value assigned using one ADVIA Centaur analyzer, one lot of calibrators and one lot of the ADVIA Centaur DHEAS reagent. At least 3 vials are assayed for each level. MCM 1 is assayed in replicates of 10 on 2 separate runs. For MCM 2 through 5, a “nested test” protocol was used where the samples are assayed with alternating samples of the lot to be value assigned “test lot” and the reference lot used to confirm value assignment. Twenty replicates of the test lot and 20 replicates of the reference lot are assayed. The target values are given in the table below:

Stability: The unopened stability of the ADVIA Centaur DHEAS MCM was determined using accelerated studies and real-time studies. The sponsor currently has real-time data supporting 108 weeks of closed vial stability when the product is stored at 2 to $8 \ ^ { \circ } C$ . The sponsor will claim 18 months of unopened shelf life at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The open vial stability was determined using real-time studies. The sponsor currently has data supporting 9 weeks of open-vial stability when the product is stored at 2 to $8 \%$ . The sponsor will claim 60 days of open vial stability at 2 to $8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$

The sponsor presented data for the in-use stability of the product. The data supports the claim that the ADVIA Centaur DHEAS MCM are stable up to 8 hours when stored at 20 to $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The sponsor will claim 8 hours of in-use stability at 20 to $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
