# 5.0 Description:

The SYNCHRON Enzymatic CO2 (CO2E) Reagent is intended for use in the quantitative determination of Carbon Dioxide concentration in human serum or plasma. The SYNCHRON Systems CO2E assay is an enzymatic method utilizing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and a stabilized NADH analog in two coupled enzymatic reactions. In the first reaction, PEPC catalyzes the reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate and $H C O _ { 3 }$ to yield oxaloacetate and inorganic phosphate. In the second step, oxaloacetate is reduced by a stable NADH analog to malate in the presence of malate dehydrogenase (MDH). The resulting decrease in absorbance at 410 nm is spectrophotometrically measured and directly proportional to the CO2 concentration in the test sample via measurement of bicarbonate ions $( H C O _ { 3 } ^ { - } )$ . The SYNCHRON DxC Systems utilize a twolevel calibrator for the Carbon Dioxide assay.

The SYNCHRON Enzymatic CO2 (CO2E) Reagent is designed for optimal performance on the UniCel DxC SYNCHRON Clinical Systems (UniCel DxC 600/800 SYNCHRON and UniCel DxC 600i/660i/680i/860i/880i SYNCHRON Access Clinical Systems). The reagent kit contains two 30o-test cartridges that are packaged separately from the associated calibrator.

# 6.0 Intended Use:

CO2E reagent, when used in conjunction with UniCel® DxC 600/800 System(s) and SYNCHRON® Systems AQUA CAL 1 and 3, is intended for the quantitative determination of Carbon Dioxide in human serum or plasma.

# Clinical Significance:

Carbon dioxide measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous potentially serious disorders associated with changes in body acid-base balance.

Dear Ms. Boyajian:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
