# L. Test Principle:

The SYNCHRON Systems CO2E assay is an enzymatic method utilizing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and a stabilized NADH analog in two coupled enzymatic reactions. In the first reaction, PEPC catalyzes the reaction between the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and HCO - to yield oxaloacetate and inorganic phosphate. In the second step, oxaloacetate is reduced by a stable NADH analog to malate in the presence of malate dehydrogenase (MDH). The resulting decrease in absorbance at $4 1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ is spectrophotometrically measured and is directly proportional to the CO2 concentration in the test sample via measurement of bicarbonate ions $( \mathrm { H C O } _ { 3 } ^ { - } )$ .

The chemical reaction scheme follows:

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. One serum pool and three serum controls were used to evaluate the withinrun and total imprecision. Samples were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days. Results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor performed linearity studies in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A guideline. The study protocol utilized inter-dilutions of a patient serum specimen with a zero-level (saline) sample. A high CO2 level was prepared by spiking with bicarbonate solution. Seven different levels of CO2 concentrations (ranging 5 to 47 mmol/L) were tested in triplicate on the $\mathrm { D x C } 8 0 0$ analyzer. The recovered CO2 values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression resulting in: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 9 7 9 \mathbf { x } + 1 . 1 2 1$ ; $\stackrel { \cdot } { \mathrm { R } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 6 7$ .

The claimed measuring range of this device is 5.0 to $4 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The enzymatic CO2 assay is traceable to NIST SRM 351.

AQUA CAL 1 and 3 calibrators were previously cleared under k965240.

The sponsor states that the unopened CO2E reagent is stable until the expiration date when stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and for 14 days at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ once opened. The calibrators are stable unopened until the expiration date when stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and for 30 days at room temperature after opening unless the expiration date is exceeded.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor determined the limit of detection (LoD) according to the CLSI EP-17-A guideline. LoD is defined as the actual concentration at which an observed test result is very likely to exceed the limit of blank (LoB) and may therefore be declared as “detected”.

The limit of the blank (LoB) was determined by analyzing a blank sample (deionized water) 20 times on a $\mathrm { D x C } 8 0 0$ analyzer. To determine the LoD an aqueous CO2 standard at $5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ was used as the $100 \%$ sample, while $80 \%$ and $60 \%$ samples were prepared by diluting the standard with deionized water. These 3 low concentration standards were analyzed 20 times each. The results demonstrated that the LoD is $5 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

The claimed measuring range of this assay is 5.0 to $4 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor performed interference studies according to the EP7-A2 guideline. Patient sample pools representing low $( { \sim } 2 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , mid (22 to $2 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ) and high $( 3 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ ) analytes levels were used. Five levels of each interferent were tested in replicates of four on a $\mathrm { D x C } 8 0 0$ analyzer. The level of interference was considered not significant if there was no more than $2 \mathrm { m m o l } / \mathrm { L }$ or $6 \%$ difference between the interferent result and the reference result.

No significant interferences were found for bilirubin (unconjugated) up to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , acetoacetic acid up to $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , lipemia up to 500 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ of Intralipid or up to a serum index of 6.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparisons to the predicate device were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline using the $\mathrm { D x C } 8 0 0$ analyzer. A total of 99 serum samples were used, some samples were spiked and diluted to fully span the claimed measuring range. The range of the samples tested was 5 to $4 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . The CO2E recovery results (Y) were compared to the corresponding CO2 ISE recovery results (X) and Deming regression analysis was performed resulting in: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 7 8 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 3 5$ ; ${ \bf r } = 0 . 9 9 6$ .

# b. Matrix comparison:

The sponsor performed matrix comparisons using 59 apparently health subjects. Serum samples and plasma samples (lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride) were drawn from the same donor. CO2 samples ranging from 25 to $3 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were analyzed on the $\mathrm { D x C } 8 0 0$ . The plasma results (Y) were compared to the corresponding serum results (X) for the same donor and Deming regression analysis was performed. The sponsor claimed that lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride are acceptable anticoagulants to be used. Results are summarized below.
