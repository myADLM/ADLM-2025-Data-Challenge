6. The legally marketed (Unmodified) Device / Predicate

GLUCOLAB™M (K051285) Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Infopia co., Ltd.

# 7. Device Description

GLUCOLAB Auto-coding™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is comprised of test meter, test strip and control solutions. GLUCOLAB Auto-coding™ Blood glucose test meter is substantially identical with the picte devic (GlucoLa K051285). The ior c s that the GLUCOLAB Auto-c test meter has auto-coding function, which GlucoLab ™M test meter does not have. GLUCOLAB Autocoding™ test meter can recognize the code of the test strips automatically. This function is intended to decrease user's incorrect code matching.

GLUCOLAB Auto-coding™ blood glucose test strips identical with the predicated device (GlucoLab™. K05 1285) except code recognition band at the back side of the strip. This code recognition band is for auto-coding function of GLUCOLAB Auto-coding™M test meter.

GLUCOLAB Auto-coding™ glucose control solutions are exactly same as GlucoLab™ control solutions.

# 8. Intended Use

The GLUCOLAB Auto-codingT Diabetes Monitoring System is used for the quantitative measurement of glucose level in whole blood as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management in the home and in clinical settings, including physician's office laboratories and point of care sites . The GLUCOLAB Auto-codingT™M System provides plasma equivalent results. The GLUCOLAB Autocoding™M System is not intended to be used with neonatal blood samples. The GLUCOLAB Autocoding™ System is for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). Testing sites include the traditional fingertip testing along with alternate site testing on the orearm, upper arm, palm, cal nd thigh.

GLUCOLAB Auto-codingTM control is used with GLUCOLAB Auto-coding™ Brand System to check that the meter and test strips are working together as a system and that you are performing the test correctly. It is very important that you do control solution tests routinely to make sure you are getting accurate results.

Control Solutions are sold separately.

# 9. Comparison to the Cleared Device

The teological charaeristi  the revised device GLUCOLABAuto-coding)in comparin to the predicated devices (GlucoLabM). The modified device has the same technological characteristics as the current legally market predicate device, GlucoLa (K051285) by Infopi Co, Lt.

# 10. Performance Data

Cliicalhe ical valsih LUCOLABuo-co Boo Gu Monitoring System components were conducted for purpose of validating the consumer use for the user and the professional accuracy. Test results showed substantial equivalence.

Non-clinical:Verification, validation and testing activities were conducted to establish the performance, functionality and reliability characteristic of the GLUCOLAB Auto-coding™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

# 11. Conclusion

The conclusion drawn from the clinical and nonclinical tests is that the GLUCOLAB AutoBl Gu Ming Syse  s  s ive n  s legally marketed predicated device, the GlucoLabTM(K05 1285).

Dear Ms. Chung:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The genral controls provisions of the Act include requirements or annual registration, listing o devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish furthe announcements concernig yourdevicn theFedral Reis.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must c with h'eents,includin, ot imi isratn nd ist1 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as st forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
