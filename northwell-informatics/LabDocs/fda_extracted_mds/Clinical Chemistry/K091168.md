# 2. Device:

Propriety Name Glucophone™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System   
Common Name Blood Glucose Test System System, test, blood glucose, over the counter   
Classification Name: Glucose Oxidase Single (specified) analyte controls   
Classification: Class II, 21 CFR 862.1345,   
Product Code: NBW, CGA, JJX

# 3. Predicate Device:

GlucoPackTM Blood Glucose Monitoring System(HealthPia America Corp.)   
K052469   
GlucoLabTM Blood Glucose Monitoring System(Infopia co., Ltd.)   
K051285

# 4. Description:

The Glucophone™M Meter device combined with Cell Phone (Motorola v3) is used ih luchoTe Su e uco v  piy whole blood.

# Test Principle

The principle of the test relies upon a specific type of glucose in the blood sample, the glucose oxidase reacts to electrodes in the test strip. The test strip employs an electrochemical signal generating an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is measured by the Meter and displayed as your blood glucose result.

# 5. Indications for use:

GlucophoneTM Blood Glucose Testing System is for the quantitative measurement of the concentration of glucose in capillary whole blood that can be taken from the fingertip, ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm, forearm, calf and/or thigh by diabetic patients or healthcare professionals in the home and in clinical setting. GlucophoneTM Blood Glucose Testing System is for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). GlucoPhone™M Blood glucose Testing system is for use with a cellular phone. GlucoPhone™M Blood glucose Testing system is not for neonatal use and not for diagnosis or screening of diabetes. Alternate site testing is for use during times of steady state.

# 6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics with Predicate:

The technological characteristics of the new device (Glucophone™) in comparison to two predicate devices (GlucoPackTM, GlucoLab™M):

The modified Glucophone™M device has the same technological characteristics as the current legally marketed predicate devices: 1. same in the meter device technology with GlucoPackTM Glucose Monitoring System (K052469) By HealthPia America Corp. and 2. same in the strip technology with GlucoLabTm Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K051285) By Infopia co., Ltd..

# 7. Performance Data:

Clinical: The clinical performance evaluation using the GlucophoneTM Blood Glucose Monitoring System components were conducted for the purpose of validating consumer use and professional accuracy. Test results showed substantial equivalence.

Non-clinical: Verification, validation and testing activities were conducted to establish the performance, functionality and reliability characteristics of the Glucophone™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System with respect to two predicate devices. Testing involved the verification of software requirement specifications, product requirement specifications and user interface requirement specifications from the risk analysis. The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

# 8. Conclusion

The data from the clinical and non clinical tests show that the Glucophone'm Blood Glucose Monitoring System is as safe and effective as the legally marketed predicate devices, the GlucoPackTM and GlucoLabTM.

Therefore we conclude that the Glucophone™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Griffin:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have bee reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice
