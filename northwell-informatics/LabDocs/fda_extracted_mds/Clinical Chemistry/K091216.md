# Device Description

The Clinitek Status $\textcircled { R } +$ Analyzer, a device modification to the current Clinitek Status $\textcircled{8}$ is a portable easy to use urine chemistry analyzer. It is designed to read only Siemens Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Clinitest $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ hCG tests.

Identical to the Clinitek Status Analyzer, the Clinitek Status+ analyzer is intended for the measurement of the following in urine: Albumin, Bilirubin, Blood (Occult), Creatinine, Glucose, Ketone, Leukocytes, Nitrite, pH, Protein, Protein-to-Creatinine Ratio, Albuminto-Creatinine Ratio, Specific Gravity, Urobilinogen, and human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG).

The enhanced Analyzer identifies automatically all instrument-read Siemens strip types and adds a quality check to assess if the strip has been compromised by humidity exposure.

In addition, the enhanced Analyzer provides reporting flexibility by allowing users to select specific test parameters to report from on a given strip and provides enhanced security to allow for user/operator access restrictions.

When the connector is attached to the enhanced analyzer (Clinitek Status+), the model is referred to as Clinitek Status Connect System. Additional functionality is enabled including bar code data entry, quality control management, and connectivity to hospital network.

# Statement of Intended Use

The Clinitek Status $\textcircled { \mathbb { R } } +$ Analyzer Urine Chemistry Analyzer is a portable easy to use analyzer. It is designed to read only Siemens Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Clinitest $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ hCG tests.

This analyzer is intended for the measurement of the following in urine: Albumin, Bilirubin, Blood (Occult), Creatinine, Glucose, Ketone, Leukocytes, Nitrite, pH, Protein, Protein-to-Creatinine Ratio, Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio, Specific Gravity, Urobilinogen, and human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG).

These measurements are used to assist diagnosis in the following areas:

Kidney Function Urinary tract infections   
• Metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes mellitus)   
• Liver Function Pregnancy

Tests performed using the Clinitek Status $\textcircled { \textcircled { R } } +$ Analyzer are intended for in vitro diagnostic use only.

The Clinitek Status $\textcircled { \scriptsize { \mathbb { R } } } +$ Analyzer is intended for near patient (point-of-care) facilities and centralized laboratory locations.

# Summary of Technological Characteristics

The Clinitek Status+ and Clinitek Status Connect System operating principle, technical platform, instrument and reagent analytical method, and intended use remain the same as the current Clinitek Status analyzer. In addition, it uses the same test strips and cassettes currently used on the Clinitek Status analyzer.

# 510(k) Summary - updated

The optical system consists of six light emitting diodes, a light guide, a mirror, a lens and a detector. Light from the LEDs travels along the light guide and is reflected off the calibration bar, strip or cassette onto the mirror. It is then directed through an aperture on the lens, from where it is focused onto the detector. The light intensity detected is converted into electrical impulses, which are processed by the instrument's microprocessor and converted into clinically meaningful results.

# Assessment of Performance

An internal study was conducted to demonstrate the performance of the Clinitek Status+ Analyzer and Clinitek Status Connect System (modified device) and assess its substantial equivalence against the Clinitek Status (predicate device).

The scope of the study covered the impact of the proposed software enhancements on performance with both urinalysis strips (Multistix® 10SG) and hCG cassettes (Clinitest® hCG).

Over the study duration, 150 urine specimens were evaluated. The testing was performed to ensure that the software enhancement has not impacted current performance. Based on data analysis, the Urinalysis method comparison results for all 5 of the test conditions meet prescribed performance requirements for percent positive agreement (relative sensitivity) and percent negative agreement (relative specificity) relative to the predicate device (Clinitek Status). Also, performance for both hCG levels tested meet prescribed limits.

In addition information on Software Development Life Cycle including software requirements specifications, risk management report, and overall verification and validation plans were included to provide additional assurance of device performance.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the modified device (Clinitek Status+ and Clinitek Status Connect System) has the same Technological Characteristics and Intended Use as the predicate. The data presented is a summary of risk management activities, internal laboratory performance evaluation and software development information which all provide assurance that the modified device is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Clinitek Status.

Dear: Ms. Malki:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class ⅡI (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
