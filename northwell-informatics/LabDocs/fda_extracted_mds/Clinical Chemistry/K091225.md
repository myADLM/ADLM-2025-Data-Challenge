Summary prepared on: April 17, 2009

Device classification name: Multi-Analyte Controls, All Kinds (Assayed and Unassayed) Device description: Quality control material (assayed and un-assayed)\*

Proprietary Name:

VALIDATE® GC1 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set VALIDATE® GC2 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set VALIDATE® GC3 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set VALIDATE® GC4 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660 Product Code: JJY\*

otThere is o FDA product code or calibratin verificatin /ineariy aterials.Therefore, as with previous submissions by Maine Standards and other calibration verification / linearity manufacturers, JY has been selected as the "best fit" FDA code for this product.

Regulatory Class: Class I

# Predicate Devices:

VALIDATE® Chem 1 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set, Maine Standards Company, Windham, ME VALIDATE® Chem 2 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set, Maine Standards Company, Windham, ME VALIDATE Chem 3 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set, Maine Standards Company, Windham, ME VAATChe  l /n T   ana Co, Wi E VALDATE® Chem 5 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set, Maine Standards Company, Windham, ME VALIDATE Chem 6 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Set, Maine Standards Company, Windham, ME ALIAhn y i \*\*NoThe VALIDATE® CHEM 4 K012120 that was filed contained the followi analytes: ALT AST, CK, LD, ALP, AMY, GGT, LIP, TBIL, and DBIL. Later, the TBIL and DBIL analytes were split off into a stand alone product called VALIDATE® CHEM 5.

Device description: VALIDATE® GC Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Sets are human and aqueous based calibration verification materials containing multiple levels used to establish the relationship between theoretical operation and actual performance of the included analytes. There exists a linear relationship among each set of solutions.

Intended use: Validate® GC Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Sets are intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of linearity, calibration verification and verification of reportable range in automated, semi automated, and manual chemistry systems. See attached 510k submission for the list of all analytes claimed.

# Summary:

The VALIDATE® GC Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Sets behave in a manner suitable for the evaluation of calibration verification, verification of reportable range, and the linear response o the listed analytes over the ranges tested when compared to the predicate devices. VALIDATE® GC Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Sets are as safe, as effective, and perform as well as or better than the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Cressman:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ EY premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at (240) 276-3464. For more information regarding the reporting of adverse events, please go to http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdr/.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
