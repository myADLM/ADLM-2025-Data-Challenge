# I. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

IEC 62304:2006 Medical device software – Software life cycle process ISO 14971:2007, Medical Devices – Application of Risk Management to Medical Devices

# J. Performance Characteristics:

Glucose meter specific   
1. Analytical Performance: a. Accuracy: Not Applicable b. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable c. Linearity: Not Applicable d. Carryover: Not Applicable e. Interfering Substances: Not Applicable

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

To determine the accurate data transmission from the meter to PC, the sponsor demonstrated the performance of the GlucoManager Data Management Software to meet the evaluation protocol and acceptance criteria stated below.

Each test-set consisted of randomly selecting one of the ten glucose meters and conducting data transmission. The process was repeated until all the glucose meters were tested. All stored test results in glucose meters were recorded before conducting the data transmission. Acceptance criteria were that the transmitted data will not be different from the previous recorded data.

To determine the repeatability of data transmission from the meter to PC, the sponsor demonstrated the performance of the GlucoManager Data Management Software to meet the evaluation protocol and acceptance criteria stated below.

One glucose meter with 480 stored test results transmitted complete data set 100 times. Acceptance criteria were that the transmitted data will not be different from the previous recorded data. This protocol did not have any incorrect data.

A User acceptance Study using 106 subjects was conducted to evaluate the GlucoManager Data Management Software with the following objectives:

• To evaluate design and ease-of-use   
• To document participant feedback on the features / functions   
• To document Observer feedback on participant performance   
• To validate that the user instructions are accurate and easy to follow   
• To evaluate participant ratings with respect to features / functions To report any discrepancies (bugs/error messages) found during the evaluation

The subjects (Users) were required to have a minimum of basic computer skills and feel comfortable using a Windows-based Operating System.

Conclusions were based on the subjects’ ability to demonstrate by usage and evaluation (rating) of features/functions (recorded as responses to 19 feature/function tests), their understanding of the applications of the software, their understanding of how to use the software, their comprehension of the contents of the instructions for use, as well as user assessment of ease-of-use based on a separate questionnaire.

Performance of each User was recorded and evaluated by EPS study administrators (Observers), who are familiar with proper use of GlucoManager Data Management Software. Observers rated each subject’s performance using four general questions.

# K. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# L. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
