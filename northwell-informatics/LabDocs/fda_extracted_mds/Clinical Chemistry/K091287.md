5.1.2.1. Name of the device: VS-SENSETM   
5.1.2.2. Classification name: Paper, Obstetric pH   
5.1.3. Identification of the legally marketed predicate device: PHEM-CHEKTM, 510(k) no: K960648

A description of the device: The VS-SENSETM comprises a regular vaginal swab with its tip coated by an indicating polymer. When the indicating tip has been in contact with vaginal secretion, with elevated $\mathfrak { p H }$ level, the user will observe a blue or green stain on the yellow background of the tip. The stains on the tip are caused by the sensitivity of a proprietary polymer, which coats the tip and contains the traditional indicator  Nitrazine Yellow. The VSSENSE™m polymer matrix has a specific composition of ingredients that changes color when the $\mathfrak { p H }$ of the vaginal discharge is greater than $4 . 7 \mathrel { + } 0 . 3 / \AA 0 . 2$ .

The intended use of the device: The VS-SENSETM TEST is a qualitative, visually-read swab for clinicians who wish to evaluate women with vaginal symptoms. The device is a vaginal $\mathfrak { p H }$ indicator swab intended to be used in conjunction with other clinical examinations, such as the Amsel criteria or the Nugent Gram stain, to aid in determining conditions characterized by elevated vaginal $\mathsf { p H }$ , such as bacterial vaginosis.

(\*) PHEM-CHEKTM reads $\mathfrak { p H }$ levels in the same manner as $\mathfrak { p H }$ paper does, thus pH readings in our study were used to simulate the results of using PHEM-CHEK.

Dear Ms. Leskovsek:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to a aessf i  sFe and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at. (301) 796-5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (301) 796-5760. For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postniarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or ( 301 ) 796-5680 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.
