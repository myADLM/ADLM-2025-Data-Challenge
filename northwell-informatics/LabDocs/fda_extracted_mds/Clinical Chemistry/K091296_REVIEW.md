D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Not applicable.

# E. System Descriptions:

Device Description:   
The Polytel PWR-08-06 GMA is a battery-powered, plug-in accessory to the Lifescan OneTouch Ultra,OneTouch Ultra 2, OneTouch UltraMini, and   
OneTouch Select Blood Glucose Monitors. The Polytel PWR-08-07 GMA is a battery-powered, plug-in accessory to the Bayer Contour Blood Glucose   
Monitors. The Polytel PWR-08-09 GMA is a battery-powered, plug-in accessory to the Abbott FreeStyle Freedom Lite and FreeStyle Lite Blood Glucose   
Monitors. Each of these devices acts as a remote unit to transmit data from the meter to a compatible access point, such as a Nokia Model N73 cell phone. The GMA plugs into a port on the glucose meter. In the case of the PWR-08-06, when a glucose reading is taken and the strip withdrawn from the meter, unit turns on automatically, accepts the data, and transmits it wirelessly to the compatible Access Point. The Access Point then sends the encrypted data via cell or land telephone lines to a computer server. Due to the electrical design of the Bayer and Abbott glucose meters, both the PWR-08-07 and PWR-08-09 require the user pressing a button to initiate data transmission.

The access point can be a compatible cell phone, personal computer, or other device having Bluetooth capability. This allows glucose readings to be monitored from a remote location. The glucose readings transmitted by the Polytel glucose accessory are intended to be used for monitoring and historical trending. Clinical judgment and experience are required to check and interpret the information delivered. The unit does not transmit any alarms.

The device hardware platform is a Cambridge Silicon Radio BlueCore4-Ext radio chip with 1MB of flash memory.

The GMA will be sold both through approved groups who can offer service support and OTC. It will be advertised to physicians, in a variety of publications, and on the Polymap website which will direct interested users to contact one of the approved support groups that Polymap has identified. Users may contact Polymap directly, or go to the Polymap website. A support technician from one of the approved groups will contact the user, answer questions about the GMA, validate that it works properly with the user's particular access point, and validate accurate data transmission to the monitoring site.

2. Principles of Operation: Not applicable.

3. Modes of Operation: Transmits data over a wireless Bluetooth link from a Blood Glucose Monitor to a compatible server.

4. Panel: Chemistry (75)

# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

The Polytel GMA (models PWR-08-06, PWR-08-07, and PWR-08-09) are remote communications link devices intended to be used to wirelessly transmit glucose meter readings from a compatible Blood Glucose Monitor to a compatible cellular phone, such as the Nokia N73 or access point, such as the Polytel APT. The receiving device, in turn, sends the readings to the healthcare provider in another location. The device does not send any real-time alarms. Clinical judgment and experience are required to check and interpret the information delivered.

2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): For prescription and over-the-counter use.
