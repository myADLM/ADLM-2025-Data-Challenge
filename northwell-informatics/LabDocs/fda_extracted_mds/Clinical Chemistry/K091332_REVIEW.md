# L. Test Principle:

The Tosoh AIA-PACK RBC folate is a competitive enzyme immunoassay which, after sample hemolysis and sample pretreatment, is performed entirely within the AIA-PACK. First, sample hemolysis is performed to achieve complete hemolysis of erythrocytes and deconjugation to monoglutamate in the whole blood sample using sample hemolyzing reagents (containing ascorbic acid). After sample hemolysis, sample pretreatment is performed to release folate from endogenous binding proteins in the hemolysate sample using sample pretreatment reagents (containing sodium hydroxide and dithiothreitol).

Folate present in the pretreated test sample competes with enzyme-labeled folate for a limited number of binding sites on a fluorescein labeled bovine folate binding protein which then binds to anti-FITC antibody immobilized on magnetic beads. The beads are washed to remove the unbound enzyme-labeled folate and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbeliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme labeled folate that binds to the beads is inversely proportional to the folate concentration in the test sample. A standard curve using a range of known standard concentrations is constructed and unknown folate concentrations are calculated using this curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

All the performance characteristics were performed using the TOSOH AIA-1800 analyzer.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were evaluated using CLSI EP5-A2 as a guideline. The sponsor conducted within-run precision and total precision with one human whole blood sample (EDTA) and three commercially available whole blood controls. All samples were tested twice daily, in duplicate over 20 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ). Results of the precision studies are shown below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were evaluated using the CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. A low and a high folate sample were prepared by adding a spiking solution containing folate to achieve the target folate concentrations (0.43 and $4 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). Inter-dilutions of the low and high samples were used to prepare nine levels of folate samples for the linearity study. All samples were tested in triplicate on the AIA-18000 analyzer. The recovered folate values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was performed. The percent recovery of all the samples ranged from $9 7 . 5 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 8 \%$ . The linear equation generated is $\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 0 6 2 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 3 4 2$ with regression coefficient $( \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } )$ of 0.999. The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from 0.62 to $2 4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: There is no reference material available for traceability. The AIA-PACK RBC folate calibrator set contains 6 levels of different concentrations of folate, which are prepared gravimetrically and compared to an internal standard material.

The folate calibrator has a shelf-life stability of 12 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and an open-vial stability of 1 day when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor determined the Detection limits according to the CLSI EP 17-A guideline. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying one blank sample 60 times and six low samples in replicates of ten. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying 10 low samples 10 times each with a target CV of $20 \%$ . The sponsor determined that the LoB for folate is $0 . 1 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , LoD is 0.43 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and the LoQ is $0 . 6 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The AIA-PACK folate assay has a linearity range of 0.62 to $2 4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were evaluated according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Two controls and two whole blood samples (EDTA) were spiked with increasing amounts of the potential interferants. The spiked samples and unspiked samples were assayed in triplicate and the mean concentration was used to calculate the recovery. The sponsor defined non-interference as $< 1 0 \%$ deviation from the un-spiked samples. Based on the data, the sponsor claims no interference for the substances and concentrations listed in the table below:

Cross-reactivity: Two drugs, Amethopterin and Leucovorin, were evaluated for potential cross-reactivity similar to the interference study protocol evaluated above. The sponsor defined no cross-reactivity as $< 2 \%$ deviation from the un-spiked samples. Based on the data, the sponsor claims no cross-reactivity for the substances and concentrations listed in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Amethopterin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2,518 ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Leucovorin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5,231 ng/mL</td></tr></table>

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison study was performed between the AIA-PACK folate assay (candidate method) and the ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FOL Lite Reagent assay (predicate method) according to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. 101 whole blood (EDTA) samples were assayed on the AIA-1800 analyzer and the ADVIA Centaur analyzer. Hemolysis and pre-treatment of the samples were carried out according to each manufacturer’s

instruction. Dilution correction and hemocrit factors were used with the folate results to calculate the final RBC folate results:

RBC folate $=$ (Hemolysate folate value (ng/mL)) $\times$ dilution factor × 100 Hematocrit $( \% )$

The final calculated RBC folate results ranged from 185 to $1 3 3 3 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The resulting Deming regression equation is $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { X } - 2 6 . 6 0$ with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.86.

# b. Matrix comparison:

Fifty paired EDTA and heparin whole blood samples spanning the folate range were assayed on the TOSOH AIA- 1800 analyzer. The final calculated RBC folate results ranged from 151.6 to $1 4 0 4 . 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The resulting Deming regression equation is $\mathrm { Y } =$ 0.955X – 9.144 with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.99.

The sponsor concluded that heparin is an acceptable anticoagulan for this assay.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A reference range study was performed according to the CLSI C28-A guideline. 122 EDTA whole blood samples were collected from apparently healthy subjects, both male and female, between the ages of 26 to 59 years old. A normal distribution result was generated from these samples and the central $9 5 \%$ interval was obtained to determine the reference range.

Reference range of the RBC folate is determined to be 148.3 to $5 3 1 . 1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$
