Precision: In testing at three LDL levels for 22 days, the within-run CV ranged from 1.2 to 2.2%, and total CV ranged from 2.2 to 2.5%. In precision studies at three separate Physician Office Laboratory (POL) sites over 5 days, the within-run CV ranged from 0.8 to 2.8% and total CV ranged from 1.2 to 2.8%. Accuracy: In a correlation study, 110 serum samples with LDL values ranging from 11 to 388 mg/dL were assayed on the S40 Clinical Analyzer using S- Test LDL (y) and a comparative method (x). Least-squares regression analysis yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.996, a standard error estimate of 6.6, a confidence interval slope of 0.948 to 0.982, and a confidence interval intercept of -1.7 to 3.4. In patient correlation studies at three separate POL sites using the S40 Clinical Analyzer and a comparative method, least-squares regression analysis yielded correlation coefficients of 0.995 to 0.997, standard error estimates of 6.0 to 8.0, confidence interval slopes of 0.895 to 0.967, and confidence interval intercepts of -4.6 to 13.6.

Dear Mr. Katz:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above an haveeeie thedevi stntly euivaln r e icatins oru tate inhe to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices-that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions  the ActThe eneral controls provisions of the Act include requiments or anual regisatn, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classied (ee above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classII (MA), it may e subject t suc aditinal controls.Existing maor regulatins affecting your devicecan be found in, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements f the Act orany Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.You must comply with all the Act's requireents, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
