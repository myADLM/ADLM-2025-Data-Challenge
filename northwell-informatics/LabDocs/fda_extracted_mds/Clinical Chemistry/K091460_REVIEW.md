# I. Device Description:

The AbT Glucose Control Solutions consist of buffered aqueous solutions of DGlucose, a viscosity modifier, preservatives, red dye, and other non-reactive ingredients. The devices are non-sterile, non-hazardous, and contain no human or animal derived materials. The product is packaged in plastic dropper tipped bottles for easy application to the test strip and contains a red coloration to aid the user to visually confirm application of the control.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods, Second Edition 08/2004

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The D-glucose used in these controls is traceable to an in-house standard prepared from NIST Standard Reference Material 917b. The control material is analyzed on the sponsor’s reference analyzer and recovered values must fall within acceptance criteria based on the target value of the NIST standard.

# Expected Values

Glucose controls expected values were determined by repeat analyses using the sponsor’s reference clinical chemistry analyzer. Pre-determined acceptance criteria for glucose recovery must be met for each control lot. Acceptable ranges for the glucose values were determined using a TRUEresult monitor and three different lots of TRUEtest strips, ten replicates per strip lot, over three days. Glucose control value ranges are lot dependent and are listed in the control vial label for each lot. Test results must fall within the range printed on the control vial. These ranges may differ from the range printed on the test strip vial.

# Stability

Stability characteristics of the AbT Glucose Control Solutions were determined using accelerated shelf-life studies and open vial studies. An unopened shelf-life of 24 months is expected at the recommended storage temperature of $3 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ . Open vial stability of 90 days was demonstrated when controls were stored at room temperature.

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
