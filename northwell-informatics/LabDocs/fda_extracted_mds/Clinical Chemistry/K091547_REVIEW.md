# L. Test Principle:

Glucose measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using the enzyme glucose oxidase. The glucose in the sample is oxidized to produce gluconic acid. The electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and correlated to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. The test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow comparison of results with laboratory methods. Using the same technology, $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate ( $\mathrm { \{ \ - \beta \mathrm { - } } $ ketone) is converted by $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and the magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of $\beta \cdot$ - hydroxybutyrate present in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision testing for $\beta$ -ketone was performed on three levels of control solutions and five venous blood samples spiked with various concentrations of $\beta$ -ketone. Sixty samples were assayed for the venous blood samples and thirty-six samples were assayed for the control solutions. Three lots of test strips were tested using the venous blood samples and the control solutions. Samples were assayed in replicates of four on each of five monitors. The sponsor conducted day-to-day precision studies using three levels of three levels of control solutions. Results are summarized in the tables below.

The linearity studies for blood glucose measurement were addressed in the sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses the same glucose test strips.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): To demonstrate the shelf-life stability of the Nova Max Plus Ketone Test Strips, the sponsor conducted real time testing at $2 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ and accelerated testing at $3 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ , $4 \mathrm { \dot { 0 } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $5 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ using 3 lots of test strips and three Nova Max Plus meters. Based on the current accelerated stability testing, ketone test strips are stable up to 9 months in a real time environment. Real time shelf life stability testing is ongoing. To demonstrate the shelf-life stability of the Nova Max Plus Ketone control solutions, the sponsor conducted real time testing at $2 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ and accelerated testing at $4 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ and $5 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { { C } }$ using one lot of strips and 3 levels of ketone control solutions. Based on the sponsor’s acceptance criteria, the control solutions are stable up to 2 years.

The sponsor provided the value assignment protocols for ketone control solutions. Values are assigned by assaying the control materials multiple times on multiple meters. The mean values are obtained and ranges are assigned based upon the results obtained. Target values are provided in the labeling.

The shelf life and traceability studies for blood glucose measurement for strips and controls were addressed in the sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses the same glucose test strips.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor conducted Limit of Detection (LOD) studies following CLSI EP-17-A (Protocols for Determination of Limit of Detection and limit of Quantitation, Approved Guideline). Five samples containing no ketones were tested 100 times to determine the limit of blank. Non-parametric analysis yielded a limit of blank of 0.06. To determine the LOD, a low sample (0.20) was tested 100 times. The equation, $\mathrm { L O D } = \mathrm { L O B } + 1 . 6 4 9 4 ^ { * } \mathrm { S D }$ yielded a LOD of 0.093.

The limit of detection for blood glucose measurement was addressed in the sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses the same glucose test strips.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Following CLSI EP7 guidelines, the sponsor tested a total of 21 substances that may interfere with $\beta$ -ketone measurements. Three ketone spiked blood samples were prepared (ketone concentrations $0 { - } 0 . 8 \mathrm { m M }$ , $2 . 0 { - } 3 . 5 \mathrm { m M }$ and $5 . 0 { - } 7 . 0 \mathrm { m M } )$ for each potentially interfering substance. The concentrations of the potential interference compounds spiked into samples covered the low and high end of therapeutic range and the toxic range. One sample was assayed for each concentration using five monitors. The sponsor concluded that the results demonstrated no significant interference from the substances tested. The results for each interfering substance are given in the table below:

The interference studies for blood glucose measurement were addressed in the sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses the same glucose test strips.

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit between $20 \%$ and $64 \%$ in whole blood samples at 4 levels of ketones (0.1-0.8, 2-3, 4-5, and 6-8). Duplicates of each were assayed on five Nova Max Plus monitors using two lots of test strips. A reference value was assayed on a plasma sample remaining from each blood sample using reference laboratory reagents. The bias for all samples tested was less than $1 1 \%$ . The claimed hematocrit range is $2 5 \%$ to $60 \%$ for both glucose and ketones.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor conducted accuracy studies to assess the performance of Nova Max Plus Blood Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone Monitor system in the hands of the consumer (subject) and a trained laboratorian relative to a standard measurement using an enzymatic spectroscopy reference method. Three lots of Nova Max Blood ketone strips were randomized across 182 (sample range: $0 . 1 - 7 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ subjects with Type1 and Type 2 diabetes. Testing was done by the users using finger tip lancing only. Results of the linear regression analysis in reference to the user results are summarized in the table below.

The sponsor’s alternative site testing (palm and forearm) is limited to the glucose measurement only. The accuracy studies for blood glucose measurement were addressed in the sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor $- \mathbf { k } 0 7 0 2 5 5 )$ that uses the same glucose test strips. However, the sponsor conducted additional method comparison studies using blood samples to demonstrate the accuracy for glucose measurements are maintained in the new device.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Based on the published literature, the sponsor included the following Expected Values for normal glucose levels in their strip labeling:

<table><tr><td>Status</td><td>Plasma glucose range for people without diabetes</td></tr><tr><td>Before meals</td><td>(mg/dL) 70-110</td></tr><tr><td>2 hours after meals</td><td>&lt;120</td></tr></table>

The expected value for ketones is less than $0 . 6 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . (American journal of Clinical pathology 107: 333-358. 1997).

# N. Instrument Name:

Nova Max Plus Blood Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.

2. Software:

FDA reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for glucose measurement in k070255. Additionally, in this submission, the sponsor provided data to support the added new features for ketone measurements.

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger for ketone measurement and finger, the palm, and the forearm for glucose measurement only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

A single calibration code is programmed into the meters at the time of manufacturing and no user Input is required

6. Quality Control:

Three glucose control solutions and three ketone control solutions at three different concentrations to be run with this device are available. The user is referred to the troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
