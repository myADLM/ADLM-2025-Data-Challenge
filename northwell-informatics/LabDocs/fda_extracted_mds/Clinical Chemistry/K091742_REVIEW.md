# L. Test Principle:

Creatinine amidohydrolase hydrolyzes creatinine in a sample to creatine. Creatine is hydrolyzed by Creatinine amidohydrolase to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine from this reaction is oxidized by sarcosine oxidase to glycine and formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine and an acid in the presence of peroxidase to yield a quinoneimine chromogen. The resulting change in absorbance at $5 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Serum and urine linearity studies were designed based on EP6-A guideline.

Serum

Serum pool samples were used for the linearity study. A low creatinine level serum pool was prepared by diluting an aliquot of the serum pool with saline to achieve the target low concentration. A high creatinine level serum pool was prepared by spiking an aliquot of the serum pool with a spiking solution to achieve the target high concentration. Inter-dilutions of the low and high serum pools were used to prepare seven level of serum for the linearity study. All serum samples were tested in replicates of three on SYNCHRON CX7 PRO system and UniCel DxC 800 system. The recovered creatinine values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression.

Serum samples concentrations tested ranged from 0.15 to $3 1 . 1 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the serum linear equation is $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 8 4 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 6 3 6$ for SYNCHRON CX7 PRO system. Serum samples concentrations tested ranged from 0.14 to 31.06 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the serum linear equation is $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 1 3 \mathrm { x } . 0 . 0 4 4 5$ for UniCel DxC 800 system.

The enzymatic creatinine assay has a serum linearity range of 0.20 to 25.0 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Urine

Urine pool samples were prepared by following the same procedures as described above for serum linearity samples. Urine samples concentrations tested ranged from 3.0 to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The urine linear equation is $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 4 5 \mathrm { x }$ - 1.758 for UniCel DxC 800 system.

The enzymatic creatinine assay has a urine linearity range of 10 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The SYNCHRON CX systems utilize a two-level calibrator, the SYNCHRON CX calibrator, for the candidate enzymatic creatinine (CR-E) assay. The SYNCHRON CX calibrator has been previously cleared in k942676.

The SYNCHRON LX and UniCel DxC systems utilize a two-level calibrator, the Beckman Coulter AQUA calibrator, for the candidate enzymatic creatinine (CR-E) assay. The Beckman Coulter AQUA calibrator has been previously cleared in k965240.

Both calibrators are traceable to the NIST 912a SRM Creatinine standard reference material. The set point values for creatinine were established by human sample correlation to isotope dilution mass spectroscopy.

The CR-E reagent has a shelf-life stability of 18 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and an open-vial stability of 30 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor determined the Limit of Detection (LoD) according to the CLSI EP 17-A guideline. The LoD was determined by assaying one blank sample (saline) and one low sample (with concentrations close to 4 times the LoB) in replicates of twenty. The serum samples were assayed on both SYNCHRON CX 7 PRO system and the UniCel $\mathrm { D x C } 8 0 0$ system. The urine samples were assayed on the UniCel DxC 800 system. The sponsor concluded that the LoD for serum is $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and for urine is $1 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The enzymatic creatinine assay has a serum linearity range of 0.20 to 25.0 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and urine linearity range of 10 to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Three sample pools which represent low, mid, and high creatinine levels were tested at different levels of the potential interferants. The sponsor states that interferences are considered to be non-significant if the bias between the test and control samples are within $\pm 6 \%$ or $\pm 0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Results of the interferences studies on SYNCHRON CX 7 PRO and UniCel DxC 800 systems are shown below:

Acetoacetate: Not-significant up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested Lipemia (intralipid): Not-significant up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested Lipemia (Serum index): Not-significant up to 8 tested Ascorbic acid: Not-significant up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested Glucose: Not-significant up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested Bilirubin (uncojugated): Not-significant up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested Bilirubin (conjugated): Not-significant up to $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested Hemoglobin: Not-significant up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested Dopamine: Not-significant up to $1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } }$ tested

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison study was performed between the enzymatic creatinine assay (candidate method) and the CRE-S assay (predicate method) according to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.

Eighty serum samples that ranged from $0 . 5 5 - 2 4 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were assayed on the SYCHRON CX 7 PRO system and the UniCel DxC 800 system. Some samples are spiked in order to cover the hard-to-find range. The resulting linear regression equation is $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 7 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 0 2$ with a correlation coefficient of 1.00, $\Nu = 7 8$ , for the SYCHRON CX 7 PRO system and $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 1 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 1 2$ with a correlation coefficient of 1.00, ${ \Nu } { = } 8 0$ , for the UniCel DxC 800 system. $\mathrm { Y = }$ candidate method and $X =$ predicate method.

Sixty six urine samples that ranged from 12 to $3 8 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were assayed on the UniCel $\mathrm { D x C } 8 0 0$ system. Some samples are spiked in order to cover the hardto-find range. The resulting linear regression equation is $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 8 8 \mathrm { x } - 3 . 0 9 6$ with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. $\mathrm { Y = }$ candidate method and $X =$ predicate method.

b. Matrix comparison:

Fifty-two paired serum and plasma samples (sodium heparin and lithium heparin) ranging from 0.5 to $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were run with both SYNCHRON CX 7 PRO system and UniCel DxC 800 system. The following tables show the linear regression results from the comparison of serum to the plasma tested.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Li-Heparin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Na-Heparin</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Linear Regression Equationfrom SYNCHRON CX 7PRO</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y=0.995X + 0.005</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y=0.999X - 0.006</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Linear Regression Equationfrom UniCel DxC 800</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y=0.997X - 0.005</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y=1.001X - 0.003</td></tr></table>

The sponsor concluded that lithium heparin and sodium heparin are acceptable anticoagulants for samples.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The serum reference range that the sponsor claimed was based on the predicate device and the transferability of the reference range based on the comparability of the analytical systems according to the CLSI C28-A2 guideline. A reference range confirmation study was performed using 20 subjects (male and female) and $9 5 \%$ of the results fell within the predicate’s reference range.

In the labeling, the sponsor’s serum reference ranges are:

For SYNCHRON CX PRO system: $0 . 4 2 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (female), 0.62-1.28 mg/dL (male)

For UniCel DxC 800 system: $0 . 4 4 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (female), 0.61-1.24 mg/dL (male)

In the labeling, the urine reference range on the UniCel DxC 800 system is based on literature\* as follows: $8 0 0 { - } 2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g } / 2 4$ hours (male), $6 0 0 { - } 1 8 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g } / 2 4$ hours (female)
