# 5. Intended Use

The SuperCheck 1 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model 6268, is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the forearm. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home and as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of a diabetes control program. The SuperCheck 1 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, nor for use with neonates.

The alternative site testing (forearm) in this system can only be used during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

This system contains a speaking function that provides audible test results for users with low vision.

# 6 Comparison to Predicate Device

The SuperCheck 1 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model 6268, has equivalent technological characteristics and intended use as the Prodigy Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System; however, the SuperCheck 1 has one alternate site at this time, the forearm.

# 7. Performance Studies

The performance of the SuperCheck 1 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model 6268 was studied in the laboratory and in clinical settings by healthcare professionals and lay users. The studies demonstrated that the performance of the SuperCheck 1 system meets its intended use.
