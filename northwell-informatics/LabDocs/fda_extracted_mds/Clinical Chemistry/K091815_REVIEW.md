# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip. The meter measures the current and displays the corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies to determine repeatability and intermediate precision were based on ISO 15197 standard. A repeatability study was conducted using blood samples at five different levels of glucose ranging from 49 to $3 9 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on three different reagent system lots, four packages per lot. Ten replicate measurements were obtained for each concentration and for each of twelve meters. An intermediate precision study was conducted using control material at three different glucose levels ranging from 46 to $3 6 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on three different reagent system lots, four packages per lot.

Measurements were obtained for each concentration and for each of twelve meters for a period of ten days. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation (CV) were determined for each sample, see results below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study based on CLSI EP6-A standard was conducted on whole blood samples at twelve different glucose levels ranging from 20 to $6 0 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Duplicate measurements for each glucose level were conducted on each of ten meters, three strip lots, and 10 vials per strip lot. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system and the YSI-2300 reference method. The linear regression was as follows: $\mathrm { Y = 1 } \mathrm { . 0 0 3 4 X + 7 } \mathrm { . 9 5 8 } .$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 8 1$ , $\mathrm { n } { = } 3 6 0$ . The reportable range of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system was confirmed to be 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If a sample result exceeds $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as HI.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The stability of the SuperCheck 1 test strips was demonstrated by real-time stability studies. The unopened shelf life is 11 months and the open-vial stability is 3 months at the recommended storage temperatures of $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

Value assignment for use of the control solutions with the SuperCheck1 test strips is based on measurements using the YSI-2300 reference method after calibration with YSI 2747 calibrator solution (NIST SRM #917A Clinical Dextrose). The control solutions were previously cleared under k032029.

The acceptable ranges are printed on the test strip vial labels.

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system is 20 to 600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b of this decision summary).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interferences Study: A study was performed based on the CLSI EP7-A standard to test for possible interference due to a number of endogenous and exogenous substances. Control samples spiked at glucose levels of 80 and $1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested in five replicates with the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system and in singlicate with the YSI-2300 reference method. Each potential interfering substance was evaluated using samples containing a low $( 8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and a high $( 1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ glucose level and compared against a control pool after measurements on the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system and the YSI-2300 reference method. The table below shows the levels with no interference when testing for glucose with the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system:

The sponsor included the following limitation in the label:

Interference was observed for therapeutic level of L-Dopa. Uric acid, acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, and ibuprofen have no significant interference in normal therapeutic levels. However, the concentration in blood beyond the following levels may cause inaccurate results: uric acid $\mathrm { \Omega } ^ { \mathrm { \prime } } 1 0 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , acetaminophen $( 6 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), ascorbic acid $( 4 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and ibuprofen $3 7 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .

Hematocrit Study: A study was performed to evaluate the blood hematocrit (HCT) effect on the performance of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system across the measuring range of the assay. Whole blood samples were tested in duplicate with the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system using three lots of strips/twelve vials per lot and eighteen meters. Glucose concentrations at each HCT level $( 3 0 \%$ , $32 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $46 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $56 \%$ , and $60 \%$ ) were compared with results obtained with the YSI2300 reference method. The data were within $\pm 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for glucose levels $< 7 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 1 5 \%$ for glucose levels $\mathrm { \Omega } \geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the claimed HCT range. The sponsor included the following limitation in the label: Hematocrit in the range of $32 \div 5 6 \%$ has been shown not to affect the glucose results. If you do not know your hematocrit level, consult with your healthcare professional.

Altitude Study: The effect of altitude was evaluated by testing whole blood samples at 120 and $2 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system using three lots of strips/ten vials per lot and ten meters. Glucose concentrations at different altitude levels were compared with results obtained with the Hemocue Glucose Analyzer reference method. The measurements were acceptable when compared to the reference method results. The sponsor included the following limitation in the label: The test strips may be used at altitudes up to 5,280 feet without an effect on test results.

Humidity Study: The effect of humidity on the performance of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system was evaluated at three glucose levels (Low-76.5-79.4 mg/dL; Medium- $1 3 6 { - } 1 4 4 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; and $\mathrm { H i g h } – 3 2 9 – 3 3 8 ~ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ using whole blood samples. Ten replicates were tested at each glucose level with the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system using three lots of strip/ten vials per lot and ten meters. Glucose concentrations at each humidity level $20 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $80 \%$ , and $9 5 \%$ R.H.) were compared with results obtained with the YSI-2300 reference method. The study results demonstrated that humidity between $20 \%$ R.H. and $9 5 \%$ R.H. did not affect glucose measurements. Results fell within $\pm 7 \%$ .

Temperature Study: A study was performed to evaluate the effect of temperature on the performance of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring at three glucose levels $\mathrm { ( L o w  – 7 7 . 8 – 7 9 m g / d L }$ ; Medium- $1 3 7 { \cdot } 1 4 2 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ ; and High- $3 2 5 { - } 3 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } $ ) using whole blood samples. Ten replicates were tested at each glucose level with the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system using three lots of strip/ten vials per lot and ten meters. Glucose concentrations at each temperature level (10, 20, 30, and $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) were compared with results obtained with the YSI-2300 reference method. The study results demonstrated that temperatures between $1 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ did not affect glucose measurements. Results fell within $\pm 7 \%$ .
