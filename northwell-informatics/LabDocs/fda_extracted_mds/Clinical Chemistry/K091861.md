# 5. Device Description

The VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathbf { N a } ^ { + }$ DT Slide assay is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathbf { N } \dot { \mathbf { a } } ^ { * }$ DT Slide and the VITROS Chemistry Products DT Calibrator Kit on the VITROS DT60/DT60 II Chemistry Systems. The VITROS $\mathbf { N a } ^ { + }$ DT Slide is a multilayered, analytical element coated on a polyester support that uses direct potentiometry' for measurement of sodium ions. All reactions necessary for a single quantitative measurement of sodium take place within the multi-layered analytical element of a VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathbf { N a } ^ { + }$ DT Slide. The slide consists of two ion-selective electrodes, each containing methyl monensin (an ionophore for sodium), a reference layer, and a silver layer and a silver chloride layer coated on a polyester support.

VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ DT Slides use ion-selective electrodes for potentiometric measurements of ionic sodium. Ionic sodium determinations are made by simultaneously depositing $1 0 ~ \mathrm { u L }$ each of a reference fluid and a sample fluid on separate halves of the VITROS Chemistry Products ${ { \bf { N } } { \bf { a } } } ^ { + }$ DT Slide. The electrode receiving the reference fluid is identified as the reference electrode. A paper bridge connects the reference electrode and the indicator electrode, which receives the sample fluid. A stable liquid junction between the two fluids is formed in the paper bridge. The sodium ions in the tested reference and sample fluids migrate to the silver/ silver chloride layers and establishes equilibrium.

After an incubation period, the electrometer in the VITROS Chemistry System measures the potential difference between the reference and indicator electrodes. Each electrode responds to the activity of sodium ions in the respective fluids to produce a potential for the concentration cell. The VITROS DT60/DT60II Chemistry System's microprocessor uses this measurement and the stored calibration parameters to determine the concentration value of the sodium ion in the sample fluid. The test result is reported in millimoles per liter $( \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ .

VITROS Chemistry Products DT Calibrator Kit contains four levels of lyophilized standards with corresponding diluents. The standards are prepared from bovine serum albumin and processed bovine serum to which enzymes, electrolytes, stabilizers, preservatives and other organic analytes have been added. The companion diluents are prepared from processed water to which inorganic salts have been added.

The VITROS DT60/ DT60 II Chemistry System and reagents are designed specifically for use with the VITROS Chemistry Products range of products.
