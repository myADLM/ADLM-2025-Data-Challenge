# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay is a quantitative antibody sandwich immunoassay intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of hirsutism and other adrenal abnormalities. The SHBG assay consists of streptavidin magnetic latex particles as the solid phase, biotin labeled anti-SHBG antibody as the capture conjugate, and an acridinium labeled anti-SHBG conjugate as the Lite reagent. An antibody sandwich is formed when SHBG in the patient sample or calibrator is captured by the anti-SHBG on the solid phase which then binds the anti-SHBG antibody acridinium ester (AE) conjugate.

In addition, the sponsor performed a dilution study to demonstrate the ability of the ADVIA Centaur analyzer to recovery accurately from a diluted sample using a 1:2 dilution. Thirteen human patient samples with high SHBG concentrations (140.3 to $3 0 6 . 8 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L } $ ) near or above the assay upper limit of $1 8 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ were diluted both manually and onboard the ADVIA Centaur analyzer and assayed using the ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay. One trained operator performed the study and the percent recovery calculated by comparing the observed onboard diluted results to the manually diluted results. The mean recovery results are within 98.86 and $1 1 8 . 7 2 \%$ .

High-dose hook effect: The potential for a high-dose hook effect was evaluated for this assay. SHBG was spiked into negative pool (equine serum) and into 2 different serum samples to achieve SHBG concentrations ranging from 888 to $1 1 { , } 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ The samples were analyzed in triplicate on one ADVIA Centaur analyzer using 2 reagent lots. Based on the results, the sponsor concluded that SHBG levels $< 1 0 0 0$ nmol/L did not exhibit any high dose effect.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay is traceable to World Health Organization (WHO) standard (95/560). Assigned values of calibrators and ranges of controls are traceable to this standardization.

The ADVIA Centaur SHBG Calibrators, low and high: A set of internal SHBG standards were manufactured and value assigned using a SHBG WHO standard (NIBSC Code: 95/960). SHBG master lot calibrators are then value assigned against these standards by pooling the results using multiple ADVIA Centaur analyzers, multiple reagent lots and multiple runs. Productions lots are value assigned against Master lots by assaying replicate samples alternating between the “master lot” calibrator and the production lot (test lot) calibrator.

The SHBG Calibrator insert refers to the Calibrator Assigned Value card to facilitate entering the calibrator values on the system. Values for the Low $( { \sim } 1 0 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ and High $( { \sim } 1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ calibrators are provided on the SHBG calibrator card.

The ADVIA SHBG Master Curve Material (MCM) is value assigned against an existing MCM reference lot that is traceable to a WHO SHBG standard (NIBSC Code: 95/960). Assigned values were established using the ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay and ADVIA Centaur analyzer. The target values for the 5 MCM solutions, MCM1 to MCM5 are 0, 10, 50, 100, and $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ . Test lots are value assigned against the reference lot by assaying replicate samples alternating between the “reference lot” and the test lot. SHBG Master Curve Material product insert refers to the SHBG MCM lot specific target value sheet for the actual ranges.

# Stability:

Real time shelf life and open vial stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the ADVIA Centaur SHBG Calibrators were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The product insert recommends storing the lyophilized calibrators at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until expiration date on the vial label. The sponsor recommends a 39 week stability. It is recommended by the sponsor that the reconstituted calibrators be stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 60 days and to freeze-thaw once.

Real time shelf life stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the ADVIA SHBG Master Curve Material were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor recommends in the insert to store unopened MCM material at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ until the expiration date on the vial. The sponsor is recommends a 39 week stability. Once reconstituted the material should be used immediately and any remaining material discarded.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor performed Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) studies in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A guideline. For the LoB studies 5 negative SHBG base pools (horse serum) were used as blanks and were analyzed on two ADVIA Centaur analyzers over three days, with two replicates each, using two reagent lots. A total of 120 results were generated. A nonparametric analysis was employed and the LoB is reported as $0 . 0 0 3 3 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

For the LoD studies 5 spiked low SHBG pools with mean values ranging from 0.119 to $0 . 2 1 6 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ were used. The pools were analyzed with 2 different reagent lots, on 2 ADVIA Centaur analyzers, over 3 days with 2 replicates/sample/run for a total of 24 replicates per sample. A total of 120 replicates were analyzed.

The mean, median and 5th percentiles were calculated for each sample by reagent lot by system. The LoD, the lowest level material in which the 5th percentile exceeds the Limit of Blank, was determined nonparametrically since the requirement of normality was not met for these pools for all combinations of reagent lot and system. The LoD was estimated to be $0 . 1 6 4 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

The SHBG assay has a linearity range of 0.35 to $1 8 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

# c. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor performed interference studies according to the CLSI EP7-A guideline. Potential cross-reactive compounds (see table below) were added to steroid-free diluent and were evaluated in triplicate on ADVIA Centaur instrument using 2 reagent lots. Each test sample was compared to a matched unspiked control and the $\%$ change calculated. The sponsor defines no significant cross-reactivity as $< 5 \%$ difference from sample and control results and states that all the following tested cross reactants are within these specifications:

Potential interfering substances were added to three sample pools containing 10, 50, and $8 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ SHBG. The following interfering substances were added to these sample pools and assayed on an ADVIA Centaur in replicates of six: $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ conjugated bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin, 10, 30, 60 and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ biotin, 250 and $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of hemoglobin, $5 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ of BSA, $5 0 ~ \mathrm { u l / m L }$ intralipid (equivalent to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ triglyceride), and 1, 10, $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { u l / m L }$ Silwet. The same samples pools containing the appropriate solvent of diluent used to dissolve the interferents were used as controls and the percent recovery between the samples and controls were calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ${ < } 1 0 \%$ change in results, and states that no significant interference was observed with any of the potential interferents tested. The labeling includes the following limitation: Samples that contain bilirubin concentrations greater than $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may be inaccurate due to potential interference and should not be used.

The SHBG package insert states that each laboratory should determine its own reference range(s) for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.

Additionally, the sponsor performed a validation study using the ADVIA Centaur SHBG and the ADVIA Centaur Testosterone assays (k934562 originally the CIBA Corning Diagnostics Corp) and the same serum samples used to establish the SHBG reference ranges described above in section M5.

Samples were tested using single determinations with one lot of the ADVIA Centaur SHBG reagent and one lot of ADVIA Centaur testosterone reagent. The study was performed by one trained operator using on the ADVIA Centaur analyzer.
