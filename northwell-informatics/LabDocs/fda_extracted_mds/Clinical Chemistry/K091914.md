# 1I. Description of the new device

OMNis Health Embrace Glucose Control Solution is a two-level, viscosity-adjusted, aqueous liquid glucose control solution. OmNis Health Embrace Glucose Control Solution is intended for use to verify the performance of OMNls Health Embrace blood glucose test systems at glucose levels within the normal fasting blood glucose range for non-diabetic persons, and at elevated ranges consistent with hyperglycemia. The product is packaged in plastic bottles with dropper tips for application of the solution to test strips. The control has a red color to help users see the solution while dispensing onto a test strip.

OMNis Health Embrace Glucose Control Solution is a non-hazardous aqueous solution containing no human or animal-derived materials.

# )  Intended use of the device

OMNis Health Embrace Glucose Control Solution is intended for in vitro diagnostic use to assess the performance of the OMNiS Health Embrace blood glucose test systems by healthcare professionals and in the home by people with diabetes mellitus.

# ) Technological characteristics of the device.

This material consists of viscosity-adjusted, aqueous glucose control solution prepared at two concentrations of D-glucose and has been optimized to simulate the response of whole blood on OMNis Health Embrace blood glucose test systems. The solution contains no hazardous, human or animal derived components.

Dear Ms. Rannikko:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration andlisting (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical devicerelated adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
