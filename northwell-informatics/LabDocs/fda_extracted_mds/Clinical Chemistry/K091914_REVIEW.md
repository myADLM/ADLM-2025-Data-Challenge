L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value Assignment: A Reference Lot known to conform to the performance specifications for the OMNIS Health Embrace Blood Glucose test system is used to value assign new lots. Each new lot is formulated gravimetrically to be within a specified range of the value of the Reference Lot measured using the YSI 2300 analyzer.

Value assignment verification was performed using at least 2 OMNIS Health Embrace Blood Glucose Meters, 3 lots of OMNIS Health Embrace test strips and 3 lots of the proposed device. Value assignment range is determined as the mean value of all measurements $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the mean value. Value assignment was verified if at least $9 5 \%$ of all measurements of the new lot of product were within the value assignment ranges printed on the OMNIS Health Embrace Test Strips.

Stability: Stability characteristics of the OMNIS Health Embrace Glucose Control Solution were determined using real-time studies. The product has a closed-vial stability of 24 months when the product is stored at 2 – 30 $^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C }$ . Open-vial stability is 90 days when the product is stored at $2 - 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ , but should not exceed the printed expiration date.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The instructions provided to the user are as follow: “The Embrace Control Solutions testing should provide results within the expected range indicated on the Embrace Test Strip bottle.” Users are instructed to contact customer support if control readings do not fall within the acceptable range after reviewing the procedure and repeating the test.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
