# I. Device Description:

$\mathrm { M A S @ }$ chemTRAK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ H is a liquid stable control material prepared from human serum. Analyte levels are adjusted with various animal extracts and other non-protein materials including drugs. drug metabolites, and purified chemicals. Preservatives and stabilizers are added to maintain product integrity. chemTRAK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ H is prepared from human source material. Components of the control which are derived from human source material have been tested using FDA accepted methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), hepatitis C (HCV) HIV-1 and HIV

2. The product is supplied as 3 levels (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3) with $6 \times 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ vials for each level.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment ranges for the additional analytes Apolipoprotein A (APO A), Apolipoprotein B (APO B), and Lipoprotein A (LpA) were established based on data from three different laboratories over three separate days. The control material was tested on Siemens Advia Chemistry Systems, Siemens Dimension Vista Systems, Roche Cobas 6000, Cobas Integra Systems, Olympus AU Systems, and Beckman Coulter Immage Systems. Value assignments are established at $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the mean value.

The protocols for establishing shelf-life for the additional analytes Apolipoprotein A (APO A), Apolipoprotein B (APO B), and Lipoprotein A (LpA) and open-vial stability were reviewed and are adequate. An accelerated stability study was performed to simulate a shelf life of 2.5 years frozen at - $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real time frozen stability data studies for the 3 additional analytes are on-going. The refrigerated stability claims $\left( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \thinspace \mathrm { C } \right)$ are 30 days unopened and 7 days opened.
