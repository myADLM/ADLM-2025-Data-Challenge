# L. Test Principle:

The sample (whole blood) is drawn by capillary action at the tip of the test strip. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose oxidase (GOD) and Hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride in the test strip. This produces Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride. Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride is produced in proportion to the glucose concentration of the blood sample.

Oxidation of the Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride produces an electric current. The meter converts the current to the glucose concentration and displays it as the test result:

$\beta$ -D-glucose $^ +$ Hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride GOD

D-Glucono-δLactone $^ +$ Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride

Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride Hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride $+ \mathrm { e } \cdot$

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-Day precision testing was performed using fresh venous whole blood obtained from several non-diabetic volunteers and adjusted to a pO2 of 60 to ${ 8 0 } \mathrm { m m } \mathrm { H g }$ and hematocrit of $42 \%$ . The whole blood was spiked to obtain 5 glucose concentrations ranging from $3 8 . 8 - 5 8 5 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Within-Day precision tests consisted of 10 measurements of each of the 6 spiked whole blood glucose samples using 10 meters for each sample for a total of 600 measurements. The within-run precision for all meters and concentrations tested was as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range of the device is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . A linearity study was conducted consistent with CLSI EP6-A using venous whole blood collected in a $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ vacuum sample tube. Glucose was adjusted to 11 concentration levels ranging from 17 to 650 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ (The Lo and Hi detection was disabled for this testing). Ten Assure Platinum meter measurements were taken at each glucose concentration. The linear regression line for three lots was: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 2 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 9 3 9 6 \ 1$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 8$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The control solutions used in this device have been previously cleared (k053079). Only the name of the control solutions has been changed.

Real time studies for the test strips are on-going and currently support up to 4 months when stored at $3 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ . Shelf life studies using accelerated aging show that the unopened test strips have a twenty-four month life-span. The sponsor recommends a three month shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened based upon real time study data. The recommended storage temperature is $3 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

d. Detection limit:

The detection limit is $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . See linearity/assay reportable range above.

e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor evaluated the interference from different concentrations of the substances listed below. Three glucose levels were tested for each interferent including a low $\mathrm { \hbar \left( 5 0 - 8 0 \ m g / d L \right. }$ range), medium $\mathrm { 1 2 0 - 1 6 0 \ m g / d L }$ range), and high $( 3 0 2 - 3 8 2 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ range). A total of 15 readings were taken for each glucose level and concentration of interferent (5 meters per each of 3 test strip lots). Studies demonstrated that all the interfering substances listed below did not significantly interfere with the glucose readings except that ascorbic acid $( 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ produced $14 \%$ bias and triglycerides $( 3 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ produced $12 \%$ bias:

Acetaminophen up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Acetyl-Salicylic Acid up to $6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Ascorbic acid up to $6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Bilirubin (unconjugated) up to $3 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Bilirubin (conjugated) up to $6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Cholesterol up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Creatinine up to $5 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Dopamine up to $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Ephedrine up to $0 . 1 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Fructose up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# Altitude Study

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the Assure Platinum Glucose Meter using the Assure Platinum test strips. Venous blood collected from a donor was allowed to undergo glycolysis at room temperature to lower the endogenous glucose to approximately $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sample was separated into 4 aliquots and spiked with glucose to levels of approximately 60, 125, 300 and 480 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . These glucose values were confirmed with the YSI glucose analyzer. The tests were performed at approximately 900 feet and at 10,500 feet. At each altitude, venous blood at each of the 4 levels of glucose was tested on the same test strip lot with 10 replicates. The meter readings obtained at 10,500 feet were compared to the meter readings at 900 feet and the $\%$ bias was determined at each level. Results recovered within $8 \%$ when compared to the readings near sea level. The labeling states that the Assure Platinum strips can be used at elevations up to 10,000 feet above sea level.

# Hematocrit Study

The sponsor performed hematocrit studies comparing the Assure Platinum result at various hematocrit levels across the glucose measuring range to the normal hematocrit level and to a reference analyzer. Hematocrit levels tested were 30, 37, 42, 53, and $5 5 \%$ . The glucose levels tested were approximately 30, 50, 75, 120, 180, 341, and $4 5 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Ten replicate measurements were taken at each hematocrit and

glucose concentration. Testing was performed on 3 lots of test strips. Based on the comparisons to the reference analyzer and to normal hematocrit $( 4 2 \% )$ , the results for hematocrit levels between $30 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \%$ showed a bias of less than $\pm 1 5 \%$ at all glucose concentrations.

N. Instrument Name:

Assure Platinum Blood Glucose Meter

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional reading.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for   
this line of product types:   
Yes ___X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

No calibration is required from the user. The meter accommodates auto-coding, in that each strip is designed and manufactured to code the meter appropriately when the strip is inserted.

# 6. Quality Control:

Two levels of control are supplied with the device. Users are instructed to test control solutions when the meter is first used in order to verify that they can use the meter correctly. In addition they are instructed to run a control when a new vial of test strips is opened, when they suspect the meter or strips are not working correctly, if test results appear to be abnormally high or low, or are not consistent with the patient's symptoms, if the meter is dropped, to check their technique, if the test strip bottle had been left open or stored outside its recommended temperature range, and each time the batteries are changed.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling and states that the lay user instructions in the user manual, strip insert, and control insert are at 7.0, 7.5, and 7.5 grade level, respectively.

The detection of the strip calibration code is automatic. A calibration code is determined during the manufacture of each lot of test strips. Calibration process uses fresh venous blood and glucose concentrations are adjusted to cover the dynamic range of the meter. The data are evaluated to determine the optimal calibration code which is preprogrammed in the meter software. Once the code is identified, it is transferred to each test strip. The strip is inserted into the meter strip connector, and the meter detects the configuration of the strip and selects one of the pre-defined calibration curves built into the meter’s software.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
