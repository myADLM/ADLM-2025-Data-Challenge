# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

Protein S is a physiological inhibitor of the coagulation process. It acts as the cofactor of activated protein C. The congenital or acquired deficiency of protein S increases the risk of thrombo-embolism. The STA® - Free PS Calibrator kit is a set of lyophilized human plasmas used to create the calibration curve on an IVD instrument performing the immuno-turbidimetric method for free protein S assays.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: The free protein S level determinations were performed in eight different series on each calibrator level with the same instrument (STA- $\cdot \mathrm { R } ^ { \circledast }$ ) using two different lots of STA® - Liatest® Free PS kit. Concurrently, the free protein S level determinations were also performed in eight different series on each

calibrator level with two different instruments (STA Compact® and STA- $\mathbf { \cdot R } ^ { \mathcal { \left( B \right) } }$ ) using one lot of $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { ( B ) } }$ - Liatest® Free PS kit. All tests were run within two to three weeks. A target value was established for each calibrator level; Reagent $1 ; 1 4 \%$ , Reagent 2: $2 9 \%$ , Reagent 3: $5 7 \%$ , Reagent 4: $9 5 \%$ . Total $C V \%$ for both studies is as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment: For each calibrator level, the free protein S value corresponds to the mean of a minimum of 24 determinations performed with a minimum of 3 instruments, using at least two different lots of STA® – Liatest® Free PS. The determinations are carried out by a minimum of two laboratory technicians.

Traceability: The STA® - Free PS Calibrators are determined against a secondary standard, International Standard 03/228 for free protein S established in 2006 by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC).

Stability: Three different lots of calibrators (Reagent 1, 2, 3, and 4) were used in the stability studies. Three vials each of Reagent 1, 2, 3, and 4 were reconstituted and stored for 4 hours on both analyzers (STA Compact and STA-R). In addition, freshly reconstituted reagents from the same three lots were run using the $\mathrm { S T A } ^ { \textcircled { \mathtt { B } } } - \mathrm { L i a t e s t } ^ { \textcircled { \mathtt { B } } }$ Free PS assay. The reconstituted stability study result supports the claim of remaining stable for 4 hours on board the STA line of IVD analyzers. In the lyophilized state, the calibrator plasmas remain stable for a duration of 18 months from the date of manufacture when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
