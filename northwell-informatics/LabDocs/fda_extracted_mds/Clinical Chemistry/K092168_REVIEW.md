Indication(s) for use: The Elecsys $\mathrm { H C G + } \beta$ CalCheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration verification and for use in the verification of the assay range established by the Elecsys $\mathrm { H C G + } \beta$ reagent on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

The Elecsys $\mathrm { H C G + \beta }$ CalCheck 5 is not intended to be used as a primary calibrator or routine control material.

# 4. Special instrument requirements:

The labeling states that the CalChecks are for use with the Elecsys $\mathrm { H C G + \beta }$ reagent on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 and Modular Analytics E170/cobas e601 test systems.

# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys $\mathrm { H C G + } \beta$ CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) purified from human urine in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the hCG is spiked into the matrix at the target concentrations listed below. CalCheck Level 1 contains no analyte.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and value assignment   
Elecsys $\mathrm { H C G + } \beta$ CalCheck 5 is standardized using internally produced master calibrators which are traceable to the $4 \mathrm { { t h } }$ International Standard for HCG (NIBSC) 75/589.

Each of the five CalCheck levels is value assigned using a minimum of three Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 analyzers and four MODULAR ANALYTICS E140/cobas e 601 analyzers. Each sample is tested in duplicate. The target value for each CalCheck is the median of the observed values.

The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

# Stability

Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. CalCheck 5 is stable until the expiration date printed on the vial when stored unopened at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The reconstituted vials are stable for four hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
