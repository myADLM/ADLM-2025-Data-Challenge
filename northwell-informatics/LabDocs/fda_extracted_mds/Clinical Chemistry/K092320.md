# Submission Purpose

PreciControl ThyroAB is used for quality control of specified Elecsys immunoassays on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers. This product contains control material for numerous Elecsys assays in one convenient solution.

Changes to PreciControl ThyroAB consist of the addition of anti-thyroperoxidase (Anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (Anti-TG) antibodies to extend the current functionality.

# Device Name

Device Description

The Elecsys PreciControl ThyroAB is a lyophilized product consisting of antibodies in a human serum matrix. During manufacture, the antibodies arc spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Intended Use

Elecsys PreciControl ThyroAB is used for quality control of the Elecsys Anti-TSHR, Anti-TPO and Anti-Tg immunoassays on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

# Predicate Device

The modified Elecsys PreciControl ThyroAB is substantially cquivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar usc. We claim equivalency to the currently marketed Elecsys PreciControl ThyroAB (K080092).
