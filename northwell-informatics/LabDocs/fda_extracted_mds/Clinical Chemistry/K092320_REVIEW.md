All products derived from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Roche Diagnostics maintains a set of master calibrators for each assay that have values assigned that are traceable to the National Institute of Biological Standard and Control (NIBSC) standards. The Elecsys PreciControl products are assayed and compared to these reference preparations and target values and ranges are assigned. Anti-TSHR is standardized against NIBSC $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ IS 60/972 Standard. Anti-TPO is standardized against the NIBSC 66/387 Standard. Anti-TG is standardized against the NIBSC 65/93 Standard.

The protocols for establishing shelf-life and open-vial stability were reviewed and adequate. An accelerated stability study was performed to simulate a shelf life of 15 months at normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Reconstituted Elecsys PreciControl ThyroAB for anti-TPO and anti-TG is stable: one month at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and up to 5 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Reconstituted Elecsys PreciControl ThyroAB for anti-TSHR is stable: one month at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and up to 5 hrs at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Protocol for real time stability and 15 month data are provided. Shelf life will be increased to 18, 21 and 24 months after stability data at additional time points is available.

Each control level was tested on a total of twelve Elecsys immunoassay analyzers (4 Elecsys 1010 analyzers, 4 Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411 analyzers, and 4 Elecsys MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601 analyzers) using Elecsys reagents.

Samples were assayed in two independent series using duplicate testing on each analyzer for each analyte. The target value for each analyte in the

PreciControl material is calculated from 8 measurements of each of the respective PreciControl.
