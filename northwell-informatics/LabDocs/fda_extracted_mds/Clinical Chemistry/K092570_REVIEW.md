# I. Device Description:

The ABX PENTRA TPU Cal is a liquid calibrator based on a buffered aqueous solution, containing human serum. The assigned values of the calibrator components are given on the calibrator vials, ensuring optimal calibration of the appropriate HORIBA ABX methods on the ABX PENTRA 400 analyzer. This calibrator is provided in three vials of $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ .

All human source materials were tested and found to be negative for HIV $\%$ , HBsAg, and HCV.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

EN 13640 Stability Testing of In-Vitro Diagnostic Reagents EN 980 Symbols for use in the Labeling of Medical Devices

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The ABX PENTRA TPU calibrator is traceable to NIST SRM 927d

# Stability:

Real-time stability study was performed to evaluate the shelf-life and open-vial stability of the calibrator. Recovery of the controls and the optical control measurements were performed with 3 lots of calibrators at regular intervals over a period of 25 months. The calibrator was stored within the defined temperature limits of $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Acceptance criteria and protocol were provided and found to be acceptable to support the claim for 24 month shelf life stability between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open vial stability was tested on 3 lots over a total period of 189 days. During this period, the open calibrator was stored between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Results met the defined acceptance criteria and supported the claim for 9 week open-vial stability between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Assigned Value:

The ABX PENTRA TPU calibrator is value assigned using an internal procedure by testing the master calibrator material multiple times on multiple days. The calibration of the assay is verified by testing the NIST SRM 927d material and checking acceptable recovery of the NIST material. Each new lot of calibrator material is verified by assaying the new calibrator material with ABX Pentra Urinary Proteins CP reagent on the ABX PENTRA 400 Analyzer and checking if the value is within acceptable limits. The calibrator value is constant for all lots with an expected value of $1 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Acceptance criteria and protocol for assigning the value were provided and found to be acceptable
