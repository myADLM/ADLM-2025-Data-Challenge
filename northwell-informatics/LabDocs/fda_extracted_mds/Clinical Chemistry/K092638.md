# Description of the Device:

A chemistry change has been made to the FreeStyle Blood Glucose Test Strip. The modified strip is to be marketed under the brand name, FreeStyle, and is intended for use with the following Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems:

FreeStyle 3 Blood Glucose Monitoring System • FreeStyle 5 Blood Glucose Monitoring System √ FreeStyle Flash Blood Glucose Monitoring System FreeStyle Freedom Blood Glucose Monitoring System

The meters and other system components contained within these systems have not been modified. Each of the aforementioned blood glucose monitoring systems are comprised of a handheld glucose meter, glucose reagent test strips, a quality control solution, a lancing device, lancets, lancing cap, and labeling for performing a blood glucose test. The intended uses and principles of operation for each of the systems remains the same as previously submitted and cleared for market entry. The systems utilize coulometric biosensor technology to quantitatively measure glucose concentration in whole blood samples. The systems are intended for selfmonitoring of glucose in capillary whole blood. The primary users are persons with diabetes. The systems are meant to aid in diabetes management and for healthcare professionals to aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes treatment. The FreeStyle Blood Glucose Test Strip is an electrochemical biosensor that fits into a handheld meter. When the strip is touched to a blood drop, the sample chamber on the strip fills by capillary action. The blood sample volume is approximately 0.3 microliters (300 nanoliters), which can be obtained from the finger, or palm or upper arm. Test results display in accordance with the blood glucose meter's software algorithm (approximately 15 seconds, 7 seconds, or 5 seconds). The internal volume of the test strip is precisely controlled, and a blood glucose result will not be displayed on the meter unless the internal sample chamber is filled. Once the measurement begins, the glucose is rapidly oxidized by the reagents that are present in the inside of the sample chamber. The electrochemical signal that results from this process depends only on the total amount of glucose present. The reagent chemistry enables electrolysis of glucose in the blood sample. A mediator molecule shuttles electrons rapidly between a glucose-oxidizing enzyme and the working electrode on the strip. The mediator is capable of reacting rapidly with both the electrode and the enzyme, resulting in a fast reaction time and minimizing the total amount of mediator required. The small mediator load results in high accuracy at the low end of the glucose measurement range.

# Description of Modifications:

The modifications to the system are comprised of changes to the blood glucose test strip which include chemistry, materials, appearance, and modification of the meter turn-on bar.

# Chemistry:

The FreeStyle Blood Glucose Test Strip chemistry for the new enzyme test strip is changed from GDH-PQQ with nPBI mediator (Osmium complex with n-pentyl benzimidazole ligand), to GDH-FAD with MAP mediator (ligand of mediator has changed to n-methyl pyridine). GDHFAD does not show intereference in the presence of carbohydrates such as maltose, lactose and galactose as compared with assays performed with GDH-PQQ. The n-pentyl benzimidazole

ligand of the mediator has changed to n-methyl pyridine and a new source of carbon ink is used to make the new enzyme chemistry compatible with on-market meters.

# Materials:

The modified FreeStyle Blood Glucose Test Strip will utilize the same materials as the current FreeStyle Blood Glucose Test Strip, with the exception of the spacer tape and source of carbon. A new adhesive system is utilized as the spacer tape. The new spacer tape uses the exact same base polymer resin as the current FreeStyle Test Strip adhesive coupled with a different crosslinking agent. Screen printed carbon electrodes are made using DuPont carbon ink instead of Ercon carbon. All other materials in the modified FreeStyle Blood Glucose Test Strip, (that is, the melinex and the silver/silver chloride ink) are exactly the same as those used in the FreeStyle Test Strip, currently being marketed.

# Appearance:

The physical appearance of the test strip has been changed to aid customers in distinguishing visually between the new enzyme version of the product and the current on-market product.

# Meter Turn On Bar:

Blood Glucose Test Strips that are branded, FreeStyle, will have a modified turn on bar but will continue to require the same user interface coding activities as those currently available in the market. Only those strips meeting the manufacturing calibration slope and intercept for current FreeStyle meters (Code 16) will enter the market.

Dear Arul Sterlin:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
