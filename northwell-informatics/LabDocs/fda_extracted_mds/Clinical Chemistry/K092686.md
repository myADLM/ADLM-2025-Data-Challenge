# 5. Device Description

The ABL90 FLEX system consists of a modular analyzer Incorporating a user interface module with a large colour touch screen interfacing the analyzer electronic and fluidic modules. The user interface module contains the analyzer CPU and all of the required electronic interfaces for external communication and data storage.

Sensors that measure pH, $p 0 _ { 2 } , p \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 } ,$ potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride, glucose and lactate are contained in a sensor cassette that connects to the sample inlet. This cassette attaches to the front of the instrument.

An oximetry module measures ctHb, $\ S O _ { 2 }$ FO2Hb, FCOHb, FMetHb and FHHb. This module consists of a spectrometer, an ultrasonic hemolyzer and thermostatic components integrated into the instrument.

The system also includes a solution pack for the calibration and automatic quality control of the sensor and oximetry system. The solution pack includes calibration,and quality control reagents individually packaged in sealed foil pouches.

The instument and consmables incorporate "smart hip" technology or nique dentifation and lot-specific calibration and quality control data.

# 6. Intended Use

The ABL90 FLEX is a portable, automated analyzer that measures pH, blood gases, electrolytes, glucose, lactate and oximetry in whole blood. The ABL90 FLEX is intended for use by trained technologists, nurses, physicians and therapists. It is intended for use in a laboratory environment, near patient or point-of-care setting.

# 7. Substantial Equivalence

The ABL90 FLEX is substantially equivalent in features and characteristics to the predicates: the ABL80 FLEX Co-Ox, the ABL800 FLEX, the ABL735, the NPT7 and the QUALICHECK5†.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket apval pplicatnAoumay, heeremarke he devisubject e controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can  unin Te 1, Code Federal Regulatons CFR), Parts 800 t  In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number: k092686

Device Name: ABL90 FLEX

Indication For Use:

The ABL90 FLEX is a portable, automated analyzer that measures pH, blood gases, electrolytes, glucose, lactate and oximetry in heparinized whole blood. The ABL90 FLEX is intended for use by trained technologists, nurses, physicians and therapists. It is intended for use in a laboratory environment, near patient or point-of-care setting.

These tests are only performed under a physician's order:

pH, p02 and ${ \mathfrak { p C O 2 } } : { \mathfrak { p H } }$ , pCO2 and p02 measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.

Potassium (cK+): potassium measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.

Sodium (cNa+): sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease, dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.

Calcium (cCa2+): calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of

Prescription Use X And/Or Over the Counter Use (21 CFR Part 801 Subpart D) (21 CFR Part 801 Subpart C)

Chloride (cCl-): chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such a cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.

Glucose (cGlu): glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus and idiopathic. hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.

Lactate (cLac): The lactate measurements measure the concentration of lactate in plasma. Lactate measurements are used to evaluate the acid-base status and are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of the blood.)

Total Hemoglobin (ctHb): total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure the hemoglobin content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.

sO2: oxygen saturation, more specifically the ratio between the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus reduced hemoglobin.

FOHb: oxyhemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.

FCOHb: carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the carboxyhemoglobin content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.

FMetHb:methemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.

FHHb: reduced hemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.

Fraction of Fetal Hemoglobin (FHbF): FHbF indicates the amount of fetal hemoglobin.   
FHbF is seldom used clinically.

Prescription Use X (21 CFR Part 801 Subpart D)
