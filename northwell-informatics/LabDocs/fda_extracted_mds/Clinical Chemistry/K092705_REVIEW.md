1. Device Description:

The Abbott $m 2 0 0 0$ System is an instrument platform that automates steps to perform nucleic acid amplification assays from sample processing through amplification, detection, and data reduction. The Abbott $m 2 0 0 0$ System comprises the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ and $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ instruments, which are operated with separate System Control Center (SCC) workstations. Each instrument contains an independent software application; one for the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ and a second for the $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ . The $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ instrument is a floor standing, automated sample preparation system. The m $2 0 0 0 r t$ instrument is a real-time PCR thermal cycler/reader instrument system. Abbott Molecular is the manufacturer of the $\mathrm { m } 2 0 0 0$ System. The principal hardware components that comprise the $\mathrm { m } 2 0 0 0 s p$ and $\mod 2 0 0 0 r t$ were developed by Original Equipment Manufacturer vendors, Tecan Schweiz AG, Mannedorf, Switzerland, and Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, respectively. Abbott Molecular developed the software that is uniquely for use with the $\mathrm { m } 2 0 0 0$ System. The Abbott $m 2 0 0 0$ System software processes sample preparation and amplification/detection protocols based on pre-determined, assay-specific parameters that are contained in individual assay application specification files that are installed on the SCC. The Abbott m2000sp reads and processes bar coded primary sample tubes and processes up to 96 specimens, controls, and calibrators in batch mode. The m2000 System is capable of processing samples from various matrices, depending on the specific assay application. At the completion of the automated sample preparation protocol, the operator seals and manually transfers the PCR plate to the Abbott $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ for nucleic acid detection. Bar code and

$m 2 0 0 0 \ : s p$ data is transferred to the $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ electronically via removable media (i.e., a CD).

2. Principles of Operation:

# The m2000sp

The sample preparation process consists of releasing the nucleic acid target from its native biological source (e.g., lysis of microorganisms) using chaotropic nucleic acid extraction technology, binding of nucleic acids to a solid phase (i.e., magnetic particles) using silica or iron oxide nucleic acid chemistry, separation of the solid phase from the residual lysis solution using magnetic separation technology, washing to remove unwanted materials, and elution or separation of nucleic acid from the solid phase using conventional fluid handling technology.

# The m2000rt

The Abbott $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ is an amplification/detection system that provides real-time PCR technology with fluorescence capability of up to five distinct dyes per reaction. PCR amplifies specific target DNA sequences through the use of reagents containing target-specific oligonucleotide sequences (or primers), individual nucleic acid triphosphate bases and polymerase enzymes. RNA target sequences must first be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences before PCR can occur. The system provides thermal cycling temperature control (the process of cycling the reaction mixture between high and low temperatures) with optical read capability for every cycle throughout the amplification protocol. Temperature control for assay reactions is accomplished by heating or cooling all sample wells in the thermal cycler simultaneously per the assay-specific protocol. The block heating and cooling is controlled by Peltier assemblies in thermal contact with the block. Through the process of thermal cycling, the reagents replicate the target nucleic acid sequence many-fold. Multiple target sequences can be amplified in the same reaction by including the appropriate combination of target specific oligonucleotide primer sequences.

The heated lid assembly is held at a high, constant temperature to prevent condensation on the plate lid. The heated lid assembly also contains optical elements to aid in collection of fluorescent light and suppression of light coming from areas other than individual wells.

Detection of fluorescent dyes in the reaction is accomplished by simultaneously illuminating all wells in the plate using the tungsten-halogen lamp. Light from the tungsten-halogen lamp is directed through an excitation filter and dichroic beamsplitter onto the PCR plate, held securely in place in the thermal block. The excitation light excites fluorescent dyes in each well of the PCR plate. The emitted fluorescence light passes through the dichroic beamsplitter and an emission filter and is detected by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera.

The optical filters inside the $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ are arranged in five excitation/emission filter pairs. The excitation and emission center wavelength and bandpass are designed to preferentially excite individual dyes in the reaction mixture. The filter wheel assembly is indexed during the read process to measure fluorescence through each of the five filter pairs. Up to five dye signals may be monitored in each sample well of the PCR plate. The thermal and optical detection system is under computer control and monitored for proper operation.

An optical reading consists of a set of five fluorescence intensity measurements by a CCD camera, one for each of the five filter assembly modules (positioned on a five-position rotating assembly). The five pairs of filters are calibrated for their response to each dye used in the assay using calibration dye plates. The choice of filters allows for the use of the following dyes on the system: FAM™, SYBR® Green, $\mathrm { V I C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ , NED™, TAMRA™, JOE™, $\mathrm { R O X T M }$ , and $\mathrm { C Y } ^ { \mathrm { T M } } 5$ . A typical amplification/detection protocol for a DNA assay lasts about 120 minutes. RNA assays run about 30 minutes longer due to the reverse transcription step.

# 3. Modes of Operation:

The Abbott $m 2 0 0 0$ System is an automated, open tube, batch analyzer. Samples are prepared for nucleic acid testing by the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ through user initiated protocols run on the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ liquid handling platform using specific reagents. Using the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ software, users can select a Master Mix addition protocol to automatically distribute the assay reagents and extracted nucleic acid specimens into an Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction plate, which must be manually loaded onto the $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ instrument. Sample IDs and processing status for each specimen are electronically transferred to the $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ from the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ and linked to the PCR plate ID. The samples are then amplified and analyzed by the $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ through fluorescent-based real-time PCR using a user initiated protocol associated with the sample preparation protocol run on the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ selected by plate ID.

The specific protocols that are performed on each instrument for IVD assays depend upon the assay-specific, closed-mode application specifications that are installed on the System. For closed mode assays, the assay protocol selected when initiating the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ run automatically establishes the protocol to be run on the $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ system. The $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ and $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ instruments are also capable of performing laboratory-defined (user-validated) applications. The $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ instrument is capable of performing sample extractions for open-mode protocols. The $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ instrument is capable of PCR thermal cycling and real-time reading for laboratory-defined applications. Any special requirements or system restrictions for specific open-mode protocols would be communicated upon installation of the protocol. The FDA is not reviewing, clearing or approving any of the open-mode/laboratory-defined functionalities and requires documentation and evidence that these functionalities do not interfere with IVD functionalities.

4. Specimen Identification:

Samples are identified by the bar code label on the primary sample tube, which is read by the m2000sp Positive ID Bar Code Reader (PosID). The system identifies the location of the sample by reading the bar coded sample rack ID and the bar coded sample tube IDs as a function of the positions in the rack. The sample location and sample ID map are then electronically transferred to the $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ linked to the PCR plate ID, along with reagent data and the prepared PCR plate.

# 5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specific mixing protocols depend on the application specifications of the assay being used on the $m 2 0 0 0$ System. Mixing, if necessary, is performed by pipetting using the Liquid Handling Arm (LiHa). The LiHa pipettes, dilutes, and mixes samples and reagents by aspirating and dispensing liquid through eight different channels, using disposable tips (DiTis).

Specimens are sampled by direct open tube and transferred automatically by the LiHa from the sample input tubes to Reaction vessels (RVs) in the $1 \mathrm { m L }$ subsystem, then to the output plates of the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ . Sample input tubes can be primary tubes or secondary aliquot tubes.

6. Calibration:

The calibration for the $m 2 0 0 0$ system consists of an assay independent optical calibration and an assay specific assay calibration, each described below.

# Abbott $\pmb { m } 2 \pmb { 0 } \pmb { 0 } \pmb { 0 } \pmb { r t }$ Optical Calibration

The $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ instrument extracts dye fluorescence data from digital images. Four sets of optical calibration data are used in this data extraction process:

Region of Interest (ROI) data, specifying what portions of the digital images correspond to the 96 reaction wells of the PCR plate. Background fluorescence data, indicating the signal from each well with no fluorescent dye present. Pure dye spectral data, indicating the relative signal intensity for the five optical filter channels when fluorescence of a single pure dye is measured. • Uniformity data, indicating the signal intensity of a given well relative to the other wells for a uniform plate.

These optical data sets are acquired during the optical calibration process. Their execution involves using the Abbott $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ Optical Calibration Kit, List No. 4J71-93. This kit contains ten 96-well PCR plates as follows:

A ROI calibration plate, with five dyes in each well. This is used for both the ROI calibration and the uniformity calibration.   
A background plate, with non-fluorescent buffer in each well. Water or diluent in a normal PCR plate may also be used for background   
calibrations.   
Eight pure dye calibration plates, each with wells filled with a specific dye (FAM, VIC, NED, ROX, Cy5, SYBR, JOE, or TAMRA), used for the pure dye spectral calibration.

Optical calibrations are performed at installation, when the lamp is changed, and after six months. Background calibrations are also performed monthly.

# Assay Calibration

Abbott RealTime assays are calibrated by processing calibrators as samples on the $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ and $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ instrument.

Quantitative assays require between two and ten calibrators, as specified by the assay, to yield a log-linear calibration curve (cycle number vs. log of calibrator concentration). Quantitative calibration curves must satisfy slope and y-intercept validity criteria specified for each assay. Assays must be recalibrated for each lot of assay reagents and as directed by assay reagent labeling.

Qualitative assays use cutoff controls with each batch of samples, from which the qualitative criteria are determined. The number of valid cutoff controls and mean cutoff control cycle number must meet validity criteria specified by the assay.

7. Quality Control:

Quality control is addressed for each separately cleared specific assay to be run on the instrument.
