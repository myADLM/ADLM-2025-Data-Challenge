# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT Folate assay is a two-step competitive assay for the quantitative determination of folate in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. Two pre-treatment steps mediate the release of folate from endogenous folate binding protein. In Pre-Treatment Step 1, sample and Pre

Treatment Reagent 2 (Dithiothreitol or DTT) are aspirated and dispensed into a reaction vessel (RV). In Pre-Treatment Step 2, an aliquot of sample/ Pre-Treatment Reagent 2 mixture is aspirated and dispensed into a second RV. Pre-Treatment Reagent1 (potassium hydroxide or KOH) is then added. An aliquot of the pre-treated sample is transferred into a third RV, followed by the addition of Folate Binding Protein (FBP) coated paramagnetic microparticles and assay specific diluent. Folate present in the sample binds to the FBP coated microparticles. After washing, pteroic acid-acridinium labeled conjugate is added and binds to unoccupied sites on the FBPcoated microparticles. Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An inverse relationship exists between the amount of folate in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i$ optical system.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

All performance characteristics were done on the Architect i 2000 SR analyzer.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were evaluated using CLSI EP5-A2 as a guideline. The sponsor conducted within-run, between-run, between-day, and total precision with three serum controls and three serum panels. All samples were tested in replicates of 3, in two runs per day, for a minimum of 20 days. Two lots of reagents were used and results are shown below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were evaluated using the CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. A low serum pool sample and a high serum pool sample were mixed to create interdilutions of 11 mixed serum samples for the linearity study. All samples were tested in duplicates on the Architect i 2000SR analyzer. The recovered folate values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was performed. The percent recovery of all the samples ranged from $9 7 . 5 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 8 \%$ . The linear equation generated is $\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 0 6 2 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 3 4 2$ with regression coefficient $( \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } )$ of 0.999.

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed that the assay is linear from 1.6 to $2 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Extended dilution study:

If serum folate is greater than $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , the analyzer can perform an autodilution of 1:2. To demonstrate the recovery of the auto-dilution capability of the analyzer, a dilution recover study was performed to evaluate the autodilution capability. 18 serum samples with folate values ranging from 20 to $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were automatically diluted by 1:2 and results were compared with the manual dilution of 1:2 and 1:4. All samples were tested in triplicate. The percent recovery of all the samples ranged from $9 8 . 5 \%$ to $1 1 9 . 6 \%$ when autodilution of 1:2 was compared to manual-dilution of 1:2. Based on the data, the sponsor concluded that when results are greater than $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , the user can either perform a manual 1:2 or a 1:4 dilution or use the analyzer to automatically dilute the sample by 1:2 to get the final results.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

ARCHITECT Folate assay is traceable to the WHO serum folate International Standard 03/178.

Value assignment:

Architect folate assay calibrators and controls are manufactured using pteroylglutamic acid (PGA or folic acid) and the concentration values are assigned against internal reference standards. The internal reference standards are assigned against the WHO serum folate International standard 03/178. The concentration values of the working reference calibrators and controls were assigned by testing multiple times on three instruments using two lots of reagents. The sponsor’s protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Stability:

ARCHITECT Folate assay utilize a six-level calibrators, calibrators A to F with assigned target values. Calibrators must be stored in the carton box to protect them from light. Stability of the calibrators is determined by the realtime stability study and is still on-going. The sponsor determined that the calibrators have a shelf-life stability of 10 months when stored at ${ \le } { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and an open-vial stability of 3 months when stored at $\mathrm { \leq - 1 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Calibrators must be discarded after 3 freeze-thaw cycle.

ARCHITECT Folate controls contain 3 levels of control materials, low, medium, and high. Controls must be stored in the carton box to protect them from light. Stability of the calibrators is determined by accelerated life testing and the real-time stability study is still on-going. The sponsor determined that the controls has a shelf-life stability of 18 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and an open-vial stability of 3 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C }$ .

The sponsor’s protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Recommendations in the labeling for preparation of calibrator and control materials include the following: calibrators and controls must be completely thawed before use at room temperature for at least 45 minutes and mixed gently before use.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor determined the detection limits according to the CLSI EP 17-A guideline. Limit of detection is defined as the lowest amount of analyte that can be detected. Limit of Quantitation is defined as the lowest concentration at which the analyte is reliably detected and at which the uncertainty of the observed test result is less than or equal to the goal set. The LoB, LoD, and

LoQ were determined by assaying one blank sample 80 times and five low folate samples in replicates of 80 on two instruments over 3 days. All the samples were assayed on the ARCHITECT i 2000SR analyzer. The sponsor determined that the LoB is $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , LoD is $0 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and LoQ is 2.0 $\mathrm { n g / d L }$ at the observed total error of $20 \%$ .

The ARCHITECT folate assay has a linearity range of 1.6 to $2 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were evaluated according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Two different levels of folate samples were spiked with one level of potential interferants. The test (spiked) samples and reference (unspiked) samples were assayed in replicates of 38 on the ARCHITECT i 2000SR analyzer. The differences between the spiked and unspiked samples were calculated and the sponsor defined no significant interference as differences of $< 1 0 \%$ with folate levels ${ > } 3 . 5 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $\leq 0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for folate levels $\leq 3 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Based on the data, the sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and concentrations listed in the table below:

It is well-known that hemolysis falsely elevated the serum folate results; therefore, the sponsor has the following limitation in their package insert: “Do not use hemolyzed specimens. Serum or plasma specimens that are hemolyzed will give falsely elevated folate levels.”

Cross-reactivity: Aminopterin, Folinic acid, and Methotrexate are chemotherapeutic agents whose structures are similar to folate and will crossreact with the folate assay and patients who are using these drugs should not have their folate tested with Architect folate assay. Therefore, the sponsor has the following limitation in their package insert:

“Methotrexate, aminopterin, and folinic acid (Leucovorin) are chemotherapeutic agents whose molecular structures are similar to folate. These agents cross react with folate binding protein in folate assays. Do not use the Architect folate assay for patients using these drugs”.

Cross-reactivity studies were performed and the results are listed below.

Additionally, the sponsor has the following statements in the limitation section of their labeling:

“Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain human antimouse antibodies (HAMA). Such specimens may show either falsely elevated or depressed values when tested with assay kits that employ mouse monoclonal antibodies.”

“Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed.”

“Serum and plasma specimens from patients with renal impairment or failure (including dialysis patients) may exhibit varying degrees of falsely depressed folate values. Therefore, to evaluate patients with renal impairment or failure who also exhibit low folate levels, it is recommended that low ARCHITECT folate values be confirmed by an alternate folate method.”
