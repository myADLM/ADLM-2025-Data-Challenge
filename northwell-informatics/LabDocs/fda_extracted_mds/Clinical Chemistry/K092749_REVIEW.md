# I. Device Description:

The $\mathrm { M A S @ }$ PTH Control and Moni-Trol $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PTH Control are liquid stable control materials prepared from human serum. Components of the controls which are derived from human source material have been tested using FDA accepted methods and found non-reactive for Hepatitis B Surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C (HCV), HIV-1 and HIV-2. Analyte levels are adjusted with various pure chemicals and preparations from human tissue or bodily fluids. Preservatives and stabilizers are added to maintain product integrity. Three levels of control are available and are provided ready to use. Each kit will contain 6 vials each: 2 vials of Level 1, 2 vials of Level 2, and 2 vials of Level 3. Each vial contains 3 mLs. The MAS and Moni-Trol products are the same.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The stability studies were performed using the Roche COBAS PTH reagents on the Roche Elecsys 2010 analyser. All studies that were performed were done so using three lots of the control material.

Open vial stability:

Three lots of PTH control, each lot at three different levels were used. For each lot and level vials were opened on day 0, stored at $5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , and tested at different time points for up to 42 days.

The recommended claim based on the data is 30 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Closed vial stability:

Three lots of PTH control, each lot at three different levels were used. For each lot and level, unopened vials were stored at $5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , and tested at multiple time points for up to 90 days.

The recommended claim based on the data is 90 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Shelf-Life stability:

The Arrhenius model was applied using stress data to establish the frozen - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ shelf life claim. Three lots, each lot at three different levels were used for the study. For each lot and level, product was stressed at elevated temperatures of $4 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 14 days, and $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 28 days. Multiple time points were tested and point of failure was determined by linear regression. The recommended claim based on the data is 24 months frozen at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

# Value assignment:

Value assignment ranges are established $20 \%$ around the mean. Control ranges are provided as guidelines until the laboratory has established its own statistical limits. The values are based on replicate assays of representative samples by participating laboratories in accordance with established protocol. Twenty replicates per level per analyte over a period of 10 days were run on 4 instruments. Means established by individual laboratories should fall within the corresponding acceptable range. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use those provided only as guides.

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
$f .$ Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable
