# English

# Intended use

The Elecsys Toxo $\mathsf { I g G }$ CalCheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration verification and for use in the verification of the assay range established by the Elecsys Toxo IgG reagent on the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

# Summary

Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5 set contains 5 lyophilized levels of human anti-Toxo IgG antibodies in a solution of human serum protein and has the appropriate matrix characteristics for the analyte. The solutions assist in the documentation of calibration verification and verification of the assay range.

# Principle

Calibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay systems based on the manufacturer's recommendations. However, in instances where such a test procedure is required by certification agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification, these CalCheck 5 solutions provide an appropriate material for such testing. College of American Pathologists, CAP, defines Calibration Verification by referring to two distinct processes: 1) validation of the current method calibration and 2) validation of the reportable range. CAP defines the ANALYTICAL MEASUREMENT RANGE (AMR) as the range of analyte values that a method can directly measure on the specimen without any dilution, concentration, or other pretreatment not part of the usual assay process.'

# Reagents - working solutions

Each bottle, reconstituted to 1.0 mL   
Reactive ingredient (after reconstitution):   
Toxo IgG antibody positive human serum in human serum matrix

# Precautions and warnings

For in vitro diagnostic use.

Exercise the normal precautions required for handling all laboratory reagents. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines. Safety data sheet available for professional user on request. All human material should be considered potentially infectious. All products derived from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A. However, as no testing method can rule out the potential risk of infection with absolute certainty, the material should be treated just as carefully as a patient specimen. in the event of exposure the directives of the responsible health authorities should be followed.2,3 Avoid the formation of foam with all reagents and sample types (specimens, calibrators, and controls).

# 1Reagent handling

Reconstitute the contents of Check 1, Check 2, Check 3, Check 4 and Check 5 with exactly 1.0 mL distilled or deionized water. Allow the bottles to stand closed for 15 minutes. Mix gently by inversion to ensure homogeneity. Refer to the lot-specific value sheet located on www.MyLabOnline.com for any lot-specific reconstitution changes.

# Storage and stability

Store unopened at $2 . 8 ~ \circ C$ .   
Stabiliy unopened: up to the expiration date printed on the bottle labels at $2 . 8 ~ \circ _ { C }$ .   
Stability reconstituted: 4 hours at $2 0 . 2 5 \cdot \textcircled { 1 }$ .

Dear Ms. Phillips:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devics that have been rcassifie accordance with the provisionsf the Federal Food Dru, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
