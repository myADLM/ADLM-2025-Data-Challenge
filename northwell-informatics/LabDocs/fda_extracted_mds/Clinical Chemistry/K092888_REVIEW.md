# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

This 510(k) Premarket Notification was prepared and referenced the guidance document, “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material: (June 7, 2007)”

# l. Test Principle:

Not applicable – Calibrator

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To verify the reportable range of the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 or cobas e analyzers using Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5, a dilution study was performed using the Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck Levels 1 and 5.

# Dilution Study

CalCheck 1,CalCheck 2, CalCheck 4 and CalCheck 5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in two-fold determination. The average was then calculated. The predetermined specification was that the diluted value had to fall within the measuring range.

Results showed that CalCheck dilution values were within the assay‘s measuring range after dilution, as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Value after 1:1Dilution [IU/mL]</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Average 1:1Dilution [IU/mL]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CalCheck 1 + CalCheck 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.72</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>1.68</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CalCheck 1 + CalCheck 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.64</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CalCheck 4 + CalCheck 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>545</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>527.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CalCheck 4 + CalCheck 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>510</td></tr></table>

Both CalCheck dilution values are within the assay‘s measuring range after dilution.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods)

The Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck is standardized against the same master calibration curve as the calibrators used for the Elecsys Toxo IgG test system (Elecsys Toxo IgG Reagent and Calibrators, k073501). Serum/plasma comparisons performed demonstrate equivalency of the specimen types. Please refer to pages 62-71 of the original Elecsys Toxo IgG Test System submission, K073501, for this information.

# Analyte Value Assignment

Values for Toxo IgG CalCheck 5 were calibrated against the WHO anti-Toxoplasma serum (TOXM), 3rd International Standard for T. gondii from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), UK. Values are assigned using a minimum of four Elecsys 2010/ cobas e 411 analyzers and four MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/ cobas e601 analyzers. Two independent series of analyses are performed for each instrument. The target value of each CalCheck is the median over 6 -8 series (i.e., 0.175 - 650 IU/mL) of the respective CalCheck.

# Stability

Open Vial Stability and Accelerated stability studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims for the Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5. The data was generated using Toxo IgG master calibrators, which have the same composition and target values as Toxo IgG CalCheck 5.

# Open Vial Stability:

The Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5 test material and reference material were tested in duplicate. The test material was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (in an

open vial). The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5. The recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference value.

The acceptance criterion is recovery of $90 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of the reference material value.

The results for the Reconstituted (Open Vial) Stability for Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5 were as follows:

The data support the package insert claims that reconstituted Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Accelerated Stability

The Elecsys Toxi IgG CalCheck 5 test material was stored at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The acceptance criterion was recovery of $90 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of the reference material value.

Results for accelerated stability studies were as follows:

<table><tr><td>Sample</td><td>Mean (IU/mL)</td><td>Percent of Reference</td></tr><tr><td>Reference:</td><td>3 weeks at 2-8°C</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Level 1</td><td>0.06</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>2.79</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Level 3</td><td>319</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Level 4</td><td>497</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Level 5</td><td>622</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

The accelerated stability model employed supports a shelf-life claim of 29 months when the Toxo IgG CalCheck 5 materials are stored under normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable, Calibrator material with assigned values..

e. Analytical specificity:

Not applicable.

f. Assay cut-off:

The assay cut-off was determined using master calibrators for the assay that has values assigned that are traceable to the World Health Organizations (WHO) standards. The sponsor used the WHO anti-Toxoplasma serum (TOXM), 3rd International Standard for $T .$ . gondii from NIBSC, UK. Two independent series of analyzes were performed on the Elecsys 2010, cobas e 411, and the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/ cobas e601 analyzers. The samples were run in duplicate and the target values were calculated as the median of the determined values. This fulfils the requirements of demonstrating a target values for the Toxo IgG CalCheck levels calibrators.
