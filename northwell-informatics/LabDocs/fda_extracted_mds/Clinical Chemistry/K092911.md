# Description of the Device:

SMART HbA1c Assay Kit contains reagents intended for use with the SMART HbA1c analyzer for the quantitative determination of stable HbAlc in human whole blood samples. Measurement of hemoglobin Alc is a valuable indicator for long-term diabetic control. SMART HbAlc assay reagents are similar to the predicate Direct Enzymatic HbAlc assay reagents (k070734). The similarities and differences in composition and format are noted in Table 1 below. The SMART HbA1c test is an enzymatic assay in which lysed whole blood samples are subjected to extensive protease digestion with Bacillus sp protease. This process releases amino acids including glycated valines from the hemoglobin beta chains. Glycated valines then serve as substrates for specific recombinant fructosyl valine oxidase (FVO) enzyme, produced in $E$ coli. The recombinant FVO specifically cleaves N-terminal valines and produces hydrogen peroxide. This, in turn, is measured using a horseradish peroxidase (POD) catalyzed reaction and a suitable chromagen. The HbA1c concentration is expressed directly as %HbAlc by use of a lot specific calibration curve that is stored in an RFID card provided with each SMART test kit. The manufacturer of the SMART HbA1c Assay kit is Diazyme Laboratories.

SMART HbAlc Assay Control Kit is intended for use as quality controls for the SMART HbAlc Assay Reagents and is packaged separately. The QC materials were pre market cleared with predicate device (k070734, k050178) and each lot of SMART HbAlc control kits will be tested with the SMART system during value assignment. The quality controls assist laboratory users in verification steps ensuring that the assay reagents are functioning correctly. QC materials are run exactly as samples. Users are instructed to verify the calibration curve with the controls and run controls each time a new lot of reagents are received. If QC materials fall outside laboratory acceptable range, users are instructed to re-test and call manufacturer customer service if problem persists. The manufacturer of the SMART HbA1c Assay Control kit is Diazyme Laboratories.

SMART HbA1c analyzer is a compact cuvette based spectrophotometer (10 inches x 5.5 inches $\tt { x 5 . 5 }$ inches) machine for point-of-care testing designed to analyze readings from single use reagent cuvettes. The instrument only uses the Diazyme Reagent System (DRS) cuvettes and caps and performs assay with a preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card. The DRS cuvette is supplied prefilled with R1a and the DRS cap is supplied prefilled with R2. The DRS cuvette and caps are kept separate until use. Users are instructed (see proposed labeling) to prepare hemolysate samples in micro tubes prefilled with Lysis buffer and prepare R1ab mix by transferring R1b from supplied bottle to cuvette. Users are then instructed to transfer hemolysate to cuvette, snap in place DRS cap and insert into analyzer. The instrument warms the cuvette to 37C and after a predefined period adds the second reagent found in the DRS cap. The reagents and samples are mixed magnetically and absorbance readings are taken at $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ The lot specific RFID card contains reagent addition time, mixing time, reading time and calibration curve.

The SMART analyzers are manufactured for Diazyme Laboratories by Eurolyser Diagnostica, GMBH (Eurolyser Diagnostica GmbH, BayernstraBe 11a, 5020 Salzburg, AUSTRIA;   
www.eurolyser.com; Fon: $+ 4 3$ 662 432100; Fax: $+ 4 3$ 662 432100 50). Eurolyser Diagnostica, GMBH establishment registration number is 3006490192. Eurolyser Diagnostica developed and commercialized the SMART analyzers in Europe with their contract manufacturing partner AKATech, GMBH (AKAtech Produktions- und Handels GmbH, Untermühlberg 1, 4890 Frankenmarkt, AUSTRIA;   
http://www.akatech.at/en/index.php?option com_content&task $\eqcirc$ view&id $_ { = 3 1 }$ &Itemid $= 6 6$ ; Tel.: $+ 4 3$ (7684) 88 04-0; Fax: $+ 4 3$ (7684) 88 04-9). AKATech is ISO13485 and ISO 9001 quality system certified.

The SMART HbA1c Analyzer System thus consists of the following:

1. SMART HbA1c Assay Kit. Reagents are provided in prefilled tubes, cuvettes and cuvette caps. The DRS cuvette and cuvette caps can only work with the SMART HbAlc analyzer.   
2. SMART HbA1c Assay Control Kit. Controls are provided for quality control of the SMART Hbalc assay   
3. SMART Analyzer. SMART analyzer is a compact cuvette based spectrophotometer machine for point-of-care testing, designed to analyze readings from single use SMAR] reagent cuvettes.

# Performance Testing Summaries:

Precision Study Summary

The precision of the SMART HbA1c Assay was evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A guideline with the following modifications: In the study, two unaltered whole blood specimens containing $5 . 6 \%$ and $7 . 4 \%$ HbA1c, one whole blood based HbAlc control containing $1 1 . 5 \%$ HbAlc were tested with 2 runs per day with duplicates over 10 working days. Reagent Lot 1 was used over the first 5 days and Reagent Lot 2 was used over the remaining 5 days. Both lots of reagents were used on three different SMART HbAlc analyzers. The precision evaluation data are listed below:

The mean value (Mean), standard deviation, within run imprecision and total imprecision $C V \%$ are calculated and summarized in the following tables:

The precision of the SMART HbA1c assay was also evaluated in three physician office laboratories (POL) by trained medical technicians to test systemic and random error on three different Diazyme HbA1C SMART analyzers. Two unaltered human whole blood HbA1c specimens containing about $5 . 5 \%$ $7 . 5 \%$ of HbAlc and one whole blood based control containing $1 1 . 5 \%$ EY HbA1c were used. For the three levels of samples tested at the three POL sites, the Diazyme Enzymatic HbA1c SMART assay yielded acceptable precision of $C V \leq 5 \%$ .

Between instrument precision and lot-to-lot variation imprecision studies were also performed on SMART Hbalc analyzers using a panel of 10 blood samples and two levels of blood controls. In both studies, less than $5 \%$ of CV was obtained indicating good lot-to-lot consistency and between instrument precision.

Comparison Study Summary

Human whole blood samples were tested with the SMART HbAlc Assay and results obtained were compared to the predicate method. A total of 64 samples ranging from $4 \%$ HbAlc were tested in both assays. The above described accuracy study showed that the SMART HbAlc assay results correlated well with predicate method with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 with a slope of 0.94 and 0.30 intercept.
