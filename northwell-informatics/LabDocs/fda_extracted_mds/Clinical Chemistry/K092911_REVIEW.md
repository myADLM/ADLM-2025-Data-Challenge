# L. Test Principle:

The SMART HbAlc test is an enzymatic assay in which lysed whole blood samples are subjected to extensive protease digestion with Bacillus $s p$ protease. This process releases amino acids including glycated valines from the hemoglobin beta chains. Glycated valines then serve as substrates for specific recombinant fructosyl valine oxidase (FVO) enzyme, produced in $E$ . coli. The recombinant FVO specifically cleaves N-terminal valines and produces hydrogen peroxide. This, in turn, is measured using a horseradish peroxidase (POD) catalyzed reaction and a suitable chromagen. The HbAlc concentration is expressed directly as $\%$ HbAlc by use of a lot-specific calibration curve that is stored in an RFID card provided with each SMART test kit.

# Lot-to-lot variation

A panel of 10 blood samples with HbA1c values spanning $5 . 2 - 1 1 . 3 \%$ was used in addition to SMART HbA1c Control Set level 1 and Control Set level 2 for lot-to-lot variation study. The blood samples and controls were analyzed in duplicates using three lots of the SMART HbA1c Assay reagents on one single SMART analyzer.

During the study, CVs ranged from $1 . 1 { - } 4 . 3 \%$ indicating lot-to-lot consistency.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Five samples used to obtain linearity data were prepared by dilution of two whole blood samples, DZ Linearity Level 1 and Level 2 with known HbA1c contents of $4 . 2 5 \%$ and $1 2 . 1 \%$ respectively. The linearity set was made according to CLSI Guideline EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach and each sample run in duplicate. One reagent lot and one analyzer were used.

The results of analysis of the data by linear regression are: $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 4 7$ , slope $= 1 . 0 1 1 3$ , and y-intercept $= - 0 . 2 9 8 1$ .

The claimed measuring range is $4 - 1 2 \%$ HbA1c for the SMART HbA1c assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The SMART HbA1c assay has met the requirements of the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification requires annual renewal. The current list of NGSP certified methods is available on the NGSP website at: http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html

# Calibration Radio Frequency Identification Card (RFID card)

SMART HbA1c Assay utilizes a RFID card that is preprogrammed with a reagent lo specific calibration curve and is supplied in each kit. When RFID card is inserted into SMART analyzer slot (assay procedure step), the lot specific calibration curve is automatically utilized for assay test. RFID cards are programmed at manufacturer site. The assay lot specific calibration curve is generated by experimental data generation using human whole blood calibrator set traced to reference calibrators. RFID calibration curve generation is described in the following steps.

1) Two level human whole blood hemolysates are tested with the Tosoh G7 HPLC method to determine initial $\%$ HbA1c values. The Tosoh G7 HbA1c HPLC method is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP, University of Missouri School of Medicine).

2) Lot specific SMART HbA1c assay reagents are used with the bi-level calibration material, to test $> 3 0$ fresh human whole blood samples and quality control materials. The human whole blood samples are previously tested with the Tosoh’s G7 HbA1c HPLC method and other assay methods. Three different instruments are used in the analysis.

3) Calibrator values are adjusted to meet the acceptance criteria and final calibration curve with a point-to-point least squares fit equation. Calibration curve values representing change in absorbance slope versus $\mathrm { H b A l c \% }$ levels are programmed into cards with the use of a card writer. RFID cards are subject to the same quality system checks as reagents and controls. Values are given in NGSP/DCCT value system. The IFCC values corresponding to NGSP/DCCT values of samples can be determined by use of published conversion formula: $\mathrm { N G S P } = 0 . 9 1 5 \times ( \mathrm { I F C C } ) + 2 . 1 5$

# SMART HbA1c Control set

The controls are made of human whole blood and are in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) state. The control set are value assigned as follows.

1) Two level human whole blood hemolysates are tested with the Tosoh G7 HPLC method to determine initial $\%$ HbA1c values. The Tosoh G7 HbA1c HPLC method is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP, University of Missouri School of Medicine).

2) With a reference lot of SMART HbA1c Assay Reagent Kits, the bi-level control material (target ranges are $5 . 5 - 6 . 5 \%$ for the low control and $7 . 5 - 9 . 5 \%$ for the high control) is then subjected to extensive replicate analysis using one SMART analyzer to obtain mean values and a range. Range criteria: Deviation from the target value of $< 2 0 \%$ for control level 1 (normal) and control level 2 (high). Values are given in NGSP/DCCT value system. The IFCC values corresponding to NGSP/DCCT values of samples can be determined by use of published conversion formula: $\mathrm { N G S P } = 0 . 9 1 5$ $\times \ : ( \mathrm { I F C C } ) + 2 . 1 5$

# Stability

Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored unopened at $2 { - } 8 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ , the

SMART HbA1c assay kit is valid for 6 months and the SMART HbA1c control set is valid for 12 months. Reconstituted controls are stable for 14 days when capped tightly and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

To establish the limit of detection for the SMART assay, a modified protocol was used. The SMART HbA1c Assay measures HbA1c normalized to hemoglobin and the reagents are comprised of redox balanced agents. Sample dilution with water or saline is not acceptable. Therefore, additional simple precision studies were conducted at the lower end of the measuring range $( 4 \mathrm { - } 1 2 \% )$ . In one experiment, a whole blood sample containing $6 \%$ HbA1c was diluted by half with redox balanced buffer to $3 \%$ HbA1c and tested on SMART analyzer in 12 replicates.

The limit of detection is calculated to be the mean $+ 3 \mathrm { S D } = 3 . 9 2 \%$ HbA1c which is below the measuring range $( 4 \mathrm { - } 1 2 \% )$ . Samples below the measuring range are reported as ${ < } 4 \%$ by the SMART Analyzer.

To further verify the precision of the SMART HbA1c Assay at the lower end of the measuring range, a blood sample containing $4 \%$ HbA1c was tested on SMART analyzer in 10 replicates in a simple precision test.

# e. Analytical specificity:

To determine the level of interference from the substances normally present in whole blood, SMART HbA1c Assay was used to test $5 . 5 \%$ and $1 1 . 0 \%$ HbA1C whole blood samples spiked with various concentrations of substances following CLSI Guideline EP7-A: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry dose-response guidelines.

The following substances normally present in the blood produced less than $10 \%$ deviation when tested at levels equal to the concentrations listed below:

In order to evaluate whether SMART HbA1c Assay is interfered by Hemoglobin AD, AE, AS, AC, and AF variants, samples with hemoglobin variants (AD, AE, AS, AC, AF) were obtained from an NGSP reference lab. Expected HbA1c values for these samples were obtained by standard reference methods known to yield true $\%$ HbA1c values that are unaffected by the variant.

(3) External Comparison of SMART HbA1c Assay using Capillary Blood and Venous Blood

Performance for the SMART HbA1c assay was evaluated at three POL sites with a total of three operators. A total of two reagent lots and four SMART analyzers were tested. About 40-50 volunteers were recruited from each POL site for the study. Both capillary finger stick blood and venous blood were drawn from each donor. The capillary finger stick blood was analyzed with Diazyme SMART analyzer; in the mean time, the venous blood was analyzed using the predicate device (Diazyme Enzymatic HbA1c Assay on the Hitachi 917). 2 samples containing greater than $12 \%$ HbA1c at Site 1 were excluded from the analysis. $9 7 \%$ of the capillary fingerstick results (124 out of 128) obtained with the proposed device were within $\pm 0 . 7 5 \%$ HbA1c of the results obtained the venous samples run on the predicate device. The results of $\mathrm { H b A l c \% }$ of the capillary finger stick blood obtained with the proposed device and $\mathrm { H b A l c \% }$ of venous blood using the predicate device were compared using Passing & Bablok regression plot.

b. Matrix comparison:

SMART HbA1c Assay uses EDTA venous whole blood and finger stick capillary whole blood specimens. See method comparison above.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Non-diabetic individuals have HbA1c values in the range of $4 \%$ using a DCCT based assay.1 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that the primary treatment goal in diabetes should be glycemic control equal to that achieved during the DCCT.1 ADA states that lowering HbA1c to below or around $7 \%$ has been shown to reduce microvascular and neuropathic complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, for microvascular disease prevention, the HbA1c goal for nonpregnant adults in general is $< 7 \%$ HbA1c.1 However, each laboratory must establish its own normal range in their country of business taking into account sex, age and ethnicity. ADA recommends that glycemic control goals should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness and individual patient considerations.1

# N. Instrument Name:

SMART Analyzer

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Smart Analyzer is operated exclusively using the Touch Display. All steps necessary for operation are displayed as symbols. To activate the symbols they have to be touched with the fingers or finger nail.

To process a test, insert the provided RFID card into the analyzer. This card contains all data necessary to perform the routine tests. No measurement can be started without the RFID test card.

The DRS (Diazyme Reagent System) cartridge is inserted in the door that opens automatically upon touch screen input. After input of all requested data and activating the START button on the Touch Display, the lid is automatically closed, and the testing procedure is started. The closed door avoids the intrusion of ambient light, dust, dirt and humidity in the laboratory photometer while the instrument is measuring and when it is not in use.

The analyzing process is fully automated after inserting the cartridge into the analyzer;   
the process starts by closing the analyzer door. Only one cartridge can be run at a time.

Once inside the analyzer, the sample and reagent are mixed automatically. As the reaction starts, changes in absorbance are measured at the correct wavelength and referenced to the calibration data preprogrammed in the RFID card. All assay and lot specific information necessary for the analyzer to process a test is read from the RFID card.

After the measurement is completed, the door opens automatically, and the test cartridge can now be removed. All SMART HbA1c DRS test cartridge are single use and are designed to be disposed after use.

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___x____ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Samples are identified by manually labeling and by logging the patient ID into the analyzer prior to inserting the cartridge into the analyzer, or during the analyzing process.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

A specimen in a single use capped DRS cuvette is inserted into the analyzer and read by the spectrophotometer with no liquid/specimen carryover within the analyzer. Once sample is read, cuvette is removed from the analyzer and disposed of.

5. Calibration:

Calibration Radio Frequency Identification Card (RFID card)

SMART HbA1c Assay utilizes a RFID card that is preprogrammed with a reagent lot specific calibration curve and is supplied in each kit. When RFID card is inserted into SMART analyzer slot (assay procedure step), the lot specific calibration curve is automatically utilized for assay test. RFID cards are programmed at manufacturer site. The assay lot specific calibration curve is generated by experimental data generation using human whole blood calibrator set

6. Quality Control:

The user should perform quality control testing to confirm that the SMART HbA1c Analyzer System is working properly and providing reliable results using the SMART HbA1c control set. Additionally, the instrument contains internal checks for detecting electronic, mechanical, and sample problems.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
