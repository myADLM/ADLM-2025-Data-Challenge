# 510(k) Summary

HBPM/LMWH into a single kit. Thus, the primary difference between the subject product and predicate devices is that it contains a set of calibration plasmas for calibration of assays of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) bundled together in a single kit.

# Indication/Intended Use:

The STA® - Hybrid Hep Calibrator is a set of calibrator plasmas intended for use with analyzers of the $\hat { \mathbf { S } \mathrm { T } \mathbf { A } } ^ { \mathfrak { D } }$ line suitable to thee agents, r he calirati o heparn (UFH and LMWH) activiy assay by measuring the antiXa activiy usig the chromogenic method, STA® - Rotachrom® Heparin.

# Technological Characteristics:

The $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { Q } }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator is a set of lyophilized human plasmas used to create he calibration curve $\ S \mathbf { T A } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ line of IVD instruments performing the chromogenic method for heparin (UFH and LMWH) assays.

Each $\operatorname { s r } \mathbf { A } ^ { \otimes }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator available contains:

$4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 { \cdot } \mathrm { m l }$ vials of Reagent $1 { : } \operatorname { S T A } ^ { \circledast }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator $\textcircled{0}$ , lyophilized human plasma free of heparin.   
0 $4 \times 1 { - } \mathrm { m l }$ vials of Reagent 2: $\ S \mathrm { T A } ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator $\textcircled{3}$ lyophilized human plasma containing a well-defined quantity of UFH.   
0 $4 \times 1 { \cdot } \mathrm { m l }$ vials of Reagent 3: STA® - Hybrid Hep Calibrator $\textcircled{6}$ lyophilized human plasma containing a well-defined quantity of UFH that is greater than that of Reagent 2.   
0 $4 \times 1 { - } \mathsf { m l }$ vials of Reagent 4: STA® - Hybrid Hep Calibrator $\textcircled{9}$ , lyophilized human plasma containing a well-defined quantity of LMWH.   
0 $4 \times 1 { \cdot } \mathrm { m l }$ vials of Reagent 5: STA® - Hybrid Hep Calibrator $\textcircled { 1 8 }$ , lyophilized human plasma containing a well-defined quantity of LMWH that is greater than that of Reagent 4.

# Principles of Operation

The $\ S \mathrm { T A } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator is designed to perate utilizing the $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ product line of IVD coagulation analyzers for the purpose of creating calibration curves for assays of heparin by measuring the anti-Xa activity. While the subject device performs calibration of assays based on chromogenic method, the predicate devices perform calibration of assays based on chromogenic method and on clotting method, both being anti- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { X } \mathbf { a }$ EY method.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator, the subject product of this submission, and the predicate devices, STA - Calibrator HBPM/LMWH Kit and $\mathbf { S T A } ^ { \otimes }$ - Hepanorm ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { o } } \mathrm { H }$ are identical products regarding indication/intended use, formulation or materials of construction and design, technology, and safety. The primary difference between the subject product and predicate devices is that the product contains a set of calibration plasmas for assays of both unfractionated heparin (UFH) and Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) bundled in a single kit whereas the predicate devices are marketed as two (2) separate and distinct products  one kit for UFH and the other kit for LMWH. In summary, the predicate devices are bundled together as a single kit. The $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { o } }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator like the predicate devices, is a calibrator used in creating the calibration curve on IVD devices for the purpose of Heparin activity assay by measuring the anti-Xa activity.

The product, $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { W } }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator and the predicate devices, $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak {otimes } }$ - Hepanorm ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { \mathrm { H } }$ and $\mathsf { S T A } ^ { \mathbf { \bar { \boldsymbol { \otimes } } } }$ Calibrator HBPM/LMWH are similar in indication/intended use, technology, principles of operation, and application of use (with IVD medical devices) thus yielding no new questions in safety, effectiveness, or technology. Therefore, this concludes the product $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ - Hybrid Hep Calibrator is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices, $\mathbf { S } \mathbf { T } \mathbf { A } ^ { \otimes }$ - Calibrator HBPM/LMWH Kit (K010350) and $\hat { \mathbf { S } } \mathbf { \hat { I } A } ^ { \otimes }$ - Hepanorm H {previously cleared as Hepanorm $\mathfrak { Q }$ Calibration Plasma Set} (K854762).

Dear Mr. Parrotta:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class I (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450.
