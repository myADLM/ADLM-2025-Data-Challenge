# Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine Master Curve Material are 5 level human serum based solutions containing varying concentrations of cyclosporine in human serum, detergents, glycerol, anti-foam and preservatives. The Cyclosporine Master Curve Materials have expected values (lot specific) of 0, 100, 500, 900 and 1400 ng/mL.

The Cyclosporine Master Curve Material (1.0 mL/vial) are liquid and ready to use.   
Storage is at $2 . 8 \%$ .

CAUTION! POTENTIAL BIOHAZARD: Contains human source material. While each human serum or plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDAapproved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2, all products manufactured using human source material should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B or C viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these products should be handled according to established good laboratory practices.

# Statement of Intended Use:

The ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine Master Curve Material is for in vitro diagnostic use in the verification of calibration and reportable range in the ADVIA Centau $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Cyclosporine (CsA) assay.

# Performance:

The traceability, value assignment, and stability of the ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine Master Curve Materials have been validated following procedures of Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. These Cyclosporine Master Curve Material are substantially equivalent to currently marketed devices with similar intended uses.

# Comparison to the Predicate Device:

Similarities and Differences between the devices and the predicate are shown below:

Re: k092993 Trade Name: ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Cyclosporine Master Curve Material Regulation Number: 21 CFR $\ S 8 6 2 . 1 6 6 0$ . Regulation Name: Quality control material (assayed and unassayed). Regulatory Class: Class I, reserved Product Codes: JJX Dated: November 12, 2009 Received: November 16, 2009

Dear Ms. Santulli:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
