4. Special instrument requirements: ADVIA Centaur $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Systems

# I. Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Cyclosporine Master Curve Material are 5 level human serum based solutions containing varying concentrations of cyclosporine in human serum, detergents, glycerol, anti-foam and preservatives. The Cyclosporine Master Curve Materials have expected values (lot specific) of approximately 0, 100, 500, 900 and $1 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The Cyclosporine Master Curve Material (1.0 mL/vial) is liquid and ready to use. Storage is at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The labeling contains the following information:

“Contains human source material. While each human serum or plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDA-approved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen $\left( { \mathrm { H B s A g } } \right)$ , antibody to hepatitis C (HCV) and antibody to HIV-1/2, all products manufactured using human source material should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B or C viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these products should be handled according to established good laboratory practices.”

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Master Curve Material is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using USP grade cyclosporine.

The ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Cyclosporine Master Curve Material is prepared utilizing various amounts of a cyclosporine positive stock solution and negative basepool. The assigned values are established by comparison studies to a reference lot of master curve materials using the ADVIA Centaur Cyclosporine Assay. Value assignment is performed using one ADVIA Centaur instrument with one lot of ADVIA Centaur Cyclosporine reagent assaying the material and reference material in multiple replicates and multiple runs. The within run CV of the 20 replicates met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $\leq 8 \%$ . The acceptance criteria of the test lot assigned value to the reference lot met the acceptance criteria $0 f \pm 1 5 \%$ . The ranges for the assigned values were established by calculating $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the assigned value.

The labeling includes a statement that if results do not fall within expected values, technical support should be contacted.

The protocol for establishing shelf-life for the Master Curve Material was reviewed and is adequate. The shelf stability is 2 years when properly stored at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open stability was established to be up to 21 weeks when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
