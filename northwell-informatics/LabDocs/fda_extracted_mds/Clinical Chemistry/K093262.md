# 5.0 Device description

AG-608, AG-610 Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a blood glucose meter, test strips, lancets, lancing device and the control solutions (available if user requests).

The AG-608, AG-610 blood Glucose Monitoring system is based on an electrochemical biosensor technology(electrochemical) and the principle of. capillary action. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood

into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in 5 seconds. The control solution available are used to test the performance of the device.

# 6.0 Intended use

AG-608, AG-610 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger only. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for both lay uses by people with diabetes and in a clinical setting by health care professionals, as an aid to monitoring levels in Diabetes Mellitus. Not for use on neonates. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus.

# 8.0 Performance summary

AG-608, AG-610 blood glucose monitoring system conform to the following standards:

IS0 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems- Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

Non-clinical test and the clinical test are done according to the above standard.

# 9.0 Comparison to the predict device and the conclusion

AG-608 and AG-610 is very similar with the predicted device AG-606, However, their appearance is different from AG-606, they use the different test strips, they also has a code button.

However, the test in this submission provides demonstration that these small differences do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness.
