# Description of Device

The OPTI CCA-TS system is a portable $[ 4 . 7 \times 1 4 . 2 \times 9 . 1$ inches, 12 pounds], microprocessor-based instrument using optical fluorescence for the measurement blood gases, electrolytes and enzymes and utilizes a graphical touch screen interface. There is an additional laser based measurement of total hemoglobin (tHb) and $S O _ { 2 }$ capability available with any cassette that contains a ${ \mathsf { p o } } _ { 2 }$ sensor.

The OPTI CCA-TS system is currently cleared [K993837, K984299, and K974784] for the measurement of pH, $P 0 _ { 2 } ,$ $P ( 0 _ { 2 } ,$ Na, K, Ca, Cl, Glucose, BUN (Urea), tHb and $\mathsf { S O } _ { 2 }$ Measurements made on he OPTI CCA-S system require the us of the OPTI CCA-TS analyzer, a disposable cassette containing fluorescent sensors for the measurement of the analytes (except tHb and SO2) and presentation of the blood sample for measurement of tHb and ${ \mathsf { S } } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ by lasers on board the CCA-TS analyzer, and software to calculate measurements from the optical data provided by the analyzer for a blood sample and perform on-board QC tests to safeguard results using known standards.

OPTI Medical has designed a lactic acid (lactate) sensor to provide lactate results when a casecontaining the actate ensor sused with the PT CATnalyzr.he B-Laccase is a disposable, single use cassette that contains four (4) sensors for in vitro measurements of pH, ${ \mathsf { P C O } } _ { 2 } ,$ $\mathsf { P O } _ { 2 } ,$ aLacaT -a al   p aloi t and is marked with a barcode label that includes a lot identification number, calibration information, and expiration date.

The OPTI Critical Care Analyzer (CCA-TS model) hardware is unchanged from the design described in the most recent clearance [k993837] of the device. The capacity to add analytes was part of the design since product inception and electromagnetic compatibility is unaffected. Software changes were made to add the lactate measurement algorithms and operational features for the B-Lac cassette addition.

# 10) Intended Use / Indications for Use

The OPTI CCA-TS B-Lac cassette is intended to be used for in vitro measurements of pH, $P { \ C } _ { 2 } , P { \bar { \bf O } } _ { 2 } ,$ lactate (lactic acid), total hemoglobin (tHb), and oxygen saturation $( \mathsf { S O } _ { 2 } )$ ,in heparinized whole blood samples (either arterial or venous) on the OPTI CCA-TS system, in either a clinical setting or point-of-care locations.

Measurements of blood gases $( P C O _ { 2 } , P O _ { 2 } )$ and blood pH are used in the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances. Lactate (lactic acid) measurements that evaluate the acid-base status areused nthe diagnosis and treatment acticaciosis (abnormally high acidity of the blood). Total hemoglobin measurement is used to determine the hemoglobin content of human blood. Oxygen saturation measurement is used to determine the oxygen capacity of the hemoglobin.

The OPTI CCA-TS B-Lac csset is for presciption use y.

# 11) Substantial Equivalence

The CCA-TS B-Lac cassette is substantially equivalent in safety, function, and efficacy to several currently marketed devices already on the market known as 'Combi Analyzers' and 'Point of Care' analyzers. Specifically, the sensors in the B-Lac cassette are shown to be equivalent to the Instrument Laboratory Co. GEM Premier 4000 [K061974] for the measurement of blood gases and ph, total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and lactic acid. Non-clinical studies were performed to demonstrate equivalence when compared to the predicate device and to gravimetric tonometry standards for the Blood Gases $( P O _ { 2 } , P C O _ { 2 } )$ . Clinical site studies demonstrated substantial equivalence when compared to legally marketed devices in a clinical setting at multiple sites by several personnel trained to perform and report these analyses. Specimens analyzed were remnant from patient samples of whole blood collected from routine analysis on existing instrumentation. Samples were aspirated into the OPTI CCA-TS B-Lac cassette from both heparinized syringes and heparinized capillary tubes.

# 14) Technological Characteristics

# Principle of Measurement

T    rallo en  p of sensors sealed inside the cassette.The OPTI CCA-TS analyzer aspirates the sample from a capillary tube or syringe. The sensors use fluorescence optodes to measure the intensity of light emitted from fluorescent dyes exposed to specific analytes. The concentration of the analyte is determined by the calculation of the difference in fluorescence measured at a defined calibration point and that measured with the unknown concentration of analyte. The principles of measurement of pO2, pCO2 and pH for the B-Lac cassette are similar to those used with existing cassette styles that are used on the OPTI CCA platform [k993837, K984299, and K974784].

The lactate measurement is based on the enzymatic oxidation of lactate.

L-Lactate $+ 0 _ { 2 }$ Pyruvate + H2O2 Lactate Oxidase

The sensor is constructed of an enzyme layer over an oxygen sensor. As a sample containing lactate contacts the sensor this enzymatic oxidation of the lactate consumes the oxygen locally lactate is determined to be proportional to the rate at which the oxygen is consumed.

# 15) Summary of Non-Clinical Testing

# Electrical Standards:

The cleared OPTI CCA-TS analyzer system [K993837, K984299, K974784] has been tested and found to comply with EN61010-1 Safety Requirements for Electrical Equipment, FCC Class A Radiated and Conducted Emissions, EN55022 Radiated and Conducted Emissions, EN61000-3-2 Quasi-Stationary Current Harmonics, EN61000-3-3 Voltage Fluctuation and Flicker Test, and EN61326-1 Electrical Equipment Electromagnetic Compatibility standards. No changes were made to the cleared analyzer system to add the B-Lac cassette so the studies cited above remain valid.

# Performance:

In-house studies were conducted using CLSl guidelines on both aqueous controls and whole blood samples to demonstrate acceptable precision, accuracy, reproducibility, and linearity across the claimed measurement ranges with both syringe and capillary tube sampling methods. Limit of detection and interference studies were completed using CLSI standard methods and are summarized in device labeling.

The OPTI CCA-TS system is calibrated with methods traceable to NIST standards.

Stability studies were performed on the B-Lac cassette design and Instructions for use are included with the B-Lac cassette style to instruct the user of the storage and use limitations.

CCA-TS software required modification to add the lactate sensor calculations and modify the calculation parameters in algorithms for the dry storage pH, PCO2, and PO2 sensors used in the B-Lac cassette. The CCA-TS software level of concern is moderate based on an assessment of the software in its intended use using tables 1 and 2 in "Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices" issued May 11, 2005. Software modifications were made, verified, and validated as outlined in the guidance document cited above.

# 16) Summary of Clinical Site Testing

Precision and accuracy of the OPTI CCA-TS system with the B-Lac cassette was verified at multiple user sites and data provided in the 510(k) demonstrates performance equivalent to marketed devices used for method comparisons. Whole blood sample discards were used by multiple clinicians and introduced to the analyzer system in both heparinized syringes and heparinized capillary tubes to demonstrate equivalence between the two sampling modes and to marketed reference analyzers.

# 17) Conclusion

Analysis of the method comparison data collected during clinical site studies for this device presented in this 510(k), together with the linearity and precision data collected during nonclinical and clinical studies demonstrates that the OPTI CCA-TS system with B-Lac cassette is safe, effective, and substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
