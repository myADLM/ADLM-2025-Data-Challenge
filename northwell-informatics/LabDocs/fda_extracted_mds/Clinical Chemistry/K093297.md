# 5.2 Identification of the Predicate Device

i-Stat™ Lactate Test using i-Stat™ Model 300 Portable Clinical Analyzer

# 5.3 Description of the New Device

The epoc Lactate Test is being added as an additional sensor to the existing single use test card that is used with the epoc Blood Analysis System. This test card is inserted into the epoc Reader and all analytical steps are performed automatically. Patient and user information may be entered into the mobile computing device (epoc Host) during the automated analysis cycle.

The epoc Blood Analysis System is an in vitro analytical system comprising a network of one or more epoc Readers designed to be used at the point of care (PoC). The readers accept an epoc single use test card containing a group of sensors that perform diagnostic testing on whole blood. The blood test results are transmitted wirelessly to an epoc Host, which displays and stores the test results.

The epoc System is intended for use by trained medical professionals as an in vitro diagnostic device for the quantitative testing of samples of whole blood.

The test card panel configuration currently includes sensors for Sodium Na, Potassium K, Ionized Calcium iCa, pH, $p ( 0 _ { 2 } ,$ $P O _ { 2 }$ ,Glucose and Hematocrit Hct. This submission adds Lactate (Lact) to this list of approved tests.

To perform a blood test, a new test card is inserted into a card reader's card slot with white label face down. When fully inserted, the test card is automatically engaged in the reader.

The card insertion process:

Brings the cards sensor module into contact with the reader's electrical contact array;   
Brings the card's measurement region, which is the fluidic channel above the sensor array, into thermal contact with the reader's heater assembly for heating the measurement region to $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$   
Actuates the opening of the fluidic valve in the card and causes delivery of calibrator fluid from the reservoir to the measurement region.

After calibration, and upon a prompt by the reader (LED visual and audio beep), the user introduces a blood sample for measurement through the blood sample port to the card's measurement region. When sensors are contacted by the blood sample they generate electrical signals proportional to analyte concentrations in the blood sample, which are transmitted wirelessly by the Reader to the epoc Host. The epoc Host displays and stores the blood test results.

Changes to the epoc Blood Analysis System required to introduce the Lactate test include:

Developing a new Lactate sensor and adding it to the existing epoc test card, which was already designed to accommodate additional sensors; Modifications to the existing EpocHost software application to accommodate the new test; Labeling changes including indications for use for the Lactate test.

# 5.5.3 Traceability

The epoc System is calibrated is against methods traceable to NIST standards.

The epoc System's test card comprises an on-board calibration material, prepared gravimetrically and assayed on reference systems calibrated with traceability to NIST standards.

Calibration verification uses commercially available calibration verification fluids whose concentration values are traceable to NIST standards.

Quality control materials are commercially available fluids with concentrations traceable to NIST standards.

# 5.5.4 Detection Limit

This study was performed in-house as per CLSI EP6-A recommendations for evaluation limits of detection and quantification. The low end of the reportable range for the EPOC lactate test $( 0 . 3 0 ~ \mathsf { m M } )$ is greater than or equal to the limit of detection and is statistically discernable from the limit of blank ( $0 . 2 1 \ m M ^ { \prime }$ .

# 5.5.5 Analytical Specificity

Interference testing4 was performed in-house on the epoc lactate sensor. In each of these tests a pooled human serum was aliquoted into two samples. The test sample was spiked by addition of interferent, while the control sample was spiked by the addition of the solvent of the interferent. The lactate bias between the mean of six replicates on both the control sample and the test sample with added interferent was calculated.

Jnacceptable interference bias was defined as producing a significant error more han $5 \%$ of the time.

Significant interfering substances are itemized below:

Acetaminophen will have no significant effect up to $0 . 8 1 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ after which it will increase the lactate reading up to 306 $\mu \mathsf { M } / \mathsf { m } \mathsf { M }$ Tylenol. Because the therapeutic upper limit for acetaminophen is $0 . 2 0 \ \mathsf { m M }$ , interfering levels of acetaminophen should only be encountered in overdose situations Iodide will decrease the lactate reading up to $\boldsymbol { \cdot } 1 . 2 \boldsymbol { \mathrm { m M } } / \boldsymbol { \mathrm { m M } }$ of Iodide up to an Iodide concentration of $0 . 6 7 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ Above $0 . 6 7 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ Iodide the decrease will be $\cdot 1 . 2 \mathsf { m } \mathsf { M }$ . Bromide will have no significant effect up to $2 5 . 4 \ m M$ after which it will decrease the lactate reading up to $1 4 . 6 ~ { \mu \ M / \mu \mu \mu }$ Bromide. Thiocyanate will have no significant effect up to $2 . 7 \mathsf { m M }$ after which it will decrease the lactate reading by up to $9 6 . 6 ~ { \mu \mathsf { M } } / { \ m \mathsf { M } }$ thiocyanate. N-Acetylcysteine will have no significant effect up to $3 . 7 \mathsf { m M }$ after which it will decrease the lactate reading by up to $9 6 . 3 ~ \mu \ M / \mu \mu$ N-Acetylcysteine.

Ethylene glycol ingestion and metabolism has been shown to produce falsely elevated lactate measurements\*. Ethylene glycol plus three metabolism products - Glycolic Acid, Glyoxylic Acid and Oxalic Acid - were tested for interference. Ethylene Glycol and Oxalic Acid do not interfere significantly.

Glycolic Acid will have no significant effect up to $0 . 8 7 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ after which it will increase the lactate reading up to $1 4 2 \mu \ M / \ m M$ glycolic acid. Glyoxylic Acid will have no significant effect up to $0 . 8 5 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ after which it will increase the lactate reading up to $3 7 3 \mu M / \min$ glyoxylic acid.

\* CMAJ, April 10, 2007, 176(8), p.1097 "Falsely elevated point-of-care lactate measurement after ingestion of ethylene glycol"

The following levels of exogenous interferences were tested and found to be insignificant: 1.66mM (25mg/dL) acetaminophen, 630μmol/L (12.5mg/dL) Na ascorbate, 20mmol/L (588 mg/dL) citrate, 100 µmol/L (\~2mg/dL) L-dopa, 9mmol/L (263mg/dL) EDTA, 4.84mmol/L (30mg/dL) ethylene glycol, 105 μmmol/L (0.441mg/dL) Na fluoride, 71 µmol/L Methyldopa, 2.55mmol/L oxidized glutathione, 2.55mmol/L reduced glutathione, 132 µmol/L (1.0mg/dL) hydroxyurea, 292µmol/L (4mg/dL) isoniazide (nydrazid), 81 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) K Oxalate, 0.037 mmol/L (1.2 mg/dL) Quinidine.

The following levels of endogenous interferences were tested and found to be insignificant: $+ 3 4 2 \mu \ m { 0 } | / \nu$ 2 $( + 2 9 . 0 9 / \mathrm { d L } )$ bilirubin conjugated, $+ 3 4 2$ µmol/L $( + 2 0 . 1 { \bmod { \mathsf { d L } } } )$ bilirubin unconjugated, +13mmol/L $( + 5 0 3 . 1 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L } )$ cholesterol, $+ 1 5 0 0 \mu \mathsf { m } { \sf o } { ! } / \mathsf { L }$ $+ 1 8 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L }$ L-cysteine, $+ 0 . 8 \%$ lipids, pH $( + 0 . 4 , ~ - 0 . 4 )$ . $3 \%$ to $10 \%$ total protein, $1 . 4 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ $( + 2 3 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ Uric Acid.

Low hematocrit did not interfere down to a level of $21 \%$ hematocrit and high hematocrit did not interfere up to a level of $61 \%$ hematocrit.

Triglycerides did not show significant interference up to a level of 37 mM (1430 mg/dL).

# Indication for Use

10(k) Number (if known): 932

Device Name: epoc Lactate test

Indication For Use:

The Lactate test, as part of the epoc Blood Analysis System, is intended for use by trained medical professionals as an in vitro diagnostic device for the quantitative testing of samples of heparinized or un-anticoagulated arterial, venous or capillary whole blood in the laboratory or at the point of care in hospitals, nursing homes or other clinical care institutions.

Lactate measurements from the epoc Blood Analysis System are used to evaluate the acid-base status and are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of the blood).
