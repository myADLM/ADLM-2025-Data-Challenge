# L. Test Principle:

Lactate is measured by amperometry. The sensor comprises an immobilized enzyme first layer coated onto a gold electrode of the electrode module, with a diffusion barrier second layer. The lactate oxidase enzyme is employed to convert lactate to hydrogen peroxide. An amperometric sensor is used to detect the enzymatically produced hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide detection is by redox mediated (ABTS (2,2’- azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzed, reduction on a gold electrode. The reduction current is proportional to the concentration of lactate in the test fluid.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The reportable range is 0.3 to $2 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

A linearity study was conducted based on CLSI EP6-A using whole blood samples collected from a fasting donor. Two (2) tubes were pooled and dialyzed in Ringer’s buffer containing no lactate or glucose to produce low lactate $( { \le } 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m M } )$ blood. This sample was then spiked to $0 . 3 \mathrm { m M }$ lactate using $1 \textbf { M }$ sodium lactate stock solution. The remaining two (2) tubes were pooled and spiked with $1 \textbf { M }$ sodium lactate stock solution to a level over 20 mM. The concentration of lactate in the two pools of blood was confirmed using an ABL instrument.

Seven (7) samples of blood were prepared by mixing known volumes of low lactate specimen with high lactate with values ranging from 0.3 to $2 4 \mathrm { m M }$ . Seven (7) lots of epoc cards were included in the study. Regression analysis was performed as per CLSI EP6-A recommendations. Linear regression of first, second and third order was carried out. The non-linear terms were statistically insignificant over the range 0.3 to $2 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . Regression analysis for the sponsor’s claimed range is $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 1 4 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 2 7 0 5$ . The studies supported the sponsor’s claimed range of 0.3 to $2 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The epoc System is calibrated is against methods traceable to NIST standards. The epoc System’s test card comprises an on-board calibration material, prepared gravimetrically and assayed on reference systems calibrated with traceability to NIST standards.

# d. Detection limit:

The low end of the reportable range for the EPOC lactate test is $0 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ The determination of Limit of Blank (LOB) and the verification of the claimed low end range using Limit of Detection confirmation (LoD) studies were performed according to CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantification.

The LoB determination was performed on an aqueous sample with known zero lactate. Sixty (60) cards from 3 lots were tested. The LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 8 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . For the LoD study, two matrices were compared, an aqueous buffer and a whole blood sample adjusted to 0.3 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . The concentration of the sample was confirmed using an ABL instrument. The aqueous sample was tested on a single occasion on 3 test card lots. Three whole blood samples were tested on 3 occasions using 6 test card lots. The LoD was verified as $0 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , which also is supported by the linearity studies in which the lowest level sample tested was $0 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . The $\%$ CV at $0 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ lactate measured in whole blood is approximately $20 \%$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed in-house using samples at two levels of lactate, 0.7 and $2 . 6 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ as recommended by CLSI guideline EP7-A2. Samples were prepared in freshly drawn heparinized whole blood and plasma was added or removed from the samples to decrease or increase the hematocrit for the hematocrit studies.

Clinically significant interfering substances are listed below and in the labeling:

Acetaminophen will have no significant effect (defined as less than or equal to $5 \%$ bias between control and test samples) up to $0 . 8 1 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ after which it will increase the lactate reading up to $3 0 6 \mu \mathrm { M / m M }$ Tylenol.   
• Iodide will decrease the lactate reading up to - $\cdot 1 . 2 \mathrm { m M } / \mathrm { m M }$ of Iodide up to an Iodide concentration of $0 . 6 7 \mathrm { m M }$ .   
• Bromide will have no significant effect up to $2 5 . 4 \mathrm { m M }$ after which it will decrease the lactate reading up to $1 4 . 6 ~ { \mu \mathrm { M / m M } }$ Bromide. Thiocyanate will have no significant effect up to $2 . 7 \mathrm { m M }$ after which it will decrease the lactate reading by up to $9 6 . 6 \mu \mathrm { M } / \mathrm { m M }$ thiocyanate. N-Acetylcysteine will have no significant effect up to $3 . 7 \mathrm { m M }$ after which it will decrease the lactate reading by up to $9 6 . 3 \mu \mathrm { M } / \mathrm { m M N }$ - Acetylcysteine. Ethylene glycol ingestion and metabolism has been shown to produce falsely elevated lactate measurements. Ethylene glycol plus three metabolism products - Glycolic Acid, Glyoxylic Acid and Oxalic Acid - were tested for interference. Ethylene Glycol and Oxalic Acid do not interfere significantly. Glycolic Acid will have no significant effect up to $0 . 8 7 \mathrm { m M }$ after which it will increase the lactate reading up to $1 4 2 \mu \mathrm { M / m M }$ glycolic acid. Glyoxylic Acid will have no significant effect up to $0 . 8 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ after which it will increase the lactate reading up to $3 7 3 \mu \mathrm { M / m M }$ glyoxylic acid.

The following levels of endogenous interferences were tested and showed no significant interference defined as less than or equal to $5 \%$ bias between

control and test samples: $2 0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ unconjugated bilirubin, $2 9 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ conjugated bilirubin, $5 0 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ cholesterol and $1 4 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ triglycerides. Hematocrit did not interfere down to a level of $21 \%$ and up to a level of $61 \%$ hematocrit.
