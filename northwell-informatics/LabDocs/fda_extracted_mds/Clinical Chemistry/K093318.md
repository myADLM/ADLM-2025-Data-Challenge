# Description:

The following is a brief description of the ACCELERATOR APS System.

# ACCELERATOR APS Modules

The ACCELERATOR APS (Automated Processing Systems) is a modular system designed to automate pre-analytical sample processing, sample handling, and processing in the clinical laboratory. The system consolidates multiple analytical instruments into a unified workstation by employing a common sample processing capability. The workcell software provides for workload management, sample order management, and instrument operational status monitoring. This is accomplished through communication connections between the workcell, analyzers, and LIS (laboratory information systems) or middleware.

The ACCELERATOR APS performs the following pre and post-analytical functions.

Sample bar code identification (previously performed by the analyzer)   
Sample transport and tracking   
Sample centrifugation (Optional functionality)   
Sample de-capping (Optional functionality)   
Tube sealing (Optional functionality)   
Sample Storage and Retrieval (Optional functionality)

The ARCHITECT Family of Instruments test instructions and test results for each sample are not processed through the ACCELERATOR APS.

The following analyzers have been validated for use with the ACCELERATOR APS.

• ARCHITECT cSystems (c8000 and c16000)  
• ARCHITECT i2000  
• ARCHITECT i2000sr

# Intended Use:

The ACCELERATOR APS is a modular system designed to automate sample handling and processing in the clinical laboratory. The system allows consolidation of multiple clinical chemistry and immunoassay analytical instruments into a unified workstation.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The substantial equivalence will be demonstrated through a Method Comparison study between a standalone ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer and an ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer

integratcd to thc ACCELERATOR APS system, utilizing the same specimens uniquely labelcd with individual sample tube barcode labels for sample identification (SID).

The substantial equivalence testing was conducted utilizing the ARCHITECT c8000 ICT Modulc for the electrolytes of Sodium, Potassium and Chloride.

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number (if known): k093318

Device Name: ACCELERATOR APS

Indication For Use:

The ACCELERATOR APS (Automated Processing Systems) is a modular system designed to automate pre-analytical processing, sample handling, and processing in the clinical iaboratory. The system consolidates multiple analytical instruments into a unified workstation by employing a common sample processing capability.

The ARCHITECT c8000 System is a discrete photometric chemistry analyzer for clinical use. The device is intended to duplicate manual analytical procedures by performing various steps such as pipetting, heating, and measuring color intensity. This device is intended for use in conjunction with certain materials to measure a variety of analytes that may be adaptable to the analyzer depending on the reagent used. The ARCHITECT c8000 System also has a solid state lon-Selective Electrode module, utilizing potentiometry, for electrolyte determinations for Sodium, Potassium and Chloride.

Sodium, Potassium and Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
