The NucliSENS EasyQ Analyzer and the accompanying NucliSENS EasyQ Director software are intended for in vitro diagnostic use in conjunction with FDA-cleared or approved NuclisENS assay prols.Theser sha a proery trai boratory tecnican miiar with perormi nuce assays. The analyzer is intended to measure fluorescent readings from molecular beacon probes binding to amplified RNA or DNA in samples containing NucliSENS EasyQ assay reagents while controlling the temperature of the samples. The NucliSENS EasyQ Director software is intended to control instrument operations and organize the assays to be performed. In addition, the software is intended to automatically calculate results for each test request based on raw measurement data, the data reduction algorithm specified for the assay, and the batch parameters of the reagents used for the test.

# Description of the Device

The NucliSENS EasyQ System indudes principally the instrument, NucliSENS Easy $\alpha ^ { \otimes }$ Analyzer, and sc Nucli Eas assay protocols.he system also requires use of the instrent NucliSENS EasyQ® Incubator II.

The NucliSENS EasyQ® Analyzer (Analyzer) is an automated, temperature-controlled fluorescence analyzer instrument designed for batch processing of up to 96 samples per run.Amplification of nucleic acid targets is detected by means of sequence-specific probes which each fluoresce upon binding of the probe to its target.The Analyzer contains a plate carrier, which is designed to keep temperature constant at the required assay temperature. The Analyzer is a specially designed fluorescent reader using an optical system based on direct and focused illumination, designed to prevent crosstalk. Specific filters are used to select the appropriate wavelength for both excitation and emission of the molecular beacons used in the assay specified for each test. The filter selection is controlled by the attached PC and is a function of the assay protocol applied to a specified test.

Once sample tube strips have been loaded into plate carrir block of the Analyzer, the instrument moves the first tube into position over the light source.The Analyzer then directs the light source upward through the bottom of the sample tube.The light causes the molecular beacons (in the assay reagent m g eei gal a photomultiplier tube where the fluorescence reading is taken.The next sample is then moved into positon and the process is repeatedThe intensity of the emited light ismeasured for each sample n the process is repeated for each test as the run progresses, generating a series of data points for each sample that form fluorescence curves.

TAnalyze is use iconn wh Nucli Eas® Director oftwar Drecosoe and assay-specific EasyQ® assay protocol software (assay protocols), loaded on a NucliSENS Easy® computer with a keyboard and screen interface.The Director Software is used for instrument corol and data collection.In combination with assay-specic "assay protocols", the Director Softwae al perfors automated esult calculationan reportibas eanalysireal-tim fluorescnc signal curves measured by the Analyzer.Results may be qualitative or quantitative, depending on the design of the assay and the assay protocol.Results available to the operator include both the qualitative or quantitative test result and the graph of the fluorescence data points (data curves).

The device which is the subject of this submission is largely unchanged from the NuclisENs EasyQ System used in conjunction with the assay NucliSENs EasyQ® Enterovirus v1.1, which received 510(k) clearance from FDA (K063261) on 23-Jun-2008.

use of the upgraded software in connection with the EasyQ Enterovirus v1.1 assay has been validated by internal in-silico testing using a panel of input data selected from prior test results, and representative of all foreseeable classes of test specimens BIOMÉRIEUX

Dear Ms. Jennings:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendiments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section

$5 1 0 ( \kappa )$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450.
