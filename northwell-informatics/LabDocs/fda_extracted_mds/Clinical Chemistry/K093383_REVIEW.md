# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The NucliSENS EasyQ Analyzer is the primary component of the NucliSENS EasyQ System. This system was used in K063261, the original NucliSENS EasyQ® Enterovirus v1.1, 510(k) submission. The instrumentation and software components of that system as currently configured are:

Instrumentation:   
• NucliSENS EasyQ Analyzer   
• NucliSENS miniMAG   
• NucliSENS EasyQ Incubator II (updated from version I)

Software: • NucliSENS EasyQ Director 2.6 (updated from 2.5) • NuclISENS EasyQ Assay Protocol

2. Principles of Operation:

Sample Processing: This step uses the NucliSENS miniMAG, a stand-alone device for semiautomated nucleic extraction. During sample processing, viral particles are lysed and the RNA is captured onto magnetic silica particles. The silica is washed to remove contaminants and the RNA is eluted. The eluted RNA is pipetted into a reaction vessel along with the amplification/detection reagents.

Sample preparation utilizes equipment and reagents that are components of the general NucliSens platform. Specifically, the specimen is lysed in NucliSens lysis buffer (containing guanidinium isothiocyanate) to release the RNA. IC RNA from e.g., the EasyQ Enterovirus kit is then added to the lysed sample. The NucliSens magnetic extraction reagents and equipment are then used to capture total RNA on magnetic silica particles. Unwanted specimen components are removed by washing. Purified and concentrated RNA is eluted.

Real-time Amplification/Detection: Eluted RNA and amplification reagents are added to the amplification reaction vessels (organized in 8-well strip units up to a total of 96 samples). After a brief denaturation step in the NucliSens EasyQ incubator II, the target RNAs are amplified in the NucliSens EasyQ Analyzer. The user interfaces with the Analyzer through the NucliSens EasyQ Director software which controls the Analyzer. The Director software is loaded on the EasyQ Computer which is connected to the Analyzer; the computer system includes a monitor, printer, keyboard and mouse as peripheral devices.

The Analyzer performs an isothermal amplification reaction and detects amplified RNA in real time through the use of two differentially labeled molecular beacons (one for the target, one for an internal control sequence). Upon binding to their target, each beacon produces a fluorescent signal used to detect the amplified RNA or DNA.

The NucliSENS EasyQ analyzer is dedicated to read fluorescence from reaction tubes in a controlled environment. The analyzer contains a plate carrier that keeps the samples at the required temperature for the assay. The reader uses an optical system, based on direct and focused illumination to prevent cross talk and give accurate readings. Filters control the wavelength of the illumination for both excitation and emission of the molecular beacon used in the assay. Filters are automatically selected by the assay protocol. The system uses different filters to measure particular labels (dyes).

Once a tray of sample tubes has been loaded into the NucliSENS EasyQ analyzer, the analyzer moves the first tube into position over the light source. The analyzer then directs the light source upward through the bottom of the sample tube. The light causes the molecular beacons to emit light. Through the use of a mirror, the emitted light is directed through an optical filter to a photo multiplier tube where the fluorescence reading is taken. The next sample is then moved into position and the process is repeated. The intensity of the emitted light is measured for each sample.

Director software receives fluorescence readings from the Analyzer and executes the calculation engine that is part of the assay protocol software. The EasyQ Enterovirus v1.1 Assay Protocol software receives the reaction data and uses a validated algorithm to interpret the kinetics and intensity of fluorescence signals which result from each amplification reaction. After interpretation by the assay protocol software, results for each test are reported back to Director as one of 3 possible reaction outcomes: positive, negative, or invalid. Director does not have any knowledge of the actual calculation. Director then presents the qualitative result to the user by printing, on screen and by export file.

3. Modes of Operation: Batch or Random access through tube strip (Analyzer)

4. Specimen Identification: Entered by user (Analyzer)

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Specimens are processed according to assay instructions.

6. Calibration:

The analyzer contains an autocalibration function that reads the fluorescence from the reference materials on the plate carrier. The reading is compared to the value in the system memory. The measured value can differ from the memory value.

7. Quality Control:

Quality control is addressed for each separately cleared specific assay to be run on the instrument.
