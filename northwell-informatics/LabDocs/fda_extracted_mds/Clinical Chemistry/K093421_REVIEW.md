# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): Refer to Indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of testosterone in human serum and plasma. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

Measurements of testosterone are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving the male sex hormones (androgens), including primary and secondary hypogonadism, delayed or precocious puberty, impotence in males and, in females hirsutism (excessive hair) and virilization (masculinization) due to tumors, polycystic ovaries, and androgenital syndromes.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription use only

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:

“In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. $> 5 \mathrm { m g / d a y ) }$ , no sample should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin administration.”

“In isolated cases, elevated testosterone levels can be seen in samples from female patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).”

“In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to analytespecific antibodies, streptavidin or ruthenium can occur. These effects have been minimized by suitable test design.”

“Implausible elevated testosterone values in women should be verified by an extraction method or a validated LC-MS/MS tandem method.”

4. Special instrument requirements: Elecsys 2010 analyzer

# I. Device Description:

The device is supplied as ready-to-use, three-reagent kit. The Elecsys Testosterone II reagent kit consists of a Reagent Pack (contains R1, R2, and M).

# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys Testosterone II immunoassay is based on a competitive test principle with streptavidin-coated microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Following CLSI EP5-A, the sponsor evaluated the precision using seven human serum (HS) specimens and two controls, at the concentrations listed in the table below. Precision was evaluated in duplicate, 2 runs per day for 21 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 4 )$ ) using Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The results are tabulated below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor performed linearity studies in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Seventeen levels of samples were prepared by diluting a high spiked serum pool sample with a low serum pool sample. The linearity samples were tested in triplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer over the range of 0.5 to $1 5 3 5 . 8 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The observed values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression resulting in: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 2 2 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 2 9 9$ ; $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R = } 0 . 9 9 9 6$ .

The data support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this device is 2.5 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrators used with this device have been previously cleared in k003411. Control materials have been previously cleared in k090541. The sponsor provided the stability study protocols for reagent stability. Based on the realtime stability studies, the reagent kit is stable up to 12 weeks. The on-board stability for open vials is 56 days.

# d. Limit of Detection:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A document. LoB were conducted using a blank sample tested five times on 2 Elecsys 2010 analyzers over 3 days using 2 runs, and 2 reagent lots $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 6 0 \right)$ ). For LoD, five serum samples were selected and diluted to obtain lower concentrations. The samples were run over 3 days with 2 runs per day using 2 reagent lots $\mathrm { ( N { = } } 6 0 \mathrm { ) }$ ). For LoQ, 7 serum samples were tested once per run, 2 runs per day for over 5 days $( \mathrm { N } { = } 7 0 )$ ). LoB was determined to be $1 . 2 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ and LoD was determined to be $2 . 5 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The LoQ was calculated as the lowest concentration for which the CV is less than $20 \%$ . The results demonstrated that the LoQ is $1 2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$

The claimed measuring range of the device is 2.5 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed using four different levels of testosterone samples spiked with 5 endogenous substances, using the same protocol as follows: One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance; another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of the solvent (control sample). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments, generating a total of 11 different concentrations of interference substances. Results of the spiked samples were compared with the control samples and $\%$ recovery was calculated. Non- significant interference was defined as recovery of $\pm 1 0 \%$ (for concentration range of ${ \scriptstyle > 1 0 0 \ n g / \mathrm { d L } }$ ), $\pm 1 5 \%$ (for concentration range of ${ > } 5 0$ to $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ , and $\pm 7 . 5$ $\mathrm { n g / d L }$ (for concentration range of 15 to $5 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ ). Based on the data, the sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and concentrations listed below:

Icterus (bilirubin up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), Hemolysis (Hemoglobin up to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), Lipemia (Intralipid up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), Biotin: up to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Rheumatoid Factor: up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ .

In addition, common pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into native human serum samples and tested with Testosterone II assay. Two serum samples pools containing approximately $6 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ and $5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ testosterone were spiked with potential interferents (multiples of maximal daily doses). The reference sample (control) without interferent was spiked with the respective amount of solvent. Based on the sponsor’s definition of nonsignificant interference (greater than $\pm 1 0 \%$ of control value), the sponsor claims no interference for the compounds and concentrations listed in the table below:

Nandrolone was tested and was considered as interference substance; therefore, the sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:

“Do not use samples from patients under Nandrolone treatment”

Cross-reactivity study was performed using native human serum samples spiked with potential cross-reactant compounds. The spiked and non-spiked samples were tested in duplicates on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Results are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparisons between the candidate device and the predicate device were performed according to the CLSI EP9-A guideline. A total of 387 serum samples (239 males and 148 females) ranging from $2 . 5 { \cdot } 1 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ were used in the study. The candidate device results on the Elecsys 2010 (Y) were compared to the corresponding predicate results on the Elecsys 2010 (X). Deming regression analysis resulted in: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 8 9 \mathrm { X } - 2 . 8 7$ ; $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 2$ .

An additional method comparison study using 123 pediatric samples (69 males age 7-18 years old and 54 females’ age 8-18 years old) was performed. Samples ranging from 2.74 to $1 0 4 8 . 2 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . Deming regression analysis resulted in: $\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 6 \mathrm { X } { - } 2 . 7 9$ ; $\mathrm { R } { = } 0 . 9 3$ .

# b. Matrix comparison:

The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study using 45 unaltered paired serum, K2-EDTA plasma, K3-EDTA plasma and Lithium Heparin plasma samples. Samples ranging from 10 to $1 4 6 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ were analyzed on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The plasma results (Y) were compared to the corresponding serum results (X) and the Passing/Bablok regression analysis results are summarized in the table below:
