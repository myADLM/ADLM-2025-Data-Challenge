# 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT

The BaseSens 1 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is identical to the i-Sens CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The Hygieia BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a rebranded CareSens N System. Rebranding here is intended to be understood as all components of the CareSens N System have been relabeled with the Hygieia name BaseSens I or BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

As fully identical to the i-Sens CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System, the BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System is thereby substantially equivalent to the i-Sens CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

1.1 The Hygieia, Inc. BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System

1.1.1 The System includes the BaseSens I blood glucose meter, test strips and controls.

Conclusion: The BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System does not raise any new safety and efficacy concerns when compared to the cleared CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

The BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System is identical to the i-Sens CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The Hygieia BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a rebranded CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System. As fully identical to the i-Sens CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System, the BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System is thereby substantially equivalent to the i-Sens CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

Dear Robert J. Bard:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number (k093475):

Device Name: BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indication for Use: The BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System is used for the quantitative measurement of glucose levels in capillary whole blood as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management at home or in clinical settings. The BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System should be used only for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). The BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates. Testing sites include the fingertip along with alternate sites testing (AST) on the forearm, palm, thigh and calf. AST in this system can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

BaseSens I Test Strip is used with the BaseSens I Blood Glucose Meter for quantitatively measuring glucose in capillary whole blood. The BaseSens I Test Strip is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). The BaseSens I Test Strips are not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and are not intended for use on neonates. Testing sites include the fingertip along with alternate sites testing (AST) on the forearm, palm, thigh and calf. AST in this system can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.
