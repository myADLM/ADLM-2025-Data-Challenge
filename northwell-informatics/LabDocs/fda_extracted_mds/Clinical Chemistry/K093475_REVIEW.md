# L. Test Principle:

The BaseSens I Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses electrochemical methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile   
device using wireless transmission?:   
Yes oor No X

2. Software: Reviewed under k080923 and k083468

3. Specimen Identification: There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, which can be applied directly to the test strip.

5. Calibration:

The device has automatic code identification. No further calibration is required.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor has two levels of controls available for the system (not included in the kit but available for purchase). When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each control can be measured by following the instructions for “Checking the System” provided in the Owner’s Booklet of the system. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is instructed to contact the Customer Help Line during the operational times or a healthcare provider outside the operational times if the control results fall outside these ranges.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above: Not applicable

Q. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
