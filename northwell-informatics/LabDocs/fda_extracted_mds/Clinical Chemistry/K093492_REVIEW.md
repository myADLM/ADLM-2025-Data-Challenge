# Mission Clinicheck Assayed Chemistry Control

Target values for each analyte were obtained by analyzing multiple replicates of each analyte over several days. Multiple replicates of each analyte were tested daily. An average of the values obtained was used to establish the target concentration. Range is assigned based upon pre-determined intervals. Value assignment for the Mission Clinicheck controls is lot specific. Lot to lot variation is determined by testing new lot versus previous lot normalized to either a serum standard made with corresponding analyte NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) material or predetermined intervals.

Shelf-Life, Open Vial and Accelerated Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. The Mission Clinicheck Assayed Chemistry controls have an estimated shelf life of 24 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The Mission Clinicheck Assayed Chemistry controls are stable for 7 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the following exception: Acid Phosphatase will be stable for 3 days when stored tightly capped at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The labeling states that the Mission

Clinicheck Assayed Chemistry controls are stable up to 20 days after reconstitution when stored tightly capped at $- 1 0$ to $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The labeling states that the control material should not be refrozen. Once thawed the remaining material should be discarded. Real time stability testing is ongoing.

# Mission CliniCAL Calibrator

The mean values listed in the package insert were derived from multiple determinations performed on randomly selected samples from that particular lot. Multiple replicates of test samples and a master calibrator lot were measured for the analytes on consecutive days. The mean analyte values were calculated using the master lot of calibrator and target values assigned. To substantiate the new values created, the new lots of Mission CliniCAL calibrator were tested against predetermined intervals on selected chemistry analyzers using 2 levels of commercially available quality control material.

Shelf-Life, Open Vial, and Accelerated Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. The Mission CliniCAL calibrator has an estimated shelf life of 24 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once reconstituted, with the diluent provided, the Mission CliniCAL is stable for 72 hours at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the following exception: Total Alkaline Phosphatase is stable for at least one day when stored tightly capped at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The labeling states that the Mission ClinCAL calibrator is stable for at least 20 days after reconstitution when stored tightly capped at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The labeling also states that the control material should not be refrozen. Once thawed the remaining material should be discarded. Real time stability testing is ongoing.
