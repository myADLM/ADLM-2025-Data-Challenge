# NAME OF DEVICE:

Trade Name:

LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Calibration VerifierS

Common Names/Descriptions:

Parathyroid Hormone Assayed Quality Control Materials

Classification Names:

Single (Specified) Analyte Controls (Assayed and Unassayed)

Classification Number:

21 CFR 862.1660

Product Code:

JJX

PREDICATE DEVICES :

LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH ContrOl Set Reference K033426

DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

# INTENDED USE:

The DiaSorin LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Calibration Verifiers are assayed quality control materials intended for use in the quantitative verification of calibration and reportable range of the LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Assay when performed on the LIAISON® Analyzer.

# KIT DESCRIPTION:

The LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Calibration Verifiers consist of four levels. Each vial contains lyophilized pooled human plasma spiked with PTH. The calibration verifiers are reconstituted with $2 . 0 m L$ of deionized or distilled water, allowed to sit for 10 minutes, and mixed gently before use.

The calibration verifier set is provided with targeted PTH concentrations of 20, 150, 350 and 1500 pg/mL. The four levels were chosen to incorporate the range of the LIAiSON® N-TACT® PTH Assay and to challenge the decision points of clinical importance for PTH.

# COMPARISON TO PREDICATE DEVICE:

The following table compares the LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Calibration Verifiers to LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH ContrOl Set.

Dear Ms. DePouw:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
