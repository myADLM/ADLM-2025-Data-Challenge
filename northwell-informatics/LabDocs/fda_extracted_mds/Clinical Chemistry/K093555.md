# Substantial equivalence

The cobas u 41 1 urinalysis test system is substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in the United States. We claim equivalence to the Chemstrip Urine Analyzer (K921087 and K931602). Both instruments are designed to provide semi-quantitative results using a reagent strip that includes test pads for determination of pH, leukocytes, blood, nitrite, protein, glucose, ketone, urobilinogen, bilirubin, and specific gravity.

Device Description

The cobas u 41 1 urine analyzer is a semi-automated, benchtop analyzer which is designed to read Chemstrip 10 UA (Combur"° Test M) test strips for urinalysis for the measurement of bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketone, leukocytes, nitrite, $\mathfrak { p H } ,$ protein, specific gravity, urobilinogen and color (if selected). These measurements are useful in the evaluation of renal, urinary and metabolic disorders. Tests performed using the cobas u411 are intended for prescription, in vitro diagnostic use only.

The functions of the cobas u 4l 1 analyzer includes:   
o Sample identification (with optional barcode scanner)   
o Controlled incubation period   
o Photometric measurements   
0 Result memory   
o Optional formats for data output

The following table compares the cobas u 411 urinalysis test system with the predicate device. These represent the features that are the same for both systems.
