# Device Descriptions:

# GEM Premier 4000 - Introductions / Modifications:

− Addition of total bilirubin (tBili) measurement with whole blood and heparinized plasma on the GEM Premier 4000 performed using spectrophotometric multi-component analysis through the instrument's existing CO-Oximetry module. Following the electrochemical measurements for blood gases, electrolytes and metabolites, a portion of the sample is chemically hemolyzed and brought into an optical cell for the CO-Oximetry measurements and the additional total bilirubin measurement. There were no hardware or mechanical changes required, and no changes to the reagent cartridge (PAK) formulation or sensors. The measurement of total bilirubin was implemented through software.

Expansion of the low-end reportable range for total hemoglobin (tHb) parameter from $5 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ to 3 $\mathrm { \bf g / d L }$ through additional testing.

Addition of a new $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ sample size for total bilirubin and CO-Oximetry mode only.

Automation of fetal hemoglobin correction for CO-Oximetry. Previously the user would input the age of the patient to apply the correction. The new software applies the correction automatically based on the presence of fetal hemoglobin in the sample without user input.

GEM CVP 2 with CO-Ox: This currently marketed external solution for the GEM Premier 4000 will also be value assigned for total bilirubin. No change in formulation.

GEM CVP 5 tBili: An additional external solution for the GEM Premier 4000, containing purified human hemoglobin, stabilizers and biocide in a physiologically buffered matrix, is being introduced at another level of total bilirubin.

GEM System Evaluator: Three-level aqueous buffered bicarbonate solution intended for use with the GEM Premier 4000 analyzer, containing inorganic salts and organic metabolites, dye and biocides; equilibrated with carbon dioxide and oxygen.

GEM Hematocrit Evaluator: Three-level aqueous buffered bicarbonate solution intended for use with the GEM Premier 4000 analyzer, containing inorganic salts and biocides; equilibrated with carbon dioxide and oxygen.

# Device Indications for Uses:

: GEM Premier 4000 with iQM (Intelligent Quality Management) • GEM CVP 2 (Calibration Valuation Product) with CO-Ox GEM CVP 5 (Calibration Valuation Product) tBili

The GEM Premier 4000 is a portable critical care system for use by health care professionals to rapidly analyze whole blood samples at the point of health care delivery in a clinical setting and in a central laboratory. The instrument provides quantitative measurements of pH $, p { \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 } , p { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ ,sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, glucose, lactate, hematocrit, total bilirubin and CO-Oximetry (tHb, ${ \mathrm { O } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { H b } }$ , COHb, MetHb, HHb) parameters. Total bilirubin can also be quantitated from heparinized plasma samples when analyzed in the tBili/CO-Ox mode. These parameters, along with derived parameters, aid in the diagnosis  a patient's acidbase status, electrolyte nd metabolite balace and oxygen delivery capacity.Total bilirubin measurements are used in the diagnosis and management of biliary tract obstructions, liver disease and various hemolytic diseases and disorders involving the metabolism of bilirubin. In neonates, the level of total bilirubin is used to aid in assessing the risk of kernicterus.

Intelligent Quality Management (iQM) is used as the quality control and assessment system for the GEM Premier 4000 system. iQM is an active quality process control program designed to provide continuous monitoring of the analytical process with real-time, automatic eror detection, automatic correction o the system and automatic documentation of all corrective actions, replacing the use of traditional external quality controls.Facilities should follow local, state and federal regulatory guidelines to ensure that a total quality management system is followed.

As part of this program, GEM CVP (Calibration Valuation Product) with CO-Ox, GEM CVP tBili and GEM CVP Hematocrit are external solutions intended to complete the calibration process and final accuracy assessment of the iQM cartridge calibration following warm-up. The reported values for GEM CVP (two levels for $\mathsf { p H }$ , blood gases, electrolytes, metabolites, total bilirubin, CO-Oximetry and hematocrit) must meet IL's specifications before the iQM cartridge can be used for patient sample measurements.Once the cartridge calibration is verified, the internal iM program monitors the status of the system during the cartridge use life.

GEM System Evaluator is a three level assayed quality control material intended for evaluating performance characteristics of $\mathfrak { p H }$ $p { \bf C } { \bf O } _ { 2 }$ , $p 0 _ { 2 }$ , Electrolytes, Metabolites, Total Bilirubin (tBili) and CO-Oximetry on the GEM Premier 4000 analyzer.

• GEM Hematocrit Evaluator is a three-level assayed quality control material intended for evaluating performance characteristics of hematocrit on the GEM Premier 4000 analyzer.

# Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Devices:

Testing supports that the GEM Premier 4000 when used for the measurement of total bilirubin (tBili) in conjunction with GEM CVP Level 2 with CO-Ox and GEM CVP 5 tBili and iQM is not materially different in intended use or performance from the ABL 735 Analyzer with traditional QC:
