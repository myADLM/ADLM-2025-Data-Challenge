# 4. Device Descriptions: B12

The B12 method is an in vitro diagnostic device that consists of pre-packaged reagents in a plastic eight well cartridge for use on the Dimension EXL ™M integrated chemistry system.

The vitamin B12 method is a homogeneous, competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathsf { L O C l @ }$ technology. $\angle O C 1 \textcircled { \mathbb { \ B } }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and biotinylated intrinsic factor (IF). The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a B12 derivative and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The patient sample is pretreated with Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) to release the serum B12 from its carrier proteins. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is added to convert all the forms of B12 into a single, cyanocobalamin form, and dicyanocobinamide is added to keep the 812 from rebinding with the carrier proteins. After the sample pretreatment, the biotinylated IF and chemibead reagents are added sequentially to the reaction vessel. Vitamin B12 from the sample competes with the B12-chemibead for a limited amount of biotinylated IF. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Ilumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from the Sensibeads which diffuses to the Chemibeads triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the concentration of vitamin B12 in the sample.

# Folate

The FOL method is an in vitro diagnostic device that consists of pre-packaged reagents in a plastic eight well cartridge for use on the Dimension EXL ™ integrated chemistry system.

The Folate method is a homogeneous, competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay based on ${ \mathsf { L O C l @ } }$ technology. LOC $\otimes$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and labeled folate binding protein (FBP). The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a folic acid derivative and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. Before the immunological portion of the reaction is initiated, the patient sample is pretreated with Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and Dithioerythritol (DTE) to release serum folate from endogenous folate binding protein (FBP) and to maintain 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in its reduced form. After the sample pretreatment, chemibeads and labeled folate binding reagent are added sequentially to the reaction vessel. Folate from the patient sample competes with the folate-chemibead for a limited amount of labeled FBP. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotinylated portion of the labeled FBP to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from the Sensibeads which diffuses to the Chemibeads triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the concentration of folate in the sample.

# 5. Device Intended Uses:

The B12 method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of Vitamin B12 in human serum and plasma on the Dimension EXL ™ integrated chemistry system.

The FOL method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of folate in human serum and plasma on the Dimension EXL ™M integrated chemistry system.

# 7. Method Comparison

A split sample method comparison was conducted using the Dimension@ B12 Flex® reagent cartridge vs. the Dimension Vista® B12 Flex® reagent cartridge. Two hundred and thirty- three (233) human serum samples ranging from 68 to 1920 pg/mL were used.

The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The analysis is as follows:

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \mathsf { S l o p e } = 0 . 9 8 } \\ { \mathsf { y - i n t e r c e p t } = 1 9 . 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L } } \\ { \mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 9 5 } \\ { \mathsf { n } = 2 3 3 } \end{array}
$$

A split sample method comparison was conducted using the Dimension® FOL Flex® reagent cartridge vs. the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FOL Flex® reagent cartridge. One hundred and thirty- eight (138) human serum samples ranging from 0.6 to $1 9 . 2 \ : \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ were . used. The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The analysis is as follows:

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \mathsf { S l o p e } \equiv 1 . 0 1 } \\ { \mathsf { y - i n t e r c e p t } = 0 . 0 5 \mathsf { n g / m L } } \\ { \mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 9 } \\ { \mathsf { n } = 1 3 8 } \end{array}

Dear Ms. Ennis

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
