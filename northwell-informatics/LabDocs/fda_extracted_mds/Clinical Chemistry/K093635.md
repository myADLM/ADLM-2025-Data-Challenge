2Device name:

Proprietary name: FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System /TD-4242 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Regulatory information:

A. Regulation section: 21 CFR 862.1345 Glucose Test System   
B. Classification: Class II   
C. Product Code: CGA, Glucose Oxidase, Glucose NBW, System, Test, Blood Glucose, Over The Counter   
D. Panel: Chemistry (75)

3. Intended Use:

The FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System/TD-4242 Blood Glucose Monitoring System are intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and 'the following alternative sites: the palm, the forearm, the upper-arm, the calf and the thigh. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates.

The alternative site testing in the FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System /TD-4242 Blood Glucose Monitoring System can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

This meter has some speaking functions but is not intended for use by the visually impaired.

Device Description:

The kit of FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System /TD-4242 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems consist of Glucose Meter, Test Strips, Control solution, A commercially available lancing device and sterile Lancets, User Manual, and Storage Pack.

5. Substantial Equivalence Information:

A. Predicate device name:   
FORA G30/TD-4241 Blood Glucose Monitoring System   
B. Predicate K number: K090187   
C. Comparison with predicate:   
The modified FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System /TD-4242 Blood   
Glucose Monitoring Systems have the following similarities to the predicate device: same operating principle,   
$\mid$ same fundamental scientific technology,   
$|$ incorporate the same basic circuit design, incorporate the same materials,

same shelf life packaged using the same materials, and Manufactured by the same process.

The modifications encompass:

A modification in the software of the glucose meter Speaking function Modification in the physical appearance Addition of components: voice chip and speaker Labeling change due to the software modification

Test Principle:

The detection and measurement of glucose in blood is by an electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose oxidase.

7Performance Characteristics:

FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System /TD-4242 Blood Glucose Monitoring System have the same performance characteristics as the predicate device.

A comparison of system accuracy performance demonstrated that the FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System /TD-4242 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the currently marketed FORA G30/TD-4241 Blood Glucose Monitoring System are substantially equivalent.

Software verification and validation testing confirmed that the performance, safety and effectiveness of the FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System /TD-4242 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are equivalent to the predicate device.

8. Conclusion:

Based on the information provided in this submission, the FORA V30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System /TD-4242 Blood Glucose Monitoring System are substantially equivalent to the predicate FORA G30/TD-4241 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

Dear Ms. Debra Liang:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class ⅡI (Special Controls) or class ⅢI (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
