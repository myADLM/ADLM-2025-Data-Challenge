ADVIA Chemistry DRUG Calibrator I

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1150 Calibrator.

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product Code: JIX, calibrator, multi-analyte mixture

4Panel: Clinical Chemistry

# F. Predicate Device:

ADVIA Chemistry DRUG Calibrator I is substantially equivalent to the (formerly) Dade Behring Dimension Drug Calibrator (DC22B) cleared under K011035.

# G. Device Description:

ADVIA Chemistry DRUG Calibrator I is a multi-analyte, liquid, human serum based product containing multiple analytes. The kit consists of 2 vials each of 5 calibrator levels which are ready for use (no preparation is required). The volume per vial is 3.0 mL. Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, and Theophylline are value assigned for ADVIA

Chemistry systems. In addition DRUG Calibrator I also contains Lithium and Digoxin with no specific value assignment on ADVIA Chemistry systems at this time.

# H. Intended Use:

The ADVIA Chemistry DRUG Calibrator I is for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of Phenobarbital (PHNB_2), Phenytoin (PHNY_2), and Theophylline (THEO_2) methods on the ADVIA Chemistry Systems

# I. Substantial Equivalence Information:

The ADVIA Chemistry DRUG Calibrator I and Dimension Drug Calibrator I were compared in the following table.

Dear Ms. Gordon:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
