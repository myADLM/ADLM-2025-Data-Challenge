# 6.0 Device description

The four blood Glucose Monitoring system AG-695 Single, AG-695 MULTI, AG-696 Single and AG-696 MILTI are all based on an electrochemical biosensor technology (electrochemical) and the principle of capillary action. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in 5 seconds. The control solution available is used to test the performance of the device. All of them use the same technological characteristics for testing but the appearance is different from their predicate device. More over, all of the four systems have a voice function.

# 8.0 Performance summary

AG-695 Single BGMS, AG-695 MULTI BGMS, AG-696 Single BGMS and AG-696 MULTI BGMS conform to the following standards:

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems- Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus. • FDA Draft Guidance Document-Total Product Life Cycle for Portable Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems: October 24, 2006 Disinfectant CaviWipes with the EPA registration number of 46781-8 has been validated to clean and disinfect the BGMS, and the performance and material will not be effected by the disinfection during the BGMS' lifetime.

# 9.0 Comparison to the predict device and the conclusion

The four blood glucose monitor AG-695 Single AG-695 MULTI, AG-696 Single and AG-696 MULT1 are very similar with the predicate device AG-606, their appearance is different from AG-606, they use the different test strips, they also has a new voice function. And the intended use of AG-695 MULTI and AG-696 MULTI are also different from their predicate device.

However, the test in this submission provides demonstration that these small differences do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness.
