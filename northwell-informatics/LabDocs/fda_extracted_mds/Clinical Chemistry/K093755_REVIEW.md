# K. Standard/ Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO15197:2003- In vitro diagnostic test systems – Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The AG-695 Single and AG-695 Multi are the same meters and the AG-696 Single and AG-696 Multi are the same meters. All four meters use the same test strip; however they have separate names due to single patient use and multi-patient use.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-day precision studies were performed using venous whole blood samples spiked with five different glucose concentrations, three different test strip lots, 10 different AG-695, and 10 AG-696 blood glucose meters. Each glucose level was evaluated 10 times for a total of 100 tests per each glucose level for each type of meter (AG-695 and AG-696). Results are summarized below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using 11spiked whole blood samples ranging in glucose concentrations from 17 to $6 1 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (17, 51, 76, 124, 201, 235, 311, 375, 482, 530, $6 1 4 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ as measured by YSI. Each level was measured 5 times and the values from the AG-695 meter were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300. The same evaluation was performed with the AG-696 meter with samples ranging from 19 to $6 0 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose (19, 38, 91, 146, 214, 262, 321, 400, 493, 570, $6 0 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) as measured by YSI. Results from regression analysis:

The claimed range of measurement for this device is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor claims that the system accuracy of the AG-695 and AG-696 meters is calibrated to a laboratory analyzer, YSI 2300. A method comparison was performed using the YSI 2300 as the comparative method. See Comparison studies in 2 a below.

Two levels of control material, Level II (96 to $1 4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and Level III (250 to 420 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ are available for use with this test system. These control solutions were previously cleared under k093262. The meters in the current submission use the same test strip as was previously cleared (k093262). For the current submission, value assignment was performed by testing each level of control solution 100 times using 5 of each of the meters in this submission (AG-695 and AG-696).

c. Detection limit:

The reportable range for the both the AG-695 and AG-696 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b) above.

# d. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor spiked venous whole blood samples with glucose to obtain concentrations of 80, 120, and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool and each potential interfering substance was added to the test pool.

Each level was analyzed 5 times total with two AG-695 meters and 5 times total with two AG-696 meters with 3 lots of glucose strips. The $\%$ difference between the sample containing interfering substance and the control sample was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as $\leq 1 0 \%$ difference. Results are presented in the table below:

Higher levels of the following substances were tested and found to interfere; therefore, the following are included in the user manual and test strip insert: “the following substances at levels greater than normal or therapeutic levels may cause significant interference: acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine and L-dopa” and “do not use icterus samples”.

# Hematocrit study:

The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and $5 5 \%$ spiked with glucose to achieve 7 concentrations ranging from 21 to $5 9 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was then tested in triplicate using the AG-695 meter and in triplicate using the AG-696 meter. For each sample the value obtained from the meter was compared with that obtained from the YSI-2300 analyzer. The $\%$ biases to YSI for both meters were $\leq 1 5 \%$ for samples within the claimed range of 30 to $5 5 \%$ hematocrit.

# System Accuracy:

The sponsor performed accuracy studies to demonstrate that the AG-695 and AG-696 blood glucose monitoring systems are equivalent to the reference method, YSI 2300. Capillary samples from 100 volunteers were evaluated. The samples used for the AG-695 had glucose concentrations, according to YSI, ranging from 21.6 to 504 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and those used for the AG-696 ranged from 23.4 to $4 6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . To obtain blood glucose concentrations $< 5 0$ and $> 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , samples were allowed to glycolize or were spiked to achieve the desired glucose concentration. The results relative to YSI are summarized in the tables below:

# User Performance Study:

To demonstrate the accuracy of the AG-695 and AG-696 blood glucose monitoring systems the sponsor performed a study for each of the meters with 100 lay user

participants and one technician at four different hospitals. The participants, who were able to read the User’s Manual in English were instructed to read the manual, obtain their own finger stick sample and perform testing using the meter (AG-695 or AG696). The technician then performed the testing on an additional fingerstick sample from the user. The samples ranged from 50 to $3 4 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the AG-695 and 52 to $3 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the AG-696. A sample was then taken from each participant by the technician and measured by YSI-2300. The results are summarized in the tables below:

# Visually Impaired User Study:

The sponsor performed a visually impaired user study with 100 participants with visual impairments ranging from moderate to profound with vision categories from 0.02 to 0.3 according to the ICD-9 World Health Organization classification. The users performed their own finger sticks and performed the test by following a large print user’s manual in English for the meter (AG-695 or AG-696). The technician then performed the testing on an additional fingerstick sample from each user. A sample was then taken from each participant by the technician and measured by YSI2300. The samples ranged from 53.9 to $3 2 4 { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ glucose as measured by YSI. Labeling states that this system contains a speaking function that provides audible test results for users with impaired vision and the audible function does not provide complete instructions for all functions of the meter or for performing a glucose test.

# N. Instrument Name:

AG-695 Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System AG-696 Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System AG-695 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System AG-696 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System,

# O. System Description:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ___ or No __X_

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No ___X___

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No

The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and developed under good software life-cycle processes.

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

The meter uses a code strip. To code the meter the code strip is inserted into the meter. Once the “OK” appears on the screen, the meter is coded and the code strip can be removed.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor provides one level of glucose control solution, Level II (cleared under k093262), with this kit. Additional (Level III) control solution (also cleared under k093262), is also available for purchase separately, as stated in the labeling. The labeling provides recommendations on when to test control materials. To perform a control test the user is instructed to press the S button in step 5. Once the “CTL” appears on the screen the control results will be prevented from being stored in the memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to customer support for problems and more information.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Altitude Studies: Capillary whole blood samples from 20 volunteers with glucose concentrations, according to YSI, ranging from 70 to $4 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the AG-695 meter and 68 to $3 9 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the AG-696 meter were measured at 11,975 feet (3650 meters). All individual measurements resulted in $\%$ biases less than $+ / - 1 0 \%$ relative to the YSI value. The results support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 11,975 feet have no significant effect (relative to YSI) on blood glucose measurements from the AG-695 and AG-696 meters.

2. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples (with glucose concentrations of 52, 168 and 418 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ and 3 of each meter (AG-695 and the AG-696). Several temperatures ranging from 50 to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (10 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) to and relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ were tested and meter results compared to YSI values. Six temperature and humidity combination were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. Results demonstrated that both devices can be used in conditions of 50 to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (10 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) with relative humidity below $90 \%$ and stored at 39 to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ and relative humidity below $8 5 \%$ . No significant effect (relative to YSI) was observed at the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used can be used in conditions of 50 to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (10 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) with relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ .

3. Insufficient and excessive sample volume studies were performed using venous blood samples (approximately 45, 55, 115, 140, 230, 376, and $4 5 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and 3 of each meter (AG-695 and AG-696). Five were tested (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1.0 and $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) were tested around the recommended sample volume of $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . Seven glucose concentrations were tested ranging from approximately $4 5 { - } 4 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , as determined by the YSI. Results support the claimed sample volume of $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

4. Infection Control Studies: The devices are intended for single-patient use (AG-695 Single and AG-696 Single) or multiple-patient use (AG-695 Multi and AG-696 Multi). Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters and lancing device by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration # 46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials for each of the meters and lancing device after 11,000 cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps with CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

5. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained SMOG Grade Level Scores of 8 for the User’s Manual, test strip insert and control solution insert.

6. The sponsors provided the appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and the AG-695 and AG-696 were found compliant (IEC 61326, IEC 61010).
