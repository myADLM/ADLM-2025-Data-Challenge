Trade Name: BGM Galectin-3 TM Common / Usual name: Galectin-3 assay Classification name: Galectin-3 IVD assay Product Code: OSX

# Predicate Device

Biosite, Inc. Triage® B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Test (K080269, K052789, K051787, K033383, K032235, K030286, K021317, K010266, and K003475).

# Device Description

BGM Galectin-3 is a microtiter plate-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) for the quantitative determination of galectin-3 levels in human serum and plasma. BGM Galectin-3 consists of a rat monoclonal anti-mouse galectin-3 antibody coated microtiter plate serving as the solid phase capture antibody and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-human galectin-3 antibody functioning as the liquid phase tracer antibody for detecting bound galectin-3.

In the testing procedure, galectin-3 in the standard, control, or patient specimen binds to the immobilized capture antibody; after a wash step, bound galectin-3 is detected by the addition of HRP-labeled anti-galectin-3 antibody. Following a second wash step, the b presence of bound galectin-3 is demonstrated by an enzymatic blue color development resulting from the addition of tetramethylbenzidene (TMB) solution as the substrate. Color development is stopped by adding sulfuric acid, changing the color to yellow. Color intensity is read at an absorbance of $4 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ using a colorimetric reader. The absorbance is proportional to the galectin-3 levels in the samples, and test results of the samples are determined using a calibration curve derived from the standards.

BGM Galectin-3 contains the microtiter plate, reagents, assayed quality control materials and standards required to perform analyses on serum or EDTA-plasma samples.

# Intended Use

BGM Galectin-3 is an in vitro diagnostic device that quantitatively measures galectin-3 in serum or EDTA-plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) on a microtiter plate platform to be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation as an aid in assessing prognosis of patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure (HF). BGM Galectin-3 is indicated for prescription use only.

# Summary of Performance Data

# Precision

Precision of BGM Galectin-3 was assessed in an evaluation according to the CLSI EP5- A2 guideline. Six (6) EDTA-plasma pools spanning a range of galectin-3 concentrations were analyzed in duplicate with two (2) runs per day over twenty (20) days using one (1) reagent lot, two (2) operators and one (1) microtiter plate reader. Estimates of withinrun, run-to-run, day-to-day and total precision were calculated and met acceptance criteria. Results are summarized in Table 2.

The table above shows the results of the precision evaluation with EDTA-plasma pools. An additional experiment was performed using serum pools which yielded similar results. Additional test pools at multiple galectin-3 concentrations were also tested and yielded similar results.

# Clinical Laboratory Precision

Precision was also evaluated at three (3) CLIA-certified clinical laboratories according the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. The study included testing of EDTA-plasma pools spanning three (3) galectin-3 concentrations, across two (2) reagent lots, using three (3) different models of microtiter plate readers, and a total of four (4) different operators. Total testing days were 17, 18 and 20 days across the three sites, yielding 110 unique analytical runs. Results from each of the CLIA laboratories were within acceptable limits.

# Linearity

The linearity of BGM Galectin-3 was established according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Evaluation Protocol 6 (CLSI EP6-A guideline). Samples were prepared to span a clinically-meaningful measurement range of galectin-3 concentrations. Linearity of BGM Galectin-3 was demonstrated between 1.4 and $9 4 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . These linearity data are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Linearity of BGM Galectin-3

# Dilution Parallelism

Dilution parallelism was evaluated by analyzing ten (10) clinical specimens with endogenous native galectin-3 concentrations from $2 1 . 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ to $8 8 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ at 1:20, 1:40, 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions. Results support ten-fold sample dilution only (1:10). Samples that yield galectin-3 results greater than the upper end of the measurement range $( 9 4 . 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ should NOT be diluted beyond 1: 10 and should be reported as "galectin-3 value exceeds the upper limit of the measurement range" or utilize language consistent with laboratory or institutional policies.

# High Dose Hook Effect

There is no high dose hook effect at galectin-3 levels up to ${ 5 0 0 } ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$

# Sample Matrices

The BGM Galectin-3 assay has been validated for use with EDTA-plasma or serum samples. The equivalence of these sample matrices were demonstrated in a study of forty-nine (49) matched serum and EDTA-plasma samples with values spanning the measurement range. The regression equation is shown in the $\mathbf { x } / \mathbf { y }$ scatter plot in Figure 2.

# Detection Limit

The limit of detection and limit of quantitation of BGM Galectin-3 were established according to the recommendation of the CLSI EP17-A guideline. The limit of blank (LoB) was determined as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile value of forty-eight (48) replicate measurements of the BGM Galectin-3 Assay Buffer. The limit of detection (LoD) was $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + \mathsf { c } _ { \beta }$ SDs, where SDs is the pooled standard deviations from four (4) serum samples with different levels of galectin-3, each of which was measured in sixteen (16) replicates (for a total of sixty-four (64) measurements) and $\tau _ { \beta }$ is the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution corrected for the degree of freedom. The Limit of quantitation (LoQ) was specified as the lowest galectin-3 concentration of the serum samples closest to while above the LoD, which is $1 . 3 2 ~ \mathrm { \mathfrak { n g / m L } }$ . For this sample, the coefficient of variation (CV) for the galectin-3 measurement was $1 0 . 4 \%$ .

$$
\begin{array} { l l } { { L i m i t o f B l a n k ( L o B ) \mathrm { : } \qquad } } & { { \mathrm { L o B = 0 . 8 6 \ n g / m L } } } \\ { { L i m i t o f D e t e c t i o n ( L o D ) \mathrm { : } \qquad } } & { { \mathrm { L o D = \ell _ { 1 } . 1 3 \ n g / m L } } } \\ { { L i m i t o f Q u a n t i t a t i o n ( L o Q ) \mathrm { : } \qquad } } & { { \mathrm { L o Q = \ell _ { 1 } . 3 2 \ n g / m L } } } \end{array}
$$

Note: The LoQ does not represent the lower end of the measuring range and should not be used for that purpose. The measuring range is 1.4 to 94.8 ng/mL as reported in the Measuring Range and Linearity sections of this document.

# Cross Reactivity

BGM Galectin-3 displayed no significant cross-reactivity when tested in the presence of the following compounds: galectin-1, galectin-2, galectin-4, galectin-7, galectin-8, galectin-9, galectin-12, collagen I and collagen III, all at a concentration of ${ 5 0 0 } ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The mean $\%$ cross-reactivity of the above potential cross-reactants is at or below $0 . 3 \%$ .

# Interfering Substances

BGM Galectin-3 was evaluated for the efects of potential interfering substances, both endogenous and exogenous, according to the recommendations of the CLSI EP7-A guideline, using an interference acceptance limit of $+ / - 1 0 \%$ . Conjugated bilirubin (up to $1 6 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), unconjugated bilirubin (up to $4 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , albumin (BSA, up to $1 2 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ triglycerides (up to $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } ) }$ , cholesterol (up to $7 4 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and creatinine (up to 5 ${ \mathfrak { m g } } / { \mathrm { d L } } )$ do not show any significant interference in the assay based on the interference acceptance limit $( + / - 1 0 \% )$ . Purified hemoglobin (up to ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L }$ does not show significant interference in BGM Galectin-3; however, packed blood cell lysate does show interference. Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) cause significant positive interference and rheumatoid factor (RF) greater than $5 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ causes significant positive interference with BGM Galectin-3. High levels of gamma globulins $( \geq 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ may cause false elevation in galectin-3 levels. This information is summarized in Table 4.

# Expected Values (Reference Range)

A reference distribution for galectin-3 was determined through an observational study. Galectin-3 levels were measured in 1,099 banked plasma samples from a population of apparently healthy subjects without known heart disease but that otherwise resemble, by age and gender distribution, the HF patient population. Specimens were from women between the ages of 60 and 80 years $\scriptstyle ( n = 5 7 5 )$ ) and men between the ages of 55 and 80 $( \mathfrak { n } \mathrm { = } 5 2 4 )$ .This reference population comprised individuals of different ethnic background, as follows: Black or African-American $( \mathsf { n { = } 3 0 7 } , 2 7 . 9 \% )$ , Caucasian $\left( \mathfrak { n } { = } 6 9 1 , 6 2 . 9 \% \right)$ , Hispanic $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } { = } 4 2 , 3 . 8 \% )$ Asian or Pacific Islander $( n { = } 3 0 , 2 . 7 \% )$ , and not specified $( \mathfrak { n } { = } 2 9 , 2 . 6 \% )$ All subjects had detectable galectin-3 levels (min-max, $3 . 2 \textrm { - } 9 4 . 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ within the measuring range of BGM Galectin-3. Blood plasma samples were collected from study participant into tubes containing

EDTA. The blood was processed and blood plasma was subsequently frozen at ${ \mathfrak { - 8 0 } } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or colder.

Table 6 summarizes the galectin-3 distribution results. The $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathfrak { t h } }$ percentile of the galectin-3 distribution from this reference population is $2 6 . 2 ~ \mathrm { \mathfrak { n g / m L } }$ .

Each laboratory should establish a reference range that is representative of the patient population to be evaluated. Additionally, each laboratory should consider their current practice in the evaluation of heart failure patients at each institution.

# Clinical Studies and Interpretation of Results

To validate the clinical effectiveness of the BGM Galectin-3 assay, galectin-3 levels were measured in an independent set of 895 banked EDTA-plasma samples from patients in the United States and Canada in a controlled multi-center clinical study, the Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) study. The HF-ACTION study involved 2,331 chronic HF patients with left ventricular dysfunction and with NYHA class II, III or IV symptoms. The average age of the 895 participants whose galectin-3 levels were assessed in the clinical validation study was 58 years, $2 9 \%$ were female, and $3 6 \%$ were non-white. Sensitivity analysis was performed comparing the set of 895 HF-ACTION subjects having evaluable galectin-3 values with all other HF-ACTION participants, and it was found that the clinical validation results based on the evaluable set of subjects were robust and representative of the larger study population. The median follow-up time was approximately 30 months. Participants were categorized based on galectin-3 risk categories defined below:

The derived galectin-3-dependent risk categories are as follows:

galectin-3 greater than $2 5 . 9 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ galectin-3 between 17.8 and $2 5 . 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ EPY galectin-3 less than or equal to $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

For the clinical validation study, Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association of baseline galectin-3 levels in HF patients with the endpoints of: (i) composite of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization, (ii) cardiovascular mortality, and (iii) composite of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure-related hospitalization, and (iv) all-cause mortality. Galectin-3 levels were found to be significantly associated with increased risk of each of these endpoints in Cox regression models (Table 7, Table 9, Table I 1, and Table 14). Galectin-3 remained significantly associated with increased risk upon adjustment for baseline risk factors of age, gender, NYHA functional classification, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes status, and smoking status. Figure 3 displays Kaplan Meier curves for the composite endpoint of allcause mortality or all-cause hospitalization, by baseline galectin-3 category.

Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6 display cumulative probabilities for events for the endpoints of the composite of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular mortality, and the composite of cardiovascular mortality and heart failurerelated hospitalization in the clinical validation study, by baseline galectin-3 category at timepoints of 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after baseline.

# Interpretation

The BGM Galectin-3 assay results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical evaluation as an aid in the assessment of prognosis of patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure.

Patients with chronic heart failure with galectin-3 levels over $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were found to have a higher risk of adverse outcomes including mortality or hospitalization compared to patients with levels below $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Galectin-3 levels between $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and 25.9 ${ \mathfrak { n g } } / { \mathfrak { m L } }$ should be interpreted with caution because these values lie within the reference range.

# Interpretation Relative to Natriuretic Peptides

Galectin-3 and natriuretic peptides are measures of separate and distinct biological processes. Each marker provides independent and complementary information on the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.

Table 15 illustrates this for N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the clinical validation study by evaluating primary endpoint event rates by categories of galectin-3 and NT-proBNP.

Table 15.Event Rates at 6, 12, 24 and 36 Months for the Composite Endpoint of All-Cause Mortality and All-Cause Hospitalization, by Galectin-3 Category and NT-proBNP level, for HF Subjects in the Clinical Validation Study. The median value for NT-proBNP in the Clinical Validation Study was $8 4 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# Conclusion

Measurement of galectin-3 with the BGM Galectin-3 assay using a colorimetric microtiter plate reader is a safe and effective in vitro diagnostic device for use as an aid by clinicians in the assessment of prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure. Based on the foregoing, the performance of BGM Galectin-3 does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness when used, as labeled, than those presented by the predicate device.
