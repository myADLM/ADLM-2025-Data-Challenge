# Device Description

The ${ \mathsf { S o l o V } } 2 ^ { \mathrm { { T M } } }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a blood glucose meter, test strips, control solutions, lancing device, and commercially available lancets. The meter has a bilingual speaking feature that provides audible test results for users with low vision. The forearm may be used as an alternate site for capillary blood.

# 5.Intended Use

The $\mathrm { S o l o V } 2 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the forearm. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home and as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of a diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis or screening for diabetes mellitus, nor for use with neonates.

The alternative site testing (forearm) in this system can only be used during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

This system contains a speaking function that provides audible test results for users with low vision.

# Comparison to Predicate Device

Modifications to the cleared device include additional buttons for volume and language adjustment, additional pre-meal and post-meal Logging Flags, substitution of a USB connection for the previous RS232 cable, addition of an insufficient blood error message, and the removal of the test strip ejector mechanism. The size and shape of the device have also been modified to differentiate from the predicate. The $\mathrm { S o l o } \bar { \mathrm { V } } 2 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System has the same indented use and fundamental scientific technology as the previous version, the SuperCheck 1 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model 6268.

# Performance Studies

Biotest Medical Corp. has conducted a risk analysis and has performed the necessary verification and validation activities to demonstrate that the design outputs of the modified device meet the design input requirements.

# 8. Conclusion

In summary, the modified $\mathtt { S o l o V 2 ^ { T M } }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System has the same intended use and fundamental scientific technology as the previous version of the device, which received $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ clearance (K091815). Therefore, the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear: Ms. Chu:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
