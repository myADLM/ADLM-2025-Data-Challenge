# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

ARKRAY conducted bench testing to demonstrate data accuracy transmission for each meter stated in H. 4., special instrument requirements, above. Meter flags/functions were tested such as control solution, DEL (or!), and temperature warning to verify the information properly downloads from the meters to the data management software. Memory data rollover was also tested by adding four (4) data points to meters that were pre-loaded with full memory. Test results show that all glucose values, flags, date, and time properly downloaded from the meters to the software. Memory data rollover also functioned properly where the new glucose values replaced the oldest glucose values.

In addition, two studies each intended to assess personal lay users and professional healthcare users in the setup and use of on ARKRAY’s Diabetes Data Management Software were conducted. The first study included 31 personal lay users and 5 professionals and the second study included 45 personal lay users and 10 professionals. The two studies evaluated a combined, seventy-six (76) diabetic adult consumers and fifteen (15) healthcare professionals who work with diabetics.

The GLUCOCARD X-METER, GLUCOCARD $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Vital™, and PocketChem EZ Meter have different user interface. The PocketChem EZ has identical user interface as the, GLUCOCARD 01, Easy PRO Plus, and EasyPro Plus.

76 Personal lay users were given the software program on CD, operating manual, step by step user instructions, a computer and printer, an ARKRAY blood glucose meter with a USB cable and the study questionnaires. They were instructed to:

1. Install the software program as directed in the operating manual.   
2. Start/access software program.   
3. Enter User Information   
4. Download and save data from the glucose meter.   
5. Access and view information in logbook.   
6. Enter user health information (carbohydrates and exercise)   
7. View and print graphs and reports.   
8. Export CSV files.   
9. Exit software program.

10. Complete “Ease of Use” and “Performance” Questionnaires.

15 Professional users were given a copy of the software program on CD, operating Manual, step by step user instructions, computer, an ARKRAY blood glucose meter with a USB cable and the study questionnaires. Using simulated patient data they were instructed to:

1. Install and start the software program as instructed in the operating manual.   
2. Enter patient preferences and profile (name, target ranges, patient   
demographics, printer preferences, time block settings …).   
3. Enter user health information (carbohydrates and exercise).   
4. Download and save data from the blood glucose meter.   
5. View and print graphs and reports.   
6. Import and export CSV files.   
7. Enter “Other Data” (HbA1c).   
8. Exit software program.   
9. Complete “Ease of Use” and “Performance” Questionnaires.

Personal lay users rated ARKRAY's Diabetes Data Management Software Program at $100 \%$ for overall program as easy or somewhat easy. There were no users that rated the software program as somewhat difficult or difficult.

Overall, professional health care users rated ARKRAY Diabetes Data Management Software Program at $100 \%$ as easy or somewhat easy.
