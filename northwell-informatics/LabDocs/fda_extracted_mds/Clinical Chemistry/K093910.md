# 8. Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

# Method Comparison Studies

Clinical evaluations were performed to determine the safety and efliciency of the IMPROVACUTER $^ { ( \mathbb { R } ) }$ E Gel & Clot Activator Tube. The devices were compared to the predicatc BD Vacutainer® tubes in total 28 chemistry assays and 13 Immunology assays. The results of the clinical evaluation demonstrated that the IMPROVACUTER $^ { \textregistered }$ Gel & Clot Activator Tube provide clinically equivalent chemistry analyte results when compared to the BD Vacutainer $\langle \widehat { \mathbb { R } } \rangle$ tubes.

All comparison studies results demonstrate that there are no major differences between IMPROVACUTER $^ { ( \widehat { \mathbb { R } } ) }$ tubes and BD Vacutainer $- \infty$ tubes.

# Stability Studies

Studies were conducted to compare fresh specimens,24 hours and 48 hours stored both at $2 { \cdot } 8 \mathbb { C }$ and at $2 2 . 2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . All results showed no significant different from BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ stored under the same condition.

Analyte stability testing has been conducted for al the analytes listed. Stability for 24 hours at room temperature and refrigerated temperature has been demonstrated for all the analytes except TBIL. TBIL is stable at room temperature for up to 20 hours.

All comparison studies results demonstrate that there are no major differences betwcen IMPROVACUTER $\circledast$ tubes and BD Vacutainer® tubes.

# Shelf- life Studies

The shelf life studics are to research whether the IMPROVACUTER@ Gel & Clot Activator Tube have significant difference from the ones which had just been manufactured. All results showed no significant different from these.

All comparison studies results demonstratc that there are no major differences between IMPROVACUTER $\circledast$ tubes and BD Vacutainer® tubes.

# Same-Lot Repeatability Study

This test is intended to test IMPROVACUTER $^ { \textregistered }$ Gel & Clot Activator Tube, whose lots are the same to those of products used in Method Comparison Study. Compare the test results with those of Method Comparison Study to determine whether there are major differences.

All comparison studies results demonstrate that therc are no major differences between IMPROVACUTER $^ { \textregistered }$ tubes and BD Vacutainer $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \langle \widehat { \mathbf { B } } \rangle$ tubes.

# Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility Study

Select 2 lots from both materials of normally produced IMPROVACUTER $^ { \textregistered }$ Gel & Clot Activator Tube. and compare the test results with those of Method Comparison Study to determine whether there are major differences.

All comparison studies results demonstrate that there are no major differences between IMPROVACUTER $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ tubes and BD Vacutainer $\mathbf { \hat { \rho } } ( \mathbf { \hat { R } } )$ tubes.
