Intended Use:

DIDGET $\mathfrak { Q }$ World Reports Diabetes Management Software is an over-the -counter software program for use by healthcare professionals and patients with diabetes for viewing and printing reports that display blood sugar readings from Bayer's DIDGET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ blood glucose meter.

Technological Characteristics:

There were no changes to the fundamental scientific technology.

Comparison to Predicate device:

DIDGET® World Reports Diabetes Management Software is similar in function to the predicate device, GLucoFACTs® Express Diabetes Management Software, k082486, but has been updated to run off of the Didget World web server.

Assessment of Performance:

Performance was assessed in a study that included fifty (50) subjects consisting of 3 healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 47 lay users (35 young adults with diabetes and 12 parents or legal guardians of children with diabetes). The study showed that the program is easy to use and the results are understandable by the users.

Conclusion:

The results of the verification and validation studies of the DIDGET® World Reports Diabetes Management Software demonstrated that the product is safe and effective in the hands of lay users and healthcare professionals. The product is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Brocchi:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
