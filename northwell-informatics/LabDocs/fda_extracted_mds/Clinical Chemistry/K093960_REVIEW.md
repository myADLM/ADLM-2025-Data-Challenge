# L. Test Principle:

The ST AIA-PACK Cystatin C is a two-site quantitative fluorescent immunoassay which is performed entirely in the ST AIA-PACK Cystatin C test cups. Cystatin C present in the test sample is bound with monoclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody. The magnetic beads are washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional to the cystatin C concentration in the test sample. A standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated using this curve.

A second precision study was performed on a set of unaltered serum, heparinized plasma (Na-heparin) and EDTA plasma specimens (three levels of each) using two AIA-1800 instruments, two lots of reagents, three operators and one calibration cycle for a total number of 160 per sample.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity study was performed according to the CLSI guideline EP6-A. Low and high serum, heparinized plasma and EDTA plasma specimens were selected. The low specimen was prepared by 1:10 dilution of a higher serum, heparinized plasma or EDTA plasma specimen using the sample dilution solution. The high specimen was unaltered serum, heparinized plasma or EDTA plasma.

The intermediate concentrations were made by mixing the high and low samples at constant intervals. A total of 11 specimens each for serum, heparinized plasma and EDTA plasma ranging from $0 . 1 - 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ were assayed on the AIA-1800 in 4 replicates. The data was analyzed using linear regression as well as second and third order non-linear fitted polynomial regression. The third order model fit the data better than the linear model. However, the difference between the linear and non-linear model (within the claimed interval) was within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Furthermore, the $\%$ recovery and the coefficient of variability at each dilution were within $\pm 1 0 \%$

Therefore, the sponsor determined the linearity of the proposed assay to be from 0.1 to $8 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ which is the same as the reportable range.

# Dilution Studies:

To determine recovery following the recommended dilution ratio for samples that read above the measuring range, 5 unaltered serum, 5 heparinized plasma, and 5 EDTA plasma samples were spiked with cystatin C (ranging from approximately 8 to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ) and were automatically diluted onboard the instrument (as recommended in the package insert). All samples fell within $\pm$ $10 \%$ of the expected value.

# Recovery Studies:

Three serum, 3 heparinized plasma, and 3 EDTA plasma with different concentrations of cystatin C were spiked with 3 different levels of cystatin C. Each sample was assayed in triplicate before and after spiking. The percent recovery was calculated (measured value/expected value) $\textbf { x } 1 0 0$ . The percent recovery for all samples fell within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected value.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): There is no international recognized reference standard for cystatin C. The calibrators are traceable to internal cystatin C standards.

The calibrators are value assigned using the mean of multiple replicates of each calibrator on multiple analyzers using multiple ST AIA-PACK Cystatin C assays. The protocols for value assignment and validation of value assignment were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Real-time stability studies were performed. The closed vial stability of the calibrators was determined to be 12 months when stored at 8 to $1 2 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The open vial stability of the calibrators was determined to be 1 day when stored at 8 to $1 2 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

Calibrations were determined to be stable for 90 days.

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limit studies were developed with reference to the CLSI Guideline EP17-A. To define the limit of the blank (LoB), a blank sample was measured in 60 replicates. A non-parametric principle based on ordered values was used since values less than zero are not reported. LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 0 1 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

LoD: To determine the LoD, the standard deviation of sample measurements (SDs) was obtained from 10 measurements of 6 low level samples. Pooled CV and SD were calculated for the 6 samples. LoD was calculated using the

formula: $\mathrm { L o D = L o B + c \beta x \ ; }$ SDs. LoD was determined to be $0 . 0 0 1 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ where ${ \tt c \beta }$ was derived from the 95th percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution (and the correction factor).

LoQ: The test results from the LoD study were used to calculate the bias and imprecision for that level of the analyte. Pooled SDs and total bias were calculated. The TE was then determined using the formula: $\mathrm { T E } { = } \mathrm { B i a s } + / { - }$ 2SDs. The TE was determined to be $0 . 0 0 0 4 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The goal for the TE was set as $0 . 0 0 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Since the TE was lower than the goal, the LoD was equal to the LoQ. LoQ was determined to be $0 . 0 0 1 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

Since the linearity of the proposed assay was demonstrated to be from 0.1 to $8 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ the sponsor claims 0.1 to $8 \mathrm { m g / L }$ as the reportable range of the assay.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed on serum, heparinized plasma and EDTA plasma samples. Test samples (with approximately 0.6, 2 and 4 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ cystatin C concentrations) were spiked with the potentially interfering substances and analyzed in triplicate at each level. The sponsor defined interference as recovery outside of $10 \%$ of known specimen concentrations.

The following potential interfering compounds were evaluated and found not to interfere with the assay:

Hemoglobin (up to $4 7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ • Conjugated bilirubin (up to $1 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Free bilirubin (up to $1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) Triglyceride (up to $1 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ • Human albumin (up to $5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ ) • Ascorbic acid (up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) • Rheumatoid factor (up to $1 3 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$

Hook Effect:

The sponsor demonstrated that no hook effect was observed with cystatin C concentrations up to $1 2 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .
