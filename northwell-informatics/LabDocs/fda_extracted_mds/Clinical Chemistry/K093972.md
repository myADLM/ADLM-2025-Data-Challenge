# Device Description

BD Microtainer® MAP Microtube for Automated Process consists of a plastic reservoir and a lavender cap indicating the presence of K2EDTA. The interior surface of the reservoir is spray-coated with K2EDTA solution, which is then dried. The upper edge of the reservoir serves as a collector for blood specimen. The plastic reservoir is a one piece design - reservoir and extender, which were previously two separate components in the predicate device (K940905).

The integrated extender gives the tube an external dimension of a standard tube (13x75mm), while maintaining the same internal characteristics for low specimen volume range and K2EDTA blood to additive ratio as the predicate. The lavender cap features a penetrable septum.

These integrated features: one piece reservoir/extender and penetrable cap adapts the tube for compatibility with high throughput hematology instruments. Once the blood specimen is collected and mixed adequately, there is no longer a need to remove the cap, transfer the sample to a suitable container or add an additional component to fit tube racks.

BD MAP can be directly processed on high throughput hematology instruments. Markings on the reservoir indicate a blood specimen fll range of 250uL to 500μL. There is also a tube marking for specimen fil (375uL) when the tube is processed in automated mode.

While. BD MAP is adaptable to automated processing; the tube remains compatible with automated instruments when processed in the manual mode.

# Intended Use

BD Microtainer ® MAP Microtube for Automated Process with $k _ { 2 }$ EDTA is used to collect, anticoagulate, transport and store skin puncture blood specimens for measurement of the following hematology parameters:

White Blood Cells (WBC), Red Blood Cells (RBC), Hemoglobin (HgB), Hematocrit (HCT), Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), Platelets, 5-part White Blood Cell (WBC) differentials (Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils), Reticulocytes and Whole Blood Lead testing.

# Synopsis of Performance Study Results

Mechanical, simulated use and clinical testing were performed to demonstrate the device's safety and effectiveness.

Dear Ms. Wing:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class I (Special Controls), it may be subject to such. additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section ${ \pmb { 5 1 0 ( | { \bf k } ) } }$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
