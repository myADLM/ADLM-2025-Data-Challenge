4. Device Description

FORA G31a/ TD-4256A Blood glucose monitoring system and FORA G31b/ TD-4256B Blood Glucose Monitoring System consist of a meter and test strips. The system utilizes an electrochemical method-based meter and dry reagent biosensor (test strips) for blood glucose testing. The size of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample, providing a quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh whole blood and control solutions.

# 5. Intended Use

FORA G31a/TD-4256A Blood glucose monitoring system:

FORA G31a/TD-4256A is intended for in vitro use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the following alternative sites: the palm, the forearm, the upper-arm, the calf and the thigh. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates. The alternative testing sites in the FORA G31a/TD-4256A Blood Glucose Monitoring system can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

FORA G31 and TD-4256 Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the FORA G31a/TD425A gucose meterin the quantitativemeasurement  gucosein esh capillary whole blood from the inger and thealternative sites specified bove.

FORA Control Solutions/Taidoc Control Solutions are intended for use with the FORA G31a/TD-4256A Blood Glucose meter to check that both the glucose meter and test strips are working properly. These solutions contain a known range of glucose, as indicated on the bottles.

FORA G31b/TD-4256B Blood glucose monitoring system:

FORA G31b/TD-4256B is intended for in vitro use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the following alternative sites: te pal te r ter, h aanh hi. It s healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home as anaid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates. The alternative testing sites in the FORA G31a/TD-4256A Blood Glucose Monitoring system can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

FORA G31 and TD-4256 Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the FORA G31b/TD4256 glucose meter in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the alternative sites specified above.

FORA Control Solutions/Taidoc Control Solutions are intended for use with the FORA G31b/TD-4256B Blood Glucose meter to check that both the glucose meter and test ss  workig properly. The oluts contai ow ng  gu a indicated on the bottles.

# 6. Comparison to Predicate Device

FORA G31a/ TD-4256A Blood glucose monitoring system and FORA G31b/ TD-4256B Blood Glucose Monitoring System have equivalent technological characteristics as the FORA G30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K090187, Model TD-4241). FORA G31a/ TD-4256A Blood glucose monitoring system and FORA G31b/ TD-4256B Blood Glucose Monitoring System also have the same intended use as the FORA G30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Model TD-4241).

# 7. Performance Studies

The performance of FORA G31a/ TD-4256A Blood glucose monitoring system and FORA G31b/ TD-4256B Blood Glucose Monitoring System was studied in the laboratory. The studies demonstrated that the performance of this system meets its intended use.

# 8. Conclusion

FORA G31a/TD-4256A Blood glucose monitoring system and FORA G31b/ TD-4256B Blood Glucose Monitoring System demonstrate satisfactory performance and are suitable for its intended use.

Dear Mr. Pan:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of May 5, 2010.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. ·The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
