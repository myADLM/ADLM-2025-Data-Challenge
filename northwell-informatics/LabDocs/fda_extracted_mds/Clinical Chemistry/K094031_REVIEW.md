# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability and Value Assignment

A master calibration curve is generated on an Elecsys Modular Analytics E170 /cobas e 601analyzer by standardizing the Folate III assay against internal reference samples. The master calibration curve is used to calculate $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for the respective CalChecks. For each Elecsys Folate III CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, value assignment is performed as follows. Each CalCheck is tested in duplicate using at least three Elecsys Modular Analytics E170 /cobas e 601analyzers. The target value for each CalCheck is the median of the observed values.

The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

# Stability

Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. The current closed vial stability claim is 18 months at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The reconstituted vials are stable for four hours at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
