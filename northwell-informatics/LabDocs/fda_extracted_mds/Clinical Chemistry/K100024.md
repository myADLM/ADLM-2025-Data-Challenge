21 CFR $\ S 8 6 4 . 7 6 7 5$ Leukocyte Peroxidase Test

Class I: Urinary Leukocytes, Nitrite

# Product Code:

LJX Test, Urine Leukocyte JMT Nitrite (urinary, non-quantitative) test system

# Medical Specialty:

Clinical Chemistry

# Predicate Device:

Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis, K905396 Bayer Corporation, marketed by Bayer Corporation, located at Elkhart, IN 46515, USA

# Device Description:

Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips provides tests for the qualitative determination of leukocytes and nitrite in urine. The product is a firm plastic strip to which is affixed two separate dry reagent pad areas that is used for urinalysis. The reagent pad areas are bibulous material saturated with chemically active substances. All UTI Test Strips are carefully packaged along with a desiccant in a sealed, foil pouch.The color chart for reading the strips is on the outside of the foil pouch. A package insert is packaged along with the foil pouch into a box. The package insert contains all the necessary product information.

Results of each test are based on the color produced from the reaction of each reagent pad area once the Urine Reagent Strip comes into contact with a urine sample. Each parameter is color coded accordingly as described in the color chart. Results with Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips can be obtained in clinically meaningful units directly by comparison with the color chart. The color blocks represent nominal values; actual values will vary around the nominal values.

# Intended Use:

The Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips are intended for the qualitative detection of Nitrite and Leukocytes in urine as an aid in the screening of urinary tract infection (UTI). It is intended for over-the-counter home use only.

# Test Principles:

Nitrite: This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram-negative bacteria in the urine. The nitrite reacts with $p$ -arsanilic acid to from a diazonium compound in an acid medium. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo(h) quinolin to produce a pink color.

Leukocyte: This test is based on the action of esterase present in leukocytes, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative. The indoxyl ester liberated reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips for Leukocyte and Nitrite are substantially equivalent to the Bayer Multistix 10-SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis (K905396).

The devices differ in their intended users. UTI Test Strips are intended for lay users over the counter, whereas Multistix 10 SG is intended for professional use in point-of-care clinical sites. The possible errors associated with lay user testing were investigated in a clinical, comparison study where both lay users and professional users tested the strips on the same sample. The study demonstrated that the strips were able to be read correctly and easily among lay users.

The predicate device, Multistix 10 SG, also tests eight other analytes, including Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, pH value, Blood (Occult), Specific Gravity, Protein and Urobilinogen, intended in the assisting the diagnosis in the areas of kidney function, liver function and metabolic disorders. However, these analytes are not used to aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection and the safety and effectiveness of Teco Diagnostics' UTI Test Strips are not affected by the drop of these test analytes.

# Summary of Clinical Tests Performed:

The clinical studies were conducted at Point of Care sites and with lay persons using the Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips versus Multistix 10 SG. Clinical data were presented evaluating clinical accuracy of results. Clinical study results indicate that the inexperienced lay users were able to obtain comparable testing data compared to those obtained by the professionals when using the Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips and the legally marketed Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis (K905396).

# Summary of Laboratory Tests Performed:

The Laboratory studies were conducted in house and included sensitivity studies, reproducibility study, interference studies, stress study, and stability studies. The obtained laboratory data indicate that Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips run well and met all required performance characteristics.

# Conclusion:

The performance characteristics of the Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips were verified by sensitivity study, reproducibility study, interference studies, and temperature stress study. Testing results indicate that Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips can perform satisfactorily when used according to the "Test Procedure" directions on the package insert.

The laboratory testing results and clinical studies demonstrated a substantial equivalency on performance between the Teco Diagnostics UTI Test Strips and a legally marketed product, Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis (K905396), with similar product characteristics and intended use of aid in diagnosis in urinary tract infection.
