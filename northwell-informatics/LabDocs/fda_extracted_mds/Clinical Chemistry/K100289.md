2. Common Name: Carbon Dioxide-L3K Assay   
3. 510(k) Number: K042362   
4. Manufacturer: Genzyme Diagnostics P.E.I. Inc. (formerly Diagnostic Chemicals Limited)

# G. Intended Use:

The ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid (CO2_L) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of carbon dioxide in human serum and plasma on ADVIA Chemistry systems. Such measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous potentially serious disorders associated with changes in body acid-base balance.

# H. Device Description:

The ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide reagent is a solution containing buffer (pH 7.6 at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ), 12.5 mmol/L PEP, $\geq$ 400 U/L PEPC (microbial), ≥ 4100 U/L malate dehydrogenase (mammalian), 0.6 mmol/L NADH analog, activators, stabilizers, a surfactant, and a preservative.

# 1. Test Principle:

The ADVIA® Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid (CO2_L) Assay is based on enzymatic reactions. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) catalyzes the first reaction which generates oxaloacetate. In the presence of MDH, the NADH analog is oxidized by oxaloacetate to $N A D +$ analog. The oxidation of NADH analog is measured by the decreased absorbance at 410/478 nm, which is proportional to the amount of CO2 in the sample.

# K. Performance Characteristics

Substantial equivalence was demonstrated by testing several performance characteristics including imprecision, method comparison, interfering substances, serum/plasma equivalency, and analytical range. All of the evaluation studies gave acceptable results compared to the predicate device. These studies support that the ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid assay is substantially equivalent to the Genzyme Carbon Dioxide $\angle 3 \mathsf { K } \langle \widehat { \mathsf { R } } \rangle$ assay that is currently marketed.

# I. Imprecision

Within run and Total Precision were established by assaying two control sera.   
Each sample was assayed 2 times per run, 2 runs per day, for at least 10 days.   
Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;   
Approved Guideline.

# II. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linear/measuring range of the assay is ${ \bar { 1 } } 0 { \mathsf { - 4 0 } } { \mathsf { m m o l / L } } \left( { \mathsf { m E q / L } } \right)$ . The low end of the assay range is calculated based on the Limit of Detection. The high end of the assay range is based on the linearity calculation.

# 11. Limit of detection

The estimations of the Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were performed by running 40 replicates of $0 . 9 \%$ saline and 40 replicates of a Low Sample, using one lot of reagent. Data were obtained from a 10-day precision study. The LoD for the CO2 assays is <2mmol/L (mEq/L).

# IV. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of this method (y) on a ADVIA 1650 was compared with performance of Genzyme carbon dioxide $\angle 3 \mathsf { K } ( \widehat { \mathsf { R } } )$ method $( \mathsf { x } )$ on a Hitachi 717. Sixty-two (62) serum samples tested ranging from $1 2 . 8 \AA - 4 0 . 0 \mathsf { m m o l } / \downarrow$ (mEq/L) gave a correlation coefficient of 0.995. Linear regression analysis gave the following equation:

This method $= 1 . 0 7$ (predicate device) $+ 0 . 7 5$ mmol/L (mEq/L).

# V. Analytical specificity

Interferences from icterus, lipemia, and hemolysis were evaluated for this carbon dioxide method on an ADVIA 1650 analyzer using a significance criterion of $> 1 0 \%$ variance from the control. No significant lipemia interference was found at Intralipid levels from $0 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in a $2 2 . 2 m m o l / L ( m E q / L )$ carbon dioxide sample. No significant interference was found at unconjugated bilirubin levels from $0 { - } 2 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in a 21.7 mmol/L (mEq/L) carbon dioxide sample. Hemoglobin levels of $0 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were studied with acceptable results to a level of a 22.6 mmol/L (mEq/L) carbon dioxide sample. Bilirubin levels from $0 { \cdot } 2 5 \ \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L }$ in a 21.9 mmol/L (mEq/L) carbon dioxide sample was $1 0 . 3 \%$ .

# L. Conclusion:

The ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid (CO2_L) assay is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Genzyme (formerly Diagnostics Chemicals Limited) Carbon Dioxide $\angle 3 \mathsf { K } \odot$ Assay (k042362).
