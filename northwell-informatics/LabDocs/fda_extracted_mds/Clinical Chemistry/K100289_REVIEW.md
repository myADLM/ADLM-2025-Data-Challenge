# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI document EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline

# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid (CO2_L) Assay is based on enzymatic reactions. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) catalyzes the first reaction which generates oxaloacetate. In the presence of MDH, the NADH analog is oxidized by oxaloacetate to $\mathrm { N A D } ^ { + }$ analog. The oxidation of NADH analog is measured by the decreased absorbance at $4 1 0 / 4 7 8 \ \mathrm { n m }$ , which is proportional to the amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline. The sponsor performed a precision study that is modified from the recommendations in CLSI Guideline EP5-A2; ten (10) days of precision studies were performed.

Within run and total imprecision were evaluated by testing three control sera and one normal serum sample spiked with sodium bicarbonate. Each sample was assayed 2 times per run, 2 runs per day for 10 days, totaling 40 replicates per system. The study was run using one reagent lot on one ADVIA 1650 system.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A high pool was prepared using a human serum pool spiked with sodium bicarbonate. A low pool was prepared using normal saline with human serum albumin at $5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ . The high and low pools were used to prepare a series of nine (9) samples with evenly spaced concentrations of CO2 and testing was performed on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer. Linearity was evaluated by calculating a linear regression comparing observed recovery versus expected values using the 6 data points between $7 . 2 - 4 3 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . Expected values were derived from the line of best fit through all data. The deviation and percent difference from this line is then calculated for all 9 diluted samples prepared from high and low samples. The Deviation was calculated as the difference of the Expected Value and the Mean Observed Result of 2 replicates.

<table><tr><td>Dilution Level</td><td>Expected Value (mmol/L)</td><td>Mean Observed Result (mmol/L)</td><td>Deviation (mmol/L)</td><td>% Difference</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>7.3</td><td>7.6</td><td>0.3</td><td>4.4%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>14.5</td><td>14.8</td><td>0.2</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>21.8</td><td>21.8</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>29.0</td><td>28.8</td><td>-0.3</td><td>-1.0%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>36.3</td><td>35.9</td><td>-0.4</td><td>-1.2%</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>43.6</td><td>41.9</td><td>-1.7</td><td>-3.9%</td></tr></table>

Linear regression analysis of the 7 data points between 7.3 – 43.6 mmol/L:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 5 1 7 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 9 2 1 9
$$

$9 5 \%$ Confidence interval for slope $= 0 . 9 1 8 3$ to - 0.9851

$9 5 \%$ Confidence interval for intercept $= - 0 . 0 2 2 7$ to - 1.8664

$\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 7$

The claimed measuring range of the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assay is 10 to 40 mmol/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ADVIA CO2_L method is traceable to a commercially available method that is calibrated with NIST sodium carbonate, via patient sample correlation.

ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid assay is calibrated using ADVIA CO2 Calibrator/Diluent cleared previously under k033643.

# d. Detection limit:

The estimations of the Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were performed by running 40 replicates of $0 . 9 \%$ Saline (Blank) and 40 replicates of a low sample (Serum Control 1, which has a target concentration of 11.5 to $1 7 . 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ). One lot of reagent was used. Testing was conducted over a period of 10 days, 2 runs per day using one ADVIA 1650 analyzer and one reagent lot.

LoB was calculated to be $0 . 0 6 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and LoD was calculated to be 1.98 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

$1 0 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ was set conservatively as the Lower Limit of the assay range for ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid method.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Two serum pools containing known amounts of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ (approximately 24 mmol/L and $3 0 { - } 3 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ were spiked with hemolysate prepared with lysed fresh human erythrocytes (to evaluate hemoglobin), Intralipid, free bilirubin and conjugated ditaurobilirubin. Multiple levels of interfering substances (five equally diluted levels) were tested for each interferent. The levels for testing were prepared by diluting the pool with the highest concentration of interferent with the same pool without interferent (control). Five equallyspaced dilutions were tested for each interferent.

The method is considered to have no significant interference if the difference between control (no interferent) and observed carbon dioxide concentration at a certain level of interferent is less than $10 \%$ .

There was no interference seen with the assay at both levels of CO2 when testing hemoglobin $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , Intralipid $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , free bilirubin (25 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ) and conjugated ditaurobilirubin $( 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Interference $( 1 0 . 3 \% )$ was seen when testing a sample with $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ levels of $2 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ spiked with 25 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ of free (unconjugated) bilirubin. This interference is noted in the package insert.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed with a total of 62 serum samples. Some samples were spiked or diluted in order to cover the hard-to-find sample range. Testing was done using the candidate device on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer and the predicate device on the Hitachi 717 analyzer. Serum samples tested ranged from 12.8 to $4 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . Linear regression and Deming regression correlations were analyzed and the results of the study are summarized in the table below:

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

Serum and plasma equivalency studies were performed to characterize the correlation between serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. The results demonstrate good agreement between serum and plasma samples.

Paired sample tubes (serum and lithium heparin plasma) from the same donor were drawn from 59 volunteers. Serum or plasma was obtained by standard lab procedures. The samples were analyzed with the ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid method on one ADVIA 1650 analyzer using one lot of reagent. Samples were assayed in singleton. Results were analyzed using linear regression.
