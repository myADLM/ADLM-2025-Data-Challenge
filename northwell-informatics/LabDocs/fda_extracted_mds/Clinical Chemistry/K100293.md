. Classification: Class II

3. Product Code: JIT

Panel: Clinical Chemistry

# F. Predicate Device:

The ADVIA Centaur Calibrator 30 is substantially equivalent to the ADVIA Centaur Calibrator E which was cleared under K932715/K954697

# G. Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur® Calibrator 30 is a 2 level human plasma based solutions containing varying concentrations of Estradiol in charcoal stripped defibrinated human plasma, $0 . 1 \%$ Sodium azide and preservatives. The Estradiol calibrators have expected values of 35 and $2 5 0 0 \ p g / m L$ .

The Cal 30 (2.0 mL/vial) is lyophilized. Storage for lyophilized cal is at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } C$ until expiration date specified on label, reconstituted calibrator storage is at $2 - 8 ^ { 0 } C$ up to 14 days, and on board is up to 4 hours.

# Statement of Intended Use:

For in vitro diagnostic use in calibrating the following assays using the ADVIA Centaur® systems.

Dear Mr. Joseph:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
