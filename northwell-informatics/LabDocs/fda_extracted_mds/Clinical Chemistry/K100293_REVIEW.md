# I. Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Calibrator 30 is a 2 level human plasma based solutions containing varying concentrations of USP Estradiol, Testosterone, Cortisol and Progesterone spiked in charcoal stripped defibrinated human plasma, $0 . 1 \%$ Sodium azide and preservatives. All human source materials used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDA-approved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2, The Estradiol calibrators have expected values of 35 and $2 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . ADVIA Centaur Calibrator 30 (2.0 mL/vial) is lyophilized.

Traceability and Value Assignment

A set of internal Estradiol standards (primary calibrators), which are not traceable to an international standard, are value assigned using panel of IDGC/MS value assigned real serum samples. Each production lot of Estradiol calibrators (secondary calibrators) are value assigned against these internal standards. Primary calibrator values are then calculated from full curve data reduction for each system independently. The average dose recovered for each calibrator assigns their value. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of controls using the calibrator values. These controls must fall within set specifications. The internal standards are stored frozen and checked periodically against the panel of these serum samples to confirm stability.

Production lots of secondary estradiol calibrators are value assigned against primary standards using one reagent lot, one run on three different instruments. Estradiol calibrator values are derived using four-parameter weighted data algorithm reduction for each run on each instrument. Calibrator values are then averaged across all systems. Three levels of commercially available controls and three levels of human serum based Medical Decision Pools at 60, 450 and $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ are used to validate value assignment.

# Stability

Real time, accelerated, open vial and on board stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. The current closed vial stability claim is 16 months at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ ; however it will updated as additional real time stability data becomes available. The reconstituted vials are stable for fourteen days at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or for four hours at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
