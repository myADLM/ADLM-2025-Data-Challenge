# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO – 15197: In Vitro Diagnostic Test Systems-Requirements For Blood-Glucose Monitoring Systems For Self-Testing In Managing Diabetes Mellitus ISO – 14971: Medical Devices – Application Of Risk Management To Medical Devices • CLSI - Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry - EP07-A2

# L. Test Principle:

Glucose dehydrogenase assay and amperometric technology is used. The reaction utilizes the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are produced. Through the mechanism of the mediator, electrical current is generated and it is proportional to the quantity of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision includes intermediate precision (day-to-day precision) and repeatability (within-day precision) on three meters. For intermediate precision, three level glucose control solutions were used instead of blood specimen to prevent glucose degradation effect (glycolysis), and this evaluation was performed for ten days. Repeatability was performed at 5 levels with spiked venous blood samples as short a period of time (30 minutes) as possible to minimize the effect of glycolysis.

Repeatability

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Testing was conducted using venous blood spiked with D-glucose to provide 11 samples spaced across the range of $< 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to ${ > } 7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Testing was conducted using TD-4277 meter with TD-4277 test strips, and YSI-2300 glucose analyzer as the reference method.

Samples were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used to perform on the TD-4277 meter and the second aliquot was analyzed on the YSI. For each level solution, 5 consecutive tests were performed by TD-4277 and YSI each.

Regression analysis calculated in the range $1 6 . 8 – 6 6 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is: $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 2 6 8 \mathrm { x } - 6 . 8 8 5 2$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } 0 . 9 9 7 7$

The applicant is using this study to support the claimed measuring range of $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Control solutions are prepared to fall within each of three levels 35 – 65, 112-168 and 224 -336 and then check against YSI-2300. Acceptance Criteria is if the coefficient of variation $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ of each level of control solution is less than $5 \%$ in both measurement results by glucose meter, and YSI-2300, and the mean values of the measurement results by a glucose meter is within the specified range of values.

Control open/closed stability claimed is based on real time studies, based on the coefficient of variation $( \mathrm { C . V \ \% } )$ for each level of the control solution is less than $5 \%$ in measurement results by YSI-2300 and the mean values of the measurement results by a glucose meter is within the specified range of values.

The results demonstrated that the Control Solution (Level 1, 2, 3) are stable for 90 days after opening, and have a shelf-life of 24 months by meeting the acceptance criteria when stored at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ to $8 6 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { F } }$ $( 2 - 3 2 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C } )$ .

The strip storage claims are: 90 days for open vial of strips stored at $2 - 3 2 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } }$ and 24 months for unopened vials of strips stored at $2 \cdot 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the system is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study in section M.1.b above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Seven volunteer subjects were healthy and had not taken medications prior to blood donation. Blood was obtained from the forearm of fasting volunteers and collected in $5 { \mathrm { - m L } }$ lithium EDTA Vacutainers. The high glucose level $( 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ was achieved by adding $10 \%$ dextrose solution to the blood pool.

The below table is from an evaluation of the dose-response relationship where 5 endogenous and exogenous concentrations from therapeutic (physiological) to toxic were performed 4 times each at low ( $7 5 { - } 8 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and high $( 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) glucose levels. A criterion of $\pm 1 0 \%$ was used as the cutoff for interference.

The above table lists the drug concentrations at which interference with glucose measurements was greater than $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Most of the concentrations are higher than therapeutic or physiological levels.

There were no significant interferences observed for galactose, maltose and fructose, however, xylose showed a significant interference for concentrations above $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in both high and low glucose levels.

No interference was observed in the rest of the interfering substances at therapeutic or physiological levels either at low or high glucose levels.
