# I. Device Description:

The AP‐1000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of three main products: the meter, test strip, and control solutions. These products have been designed, tested, and proven to work together as a system accurate blood glucose test results. Use only AP‐1000 test strips and MAJOR control solution with the AP‐1000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

These products have been designed, tested, and proven to work together as a system accurate blood glucose test results. Use only AP‐1000multi test strips and MAJOR control solution with the AP‐1000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

Both systems (AP-1000 and AP-1000multi) utilize an electrochemical method‐based meter and dry reagent biosensor (test strips) for blood glucose testing. The size of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample, providing a quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh whole blood and control solutions. The control solutions and the test strips were previously cleared under k090389. The systems allow the palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh to be used as alternative testing sites.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 15197. In vitro diagnostic test systems. Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

# L. Test Principle:

The AP-1000/AP‐1000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use electrochemical methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

To demonstrate performance of the new device when testing alternative sites, the sponsor conducted a new user performance evaluation including the following testing sites: finger, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh. One set of performance data was evaluated since the AP-1000 and AP-1000multi systems use the same test strips and are identical with the exception of their names and indications for use (single- vs. multiple-patient use). Results were compared to a reference method (YSI-2300) and subjected to acceptance criteria described in the ISO 15197 standard.

User Performance Evaluation of Alternative Site Testing:

In the user performance study, 100 subjects measured their own blood glucose on the AP-1000 glucose monitoring system using samples from the finger and the following alternative testing sites: palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh. Healthcare professionals then tested these samples using the YSI-2300 reference method. The study was performed with five AP-1000 glucose monitoring systems throughout a glucose concentration range of 41.5 to $4 5 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The regression statistics and accuracy data are summarized in tables below.
