# E. Device to Which Substantial Equivalence is Claimed

Product Trade Name:

Document Ammonia/Ethanol CAL•VER® Microgenics Corporation, Fremont, Ca K944338

# F. Description of the Device

The Audit™M MicroCVTM Ammonia/Ethanol Linearity Set is a protein (bovine) based calibration verification material containing multiple levels used to confirm proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of the measured analyte. Level A has concentration near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit level of instruments. Levels B  D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

# G. Statement of Intended Use

The Audit MicroCV Ammonia/Ethanol Linearity Set is assayed quality control material consisting of five levels protein (bovine) based serum. Each level contains Ammonia and Ethanol analytes. The five levels demonstrate a linear relationship to each other for Ammonia and Ethanol analytes. It is intended to simulate human patient serum samples and to detect systematic analytical deviations of laboratory testing procedures for Ammonia and Ethanol. This product may be used as unassayed quality control material for Ammonia and Ethanol analytes. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays on the indicated analyzer provided in the labeling. The Audit MicroCV Ammonia/Ethanol Linearity Set is "For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only".

# I. Summary of Performance Data

Stability studies have been performed to determine stability and shelf life for the Audit ™M MicroCVTM Ammonia/Ethanol Linearity Set. All supporting data is retained on file at Aalto Scientific, Ltd. Product claims are as follows:

Open Vial Stability: Once a vial has been opened, all analytes will be stable for 2 days when stored stoppered at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ .

Shelf Life: 2 years, when stored unopened at $2 \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Note: Real time studies are ongoing to support the shelf life of this product.

Dear Ms. Lyakov:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). :
