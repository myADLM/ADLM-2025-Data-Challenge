3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For in vitro diagnostic use For prescription use

4. Special instrument requirements:

For use with Audit MicroCV Ammonia/Ethanol Linearity Set on the Hitachi 911 analyzer.

# I. Device Description:

The Audit MicroCV Ammonia/Ethanol Linearity Set is a protein (bovine) based, aqueous calibration verification material containing five levels (Levels A through E) of ammonia and ethanol. The set is used to confirm proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of the measured analytes. Level A contains ammonia and ethanol concentrations near the lower limit level and Level E contains ammonia and ethanol concentrations near the upper limit level of chemistry analyzers. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

NCCLS EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The Audit MicroCV Ammonia/Ethanol Linearity Set is prepared such that a linear relationship exists among all five levels (Levels A through E). Level A has concentration near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit level of instruments. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E using dilution schemes based on guidelines provided by NCCLS EP6-A.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The sponsor claims traceability of the ammonia and ethanol used in this linearity set to Pointe Scientific Ammonia Standard and Diagnostics Chemical Limited Ethanol Standard, respectively.

# Value Assignment

Expected values for ammonia and ethanol were determined by repeat analyses on the Hitachi 911 chemistry analyzer with one set of Pointe Scientific Ammonia Standard and one set of Diagnostics Chemical Limited Ethanol Standard. Both analytes are cleared for use on the Hitachi 911 chemistry analyzer (Ammonia (k864706) and Ethanol (k993920)). Ammonia and Ethanol were measured 10 times and the mean values were used to assign target ammonia and ethanol concentrations values for each of the five linearity set levels. Expected values may change depending on lot, instrumentation, methodology, and assay temperature. Lot-specific expected value ranges are provided in the package insert. Expected value ranges for each level of the linearity set are summarized in the table below.

# Stability

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Stability characteristics of the Audit MicroCV Ammonia/Ethanol Linearity Set were determined using an accelerated study to predict closed vial shelf life for each level of the linearity set. A closed vial shelf life of 2 years is expected at the recommended storage temperature (2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Real-time closed vial stability is ongoing. Real-time opened vial stability studies were also performed. Open vial stability of 2 days was demonstrated at the recommended storage temperature of 2 to $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . Storage recommendations are provided in the labeling with additional warnings to prevent prolonged storage at room temperature and to not freeze linearity solutions.
