# 7.0 Statement of Supporting Data

Stability studies have been performed to determine the open vial stability and shelf life for the Liquid Assayed Multiqual. Product claims are as follows:

.7.1 Open vial 7.2 Thawed and Unopened:

5 days at 2 to $8 \circ _ { \mathsf { C } }$

30 days at 2 to $8 \%$ ,with the following exceptions: Direct Bilirubin 11 days, Triglycerides, HDL, Cholinesterase, Phosphorus 7 days. Total Bilirubin and Direct Bilirubin values may decrease, Alkaline Phosphatase activity may rise.

# 7.3 Shelf Life Stability

3 Years at $\boldsymbol { \cdot } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $\boldsymbol { \cdot } 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$

7.4 Assignment of Values

The assigned values were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for each lot of product. The tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of the product lot. Assigned values are presented as means and $\pm 3 \mathsf { S D }$ ranges.

# 8.0 Conclusion

Liquid Assayed Multiqual (new device) is intended to be used for the same purposes as the predicate device, it has the same human serum matrix and performs similarly as the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Parsons

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may Dublish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket   
notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
