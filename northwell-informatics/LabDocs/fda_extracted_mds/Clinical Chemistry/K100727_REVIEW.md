# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Liquid Assayed Multiqual is prepared from human serum to which purified biochemical material (tissue extracts of human and animal origin), chemicals, drugs, preservatives, and stabilizers have been added.

Expected Values and Value Ranges

Expected values for the Liquid Assayed Multiqual are determined by duplicate analyses of levels 1 to 3 using Siemens Dimension Vista analyzers by the analyzer manufacturer. Pre-determined acceptance criteria for analyte recovery must be met for each control lot. The target value for each CalCheck is the mean of the observed values. Assigned values and value ranges are lot dependent and are listed in the lot-specific value sheet. Test results should fall within the corresponding $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ range printed on the lot-specific value sheet. The labeling states that laboratories should establish their own means and acceptable ranges.

# Stability

Stability testing data support the manufacturer claims that the Liquid Assayed Multiqual is stable until the expiration date printed on the vial when stored unopened at $- 2 0$ to $- 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Accelerated stability testing supports the target shelf life claim of three years. The manufacturer has an on-going real-time stability study design to support the recommended storage conditions for the life of the product. The unopened-thawed vials are stable for thirty days at 2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the following exceptions: Direct Bilirubin-11 days; Triglycerides, HDL, Cholinesterase, Phosphorus-7 days. The following statement has been added to the label: Total Bilirubin and Direct Bilirubin values may decrease; Alkaline Phosphatase activity may rise under these storage conditions. The opened vials (on-board) are stable for five days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
