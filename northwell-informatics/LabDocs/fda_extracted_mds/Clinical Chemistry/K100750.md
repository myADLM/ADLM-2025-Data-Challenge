# E. Device to Which Substantial Equivalence is Claimed

Audit™M MicroCVTM Gcncral Chemistry Lincarity Sct Aalto Scientific, Ltd., Carlsbad, CA K042318

# F. Description of the Device

The Audit™M MicroCVTM ASO Linearity Set is a human based, liquid, five level set of QC material, with each level containing one analyte: Anti-streptolysin O (ASO). It is used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of ASO. Level A has concentration near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit level of instruments. Levels $\mathrm { \mathbf { B } } - \mathrm { \mathbf { D } }$ are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

# G. Statement of Intended Use

The AuditTM MicroCV™M ASO Linearity Set is assayed quality control material   
consisting of five levels human based serum. Each level contains Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) analyte. The five levels demonstrate a linear relationship to each other for Antistreptolysin O (ASO) analyte. It is intended to simulate human patient serum samples for purpose of monitoring the precision and to detect systematic analytical deviations of laboratory testing procedures for Anti-streptolysin O (ASO). This product may be used as an unassayed quality control material for   
Anti-strcptolysin O (ASO) analyte.

# I. Summary of Performance Data

Stability studies have been performed to determine the shelf life for the AuditTM MicroCVTm ASO Linearity Set. All supporting data is retained on file at Aalto Scientific, Ltd. Product claims are as follows:

Open Vial Stability: Once a vial has been reconstituted, all analytes will be stable for 24 hours when stored tightly capped at $2 { \cdot } 8 \ \mathrm { C }$ .

Shelf Life: Two years at $2 \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Note: Real time studies are ongoing to support the shelf life of this product.

Dear Ms. Lyakov:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section
