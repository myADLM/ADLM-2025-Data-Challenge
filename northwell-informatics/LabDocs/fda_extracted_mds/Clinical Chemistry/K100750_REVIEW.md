# I. Device Description:

The Audit™ MicroCV™ ASO Linearity Set is a human based, liquid, five level set of QC material, with each level containing one analyte: Anti-streptolysin O (ASO). It is used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of ASO. Level A has concentration near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit level of instruments. Levels B – D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not Applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

Laboratories use a stable reference material to verify the accuracy and precision of testing methods and techniques. Audi $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MicroCV™ ASO Linearity Set may be used as one would use human serum to verify and validate the test method analytical measurement range.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Value assignment for each level was based on ten results. Target values were calculated from mean values of the ten results for each level. Assigned target values were graphed and a linear regression value was obtained to determine linearity of the five levels. The ASO five level set demonstrates a linear relationship for their respective analyte levels.

Value Assignment was performed on one instrument by one set of reagent for ASO analyte. ASO was measured 10 times (5 separate vials in duplicate) and the mean value of ASO was used to establish target concentration values at each level. The target ranges were calculated a $\leq 2 0 \%$ of the mean target value. The mean concentration values of each level were plotted (concentration value vs. assigned level) and a linear regression values were obtained. The five-point linear regression $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ value is greater than 0.95 and the product demonstrates linearity.

Representative data from the ASO Linearity set is shown below for five lots:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: Values assigned to the AuditTM Micro $\operatorname { C V } ^ { \mathrm { { T M } } }$ ASO Linearity Set can be traced to ASO Reagent – 447620 and ASO Calibrator– 469975, Cal 5 obtained from Beckman and ASO Control– 472599 from Vigil Serology.

The base matrix for building the Low and High Pools is human serum. For the Low Pool (Level A), ASO is adjusted to be within $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the lowest limit of measurability for the ASO assay. For the High Pool (Level E), ASO is adjusted to be within $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the highest limit of measurability for the ASO assay.

An accelerated “Heat Stress Stability Prediction” stability study was conducted to predict shelf life. Five vials of each level were stressed at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 20 days to predict two-year stability when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Two pilot lots, Pilot 1, Lot 100153-100157 and Pilot 2, Lot 100158-100162, were produced and tested. For both pilots, ASO in the stress stability study results were within $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the Day Zero value. This gives the ASO Linearity Control two-year shelf life stability.

Accelerated stability studies are supported by an on-going real-time stability studies.

Open vial stability was also performed to determine the viability of the product during the course of normal use. Five vials of each level (A through E) were opened and exposed to the environment for 30 minutes then closed and repeated for a total of 3 cycles. Vials are then closed and stored for 24 hours at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested following the same manner as the above stated destructive testing. The percent loss determined in comparison to Day Zero values was $< 1 5 \%$ and the product is considered stable.
