# 8. Performance Characteristics:

# Precision study:

Repeatability and Device/Method Precision is evaluated according to "NCCLS Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline - Second Edition, EP5-A2, Vol. 24, No. $2 5 "$ .

Performance Claims for Precision Performance, Repeatability $( \mathsf { S } _ { 0 } )$ and Total Precision $( \mathsf { S } _ { \mathsf { X } } )$

The test verifies that the use of this new pleural fluid measuring mode produces pH results with acceptable precision.

# Method Comparison:

Method comparison study has been conducted according to NCCLS guideline APg-A2 "Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples".

The slope of the linear fit to the data is 1.056 for the ABL837, and the intersection with the Yaxis is at -0.393. The linear fit intersects the identity line ${ \sf X } = { \sf Y }$ (and thus the Roche data) at pH 7.016. Furthermore, the graph clearly shows coherence between the ABL837 data and the Roche data in the sense that the $\mathsf { X } { = } \mathsf { Y }$ line, representing the Roche data, lies within the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the linear regression, in the entire pathological range from pH 7.0 to 7.5 and the difference in slope of $5 . 6 \%$ is well within the $10 \%$ acceptance.

At the critical decision interval for pleural fluid treatment, namely around pH 7.3, the ABL837 device measures 0.0159 above the Roche analyzer. This bias is considered acceptable, taking into account the nature of the sample material, and the fact that the clinical decision point is not defined more accurately than is the case. This means that the difference of 0.0159 pH could be contained in the rounding of the data. Finally, the placement of the critical decision point varies regionally; at some hospitals $p 1 7 . 2$ is considered the critical decision point.

Summarizing our findings, we find that the results of this test clearly demonstrate that the ABL837 analyzer correctly measures pH in pleural fluid, since the measurements show a good agreement with those of the predicate device.

# Linearity:

The data to proof the linear fit of the method has been taken from the method comparison study.

The data points from the 58 samples lie sufficiently distributed in the pathological range, and form a straight line, when plotting the ABL837 pH values against the Roche pH values. An $R ^ { 2 }$ EPY value of 0.993 is found when doing a linear regression on the data, plotting randomly selected single ABL837 measurements against the Roche average of two measurements.

Summarizing our findings, we find that the results of this test clearly demonstrate that the ABL837 analyzer correctly measures pH in pleural fluid, since the measurements show a good agreement with those of the predicate device.

# ABL837 FLEX analyzer with pleural pH

# Conclusion:

Taken the results from the performance studies and the comparison of the new device with the predicate devices into consideration, we believe that the ABL837 with pleural pH is as safe and effective as the predicate devices.

# Calibration and Quality Control

Since the measuring technology for pH in pleural fluid is the same as in blood no new calibration or quality controls have been introduced for the new indication.

# Technology

he technology has not been altered for the new indication of measuring pH in pleural fluids.

Potentiometric Method

The potential of an electrode chain is recorded using a voltmeter, and related to the concentration of the sample (the Nernst equation).

The electrode chain consisting of a sample, electrode, reference electrode, voltmeter, nembranes and electrolyte solutions.

The reference electrode maintains a stable, fixed potential against which other potential differences can be measured. The potential is not altered by sample composition.

The pH electrode (E777) is a pH-sensitive glass electrode. The pH-sensitive glass membrane is located at the tip and seals the inner buffer solution with a constant and known pH

# Modes of Operation

The instrument is an automated, random access, stat instrument. The specimens are withdrawn from a sampling device and drawn into the closed fluid transport system within the instrument for analysis.

# ABL837 FLEX analyzer with pleural pH

The FLExQ allows the capability of automatic sampling from up to three blood samplers. Automatic measurements are accomplished via bar coding on the patient samples. The required tests for the identified sample are retrieved from a networked server. If required, manual introduction of a blood sample may be performed as well.
