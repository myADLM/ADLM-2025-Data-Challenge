# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use: The ABL837 FLEX analyzer is intended for in vitro testing of pleural fluid samples for the pH parameter.

The pH measurement of pleural fluid can be a clinically useful tool in the management of patients with parapneumonic effusions. Critical values: $\mathrm { p H } > 7 . 3$ is measured in uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions. All pleural effusions with a

$\mathsf { p H }$ of $< 7 . 3$ are referred as complicated parapneumonic effusions; they are exudative in nature.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

This device is intended for prescription use only. If the measured values obtained for pleural fluid $\mathrm { p H }$ lie outside the test range $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 0$ to 7.5), Radiometer advises users to repeat the measurement by means of another method.

4. Special instrument requirements: Performance data was provided for ABL837 FLEX analyzer.

# I. Device Description:

The ABL837 FLEX analyzer is a member of the ABL800 FLEX blood gas analyzer family for the whole blood measurement of pH (whole blood and pleural fluid), $\mathsf { p O } _ { 2 }$ , $\mathsf { p C O } _ { 2 }$ , chloride, calcium, potassium, sodium, glucose, lactate, creatinine, total bilirubin, and co-oximetry parameters (total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and the hemoglobin fractions $\mathrm { F O } _ { 2 } \mathrm { H b }$ , FCOHb, FMetHb, FHHb, FHbF) and expired air for the parameters ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathsf { p C O } _ { 2 }$ . The ABL837 FLEX analyzer is comprised of a blood gas analyzer, a computer and software (KIRA v6.09).

# L. Test Principle:

The pH in Pleural fluid is measured by potentiometry. The potential of an electrode chain is recorded using a voltmeter, and related to the concentration of the sample, as described by the Nernst equation. An electrode chain describes an electrical circuit consisting of a sample, electrode, reference electrode, voltmeter, membranes and electrolyte solutions. The reference electrode maintains a stable, fixed potential against which other potential differences can be measured. The potential is not altered by sample composition.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The evaluation of precision for the pleural fluid on the ABL837 FLEX analyzer was conducted using pooled human pleural fluid samples adjusted to three different pH levels (7.1, 7.3 and 7.5). The pH adjusted pleural fluid samples were frozen and thawed prior to testing. Each pH adjusted pleural fluid sample was analyzed on three ABL837 FLEX analyzers, 2 runs per day, and 2 aliquots per run for 20 days. The precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP5-A2.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity data for pleural fluid collected in the comparison study (see Section M2a below) was used to demonstrate linearity on the ABL837 FLEX analyzer. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 5 6 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 3 9 3$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 3$ .

The measuring range for pleural fluid samples is $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 0$ to 7.5.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The traceability, stability and expected value of pH calibration solutions (Calibration Solution 1 and 2) and pH control solution kit (AutoCheck $^ { 6 + }$ ) was previously cleared under k041874. The traceability, stability and expected value of the pH control solution kit (Range $^ +$ Qualicheck) were previously cleared under k980135.

d. Detection limit:

Detection limit for pleural fluid pH was established in the method comparison study M. 2 a. below and for whole blood pH in the previously cleared submission (k041874).

The measuring range for pleural fluid samples is $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 0$ to 7.5.

e. Analytical specificity: Analytical specificity was established in the previously cleared submission (k041874).

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A correlation study was performed between the proposed device (ABL837 analyzer) and the predicate device (Roche Omni C which is currently   
marketed as Roche Cobas b221) according to CLSI protocol EP9-A2. This study was performed using 58 pleural fluid samples, pH ranged from 6.93 to 7.57, obtained from 29 patients. Some of the samples were spiked with either NaOH or acetic acid to adjust the $\mathrm { p H }$ , so that the samples were evenly distributed in the $\mathsf { p H }$ range 7.0 to 7.5. All pleural fluid samples were frozen and thawed prior to testing. Eight samples were tested per day on two analyzers per day over a span of eight days. A single measurement obtained on an ABL837 analyzer was compared to a single measurement obtained on the predicate device. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:   
$\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 5 6 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 3 9 3 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 3 .$

A bias plot of individual data points showed that all values were within $\pm 0 . 1$ $\mathsf { p H }$ unit of the predicate device. At medical decision points of $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 2$ and 7.3, the bias was 0.010 and 0.0159, respectively.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

All pleural effusions with a $\mathrm { p H } < 7 . 3$ are referred as complicated parapneumonic effusions; they are exudative in nature $\bf { \underline { { f } } , t }$ .
