# E. Regulatory Information:

LOCI THYR Calibrator:

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1150 Calibrator   
Classification: Class II   
Product Code: JIX -Calibrator, Secondary   
4. Panel: Immunology

# F. Predicate Device:

The predicate device used to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the LOCl Thyroid Calibrator is the current LOCI Thyroid Calibrator cleared under k073604.

# G. Device Description:

The LOCI THYR CAL is a multi-analyte, liquid, bovine serum albumin based product containing triiodothyronine, thyroxine and human thyroid stimulating hormone. The kit consists of ten vials with two vials per level containing $2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ per vial.

# H. Intended Use:

The LOCI THYR CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the LOCI Free Triiodothyronine (FT3), LOCI Free Thyroxine (FT4L) and LOCI Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSHL) methods on the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EXLTM integrated chemistry system with LOCl $\otimes$ Module.

# I. Substantial Equivalence Information:

The LOCl Thyroid Calibrator and the current Thyroid Calibrator as the predicate were compared. The following table provides a comparison of the important similarities and differences:

Dear Ms. Marinelli:

We have reviewed your Section $5 \dot { 1 } 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concérning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
