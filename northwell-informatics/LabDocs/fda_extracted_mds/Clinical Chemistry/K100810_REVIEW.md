Traceability and Value Assignment

A master calibration curve is generated on an Elecsys Modular Analytics E170 /cobas e 601analyzer using nine target values from the World Health Organization reference reagent, 1st IRR, code 84/510 (NIBSC) standard. The master calibration curve is used to calculate $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ for the respective CalChecks.

For each Elecsys C-peptide CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, value assignment is performed as follows. Each CalCheck is tested in duplicate using at least three Elecsys Modular Analytics E170 /cobas e 601analyzers. Additionally, each CalCheck is assayed once on eight Elecsys 2010/ cobas e 411analyzers. The target value for each CalCheck is the median of the observed values. The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

# Stability

Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. The current closed vial stability claim is 15 months at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . The reconstituted vials are stable for four hours at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
