Traceability and Value Assignment

The Elecsys Insulin assay is standardized against the WHO Reference Reagent, 1st IRP, code 66/304 (NIBSC).

For each Insulin CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks were assayed in duplicate on the Elecsys MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, Elecsys 2010, cobas e 601, and cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzers. The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers) of the respective CalCheck.

Stability studies

Open-Vial Stability:

The on-test material was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (in an open vial).

The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The ontest and reference materials were tested in duplicate. On-test recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference. The protocol, data and acceptance criteria were found to be adequate.

The data supported the package insert claims that reconstituted Insulin CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Accelerated Stability:

The on-test material was stored lyophilized (as supplied to the user) at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 3 weeks. The reference material was freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks (stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials are tested in duplicate. The on-test recovery is calculated as a percent of the reference. The protocol, data and acceptance criteria were found to be adequate.

One Elecsys Insulin CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys 2010.

Real-Time Stability:

In addition to open-vial and accelerated stability, real-time stability was evaluated. In the on-going real-time stability study, the Elecsys Insulin CalCheck 5 test material is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The CalChecks were tested at $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ and at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device up to the planned shelf life plus one month.

The shelf life claim is 18 months. This is based on the accelerated stability results.
