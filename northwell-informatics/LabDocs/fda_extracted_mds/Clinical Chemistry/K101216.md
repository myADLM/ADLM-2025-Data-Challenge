# E. Device to Which Substantial Equivalence is Claimed

Audit™M MicroCVTM General Chemistry Linearity Set Aalto Scientific, Ltd., Carlsbad, CA K042318

# F. Description of the Device

The Audit™ MicroCV™ Protein Linearity Set is a human based, five level set of QC material, with each level containing seven analytes: Aipha-1-Antitrypsin, Complement C3, Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M, and Transferrin. It is used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of the analytes listed. Level A is near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit of instruments. Levels B - D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

# G. Statement of Intended Use

The Audit™M MicroCVTM Protein Linearity is assayed quality control material consisting of five levels protein (human) based serum. Each level contains Alpha-1-Antitrypsin, Complement C3, Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M and Transferrin analytes. The iv eve demnstrate linearelationship  each otheror Alpha--Antpsn, Complement C3, Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M, and Transferrin analytes. It is intended to simulate human patient serum samples and to detect systematic analytical deviations of laboratory testing procedures for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin, Complement C3, Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M, and Transferrin. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays on the indicated analyzer provided in the labeling. The Audit MicroCV Protein Linearity Set is "For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only."

# I. Summary of Performance Data

Stability studies have been performed to determine the open vial stability and shelf life for the Audit™ MicroCV™ Protein Linearity Set.All supporting data is retained on file at Aalto Scientific, Ltd. Product claims are as follows:

Open Vial Stability:Once a vial has been opened, all analytes will be stable for 1 day when stored tightly capped at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathbb { C }$ .

Shelf Life: One year, when stored unopened at $2 \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Note: Real time studies are ongoing to support the shelf life of this product.

Dear Ms. Lyakov:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
