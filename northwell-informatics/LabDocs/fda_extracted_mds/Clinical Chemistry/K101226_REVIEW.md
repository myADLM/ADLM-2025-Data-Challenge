This product may also be used as unassayed quality control material for Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) analytes. When used for quality control purposes, it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use the values provided only as guides. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays on manual, automatic, and semi-automatic analyzers. The Audit™ MicroCV™ RF/CRP Linearity Set is “For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only”.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

I. Device Description:

The 5 level quality control solution set contains C-reactive protein and Rheumatoid Factor as the measurands. Level A is near the lower limit and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit of instruments. Levels $\mathrm { B } - \mathrm { D }$ are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E. The set includes ${ 5 } \mathrm { x } 1 \ \mathrm { m L }$ ready to use vials, one each of levels A, B, C, D and E.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: RF is obtained from RF Positive Plasma and is traceable to WHO (World Health Organization) Human, International Reference Preparation 1970. CRP is obtained from recombinant human C-reactive protein and is traceable to reference material CRM 470.

Open Vial Stability:   
5 vials of each level were left open for 30 minutes, then closed and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . This cycle is repeated 5 times (one cycle each day). Vials are tested at the end of the 5 days. The results showed $0 . 0 \% - 1 5 \%$ difference from the day zero results. The claimed open vial stability is 5 days when stored tightly capped at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .   
Shelf Life Stability:   
An “accelerated” stability study was used to predict shelf life. Five vials of

each level were stressed at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 20 days. The percent loss is determined in comparison to Day Zero values. The results showed $0 . 0 \% - 1 2 . 0 6 \%$ difference from the day zero results. The shelf life is based on the accelerated stability studies and on the on-going real-time stability studies. The claimed shelf life is 19 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Value assignment:

The reference materials that were used for value assignment are the calibration and control sets provided by the manufacturers of the reagents – Beckman for RF and Pointe Scientific for CRP. Hitachi 911 and Array analyzers were used for CRP and RF respectively. The analyzers were calibrated and the control was used with the value assignment run. Value assignment for each level was based on 10 results for each level. Target values were calculated. Expected vs. observed values were graphed and a linear regression value was obtained to determine the linearity of the five levels. The linear range is defined by the highest and lowest measured concentrations where the response is linear. The dilution scheme is as follows:

Level $\mathbf { A } = 1 0 0 \%$ Low Pool (no analyte) Level $B = 7 5 \%$ Low Pool, $2 5 \%$ High Pool Level $C = 5 0 \%$ Low Pool, $50 \%$ High Pool Level $D = 2 5 \%$ Low Pool, $7 5 \%$ High Pool Level $\mathrm { E } = 1 0 0 \%$ High Pool
