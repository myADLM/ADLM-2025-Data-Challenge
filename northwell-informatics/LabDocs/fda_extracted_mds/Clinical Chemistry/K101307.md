# 6.0 Device description

AG-6081 and AG-6951 Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) consist of blood glucose meter, single use test strips, sterile lancets, lancing device and the control solutions.

While AG-6081 and AG-6951 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) consist of blood glucose meter, MULTI use test strips, Auto-disabling Lancing device and the control solutions.

The four blood Glucose Monitoring system AG-6081 Single, AG-6951 Single, AG-6081 MULTI and AG-6951 MULTI are all based on an electrochemical biosensor technology (electrochemical) and the principle of capillary action. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in 5 seconds. The control solution available is used to test the performance of the device. All of them use the same technological characteristics for testing with their predicate device. Only the appearance is different from their predicate device, and the new devices can test the blood glucose at the alternative site: the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf and the thigh.

More over, AG-6951 Single and AG-6951 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems have a voice function, which is also different from their predicate device.

# 8.0 Performance summary

AG-6081 Single BGMS, AG-6081 MULTI BGMS, AG-6951 Single BGMS and AG-6951 MULTI BGMS conform to the following standards:

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems- Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.   
FDA Draft Guidance Document-Total Product Life Cycle for Portable Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems: October 24, 2006   
CLSI/NCCLS Guideline, EP07-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline-Second edition

# 9.0 Comparison to the predict device and the conclusion

The four blood glucose monitor AG-6081 Single, AG-6081 MULTI, AG-6951 Single and AG-6951 MULTI are very similar with the predicate device AG-606. Their appearance is different from AG-606, they use the different test strips, and the intended use of AG-6081 MULTI and AG-6951 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are also different from their predicate device AG-606. Besides, the four new devices can test the blood glucose at the alternative site other than the finger, and they have the USB function as well. More over, AG-6951 Single and AG-6951 MULTI BGMS have a new voice function.

However, the test in this submission provides demonstration that these small differences do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness.

Dear Yi Liu:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to markel the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, markel the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices. good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statules and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Device Name: AG-6951 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indication For Use:

The AG-6951 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh. The AG-6951 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is intended for multiple-patient use in professional healthcare settings as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of a diabetes control program.

The AG-6951 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, nor for neonatal use. Alternative site testing such as the palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).
