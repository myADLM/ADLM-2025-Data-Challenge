# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems-Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The AG-6081 Single and AG-6081 MULTI are the same meters and the AG-6095 Single and AG-6095 MULTI are the same meters. All four meters use the same test strip; however they have different names due to their different indications for use.

# AG-6081 and AG-6951 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

The sponsor claims that the system accuracy of the AG-6081 and AG-6951 meters is calibrated to a laboratory analyzer, YSI 2300. A method comparison was performed using the YSI 2300 as the comparative method. See comparison studies in 2a below.

Three levels of control material, Level I $\mathrm { ( 6 0 - 9 0 ~ m g / d L ) }$ , Level II $( 9 9 - 1 4 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and Level III $( 2 5 3 - 3 7 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ are available for use with the AG-6081 BGMS. Three levels of control material, Level I $5 8 - 8 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , level II $( 9 8 - 1 4 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and Level III (262-394) are available for use with the AG-6951 BGMS. These control solutions are purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k012430). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: The shelf-life of the AG1100 control is 24 months when stored between $3 6 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and kept away from direct sunlight and heat. Stability is 90 days when opened and stored at $3 6 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

Value assignment was performed by testing each level of control solution 100 times using 10 meters (5- AG-6081 and 5 -AG-6951 meters).

# c. Detection limit:

# AG-6081 and AG-6951 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

The measuring range of the system is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study above (section M.1.b)

# d. Analytical specificity:

# AG-6081 and AG-6951 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Whole blood samples were spiked to nominal glucose concentrations of 80, 120 and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each spiked sample was then divided into a test pool and a control pool. Each potential interfering substance was added to the test pool. Each level was analyzed for a total of 5 times with two AG-6081 meters and a total of five times using two AG-6951 meters. Three lots of AG-1100 test strips were used. The difference between the control sample and the sample containing the interfering substance were calculated.

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling: “Metabolites: Ascorbic Acid and bilirubin at normal blood concentration does not significantly affect glucose readings. High concentrations of acetaminophen, dopamine, L-dopa, methyldopa, tolbutamide and uric acid may cause inaccurate test results. Blood glucose readings should be interpreted with caution. Lipemic Effects: Elevated blood triglycerides up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ do not significantly affect the results.”

# AG-6081 Single and AG-6081 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System

The sponsor performed accuracy studies to demonstrate that the AG-6081 meter is equivalent to the YSI 2300 reference method. Capillary samples from 100 volunteers with glucose concentrations distributed over the range of $2 5 . 5 - 5 2 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were evaluated at two different hospitals $\mathrm { ( n { = } l 0 0 }$ ). Each blood sample from the volunteers was divided into two, one was tested by YSI-2300 and the other was tested by the AG-6081 blood glucose monitoring system. Percent distribution of the samples corresponding to the glucose concentration ranged as follows: $< 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } { - 9 \% }$ ; 51-80 mg/dL- $14 \%$ ; $\mathrm { 8 1 - 2 0 \ m g / d L - 1 }$ $1 8 \%$ ; 12 $\mathrm { - 2 0 0 m g / d L - 2 6 \% }$ ; $2 0 1 { - } 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } - 1 6 . 5 \%$ ; $3 0 1 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } - 8 . 5 \%$ ; and $> 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } - 8 \%$ .

# Speaking function of the AG-6951 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

A study was conducted to evaluate the use of the speaking function on the AG-6951 Blood Glucose monitoring system by visually impaired users. The study consisted of 100 lay users ( $51 \%$ moderately visually impaired, $3 7 \%$ severely visually impaired, and $12 \%$ profound visual impairment) and a health care professional at one hospital. The users collected their blood sample following the instructions given by the speaker function of the meter. A sample was then taken from each participant by the health care professional and measured by YSI-2300. The samples ranged from 54- 324 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Labeling states that this system contains a speaking function that provides audible test results for users with impaired vision and the audible function does not provide complete instructions for all functions of the meter or for performing a glucose test.

# N. Instrument Name:

AG-6081 Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System

AG-6951 Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System

AG-6081 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System

AG-6951 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaces with a new strip for additional readings.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes _ __X___ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No _X

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X_____ or No _

The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and developed under good software life-cycle processes.

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and thigh. The whole blood is applied directly to the test strip so therefore no special handling or storage is needed.

5. Calibration:

One code function (No Code). The AGS-1100 test strips contain the calibration code.   
There is no coding by the user.

6. Quality Control:

One level of glucose control solution (Level ll), is provided within the kit from the sponsor. An additional two levels Level l and Level lll are available for purchase separately, as stated in the labeling. The labeling provides instructions on when to test control materials. To perform a control test on the AG-6081 and the AG-6951 meters, the user is instructed to press the M button in step 2. Once the “CTL” appears on the screen the control results will be prevented from being stored in memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to customer support for problems and more information.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Altitude Studies: Capillary whole blood samples from 20 volunteers with glucose concentrations, according to YSI, ranging from $6 1 { - } 4 0 6 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on the AG-6081 meter and $6 0 { - } 3 3 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on the AG-6951 meter. Results were compared to YSI values and resulted in no significant bias $( \leq 1 0 \% )$ for all samples tested. The data submitted support use of the devices up to 10,744 feet.

2. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using the AG-6081 and the AG-6951 meters with venous whole blood samples at 5 glucose levels (44, 74, 169, 278 and $5 2 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Results demonstrated that both systems (meters and test strips) can be used in conditions of $5 0 ^ { \circ } { - } 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 1 0 – 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity $2 5 \mathrm { - } 8 0 \%$ and stored under conditions of $3 9 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and relative humidity of $- 8 0 \%$ . No significant effect $( \leq 1 0 \%$ relative to YSI) was observed at the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The following combinations were tested: low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 50 to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ ( $1 0 { - } 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of $2 5 \mathrm { - } 8 0 \%$ .

3. Sample volume studies were performed using venous blood samples 48, 55, 114,143, 226, 377, and $4 5 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and of each meter (AG-6081 and AG-6951). Three volumes were tested (0.5, 0.6, and $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). The recommended minimum sample volume is $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . Seven glucose concentrations were tested ranging from approximately $4 8 { - } 4 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , as determined by the YSI. Results support the claimed sample volume of $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

4. Infection Control Studies: The devices are intended for single-patient us (AG-6081 and AG-6951 Single) or multiple-patient use (AG-6081 Multi and AG-6951 Multi). Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters and lancing device by outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration #46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials for each of the meters and lancing device after 11,000 cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps with the CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to stimulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

5. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained SMOG Grade Level scores of 8 for the User’s Manual, test strip insert and control solution insert.

6. Hematocrit Study - The effect of hematocrit levels of $20 – 6 5 \%$ was tested on whole blood samples spiked with nine hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 60, and $6 5 \%$ ) at glucose concentrations distributed within the measuring range $( 2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ of the device. The values generated were compared with the glucose values from YSI-2300 analyzer. The results generated by the device are comparable to the values of YSI-2300 analyzer at hematocrit levels between $20 \%$ . The candidate devices did not show any significant bias $( \leq \pm 1 5 \% )$ versus the reference method within the measuring range of 20- $60 \%$ . The sponsor will claim a hematocrit range of $20 \%$ .

7. The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and the AG-6081 and AG-6951 were found compliant (IEC 61326, IEC 61010)
