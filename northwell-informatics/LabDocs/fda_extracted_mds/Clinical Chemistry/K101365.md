# Device Name

# Predicate device

The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. We claim equivalency to the currently marketed Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck 5 (K100810) and CA 19- 9 CalCheck (K051185).

# Device Description

The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of human CA 19-9 in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Intended use

The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration verification and for use in the verification of the assay range established by the Elecsys CA 19-9 reagent on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

# Comparison Table

The table below compares Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 with the predicate devices, Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck 5 (K100810) and CA 19-9 CalCheck (K051185). The first predicate shows that CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 is substantially equivalent to another CalCheck 5 product, Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck 5. The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 is also substantially equivalent to the second predicate, CA 19-9 CalCheck, with several key similarities, especially the analyte. The shaded fields indicate similar characteristics between the candidate device and one or both predicate devices.

Re: k101365 Trade/Device Name: Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 Regulation Number: 21 CFR§862.1660 Regulation Name: Quality Control Material, Assayed and Unassayed Regulatory Class: Class I (Reserved) Product Code: JJX Dated: August 27, 2010 Received: August 31, 2010

Dear Ms. Adams:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by othér Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will alow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
