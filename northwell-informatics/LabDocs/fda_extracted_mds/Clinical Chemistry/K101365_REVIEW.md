# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 kit consist of 5 levels of human CA 19-9, each with the appropriate lyophilized level of human CA 19-9 in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte CA 19-9 is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels. Level 1 contains no analyte. Sponsor recommends using Check levels 2, 3 and 4 for calibration verification only; and Check 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for verification of the assay range only or verification of the assay range and calibration verification. Target values and approximate concentration target ranges are listed below:

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

# L. Test Principle:

Per sponsor: Clalibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay systems based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. However, in instances where such a test procedure is required by certification agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification, these CalCheck 5 solutions provide an appropriate material for such testing.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 was initially standardized against the Enzymun Test CA 19-9. Value assignment:

The five levels of the CalCheck 5 kit are assigned based on the measuring range of the assay. Samples were run in duplicates on 4 E170 analyzers for a total of 8 runs on 2 days, and on 3 Elecsys 2010 analyzers on one day and 4 Elecsys 2010 analyzers on one day for a total of 7 runs on 2 days. The Modular Analytics E170 master calibration curve is used to calculate $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ from counts. The table below summarizes the assigned values and ranges for Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 lot that was used in this submission on the E170:

# Stability:

Opened-vial and accelerated stability studies were completed on the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170.

Open Vial Stability:

One lot of Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 (Check 1-5) was evaluated in duplicate on the E170. The test material was reconstituted and stored for 4 hours at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and compared to reference material that was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The claimed stability for reconstituted Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 is up to 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

On-Board Stability

Not applicable Accelerated Stability $\%$ Real time Stability:

One Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys E170. The test material was stored lyophilized at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks, stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate and compared.

Real-time stability study is ongoing. The shelf life stability is based on the accelerated stability study of the CalCheck 5 and the real-time stability studies of three-level CalCheck (because of the identical composition of the 3-level and 5-level CalChecks). The initial shelf life stability claim is 18 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Dilution Study

A study is suggested in the package insert in the event CalCheck Levels 1 or 5 produce results that exceed the reportable measuring range of the assay. To demonstrate that the values are within the assay’s measuring range of 0.600– $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ , the following dilution study was performed: Check 1&2 and Check 4&5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in duplicates. Per the sponsor specification, the diluted value must fall within the assay’s measuring range: $0 . 6 - 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ . Results of a dilution study are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Value after 1:1Dilution [U/mL]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average 1:1Dilution [U/mL]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>E170/e 601</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 1 + Check 2Check 1 + Check 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>17.716.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>17.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 4 + Check 5Check 4 + Check 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>874.0774.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>824.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>2010/e 411</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 1 + Check 2Check 1 + Check 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15.715.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 4 + Check 5Check 4 + Check 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>834.0847.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>840.0</td></tr></table>
