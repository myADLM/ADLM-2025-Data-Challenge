# Description:

The $\mathrm { O n } \ C \mathsf { a l l } ^ { \mathfrak {otimes } }$ Plus Diabetes Monitoring Software is for downloading glucose data from the On Call Plus meter to a PC through an USB to RS232 TTL level cable or RS232 to RS232 TTL level cable, with tracking and trending capabilities of glucose measurements.

The Diabetes Data Management Software is intended to be used in a clinical setting with multiple patients by a healthcare professional, or directly by the patient.

The user has the choice to install either a personal "Home" or "Professional" version. In the "Home" version, glucose results are assembled for a single user. In the "Professional" version, the software user can configure a database with multiple providers and patients, The number of providers, patients and data points is limited only by the computer's capabilities.

# Intended Use:

The On $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { C a l l } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Plus Diabetes Software is an optional software accessory to be used with the On Call® Plus Glucose Meters for transferring data to a computer and organizing it in tables and graphs to be used at home and by health care professionals. The software does not recommend any medical treatment or medication dosage level.

# Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as Follows:

The performance characteristics of the On $\mathrm { C a l l } ^ { \mathfrak { Q } }$ Plus Diabetes Monitoring Software were evaluated by performing the software validation test. Guidance documents included "Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff." Compliance to applicable voluntary standards includes EN 62366:2008, "Medical devices, Application of usability engineering to medical devices" and EN 62304:2006 "Medical device software, Software life cycle processes."

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

Clinical studies were conducted with lay persons using the $\mathrm { O n C a l l } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Plus Diabetes Monitoring Software to demonstrate that the intended user can easily operate the software features including Installing the software, transferring meter data to the computer, changing settings, setting up providers and patients, using passwords, viewing and printing reports and uninstalling the software.

Study results indicate that non-professional, inexperienced lay persons were able to operate the sotware an obtain gucose trending reports.In addition, the participaing lay persons were questioned and responded as satisfied with the ease of operation by following the User's Manual and the overall performance of the $\boldsymbol { 0 } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } \mathbb { C } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { a l l } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Plus Diabetes Monitoring Software.

# Conclusion:

The laboratory testing and clinical study results demonstrate that the $\mathrm { O n C a l l ^ { \mathfrak { B } } }$ Plus Diabetes Monitoring Software is safe, effective and easy-to-use. It demonstrates that the $\mathrm { O n C a l l } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Plus Diabetes Monitoring Sotware meets all the validation and clincal requirements and is substantially equivalent to the Bayer Glucofacts Deluxe Diabetes Management Software sold on the U.S. market (K091820).
