The Diabetes Data Management Software is intended to be used in a clinical setting with multiple patients by a healthcare professional, or directly by the patient.

The user has the choice to install either a personal “Home” or “Professional” version. In the “Home” version, glucose results are assembled for a single user. In the “Professional” version, the software user can configure a database with multiple providers and patients. The number of providers, patients and data points is limited only by the computer’s capabilities.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

A study to verify the accuracy of data transmission from the On Call Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring Meter to the On Call Plus Diabetes Monitoring Software was conducted. The data management system was challenged under the conditions in which it is intended to be used in a professional health care setting.

20 meters were used for the study each with a full memory of 300 readings. Data stored on the meters incorporated a range of dates and values and included out of range readings for both high and low and in range data including readings marked as controls.

This study verified that the data transmitted to the PC from the meters was accurate and that the data was accurately manipulated by the software $100 \%$ of the time.

In addition, 50 participants with varying demographics (age, sex, and education level) were included for individual consumer use and multiple patient use with health care provider using both the Home Edition and Professional Edition. The user guide was used in the study (Flesch Kincaid Grade Level 8.3). Participants were required to install the software on a computer, download meter data and use the various features of the program. $9 6 \%$ of the participants evaluated the overall easy of use for the program as OK or above, on a scale for 1 – 5 where 1(very hard) 3 (OK) and 5 (very easy).

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
