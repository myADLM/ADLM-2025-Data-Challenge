# Description of the Device

Astoria-Pacific SPOTCHECK Flow (system marketed with new 307 detector) Astoria-Pacific SPOTCHECK Analyzer with NeoPac (Fluorometric and Photometric Detection options, i.e. predicate detectors)

# Introduction

The SPOTCHECK continuous flow analyzer consists of various devices that interact together to provide a complete in vitro diagnostic (IVD) instrument system for use with Astoria-Pacific's neonatal screening assays. The technology can be considered automated bench chemistry in which continuously flowing reagents are mixed with the sample, ultimately producing a detectable product that correlates to analyte concentration. Proper conditions for reactions are controlled by using a variety of techniques such as specific timing for reagent inputs, incubation at specific temperatures, and/or dialysis. Depending upon the particular IVD assay, system components may differ slightly. In each case however, a system consists of an autosampler, a pump for reagents and sample streams, a module where assay chemistry occurs, a detector (including flowcell), and an interface unit that facilitates communication with the software.

The software, device modification, and new device described herein do not propose to alter the FDA-cleared assays used on the instrument.

Indications for use

The devices described herein do not contain any one specific indication for use, nor does the complete generic system for which they are a part. Complete systems are used to screen for inborn errors of metabolism in neonatal patient dried blood spots.

Proposed Modifications

The proposed modifications to the analyzer system components allow for 2 new unique system options; they are as follows:

1. 350D Interface Unit: The predicate interface unit used for communications between detectors and software has been updated to accommodate the new software\*.   
OR 2. 307 Digital Photometer/Fluorometer: A new detector has been developed as an alternative to using the interface unit and predicate fluorometric detector. It is intended to be used with the new software\*.   
AND \*NeoPac: A new software package has been developed to replace outdated software. The 2 options listed above both depend on this software to complete th system.

Each new or modified component is briefly described below:

# NeoPac Software

NeoPac is a newly developed software package designed to replace Astoria-Pacific's peicattare package. It is intnde o use wih new cnts nd Mic operating systems currently on the market. The software facilitates similar instrument controls as the predicate package, while adding minor but important functionality.

# 350D Interface Unit

The 350D facilitates electronic communication between NeoPac software and the detector(s), autosampler and pump. Each unit has 7 analog detector inputs on the front panel, a power cord connection, and cable connections for a PC, autosampler and pump. Its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for commands and data to flow to and from the software and system components. The 350D is modified from the predicate device (350 Interface Unit) in order to communicate with new software.

# 307 Digital Photometer/Fluorometer

The 307 detector is a newly developed detection platform intended to provide an alternative option to the interface unit and one or more detectors in the SPOTCHECK analyzer system. Aside from providing a state-of-the-art option for detection, its spatial requirements are significantly less than the predicate device. It can be manufactured with up to 4 unique photometric or fluorometric detection channels and an additional analog input (offering the ability to connect to a standalone detector). In conjunction with NeoPac software, it facilitates the communication of data and commands between a PC, autosampler and pump.

The 307 consists of a base module with up to 4 detection channels (not including a reference channel); each channel is either a fluorometer module or a photometric subassembly. The fluorometer module is a removable device that contains a flowcell, excitation LED, and emission bandpass filter. Each fluorometer module is manufactured according to the specifications of the assay it is intended to be used with. The photometric subassembly is not removable by the user.

The only significant differences between the 307 and the predicate detectors (321 and 315) are the use of LEDs for excitation (fluorometry) and a bandpass filter instead of a monochromator (photometry).

# Device Comparison

EP9-A2 Study

The first study described below adhered to the protocol outlined in Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline-Second Edition, EP9- A2. The new system option including the 307 detector was directly compared against the appropriate detector (321 Fluorometer) for 5 neonatal screening assays currently on the market. Results are summarized in the table Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using New 307 Detector.

Dried blood spots were obtained to represented both normal and deficient conditions for each of the 5 individual assays used on the SPOTCHECK system. Since patient samples with deficient and partially-deficient conditions are rare and especially difficult to obtain, in some cases dried blood spot controls provided by different manufacturers (including Astoria-Pacific and the Centers for Disease Control) were used to ensure adequate sample distribution across the assay range. Samples tested include responses around the medical decision levels for each individual assay. These levels were chosen using the cut-offs established in Astoria-Pacific's quality control laboratory.

The results of the EP9-A2 protocol demonstrate that there is no clinically-significant bias which would suggest a need for further analysis. The fluorometric assays performed nearly identical on both the 307 and predicate detector. Since the detection paradigms on the 307 are equivalent to the predicate device, the strong agreement was anticipated.

# Additional Study of Newborn Specimens

A second comparison study for each assay (Uridyltransferase (GALT), Total Galactose, Phenylalanine, and Tyrosine) was performed using a minimum of 88 newborn dried blood spots obtained from domestic newborn screening laboratories. The new G6PD study involved 50 newborn specimens, however the original study (described above) utilized a significant number of newborn specimens. The results of the G6PD study include 42 measurements from the previous study.

The results from the second study closely match the original study and no clinically significant bias between detection paradigms was observed.

# Sensitivity

Evaluation of TGal, Phe, Tyr, and G6PD utilized 3 low-level samples analyzed over 3 days in batches of 20 low-level replicates and 20 blank replicates per run (for each method). Evaluation of GALT utilized 2 low-level samples analyzed over 3 days in batches of 20 low-level replicates and 20 blank replicates per run (1 low level sample was used in 2 of 3 runs, 40 replicates in total). Results were used to determine the sensitivity of the analytical system for each method. The study was conducted according to CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline. The study results demonstrated equivalent or improved sensitivity performance when compared to the predicate system. A summary is provided below.

# Precision

Evaluation of precision for TGal, Phe, Tyr and GALT utilized 3 samples at different levels of activity or concentration (generally: low, medium, and high) for each method tested. Samples were analyzed over 5 days, 1 run per day, 8 replicates of each sample per run. Sample order was changed for each run.

Evaluation of precision for G6PD also utilized 3 samples at low, medium and high activity, however, samples were analyzed over 4 days with 1 run per day for 3 days and 2 runs on one day. Eight replicates of each sample were analyzed per run in order to attain the degrees of freedom recommended in the protocol. Sample order was the same for each run. The study was conducted according to CLSI EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline  Second Edition.

Each method's results demonstrated an improvement in precision over the predicate device at comparable levels of analyte/enzyme activity. The only exception is an observed increase in imprecision at very low levels of G6PD enzyme activity, however, said imprecision is acceptable and not clinically significant. Neither within-run nor total precision suggests that a neonate with deficient G6PD activity would be qualified as normal, especially considering the comparable precision around the clinical decision level.
