3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

This device is intended for prescription use only.

As with any other in vitro screening test, the data obtained using these screening kits should be used as an aid to other medically established procedures and results interpreted in conjunction with other clinical data available to the clinician. A diagnostic procedure should be used to confirm a diagnosis.

# 4. Special instrument requirements:

Five neonatal screening assays (Total Galactose, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Uridyltransferase and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) are for use on the SPOTCHECK FLOW analyzer.

Six neonatal screening assays (Total Galactose, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Uridyltransferase, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase and Biotinidase) are for use on the SPOTCHECK analyzer.

# I. Device Description:

One new device and three modified devices are described in this bundled submission.

The new device (SPOTCHECK Flow) is a continuous flow analyzer consisting of a new detector (307 Digital Photometer/Fluorometer Detector) which does not require an Interface Unit for communication between detector and software, new software (NeoPac Software), computer, autosampler, peristaltic pump, assay cartridge and base module with power.

The three modified devices are modifications to previously cleared continuous flow analyzers (SPOTCHECK Analyzers; k883020 and k851542) that consist of a detector (315 and/or 321 Detector), a new interface unit (350D Interface Unit), new software (NeoPac Software), computer, autosampler, peristaltic pump, assay cartridge and base module with power. NeoPac Software is new software update allowing compatibility with Microsoft based computers while the 350D Interface Unit is an updated component that allows communication between the 315 or 321 detector and new software.

The 307 Digital Photometer/Fluorometer Detector is a new detector developed as an alternative to using the interface unit and 315/321 detectors. It is intended to be used with the new NeoPac software. The 307 Detector consists of a base module with up to 4 detection channels (not including a reference channel); each channel is either a fluorometer module or a photometric subassembly. The only significant differences between the new detector (307 Detector) and the original detectors (315 and 321 Detectors) are the use of LED light source for excitation (fluorometry) and a bandpass filter instead of a monochromator (photometry).

NeoPac Software replaces Astoria-Pacific’s original software package, FASPac. It is intended for use with new components and Microsoft operating systems currently on the market. The software facilitates similar instrument controls as FASPac, while adding new minor functionality.

The 350D Interface Unit facilitates electronic communication between NeoPac software and the detector(s), autosampler and pump. Each unit has 7 analog detector inputs on the front panel, a power cord connection, and cable connections for a PC, autosampler and pump. Its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for commands and data to flow to and from the software and system components. The 350D Interface Unit is modified from the predicate device (350 Interface Unit) in order to communicate with new software.

# L. Test Principle:

Continuous flow analysis technology can be considered automated bench chemistry in which continuously flowing reagents are mixed with the sample, ultimately producing a detectable product that correlates to analyte concentration. Regardless of the test, a system consists of an autosampler, a pump for reagents and sample streams, a module where assay chemistry occurs, a detector (including flowcell), and an interface unit that facilitates communication with the software (providing the detector does not directly interface with a computer). Proper conditions for chemical reactions are controlled by using a variety of techniques such as specific reagent input timing, mixing, incubation at specific temperatures, and sample dialysis. As the reaction stream enters the detector's flowcell, the fluorescence or absorbance increase is simultaneously observed onscreen and recorded by the software. The software package is designed to recognize the increase and marks the sample peak, identifying it to a particular sample based on its arrival time. Calibration and results determination are also computed by the software. The new instrument uses an LED light source for analyte excitation during fluorometric analysis which does not affect the assay as the peak excitation wavelength remains unchanged.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed a precision study that is modified from the recommendations in CLSI Guideline EP5-A2; four or five days of precision studies were performed. Precision studies were conducted for five neonatal screening assays (Total Galactose, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Uridyltransferase and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) on a single SPOTCHECK FLOW analyzer (new device) using a single reagent lot. The evaluation of precision for Total Galactose, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine and Uridyltransferase was conducted using adult dried blood spot samples spiked at different three different levels (generally; low, medium and high). Samples were analyzed 8 replicates per run, 1 run per day for 5 days (total of 40 replicates per sample). The precision study for Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase used adult dried blood spot samples spiked at three different levels (low, medium and high), however the samples were analyzed over 4 days with 1 run per day for 3 days and 2 runs on one day (total of 40 replicates per sample).

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off:

Newborn screening using these assays (Total Galactose, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Uridyltransferase and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) requires a decision of the screening policy, cut-off values and follow-up for each condition being screened for. In the labeling the sponsor makes the recommendation that the laboratory needs to establish its own cut-off values for each assay, which can be based on a percentile, or on the basis of a normal range depending on the condition being screened for.

In the labeling the sponsor states that laboratories are to follow local requirements for follow-up testing.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected values of the individual assays (k990957, k970277, k970093, k894011 and k891070) were previously established. In the labeling, the sponsor recommends that each laboratory establishes its own reference range for each assay from a representative sample population.

Astoria-Pacific's SPOTCHECK analyzer uses neonatal patient blood samples dried on approved paper for its testing medium. Punched blood spots are eluted into extraction solution in individual wells of standard microplates. Up to 4 microplates are placed on a random access autosampler and patient identifiers are either imported or typed directly into NeoPac software's sample table. Once a run begins, samples are analyzed sequentially via continuous flow analysis and the data is handled, manipulated, and reported using the software. The software allows for samples to be added during a run, however because of the pre-analytical extraction process, this requires working with additional microplates.

# 2. Software:

NeoPac software is capable of running on all of Microsoft operating systems currently on the market. Software capabilities include interfacing with laboratory management systems, using both import and export functions. The user primarily interfaces with the software by inputting sample identifiers and positions; monitoring detector response; starting and stopping analyses; exporting or printing reports; and reviewing calculated values for clinical-decision making purposes. Additional data management capabilities include ongoing trending for specific samples or quality control material.

3. Specimen Identification:

Samples are identified in several ways: The user can manually input both sample identifiers and positions directly in the software's sample table (correlating to where dried blood spots are punched into the microplate). As samples are entered, by default NeoPac software will automatically add sample positions sequentially according to a microplate layout. Alternatively, sample positions can be imported along with sample identifiers from a spreadsheet or laboratory management system export file. This may or may not involve barcoding; however the software does not interface with barcodes directly.

NeoPac software is flexible such that a combination of both methods is possible, allowing for the various levels of sample handling automation in clinical laboratories.

# 4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Neonatal patient dried blood spots are punched (the size of the punch is dependent on the assay or number of assays) into 96-well filterplates and extracted with a specific eluent (dependent on the assay). After an extraction time specified in the assay's product insert, samples are filtered into clean microplates. The microplate containing each eluted sample is placed on the autosampler tray and individual wells are sampled sequentially correlating with their order of entry in NeoPac software.

# 5. Calibration:

Calibration on the SPOTCHECK analyzer system is achieved using calibrators specific to the assay; this can be accomplished using the analyte or calibrators that mimic the analyte's response. NeoPac software applies the values entered by the user for the calibrators and, using regression analysis, generates a curve. This curve is used to calculate the results for all subsequent samples or quality control material.

# 6. Quality Control:

Quality control samples, typically dried blood spots with specific or qualitative concentrations, are generally analyzed throughout a run to ensure that each assay continues to produce appropriately accurate results. In the labeling the sponsor provides recommendations for testing external quality control materials.
