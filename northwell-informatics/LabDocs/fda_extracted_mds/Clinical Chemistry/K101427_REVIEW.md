# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indication for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Audit™ MicroCV™ hs-CRP Linearity Set is assayed quality control material consisting of five levels human based serum. Each level contains High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs -CRP) analyte. The five levels demonstrate a linear relationship to each other for High Sensitivity CReactive Protein (hs -CRP) analyte. It is intended to simulate human patient serum samples for purpose of monitoring and detecting systematic analytical deviations of laboratory testing procedures for High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs -CRP). This product may be used as quality control material for High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs -CRP) analyte. When used for quality control purposes, it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use the values provided only as guides. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays on the indicated analyzer provided in the labeling. The Audit™ MicroCV™ hs-CRP Linearity Set is “For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only”

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

AUDIT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MicroCV™ hs-CRP Linearity Set is not to be used for calibration or standardization of the hs-CRP assay.

4. Special instrument requirements:

The performance was established on the Hitachi 911 analyzer.

# I. Device Description:

The Audit™ MicroCV™ hs-CRP Linearity Set is an in vitro diagnostic device consisting of five levels of liquid linearity materials containing hs-CRP and additives in human serum. There are 5 vials labeled A, B, C, D, and E, and contain $2 \mathrm { m L }$ for each level.

Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test set has been tested using FDA approved methods and found to be non-reactive for HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2.

Traceability and Value assignment

Component is obtained from an approved vendor and inspected by the sponsor upon arrival.

Value assignment is performed on one Hitachi 911 instrument with one lot of reagent for hs-CRP analyte. hs-CRP was measured 5 times (5 separate vials) and the mean value of hs-CRP was used to establish target concentration values at each level. The target ranges were calculated $a \mathbf { s } \pm 2 0 \%$ of the target value. The mean concentration values of each level are plotted (concentration value vs. assigned level) and a linear regression values obtained and evaluated.

Stability studies: Open-Vial Stability:

Five vials of levels A, B, C, D and E are opened and exposed to the environment for 30 minutes then closed and repeated for a total of 3 cycles. Vials are then closed and stored for 10 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The percent loss is determined in comparison to Day Zero values.

The protocol, data and acceptance criteria were found to be adequate.

The data supported the package insert claims that the analyte is stable after opening the vial when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 10 days.

Accelerated Stability:

Five vials of levels A ,B.C.D and E were stressed at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 20 days to predict two-year stability when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Performance data was collected through “destructive testing” by Quality Control according to specifications. The protocol, data and acceptance criteria were found to be adequate. Accelerated stability studies are supported by an on-going real-time stability study.

Homocysteine Linearity Set was evaluated on the Hitachi 911 analyzer with Pointe hs-CRP reagents.

The shelf life claim is 24 months. This is based on the accelerated stability results and on-going real-time stability studies.
