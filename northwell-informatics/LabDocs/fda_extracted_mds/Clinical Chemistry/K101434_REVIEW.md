# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not Applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

Laboratories use a stable reference material to verify the accuracy and precision of testing methods and techniques. Audi $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MicroCV™ Procalcitonin Linearity Set may

be used as one would use human serum to verify and validate the test method analytical measurement range.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Value Assignment was based on measurement of Procalcitonin 8 times (8 separate vials) and the mean value of Procalcitonin was used to establish target concentration values at each level. The target ranges were calculated as $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the target value. The mean concentration values of each level were plotted (concentration value vs. assigned level) and a linear regression values were obtained. If the five-point linear regression $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ value is greater than 0.95 and if the plots are linear, then the product demonstrates linearity.

Representative data from the Procalcitonin Linearity set is shown below for five lots:

Traceability: Values assigned to the AuditTM Micro $\operatorname { C V } ^ { \mathrm { { T M } } }$ Procalcitonin Linearity Set can be traced to bioMerieux VIDAS Procalcitonin Reagent – 30450-01, Procalcitonin Calibrator – 30450-01, and Procalcitonin Control– 30450-01

The base matrix for building the low and high pools is bovine serum albumin. For the low pool (Level A), Procalcitonin is adjusted to be within $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the lowest limit of measurability for the Procalcitonin assay. For the high pool (Level E), Procalcitonin is adjusted to be within $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the highest limit of measurability for the Procalcitonin assay.

An accelerated “Heat Stress Stability Prediction” stability study was conducted to predict shelf life. Four vials of each level were stressed at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 10 days to predict one-year stability when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Two pilot lots, Pilot 1, Lot 091011-091015 and Pilot 2, Lot 81164-81168, were produced and tested. For both pilots, Procalcitonin in the stress stability study results were within $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the Day Zero value. This gives the Procalcitonin Linearity Control one-year shelf life stability.

Accelerated stability studies are supported by an on-going real-time stability studies.

Open vial stability was also performed to determine the viability of the product during the course of normal use. Four vials of each level (A through E) were opened and reconstituted with deionized water. Vials were then closed, stored for 5 days at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested following the same manner as the above stated destructive testing. The percent loss determined in comparison to Day Zero values was $< 1 5 \%$ and the product is considered stable.
