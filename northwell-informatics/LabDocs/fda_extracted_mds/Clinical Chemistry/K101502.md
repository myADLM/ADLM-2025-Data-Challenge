# Device

Trade Name:

BD Vacutainer $\otimes$ Rapid Serum Tube Blood Collection Tube with HemogardTM Closure

Classification Name:

JKA (Tubes, vials, systems, serum separators, blood collection)

Classification:

Class II

Performance Standards:

None Established under 514 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act

# 2. Safety and Effectiveness Information Supporting the Substantial Equivalence Determination

Device Description:

BD Vacutainer® Tubes are sterile, single-use, evacuated plastic blood collection tubes with rubber stoppers that provide a means of collecting, transporting, separating, and processing blood in a closed tube. The BD Vacutainer® Rapid Serum Tube Blood Collection Tube with HemogardTM Closure (BD RST HG) clots blood specimens much faster than other additives (5 minutes), and therefore is desirable when a fast turnaround-time is necessary.

Intended Use:

The BD RST HG is a single use tube used to collect, separate, transport and process venous blood specimens to obtain serum for chemistry determinations for in vitro diagnostic use. It is used in settings where a venous blood sample is collected by a trained healthcare worker.

Clot time has not been established for patients on heparin therapy, direct thrombin inhibitor therapy or with Factor I deficiency. As a result, the use of BD RST HG in these patients is not recommended.

# Claims:

BD RST HG tube clots blood in 5 minutes, providing high quality serum.   
BD RST HG tube demonstrates substantially equivalent performance to the predicate BD Vacutainer $\textcircled{8}$ SST™M Plus Blood Collection tube (BD SST™M) for the collection, separation, transport, and processing of venous blood specimens for chemistry determinations requiring serum for in vitro diagnostic use.   
BD RST HG tube demonstrates substantially equivalent performance to the predicate BD SST™M tube for the following selected serology analytes: anti-CMV IgG antiCMV-IgM, and CRP.   
BD RST HG tube demonstrates substantially equivalent performance to the predicate BD SST™M tube for the following selected immunology analytes: C3, C4, IgG IgM, and Rf.   
BD RST HG tube demonstrates substantially equivalent performance to the predicate BD SST™M tube for 24 hr stability for analytes evaluated except LDL (16 hours), Progesterone (8 hours), and Triglycerides (15 hours).

# Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

Clinical testing was performed on blood collected in both the evaluation and predicate tubes for a battery of routine and special chemistry analytes, and selected serology and immunology analytes. Clotting of blood within 5 minutes was demonstrated in the

BD RST HG. The test results demonstrated that the evaluation device's performance was substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device for tested analytes.

Based on a comparison of the device features, materials, and intended use, the BD RST HG is substantially equivalent to the commercially available predicate device, the BD SST™M tube.

Dear Ms. Alsberge:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other . Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
