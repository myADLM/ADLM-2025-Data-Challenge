# Device Description

The U-RIGHT TD-4279 A/B Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems and FORA GD40a/b Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems consist of three main products: the meter, test strips and control solutions. These products have been designed, tested, and proven to work together as a system to produce accurate blood glucose test results. Use only U-RIGHT TD-4279 A/B test strips and FORA GD40a/b test strips for the U-RIGHT TD-4279 A/B Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems and FORA GD40a/b Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems, and use with FORA control solutions to perform quality checks.

The blood glucose detection method and measurement is by an electrochemical biosensor technology using FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH).
