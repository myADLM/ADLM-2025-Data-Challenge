# L. Test Principle:

The U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD 40 glucose meters, in conjunction with the same test trips (U-Right TD-4279 or FORA GD-40), utilize amperometric technology to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in whole blood samples and in control solutions. A glucose dehydrogenase sensor based on the carbon electrode adopting the amperometric assay utilizes the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are produced. Through the mechanism of the mediator, electrical current is generated and it is proportional to the quantity of glucose in the sample.

The reaction principle of reagent depends on following reaction equation:

GDH, FAD Glucose $^ { + 2 }$ ferricyanide $=$ gluconolactone $^ { + 2 }$ ferrocyanide

electrode ferrocyanide $=$ ferricyanide $^ +$ eGDH: glucose dehydrogenase FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO 15197 and CLSI EP-5A. Since the U-Right TD-4279A and U-Right TD-4279B are identical devices as well as FORA GD40 A and FORA GD40 B, which differ only in data transmission function (A - USB model; B - Bluetooth model), the precision studies were performed to evaluate precision of the glucose meters with more complex data transmission function, the U-Right TD-4279B and FORA GD40 B models. The within-run precision study was performed using venous whole blood samples, with hematocrit ranging from $3 8 \%$ to $54 \%$ , and dextrose spiked to create 7 levels of blood glucose. Three lots of test strips and 10 meters were used in the study, with 10 tests performed on each meter for a total of 300 tests per blood glucose level. Results for each test strip lot are summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted whole blood samples with 11 different glucose concentrations covering the measuring range entirely and using both devices, U-Right TD-4279 (B model) and FORA GD40 (B model) and the YSI-2300 glucose analyzer (reference method). Three lots of test strips were used in the study with 20 tests per lot performed on each meter. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot is summarized below:

U-Right TD-4279: Lot 1 $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 8 3 3 \mathrm { x } + 6 . 2 5 4 8$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 4$ Lot 2 $\begin{array} { r } { \mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 7 3 4 \mathrm { x } + 7 . 5 1 2 6 . } \end{array}$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 1$ Lot 3 $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 7 0 7 \mathrm { x } + 8 . 0 8 5 7 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 5$

# FORA GD40:

Lot 1 $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 3 3 9 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 5 7 2 2$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 4 4$ Lot 2 $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 0 9 \mathrm { x } + 2 . 1 5 1 1$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 5 2$ Lot 3 $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 0 8 9 + 5 . 2 1 8 6$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 7 9$

The measuring range of the U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 is 20 - 600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The method comparison was performed using the proposed devices and YSI 2300 glucose analyzer.

Controls: Control solutions were cleared in k093724. The control ranges are listed on the test strip vial labels.

The storage claims for these devices are: 90 days for open vial of strips stored at $3 5 . 6 - 8 9 . 6 ~ \mathrm { ^ { o } F }$ $( 2 - 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and 18 months for unopened vials of strips stored at the same temperature. The study protocol, data and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be adequate.

Temperature and humidity studies: Temperature and humidity studies were conducted on each type of meter (U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40) with venous blood samples spanning the measuring range and demonstrating that these devices can be used at temperatures of 4 to $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and at a relative humidity up to $8 5 \%$ . The study protocol, data and individual bias $0 \mathrm { f } \pm 1 0 \%$ across the entire measuring range were provided and found to be adequate.

Open-vial-in-use test strip studies were performed at the combined extremes of $1 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $4 6 . 4 \substack { - 5 6 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { { F } } } )$ RH: $30 \%$ , $1 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $R \mathrm { H } { : } 8 5 \%$ , $4 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (100.4- $1 0 7 . 6 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } F } )$ $R H { : } 3 0 \%$ , and $4 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ RH: $8 5 \%$ with venous blood samples with concentrations across the measuring range and compared to the YSI. The study protocol, data and individual bias of $\pm 1 0 \%$ across the entire measuring range were provided and found to be adequate.

d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the devices is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . This range was validated via the linearity study (see section M.1.b.).

e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples at two glucose concentrations (100 and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) that were prepared and divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. The interferents were added to the sample and each sample was analyzed in duplicate using $^ { 4 \mathrm { ~ U ~ } }$ - Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 glucose meters. The table below lists all substances tested at concentrations with insignificant $( < 1 0 \% )$ interference:

Hematocrit Study:

A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 8 glucose concentrations at 11 hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and $70 \%$ ). Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested in duplicate of 6 of each type of meter (U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40) using one lot of test strips. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same glucose concentration at normal $( 4 0 \% )$ hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value. All individual results for each meter type were $+ / - 1 5 \%$ of the YSI, supporting the claimed hematocrit range of $20 \mathrm { - } 7 0 \%$ .

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor conducted a combined accuracy and consumer study. Testing was performed at 3 sites, with trained operators and a total of 146 lay-users. Each lay user participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood on the U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 (TD-4272) meters using only the instructions in the user’s manual and test strip insert. A trained operator then performed a second fingerstick and tested the blood on the same meter. Venous blood was also collected and measured on an YSI analyzer. The total range of samples tested was $3 2 { - } 5 3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the U-Right TD-4279 meter and 32 to $5 1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the FORA GD40 (TD-4272) glucose meter. Samples ${ < } 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and ${ \scriptstyle > 4 0 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were glycolyzed or spiked, respectively, and tested by trained operators as well as lay users. Linear regression results are presented below:

Venous blood samples:

Testing was done comparing venous blood samples previously collected in commercially available sodium-heparin tubes and then evaluated with the URight TD-4279 and FORA GD40 against YSI-2300. 100 subjects were tested by professionals. Samples from 25 to $5 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the U-Right TD-4279 BGM and 22 to $5 8 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the FORA GD40 were included in this analysis. Each fresh capillary whole blood sample used was from a different individual except for samples with blood glucose concentrations less than 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and greater than $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For those specimens, a pooled capillary whole blood specimen was either glycolyzed or spiked to the desired level. Linear regression results are presented below:

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Professionals may test capillary and venous blood, while home-use is limited to capillary whole blood testing only.

5. Calibration:

These systems need to be calibrated every time users open a new vial of test strips. Calibration of the test strip is done by inserting the code strip into the meters when opening a new vial of test strips

# 6. Quality Control:

The sponsor has three levels of controls that may not be provided with the meters, but can be purchased separately. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each control can be measured by following the instructions for “Performing a Control Solution Test” provided in the User’s Manuals for the meters. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the test results fall outside the range printed on the test strip vial, the user is instructed to contact the Customer Care Line at 1-866-469-2632 for customer support. The Customer Care service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. These devices are intended for single-patient use (U- RIGHT TD4279A/B and FORA GD $4 0 \mathrm { a / b / T D - } 4 2 4 7 \mathrm { A / B } )$ and multiple patient use/healthcare professional use (U- RIGHT TD-4279A/B MULTI and FORA Wisdom GD 40a/b/TD-4247A/B ) . Cleaning and disinfection are different processes. Cleaning is the process of removing dirt (e.g. food debris, grease, dust), disinfection is the process of killing germs (e.g. bacteria and viruses). Disinfection studies (viral efficacy studies) were performed by an outside service to evaluate the virus elimination effectiveness of disinfecting wipes in preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Specifically, Micro$\mathbf { K i l l + }$ cleaner disinfectant towels (with EPA registration # 59894-10-37549) were validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus. The sponsor does not market a lancing device for use with the device. The sponsor also performed robustness studies using all 4 glucose meters claimed in this 510(k) application (U- RIGHT TD-4279A, U- RIGHT TD-4279B, FORA GD 40a/TD4247A and FORA GD 40b/TD-4247B) and demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meters after 10,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years (5 cleaning and disinfection cycles per day) of single patient device use or 3 years (9 cleaning and disinfection cycles per day) of healthcare professional use. The tested number of cycles is estimated by 5 cleaning and disinfection cycles per day over 5 years, the expected life of the single patient device or 9 cycles per day for the multiple patient use in professional settings. In addition, the sponsor provided a risk analysis specific to the potential harm due to infection. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

2. Lay-User Study for USB and Bluetooth mediated Data Transmission: This study was performed using 50 study participants, following instructions in

User’s manual, who were able to transmit results from the meter to the PC application (cleared under k070941) via either the USB (25 study subjects) or Bluetooth (25 study subjects)features. The study participants also completed a questionnaire in response to whether the data transmission feature is easy to use. The sponsor concluded that the users’ responses indicated that data transmission function was easy to operate by following the User’s manuals for both the USB and the Bluetooth mediated data transmission.

3. Altitude study: An altitude study was performed in an altitude simulation chamber with whole blood samples spanning the range of ${ \sim } 2 0$ to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for both, U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 glucose meters. The study protocol, data and bias $\pm 1 0 \%$ across the entire measuring range were provided and found to be adequate. Altitude up to 10,742 feet $( 3 , 2 7 5 \mathrm { m } )$ does not affect test results of the U-RIGHT TD-4279 and FORA GD40 glucose meters.

4. Specimen volume study: A study was performed to evaluate the effect of different sample volumes (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 and $2 . 5 \mu \mathrm { l }$ ) on the performance of these devices. It was determined that the $1 . 1 \mu \mathrm { l }$ volume of sample provides accurate reading for both, U-RIGHT TD-4279 and FORA GD40 glucose meters. The results from this study for the sample volume of $1 . 1 \mu \mathrm { l }$ were within $\pm 1 0 \%$ individual bias across the entire measuring range when U-RIGHT TD-4279 and FORA GD40 measurements were compared to the YSI-2300.

5. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid grade level scores of 8 or lower for the User’s Manual and test strip insert.

6. Lay user questionnaire: 146 lay users evaluated the ease of use of the device and the presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems were easy to use and most answer “easy” and “very easy” that the user manuals were written to make it easy to use.

7. Additional electromagnetic interference study was performed to verify these new products. The results of this study complied with standards listed in the Standard/Guidance Document Referenced section above. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC): EMC testing for u-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 was performed/passed and a certificate to TaiDoc was provided.
