# 5Intended use

# TysonBio AC100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System:

The TysonBio AC100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm or palm. The TysonBio AC100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The TysonBio AC100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The TysonBio AC100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly). The TysonBio AC100 contains a voice function but this function is not intended for users with impaired vision.

The TysonBio AC100 Test Strips are for use with the TysonBio AC100 Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm or palm.

# TysonBio AC100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System:

The TysonBio AC100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm, or forearm. The TysonBio AC100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is intended for multiple-patient use in professional healthcare settings as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control program. This system should only be used with single-use lancing devices.

The TysonBio AC100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not

changing rapidly). The TysonBio AC100 Pro contains a voice function but this function is not intended for users with impaired vision.

The TysonBio AC100 Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the TysonBio AC100 Pro Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm or palm.

# Test principle

The test principle is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose oxidase. There has been no change to the fundamental scientific technology.

# 7.Predicate device

Easy Step Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K090629)

# Comparison to predicate device

The modifications to the device encompass:

Addition of selectable voice guidance on/off function (for TysonBio AC100 model only)   
Addition of hypoglycemic and hypoglycemic alarm setting Removal of backlight   
Extension of meter memory capacities   
Changes in outer case appearance   
Change to auto coding.

There have been no changes to the operating principle, intended use or functionality.

# 8Performance characteristic summary

Evaluations of the TysonBio AC100 / A100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the TysonBio AC200 / AC200 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System were studied in the laboratory and in a clinical setting using persons with diabetes. The results were compared to results from the currently marketed Easy Step Blood Glucose Monitoring System and to a laboratory method. The studies showed substantially equivalent performance with the current Easy Step Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# . Conclusion

The TysonBio AC100 / AC200 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the predicate Easy Step Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
