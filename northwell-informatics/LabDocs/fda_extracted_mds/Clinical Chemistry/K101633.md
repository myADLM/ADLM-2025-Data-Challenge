Device Name:

Nova Max Plus Glucose and β-Ketone Control Solutions

Common Name:

Single (Specified) Analyte Controls (Assayed And Unassayed)

# Classification:

Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Clinical Chemistry

Single (Specified) Analyte Controls (Assayed And Unassayed)   
Class I per 21 CFR 862.1660   
Nitroprusside, Ketones (Urinary, Non-Quant.)   
Class I per 21 CFR 862.1435

Product Codes: JJX, JIN

Predicate Devices: Nova Max Plus Blood Glucose and B-Ketone Monitor System, K091547 Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor, K070255

Description of the Device:

Intended Use/Indications for Use:

Nova Max Plus Glucose and β-Ketone Control Solutions are intended for use with the Nova Max Family of Monitors (Nova Max, Nova Max Plus, and Nova Max Link), BD Logic and Paradigm Link Monitors, Nova Max Glucose Test Strips, and Nova Max Plus Ketone Test Strips as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood Glucose and β-Ketone test results.There are two levels of Nova Max Plus Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone Control Solutions (Mid and High).

Nova Max Plus Glucose and β-Ketone Control Solutions are for in vitro diagnostic use ONLY (for testing outside the body).

Summary of Technological Characteristics:

The proposed Nova Max Plus Glucose and β- Ketone Control Solutions measures Glucose and β-Ketone electrochemically. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the amount of Glucose or, β- hydroxybutyrate (β- Ketone) present in the sample, providing a quantitative measure of Glucose or β- Ketone in whole blood, or control solutions.

# Comparison to Predicate Devices:

1ne proposed Nova Max Plus Glucose and β-Ketone Control solutions use the same fundamental scientific technology and have the same intended use as the control solutions previously cleared in the predicate Nova Max Plus Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitor System (K091547), and the predicate Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor (K070255).

# Performance Studies:

I he performance of the Nova Max Plus Glucose and β-Ketone control solutions has been studied in the laboratory. Stability studies, precision studies, and equivalency studies have all been performed.All results support the conclusion of substantial equivalence to the currently marketed predicate devices

# Conclusion:

Kesults of laboratory testing demonstrate that the performance of the Nova Max Plus Glucose and β- $\beta$ Ketone Control Solutions can produce results that are substantially equivalent to results obtained with the previously cleared predicate devices. In addition, the proposed device utilizes the same fundamental nictenoogy, and has the sameintended use s the previousy ceare predicate devics.Thee no new concerns for safety and effectiveness that have been shown through testing.

Dear Mr. MacDonald:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
