# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

Glucose controls are traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) D-Glucose SRM 917B.

Nova Max Plus Ketone controls are traceable to an in house standard prepared gravimetrically from commercially available materials. No Standard Reference Material (SRM) is currently available for B-Hydroxybutyrate.

# Value Assignment:

Glucose:

The target values are $1 0 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (Level Mid) and $2 8 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (Level High). The lot specific range was assigned as mean $\pm 1 7 \%$ . The Mean and SD was calculated from 150 test results (2 tests per strip lot per monitor per day, using 3 strip lots and 5 monitors over 5 days of testing).

Ketone:

The target values are $1 . 1 \mathrm { m M }$ (Level Mid) and $2 . 6 \mathrm { m M }$ (Level High). The lot specific range was assigned as mean $\pm 2 0 \%$ for the high control, and mean $\pm 0 . 2 \mathrm { m M }$ for the mid control. The Mean and SD was calculated from 150 test results (2 tests per strip lot per monitor per day, using 3 strip lots and 5 monitors over 5 days of testing).

# Stability:

Shelf life stability:

Real-time testing at room temperature $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and accelerated testing at $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $5 0 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ were conducted. The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The predicted shelf-life, based on results of accelerated testing, is 2.5 years at room temperature $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Real-time stability testing is on-going to support the claimed shelf life of 24 months at room temperature $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

• Open-Vial Stability:

The stability study protocol to determine open-vial stability of the controls and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The Nova Max Plus Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone Control Solutions are stable after opening for at least 90 days at room temperature $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .
