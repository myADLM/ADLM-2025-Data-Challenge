FORA G31 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Model TD-4256) Blood glucose test system TaiDoc Technology Corporation K094005

# Device Description

The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System consist of three main products: the meter, test strips and control solutions. These products have been designed, tested, and proven to work together as a system to produce accurate blood glucose test results. Use only TD-4239 and TD-4239 Multi test strips for the TD-4239 and TD-4239 Multi Blood·Glucose Monitoring Systems, and use with the control solutions that has been tested and validated with this system to perform quality checks.

The blood glucose detection method and measurement is by an electrochemical biosensor technology using FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH).

The two blood glucose systems have the same technical components (same meter and test strips) and therefore the same performance data.

# 5Intended Use

# For single use device

The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples from the finger. It is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus or be used on neonates.

The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the TD-4239 Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples.

# For multiple patient use device

The TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary, venous and neonatal whole blood samples. The TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is intended for multiple patient use in professional healthcare settings as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus.

Professionals may test with capillary, venous and neonatal whole blood. Capillary samples may be drawn from the fingertip, and in the case of neonates, from the heel.

The system is only used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices.

The TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary, venous and neonatal whole blood samples.

# Comparison to Predicate Device

The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System have the same operating principle and same fundamental scientific technology as FORA G31 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K094005). Modifications include test strip change, meter outer casing design, and software modifications. Accuracy study and software validation were performed to evaluate the meter performance. Results show that both devices are substantially equivalent to the predicate device K094005.

# 7Performance Studies

The laboratory and clinical studies for the system performance of TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System demonstrate the meter and test strip works well as a system.

Software verification and validation tests confirmed that the performance, safety and effectiveness of the TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System are equivalent to the predicate device.

# 8. Conclusion

The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System demonstrate satisfactory performance. The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System are therefore substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Hsu,

We have reviewed your Section S10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
