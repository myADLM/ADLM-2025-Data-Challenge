# 005 - 510(k) SUMMARY

# H. Intended Use:

# Indication(s) for use:

The Uritek TC-101 urine analyzer is an automated, bench top instrument which is intended for prescription, in vitro diagnostic use only. The instrument is intended to be used together with the Urine Reagent Strips (URS) 10 as a system for the semiquantitative detection of Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite and Leukocytes in urine. Test results may provide information regarding the status of carbohydrate metabolism, kidney and liver function, acid-base balance and bacteriuria.

# IDevice Description

The Uritek TC-101 Urine Analyzer is a portable easy to use instrument which reads Teco Urine Reagent Strips (URS) 10 for testing in the clinical laboratory. The TC101 can determine the intensity of different colors on the reagent strip test area. It does this by irradiating the test area with light and detecting the reflectance of different wavelengths using an integrated sphere photo-detector. This photo-detector is filtered to measured wavelengths of ${ 5 2 5 } \mathrm { n m }$ , $5 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , $6 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , and $7 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ by the integrated sphere. Results are calculated by a reflection rate which is a percentage of the total reflectance of the testing wavelength and are printed automatically.

The Uritek TC-101 reports semi-quantitative assays for 10 urine analytes (glucose, bilirubin, ketone, specific gravity, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocytes). Reagent strip results are automatically displayed on the screen in one minute. A printed hardcopy can also be created either from the results screen or recalled from memory. The analyzer features a display, internal printer, a serial computer interface and an electrical outlet. Communication between the operator and the analyzer is made through the display using the arrows and 'yes' or 'no' buttons on the front of the analyzer.

The Urine Reagent Strips (URS) 10 are urine test strips of which glucose, bilirubin, ketone, specific gravity, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocyte reagent pad are affixed onto the firm plastic strips. The reagent pad areas are bibulous material saturated with chemically active substances, then dried and affixed to the plastic strip with double-sided adhesive. URS 10 provide tests for the semi-quantitative determination of glucose, bilirubin, ketone, specific gravity, blood, $\mathtt { p H }$ , protein, urobilinogen, nitrite and leukocytes in urine. Test results may provide information regarding the status of carbohydrate metabolism, kidney and liver function, acid-base balance, and bacteriuria.

The Urine Reagent Strips 10 and Multistix 10 SG share the same characteristics including Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, $\mathsf { p H } ,$ Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite, and Leukocyte methodologies.

# K. Test Principle:

Glucose: This test is based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. One enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the reaction in which glucose is oxidized to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. A second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with potassium iodide chromogen in which the chromogen is oxidized to different colors ranging from blue-green to greenish-brown through brown and dark brown.

Bilirubin: This test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with a diazotized dichloroaniline in a strongly acid medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce light tan to reddishbrown color propotional to its concentration in urine.

Ketone: This test is based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid with sodium nitroprusside in a strongly basic medium. The colors range from beige or buff-pink color for a "Negative" reading to pink and pink-purple for a "Positive" reading.

Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated polyelectrolytes in relation to the ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, the colors range from dark blue or blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green in urine of higher ionic concentration.

Blood: This test is based on the pseudoperoxidase action of hemoglobin and erythrocytes which catalyzes the reaction of 3,3',5, ${ \bar { \mathfrak { s } } } ^ { \mathfrak { r } }$ -tetramethyl-benzidine and buffered organic peroxide. The resulting colors range from orange to yellow-green and dark green. Very high blood concentration may cause the color development to continue to dark blue.

pH: This test is based on the well known double pH indicator method, where bromothymol blue and methyl red give distinguishable colors over the pH range of 5-9. The colors range from red-orange to yellow and yellow-green to blue-green.

# 005 - 510(k) SUMMARY

Protein: This test is based on the protein error-of-indicator principle. At a constant pH, the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow for a "Negative" reaction to yellow-green and green to blue-green for a "Positive" reaction.

Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction in which $p .$ - diethylaminobenzaldehyde reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly acid medium. Colors range from light pink to bright magenta.

Nitrite: This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gramnegative bacteria in the urine. The nitrite reacts with $p$ -arsanilic acid to from a diazonium compound in an acid medium. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1,2,3,4- tetrahydrobenzo(h) quinolin to produce a pink color.

Leukocytes: This test is based on the action of esterase present in leukocytes, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative. The indoxyl ester liberated reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color.

# L. Clinical Performance Characteristics:

The clinical studies were performed at Point-of-Care sites using Teco Diagnostics' Uritek TC-101 and Urine Reagent Strips 10 versus Bayer's Clinitek Status with Multistix 10 SG. Clinical data were presented to evaluate clinical accuracy of results. Clinical study results indicate that the intended users were able to obtain comparable testing data when using the Uritek TC-101 with Urine Reagent Strips 10 and the legally marketable Bayer Clinitek Status with Multistix 10 SG.

# M. Conclusion:

The performance characteristics of the Uritek TC-101 with the Urine Reagent Strips 10 were verified by method comparison, precision, linearity, detection limit, specificity, shelf life, and stress studies. Testing results indicate that the Uritek TC-101 and Urine Reagent Strips 10 perform satisfactorily when used appropriately, as outlined in the package insert.

The clinical studies results demonstrate a substantial equivalency on performance between Teco Diagnostics' Uritek TC-101 with Urine Reagent Strips 10 and the predicate device, Bayer Clinitek Status with Multistix 10SG.
