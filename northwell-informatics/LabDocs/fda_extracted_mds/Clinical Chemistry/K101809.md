# Summary and Principle

This quality control product can be used as an objective judgment of the laboratory's procedures and personnel techniques. It is a valuable tool to assess good laboratory practices. Two levels of control are available to compare observations with expected ranges therefore assuring consistent performance of the testing systems within the clinical range.

# Intended Use

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.   
Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control is intended for use as an assayed control serum to mnor he precision  laboratory testing procedures for he analysis f AFP, CA1-3, CA19-9 CA125, CEA, Ferritin, HE4, PSA and Free PSA.

# Statement of Substantial Equivalence

The Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control is intended for use as a quantitative, assayed control serum to monitor the procedures used in the laboratory for testing the analytes listed in the lot specific assigned values sheet.

The Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control is substantially equivalent to the Lyphochek Tumor Marker Plus Control\*. Each of the devices are assayed quality control material and are used to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analytes listed in their respective package insert.

\*Note: For HE4, the Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control is substantially equivalent to the ARCHITECT HE4 Control Kit.

Dear Ms. Hall:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice

requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will llow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
