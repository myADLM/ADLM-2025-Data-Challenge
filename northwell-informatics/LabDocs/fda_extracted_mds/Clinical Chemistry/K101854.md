# E. Regulatory Information:

ADVIA 1650 Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 Reagent

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1345 Glucose test system.

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product Code: CFR, Hexokinase, Glucose

4.Panel: Clinical Chemistry

# F. Predicate Device:

ADVIA 1650 Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_ 3 reagent is substantially equivalent to the ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase II reagent cleared under k042015

# G. Device Description:

The ADVIA 1650 Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) method uses a twocomponent reagent. Sample is added to Reagent 1, which contains the buffer, ATP, and NAD. Absorbance readings of the sample in Reagent 1 are taken and are used to correct for interfering substances in the sample. Reagent 2 is added, which initiates the conversion of glucose and the development of absorbance at $3 4 0 / 4 1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ The difference between the absorbance in Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 is proportional to the glucose concentration.

# H. Intended Use:

For in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative detcrmination of glucose in human serum, plasma, urine and CSF on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system. Such measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, idiopathic hypoglycemia, and insulin overdose

Dear Ms. Gordon

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

I your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it xit found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply w c  c  o  t  t 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
