# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 kit consist of 5 levels of human CEA, each with the appropriate lyophilized level of human CEA antigen in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte CEA is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels. Level 1 contains no analyte. Sponsor recommends using Check levels 2, 3 and 4 for calibration verification only; and Check 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for verification of the

assay range only or verification of the assay range and calibration verification. Target values and approximate concentration target ranges are listed below:

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA staff – Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material.

# L. Test Principle:

Per sponsor: Calibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay systems based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. However, in instances where such a test procedure is required by certification agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification, these CalCheck 5 solutions provide an appropriate material for such testing.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): All testing and information for CalCkeck 5 were done on the modular Analytics E170, and on the Elecsys 2010. Traceability: st Elecsys CEA is standardized against the 1 IRP WHO Reference Standard 73/601 Value Assignment: The five levels of the CalCheck 5 kit are assigned based on the measuring

range of the assay. Samples from each level was run 1 time a day on 4 MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 and 4 Elecsys 2010 analyzers for a total of 2 days. The difference between the target and assigned value was less than $10 \%$ . A master calibration curve is generated on the E170 master calibration curve and used to calculate $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ from counts. The table below summarizes the Assigned Values and Ranges for Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 on the E170 :

Stability:

Stability studies were done on the Elecsys E170.

Open vial stability:

One Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys E170. The claimed reconstituted Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 is stable for 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

On Board Stability:

Not applicable

Accelerated stability & Real time stability:

One Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys E170. The test material was stored lyophilized at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks, stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate and compared.

Real-time stability study is ongoing. The shelf life stability is based on the accelerated stability study of the CalCheck 5 and the real-time stability studies of three-level CalCheck (because of the identical composition of the 3-level and 5-level CalChecks). The initial shelf life stability claim is 18 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Dilution study:

The CEA CalCheck 5 package insert instructs the customer to analyze diluted samples in the event CalCheck Levels 1 or 5 produce results that exceed the reportable measuring range of the assay. To demonstrate that the values are within the assay’s measuring range of $0 . 2 { - } 1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ after mixing, the following dilution study was performed: Check 1&2 and Check4 &5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in duplicate. Results of a dilution study are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Value after 1:1Dilution [ng/mL]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average 1:1Dilution [ng/mL]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>E170/e 601</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 1 + Check 2Check 1 + Check 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.52.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 4 + Check 5Check 4 + Check 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1026943</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>984</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2010/e 411</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 1 + Check 2Check 1 + Check 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.42.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 4 + Check 5Check 4 + Check 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>901873</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>887</td></tr></table>
