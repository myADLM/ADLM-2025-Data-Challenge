# Device Description

The FORA D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System consists of one monitor, test strip, control solution, and a pressure cuff. The proposed device has been designed, tested, and demonstrated to work together as a system to produce accurate blood glucose test results and blood pressure measurements.

The proposed device contains speaking function which offers step-by-step audio instructions to help users perform a glucose test or take a blood pressure measurement.

# 5. Intended Use FORA D40d for single patient use

The FORA D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, and upper arm. This system is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The FORA D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. This system should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, nor for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The FORA D40d Test Strips are for use with the FORA D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, and upper arm.

This system is also intended to be used to measure non-invasively the systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate of an adult individual at home. The blood pressure is measured by using an inflatable cuff wrapped around the arm.

This system contains speaking function, but is not intended for use by the visually impaired.

# FORA Wisdom D40d for multiple patients use

The FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, and upper arm. This system is intended for multiple-patient use in professional healthcare settings as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. This system is only used with single-use auto-disabling lancing devices.

The FORA Wisdom D4Od Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, nor for neonatal use. Alternative site testing such as the palm, forearm, and upper arm should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The FORA Wisdom D40d Test Strips are for use with the FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, and upper arm.

This system is also intended to be used to measure non-invasively the systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate of an adult individual at home. The blood pressure is measured by using an inflatable cuff wrapped around the arm.

This system contains speaking function, but is not intended for use by the visually impaired.

# 6Comparison to Predicate Device

For blood glucose, consumer study was performed to evaluate the accuracy at fingertip and alternative sites including palm, forearm and upper arm compared to YSl-2300. For blood pressure, a clinical study was performed compared to the reference method according to the requirements of ANSI/AAMI SP10.

The FORA D4Od and FORA Wisdom D4Od Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring Systems are substantialy equivalent to the predicate device, TD-3252 Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System (K091555).

# 7. Performance Studies

To evaluate the system accuracy of FORA D40d and FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System, the consumer study was performed according to ISO 15197 and other tests performed according to ANSl/AAMI SP10. Results show that the device met the requirements of ISO 15197 and ANSl/AAMI SP10, and is safe during the use. It is substantially equivalent to the predicate device with the same effectiveness and safety.

The proposed device met the requirements of IEC/EN 60601-1:1995, IEC/EN 60601-1-2:2001, EN 61326-1:2006, IEC/EN 61010-1:2001 and IEC/EN 61010-2-101:2002. It complies with Part 15 of FCC rules. Software validation was also performed to verify and validate the system works functionally.

# 8. Conclusion

The FORA D40d and FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring Systems demonstrate satisfactory performance and are suitable for its intended use. The FORA D40d and FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring Systems are substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Ko:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
