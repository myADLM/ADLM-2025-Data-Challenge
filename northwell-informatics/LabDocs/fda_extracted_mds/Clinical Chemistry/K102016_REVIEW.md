# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Value Assignment:

The value assignments for each lot of control are performed using three analyzers ( modular P, cobas c 501 and integra) from each analyzer family Integra/c111 and Hitachi/cobas. Full calibration using a master calibrator and at least three separate runs were performed on each analyzer. Each run used one or more replicates of the control as sample for each assay being assigned. The mean of all the runs was calculated for each assay and was used as the assigned control target value. The corresponding control range is calculated as the target value $\pm 3$ standard deviations (with the standard deviation being the value obtained from several target value determinations).

The concentrations and activities of the components are lot-specific. The exact target values are given in the value sheets provided with the finished device or electronically at the sponsor’s website.

# Traceability:

Roche Diagnostics maintains a set of Roche master calibrators for each assay that have values assigned that are traceable to the various standards, or in-house developed standards.

Traceability of the target values is given in the respective instructions for use of the system reagents.

# Stability:

The shelf-life was 25 months at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (closed vial) and 16 hours at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 6 days at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 29 days at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ (open vial/accelerated stability) were demonstrated through the following studies by the sponsor to support the stability claims stated in the labeling.

Closed Vial Stability (Real-time/Shelf-life stability)

PCCC1 and PCCC2 are stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 25 months. After 25 months, three replicates of test lot material are analyzed and the average value of $\%$ analyte recovery was compared to the reference material (stored at $- 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and fresh reconstituted). Percent recovery was also measured with at least two intermittent time periods, prior to 25 months. The data supports the shelf life claim 24 months at normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Opened Vial Stability

Data support that samples stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 25 months then keptfor 5 days at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and reconstituted according to the package insert directions and stored (at $1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 16 hours; at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 6 days and at $( - 1 5 ) - ( - 2 5 ) ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 29 days) were stable. Three replicates of test lot materials are analyzed and the average values for $\%$ analyte recovery was compared to the reference material (fresh reconstituted PCCC1 and PCCC2). These data respectively support the package insert claim of stability of the product at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } 1 2$ hours, at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 5 days and at (-15)–(-25) $^ \circ C 2 8$ days (when frozen once)
