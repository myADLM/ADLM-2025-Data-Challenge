# Device Description:

The ALRT Health-e-Connect System (HeC) is an internet based blood glucose monitoring system that allows healthcare providers and patients the opportunity to review, analyze and evluate the effcacy of a diabetes management program. It is expected that this functinality will significantly improve HbA1C levels in patients with diabetes.

Note there are no physical, electrical, biocompatibility or sterility specifications for-this device as it is software only. It performs two functions: it is a data management tool and a communication platform.

The Health-c-Connect System is comprised of a home based application, legally marketed peripherals (blood glucose meters) and a server.

The home based application software collects data from blood glucose meters and transmits the data over the home's existing inteet connection where t is uploade to the Healthe-Connect System's web-based servers.

The server is a web-based application that collects, range checks, stores and displays historical patient blood sugar levels. It also allows patients, healthcare providers, patient relatives and other healthcare providers involved in the case to send messages to each other and share patient information. This communication is retrospective and not a rcal- time alert or alarm. The Healthe-Connect System is a tool to monitor patients remotely and motivate them through notifications.

# Intended Use

The Health-e-Connect System is a remote, retrospectivc tool to supplement a patients' care. The Health-e-Connect System is intended to be a simple "store and forward" communications platform that allows clinicians and authorized users to access a patients' information for review and feedback. The Health-e-Connect System is a tool to monitor patients remotely and motivate them through notifications. The Health-e-Connect System is not intended to replace existing treatments or consultations, nor is it to be used as a substitute for a qualified healthcare provider's judgment or treatment plan. The Health-e-Connect System is not intended to act as an emergency response system.

# Indications for Use:

The Health-e-Connect System is intended for use in the home and clinical settings by people with diabetes and healthcare providers as an aid in the review, analysis and cvaluation of historical glucose test results and associated usage data in support of an effective diabetes management program.

Patient Population: Patient with diabetes

Environment of Use: Home and clinical environments

Contraindications: None

# Technology:

The Health-e-Connect System is a software based data processing system. The device operates on personal computers and across the internct via encrypted communications.

# Materials:

No patient contacting materials

# Performance Testing

The HeC was tcsted with 1 different meter models. The following tests were performcd as part of the verification.

# 510(k) Summary Page 3 of 5 7-Oct-11

# Bench Testing

Test: View Glucometer summary of a user Procedure: Correct Glucometer summary (checked against paper copy & calculations)

# Test: Procedure:

# Glucometer usage uploaded into the HEC

Take a blood test and check blood-sugar value on glucometer. Connect glucometer to HeC Desktop Programmer and upload. Check HeC recorded value.

# Test: Procedure:

Patient information and import data are not associated correctly Performed many uploads of the glucometer. For each upload, a log is created, manually chccked the log for the uploads.

# Test:

# Glucose analysis is flawed and the results are not correct in the HeC-RCS

Procedure:

The code which analyzes the glucometers values is checked thoroughly against other algorithms calculating the same statistics to verify accuracy.

# Non-clinical Testing:

A series of Usability / Human Factor studies were performed with lay users and healthcare providers. Overall 22 lay users and 2 HCP were involved. The Human Factor

# 510(k) Summary Page 4 of 5 7-Oct-11

Study (HFS) was intended to evaluate the usability of the Health-e-Connect (HeC) System, including aspects of user friendliness, design and so forth. The study was conducted by surveying users of the system that were able to evaluate such aspects as manual data entry, electronic data uploads, reports, messaging and other functions. Participants included patients with diabetes and caregivers.

# Clinical Testing:

Clinical testing was not performed to support this submission as the HeC is a data collection device only.

# Conclusions:

Bench testing: All meters passed the outlined tests.

Usability / Human Factors Study: Results of this HFS indicate that the HeC System is user friendly, is fast and easy to use and that users were able to successfully perform the various functions within the system.

Comparison to Predicates:

# Indications
