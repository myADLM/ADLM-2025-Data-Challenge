# Device Name

# Predicate device

The Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. We claim equivalency to the currently marketed Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck 5 (K100810) and the Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck (K003967).

# Device Description

The Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of equine serum in level 1 and human serum matrix for levels 2-5. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Intended use

The Elecsys CA 125 CalCheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration verification and for use in the verification of the assay range established by the Elecsys CA 125 II reagent on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers, for in vitro diagnostic use only.

# Comparison Table

The table below compares Elecsys CA 125 CalCheck 5 with the predicate devices, Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck 5 (K100810) and the CA 125 II CalCheck (K003967).

Please note that the use of two predicates has been utilized for this submission based on previous FDA feedback to several of the most recently FDA-cleared CalCheck 5 products. The first predicate shows that the CA 125 I1 CalCheck 5 is substantially equivalent to another CalCheck 5 product. The Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 is also substantially equivalent to the second predicate, CA 125 II CalCheck, with several key similarities, especially the analyte. The shaded fields indicate similar characteristics between the candidate device and a predicate device.

Dear Ms. French:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 1, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
