# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 set contains one lyophilized level of equine serum and four lyophilized levels of CA 125 II antigen in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the target concentrations. CalCheck Level 1 is free of analyte. Sponsor recommends using Check level 2, 3 and 4 for calibration verification only; and Check 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for verification of the assay range only or verification of the assay range and calibration verification. Target values and approximate concentration target ranges are listed below:

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: The sponsor claims the assayed value of each CalCheck level was standardized against the Enzymun-Test CA 125 II method. This assay was in turn calibrated against CA 125 II RIA from Fujirebio. Value assignment: For each Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 kit manufactured, value assignment for each level was tested once a day on two Modular Analytics E170 analyzers for a total of eight runs on two days. The Modular Analytics E170 master calibration curve was used to calculate $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ from counts. The assigned target value of each CalCheck is the median of the observed values. The assigned values and assigned range for lot that was used in the submission on the E170 are listed below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Target Value[U/mL]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Assigned Value[U/mL]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Assigned Range</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>31.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24.6 - 37.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2440</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1928−2952</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3870</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30574683</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4840</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3824 - 5856</td></tr></table>

Additionally, the same value assignment procedure was performed on the

Elecsys 2010 analyzers. The assigned values obtained on the Elecsys 2010 analyzers were compared to those obtained on the E170. Results showed that the values assigned to the E170 are valid for the Elecsys 2010.

The labeling states that obtained values should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific value sheets and that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

# Stability:

Stability studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims for the Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5.

Open vial stability:

One Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys E170. The test material was reconstituted and stored for 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (in an open vial). The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The recovery of test material was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The data support the claimed stability - Elecsys CA125 II CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

On-Board Stability:

Not applicable

Accelerated stability:

One Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys E170. The test material was stored lyophilized at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks (stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } $ ). After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The recovery of test material was calculated as a percent of the reference value.

Real time stability:

The real time stability is on-going. The test material is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Sample at time-points at 0, 13, 19 and 37 months will be tested in duplicate and the recovery value will be calculated by comparing to the unstressed reference value (stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ ).

The results from the Accelerated stability and on-going Real time stability support an initial shelf-life claim of 18 months when the Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 is stored under normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

c. Dilution Study:

A study is suggested in the package insert to analyze diluted samples in the event CalCheck level 1 or 5 produce results that exceed the reportable measuring range of the assay. To demonstrate that the values are within the assay’s measuring range of $0 . 6 \mathrm { \ : U / m L } - 5 0 0 0 \mathrm { \ : U / m L }$ , the dilution study was performed. Check 1&2 and Check 4&5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in duplicates. Results are summarized in the following table and both CalCheck dilution values are within the assay’s measuring range after dilution.
