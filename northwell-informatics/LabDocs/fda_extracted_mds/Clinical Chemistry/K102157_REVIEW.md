# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff – Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability and Value Assignment

Each level of the Elecsys PreciControl Multimarker is assigned analytespecific values with the respective Elecsys assay using master calibrators. The master calibrator for ACTH is traceable to an internal reference material based on gravimetry, for C-Peptide is traceable to NIBCS reference material, and for hGH and Insulin the master calibrators are traceable to respective WHO reference materials. The Elecsys PreciControl products are assayed and compared to these reference preparations and target values and ranges are assigned.

For lot-specific value assignment, each level of quality control is tested in duplicate on at least three Elecsys MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 / cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzers (master platform). The assigned value of each control level is defined as the median value obtained from at least six determinations (duplicate runs on at least three analyzers), with an assigned range calculated from the assigned value. Acceptance criteria including precision of control determinations and percent difference between assigned and target values must be met for lot value assignment.

To ensure the values assigned to the Elecsys PreciControl Multimarker on the master platform are transferrable to the additional instrument platforms, the same value assignment procedure is performed on the Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer and the assigned values are compared to those obtained on the master platform. The analyzer-toanalyzer variability must be less than $10 \%$ difference to meet acceptance criteria. The assigned value from the master platform is then valid on the Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer.

# Stability

As stability studies are not analyzer dependent, all stability studies were performed on the cobas e 601 / MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 immunoassay analyzer and can be applied to the Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 analyzer. An accelerated stability study was performed to simulate a shelf life of 15 months at normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Stability data supports this package insert claim and percent recoveries at 15 months meet the stated acceptance criteria of $90 { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of concentration based on unstressed material. A real-time stability study is ongoing.

Reconstituted control material is stable at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ for 72 hours. Stability data supports this package insert claim and percent recoveries at 72 hours meet the stated acceptance criteria of $90 { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of concentration based on unstressed material.

Reconstituted control material is stable frozen at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 31 days. Stability data supports this package insert claim and percent recoveries at 31 days meet the stated acceptance criteria of $90 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of concentration based on unstressed material.

Reconstituted control material is stable sitting on the analyzers at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5 hours. Stability data supports this package insert claim and percent recoveries at 5 hours meet the stated acceptance criteria of $90 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of concentration based on unstressed material.
