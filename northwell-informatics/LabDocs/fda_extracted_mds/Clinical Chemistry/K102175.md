Device Trade Name:

RapidVue® hCG Test

Common Name:

hCG pregnancy test

Predicate Device:

QuickVue One-Step hCG Urine Test (K020799)

Product Code

JHI

Device Classification/Name:

21 CFR 862.1155 / Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) Test System

The RapidVue hCG test is similar to other FDAcleared devices used for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for the early detection of pregnancy.

The Food and Drug Administration has classified test systems for the detection of pregnancy as Class II.

Intended Use:

The RapidVue hCG test is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) in urine for the early detection of pregnancy. The test is intended for use by health care professionals

Physiologic Basis of the Test:

Human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone produced by the placenta shortly after implantation. Since hCG is present in the urine of pregnant women, it is an excellent marker for confirming pregnancy.

# Device Description:

The RapidVue hCG test uses a monoclonal antibody specific to the beta subunit of hCG in a single-step technology to accurately detect hCG.

The Dipstick is dipped in urine. If hCG is present in the specimen at a level of 25 mlU/mL or greater, a pink-to-red Test (T) Line will appear along with a blue procedural Control (C) Line in the test result area. If hCG is present at lower levels, or not present in the specimen, only a blue procedural Control Line will appear in the test result area.

\*Note: The monoclonal antibodies used for the Test Line and the Indicator in the RapidVue hCG test are identical to those used in the predicate QuickVue One-Step hCG Urine test.The components that generate the Control Line are also identical.

# Summary of Performance Data:

Numerous analytical studies were undertaken to document the performance characteristics and the substantial equivalence of the RapidVue hCG test to the predicate device. These studies included the following:

1. Assay Sensitivity: to verify that the sensitivity of the RapidVue hCG test is consistent with QuickVue One-Step hCG Urine test.   
2. Prozone Effect: to verify that no prozone effect is observed with the RapidVue hCG test as is consistent with QuickVue One-Step hCG Urine test.   
3. Urinary pH: to verify that the RapidVue hCG test is not affected by variations in urinary pH.   
4. Procedural Flex Testing: to demonstrate the robustness of the RapidVue hCG test and its test procedure.   
5. Clinical Sample Testing: to verify that the accuracy of the RapidVue hCG test is consistent with QuickVue One-Step hCG Urine test using procured clinical urine samples.   
6. Physician Office Laboratory (POL) Reproducibility Study: to evaluate the performance of the RapidVue hCG test by physician office personnel.

# Conclusion:

The results of these studies demonstrate that the RapidVue hCG test is substantially equivalent with the predicate QuickVue One-Step hCG Urine test.

Dear Ms. Bodien:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf k )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
