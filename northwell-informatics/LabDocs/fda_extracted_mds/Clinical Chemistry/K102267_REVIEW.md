# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The sponsor claims traceability of ferritin used in this quality control set to National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC) reagent for Ferritin (human liver) 80/602. The Elecsys Ferritin assay was standardized against the Enzymun-Test Ferritin method.

# Value Assignment

For each Elecsys Ferritin CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, value assignment for each level of CalCheck was performed by duplicate runs on at least three Elecsys Modular Analytics E170/cobas e 601 analyzers. Additionally, the same value assignment procedure was performed on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411 analyzers. The assigned target value of each CalCheck is the median of the observed values. The labeling states that obtained values should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific value sheets and that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

# Stability

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Closed (unopened) vial shelf life of 2 years at the recommended storage temperature (2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) was demonstrated based on accelerated stability studies. Real-time closed-vial stability studies for the Elecsys Ferritin CalCheck 5 solutions are ongoing. Open vial stability of 4 hours was demonstrated at the recommended storage temperature of 20 to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Storage recommendations are provided in the labeling.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: The expected values are provided in the labeling for each specific lot.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports substantial equivalence decision.
