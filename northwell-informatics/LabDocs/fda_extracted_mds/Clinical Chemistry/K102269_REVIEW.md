All human material should be considered potentially infectious. All products derived from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A. However, as no testing method can rule out the potential risk of infection with absolute certainty, the material should be treated just as carefully as a patient specimen.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff – Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

# L. Test Principle:

Calibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay systems based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.   
However, in instances where such a test procedure is required by certification agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification, these CalCheck 5 solutions are used for such testing.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: This method has been standardized against the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ IRP WHO Reference Standard 75/502. Expected Values and Value Ranges For each Elecsys IgE CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are run in duplicate on at least three E170 analyzers. The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers) of the respective CalCheck. (i.e. Elecsys 2010 and E170). Pre-determined acceptance criteria for IgE recovery must be met for each control lot. The target value for each CalCheck is the median of the observed values. IgE expected values and value ranges are lot dependent and are listed in the lot-specific value sheet. Test results must fall within the range printed on the lot-specific value sheet. The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

# Stability Open-Vial Stability Studies

The on-test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The on-test material was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (in an open vial). The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The on-test recovery was calculated as a percentage of the reference value. The reconstituted vials are stable for four hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

# Accelerated Stability:

The on-test material was stored lyophilized (as supplied to the user) at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The on-test recovery was calculated as a percentage of the reference value. Accelerated stability testing supports the target shelf life claim of 18 months

# Real-Time Stability:

In the on-going real-time stability study, the Elecsys IgE CalCheck 5 test material is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The CalChecks are tested at $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ and at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device up to the planned shelf life plus one month.The manufacturer claims CalCheck 5 is stable until the expiration date printed on the vial when stored unopened at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Dilution Study:

To demonstrate that the values are within the assay’s measuring range of $0 . 1 0 0 - 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { \Pi U / m L }$ after mixing, the following dilution study was performed on Elecsys IgE CalCheck 5 Levels 1 and 5: Check 1 & Check 2 and Check 4 & Check 5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in two-fold determination. The average was then calculated.
