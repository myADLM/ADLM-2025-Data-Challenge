# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Integrated Cycler is a thermocycler that is capable of heating, cooling, mixing of sample and reagents, and real-time detection of flourophores set at four distinct wavelengths. Sensors on the instrument monitor the status of the primary functions of the system. The instrument comes in two power formats one for 110 V(MOL1001) and one at $2 2 0 \mathrm { V }$ (MOL1101).

# 2. Principles of Operation:

Extracted nucleic acid from clinical samples is pipetted into appropriate sample injection wells on the Universal Disc. The instrument utilizes disc media to contain and to process samples and real-time fluorometric detection to identify targets within the sample reaction wells. The instrument's operation parameters are controlled by the use of an external personal computer and associated software. The disc can process up to 96 independent samples.

# Thermal Control Functions

Heating is controlled by activating an optical light source until the desired temperature is reached. A 500 watt tungsten halogen bulb is mounted in an elliptical reflector and is controlled by a dimmer control to heat a portion of a rotating platform. The light source is located underneath the disc platen and causes warming of the outer ring of platen called the light ring. Cooling of the reaction chamber is achieved by activating an internal fan that draws in ambient air. Air is directed onto the light ring cooling the disc. The heating system is capable of reaching a maximum temperature of $9 9 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; and is capable of

maintaining the temperature within $\pm 0 . 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Heating can occur at a rate of ${ \ge } 5$ ${ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / \mathrm { s e c }$ and cooling occurs at a rate of ${ \ge } 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } /$ sec with an ambient temperature of $2 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Motor Functions

The motor that controls the motion of the disc platen can be operated in two modes dependent on the type of processing: velocity and position modes. Velocity mode is used for maintaining a constant velocity for heater/cooler control and data acquisition of the fluorescence reader. Position mode is used for precisely positioning the sample discs at known locations for laser valving.

# Microfluidics

The instrument mixes the reagents with the extracted sample by centrifugal force. The Universal Disc spins on the platen forcing the sample from the injection well to the sample reaction well on the perimeter of the Disc.

# Optical Subsystem

The optical subsystem of the Integrated Cycler performs two distinct functions. The primary function of the system is the detection of fluorescence in each of the four optical channels. An additional function of the subsystem, for future iterations of the disposable media, is the activation of specific valves located in the media using laser light. The Integrated Cycler uses fluorescence to quantify the amount of certain nucleic acid sequences in a sample. The measurement is performed by optical modules that are optimized for specific detection dyes determined by the spectral characteristics of the dyes. Each module contains a LED excitation source, filters, lenses and a fiber port. Fluorescence is collected at the fiber port and transmitted to a single photomultiplier detector. This design allows for optimized detection of up to four targets simultaneously. A high degree of flexibility is achieved by allowing users to interchange modules for other targets. The optic system is contained within a protective housing and is controlled by a gantry system which can move the optic system into place to control the sensing optics and laser valving optics. The sensing and valving optics are mounted on the gantry to allow the ability to sense and open valves over the entire area of the sample disc.
