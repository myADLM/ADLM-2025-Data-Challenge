Device Description

A.) Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a blood glucose meter, test strips, control solutions(Level 1, 2 and 3), lancing device, and commercially available sterilized lancets. This system utilizes amperometric method to generate a current. The size of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose presented in the sample, providing a quantitative measure of glucose level in whole blood.

B.) Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a blood glucose meter, test strips, control solutions(Level 1, 2 and 3) and single-use lancing devices. This system utilizes amperometric method to generate a current. The size of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose level presented in the sample, providing a quantitative measure of glucose level in whole blood.

# Intended Use

A.) Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) at home. It is used for quantitative measurement of glucose level in fresh capillary whole blood samples (from the finger, the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf and the thigh). The alternative site testing can be only used during steady-state blood glucose monitoring. The Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use by a single person and should not be shared. In addition, it is intended for use at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It should not be used for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes, nor for the testing of neonates.

The Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose meter and the Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose test strips. The Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose meter is used only with Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose test strips to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from finger tips, the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf and the thigh.

The Glucose Shepherd Control Solutions are for use with the Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

B.) Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). It is used for quantitative masurement glucose evel nfesh capily who blood amples  e finger, the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf and the thigh). The alternative site testing can be only used during steady-state blood glucose monitoring. The Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System may be used for multiple patients in a professional healthcare setting. It is intended for use as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. This system is only used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices. It should not be used for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes, for the testing of neonates, or for testing of arterial blood.

The Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose meter and the Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose test strips. The Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose meter is used only with Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose test strips to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from finger tips, the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf and the thigh.

The Glucose Shepherd Pro control solutions are for use with the Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

Dear Mr. Lai:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (rcporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will alow you to begin arketing yourdevice s descrbed in yur Sectn 0(k) premarke notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
