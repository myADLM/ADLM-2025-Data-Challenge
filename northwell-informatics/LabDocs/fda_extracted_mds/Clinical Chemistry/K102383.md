Intended Use

Intended use(s): See indication(s) for use below

# Indication(s) for use:

The microdot ® Home Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only), by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is intended for "single patient-home use" only and should not be shared. It should be used only for testing fresh capillary whole blood samples from a fingerstick or palm for glucose (sugar). Alternate site testing should be done only during steady-state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly). It is not intended for use on neonates or in the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus.

The system consists of the microdot ® Home Blood Glucose meter, microdot ® Hoe Test Strips and microdot ® Control solutions.

microdot ® Home Test Strips The microdot ® Home Test strips are intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from a fingerstick or palm.

Special conditions for use statements(s):

This product is intended for over-the-counter.

Fingerstick testing only (no palm testing) should be performed if blood glucose level is changing rapidly as follows:

Within 2 hours after a meal   
Within 2 hours after insulin dosing   
Patients with a history of hypoglycaemia, experiencing symptoms of low sugar or suffer from hypoglycaemic unawareness.

Special instrument requirements:

microdot® Home Blood Glucose Meter

Device Description:

The microdot® Home Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the microdot® Home Blood Glucose Meter, microdot® Home Test Strips, microdot® Control Solutions and a commercially available (510(k) cleared) lancing device and lancets. A clear cap is provided with the lancing device for alternate site testing on the palm. microdo® Home Blood Glucose Monitoring System is for a single patient use only. The meter and lancing device must not be shared with anyone.

microdot® Home is an auto code system. The meter turns on upon insertion of the strip, a blood sample from the finger or palm is applied to the test strip and after 10 seconds, the plasma glucose result is displayed on the screen in mg/dL only.

microdo® Home Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent in form, firmware, fundamental scientific technology and specifications as the predicate system, microdo® Xtra Blood Glucose Monitoring System. It relies on quantitativ electrochemical biosensor technology to measure current generated on disposable test strips.

The strip remains unchanged since the last submission approval, microdot® Xtra Blood Glucose Monitoring System (k083273). The Test Strip manufacturing and performance characteristics are unchanged. The test strips are designed to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary blood from the fingertip by persons with diabetes.

# Standard/Guidance Document referenced (if applicable):

ISO15197:2003: in vitro diagnostic test systems- requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self testing in managing diabetes mellitus (Section 8: User Performance)

Test Principle

The test is based on the enzymatic conversion of glucose in the sample to gluconolactone, with concomitant reduction of the enzyme cofactor NAD\* to NADH. The NADH is re-oxidised to NAD\* by the mediator compound which in turn becomes reduced; re-oxidation of the mediator by the meter induces a micro current to flow, and the size of this micro current is directly proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. Unlike PQQ dependent Glucose Dehydrogenase, the NAD-dependent Glucose Dehydrogenase enzyme used in the microdot® Home test strips is specific to glucose and has no interference from galactose and maltose.

Alternate Site Testing at Palm

A consumer study was performed with 152 diabetics testing themselves both at finger and alternate site and healthcare professionals testing at finger only to see if the results obtained at the alternate site is comparable with the finger. The diabetics obtained the samples and carried out the tests using the instructions provided. The samples ranged from 48 to 367 mg/dL. The palm results were comparable to finger results.

# Disinfection Studies

Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant wipes with Bleach with EPA registration # 56392-8 was validated demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B virus. It was demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device for a minimum of 375 cycles equivalent to a pre-clean and disinfection cycle of once per week for 5 years for a single patient use only meter.

# Conclusion

The study supports substantial equivalence to a predicate device and the addition of palm testing as an alternate testing site for blood glucose testing.
