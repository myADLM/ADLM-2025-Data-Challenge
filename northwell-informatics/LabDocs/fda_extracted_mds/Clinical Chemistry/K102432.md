# DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE

The 25-hydroxy (25-OH) Vitamin D assay is based on the principle of $\mathfrak { Q }$ -complementation of the enzyme $\beta$ -galactosidase and the competition between an enzyme donor-25-OH Vitamin D conjugate, Vitamin D binding protein and the 25-OH Vitamin D content of a serum sample. Samples with higher 25-OH Vitamin D concentrations produce higher $\beta$ -galactosidase activities and vice versa. Chlorophenol red- $\beta$ -D- galactopyranoside (CPRG) is used as the enzyme substrate and the accumulation of the reaction's product (chlorophenol red) is monitored at $5 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ The 25-OH Vitamin D concentration of a patient sample is proportional to the measured $\beta$ -galactosidase activity. The assay consists of a sample extraction step during which Vitamin D is irreversibly dissociated from its serum transporter. Extracted samples are then analyzed on a microplate reader after the sequential addition of three reagents.

25-OH Vitamin D assay calibrator set is intended for use with the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay kit only. Six calibration levels are needed for each run. Calibrators are treated exactly the same as patient samples.

25-OH Vitamin D assay 2-point control set is intended for use with the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay kit only. Controls are treated exactly the same as patient samples. The quality controls assist laboratory users in verification steps ensuring that the assay reagents are functioning correctly. Users are instructed to verify the calibration curve with the controls and run controls each time a new lot of reagents are received.

# INDICATIONS FOR USE

# PERFORMANCE TESTING SUMMARIES

# Precision Study

Acceptance Criteria: Precision: $C V \leq 1 0 \%$

The precision of the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D Microplate Assay is evaluated according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A guideline. Acceptance Criteria: Precision: $C V \leq 1 0 \%$ .

Seven precision levels were used: three serum controls (containing 21.5 ng/mL, 37.0 ng/mL and 60.8 ng/mL) and four serum samples. Two samples correspond to deficient patients (19.0 ng/mL and 19.4 ng/mL), one sample corresponds to a near cut-off concentration (36.4 ng/mL) and one sample corresponds to an optimum level $( 4 3 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ .

Furthermore, to test the performance of the assay at the limits of the dynamic range, a severely deficient patient $( 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ and a very high sample $\mathbf { \hat { \Pi } } ^ { \mathrm { 1 0 1 . 2 ~ n g / m L } } ,$ were subjected to the same precision studies.

The mean value (Mean), standard deviation, within-run imprecision and total imprecision are calculated and summarized in the following tables:

# Linearity/Reportable Range

To establish the linearity of the assay, study design was used based on the CLSI protocol EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: a Statistical Approach: Approved Guideline.

Eleven levels of linearity were prepared by diluting a serum sample containing 130 ng/mL of 25- OH Vitamin D with a Vitamin D Diluent (Phosphate Buffer Saline supplemented with $9 \%$ of Bovine Serum Albumin). Linearity levels were prepared according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP6-A. The samples prepared were tested with the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay, in triplicates. The results were processed using the EP Evaluator Software (Version 8.0) parameterized to an allowable systematic error of 10.8%. The linearity range was found to be $5 . 9 - 1 2 0 . 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# LoB/LoD/LoQ

The Limit of Blank (LoB), the Limit of Detection (LoD) and the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay on microplate were determined according to CLSI EP17- A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. The following are the limits determined with the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay method:

$$
{ \begin{array} { r l } & { { \mathrm { L o B } } = 1 . 0 ~ { \mathrm { n g / m L } } } \\ & { { \mathrm { L o D } } = 3 . 6 ~ { \mathrm { n g / m L } } } \\ & { { \mathrm { L o Q } } = 5 . 9 ~ { \mathrm { n g / m L } } } \end{array} }
$$

# Comparison Studies

# Method Comparison

Human serum samples were tested with the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay and the obtained results were compared to the predicate method. A total of 80 samples (ranging from 7.7 to 113.8 $\mathfrak { n g / \mathfrak { m L } }$ of 25-OH Vitamin D) were tested in both assays. The above described accuracy study showed that the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D Microplate Assay results correlated well with predicate method with a correlation coefficient of 0.936 with a slope of 1.039 and -2.469 intercept.

# Matrix Comparison

26 samples were used in a comparison study between serum and Li-Heparin plasma. Linear regression of the "Serum versus Li-Heparin plasma" data yielded the following results: $\mathrm { y } = \mathrm { 0 } . 9 9 2 \mathrm { x } -$ 0.173 and $\mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 6$ .

55 samples were used in a comparison study between serum and K3-EDTA plasma. Linear regression of the "Serum versus K3-EDTA plasma" data yielded the following results: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 0 8 \mathrm { x }$ EPY $\div 1 . 7 4 9$ and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 1$ .

# Reference Range Study

To determine a reference range for the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D microplate assay, the 25-OH Vitamin D serum concentrations of a US population of 150 apparently healthy individuals were measured with the Diazyme method. Thirty (30) samples from Pennsylvania (Northern U.S.) were collected from an FDA Licensed Donor Center with informed consent through Dx Biosamples. Sixty (60) samples from Tennessee (Central U.S.) and sixty (60) samples from Texas (Southern U.S.) were collected according to an IRB approved protocol by ProMedDx, LLC.

All participating individuals met the following inclusion conditions:

The age of all individuals was within the 21-90 years old range. Individuals were from three different geographical locations: 30 from Pennsylvania (Northern US), 60 from Tennessee (Central US) and 60 from Texas (Southern US). All samples were collected during the months of October and November 2010 (fall season). The studied population consisted of 63 light skin individuals (42%) and 87 dark skin individuals $( 5 8 \% )$ .

148 individuals $( 9 8 . 6 \% )$ did not take any artificial Vitamin D supplements. 2 individuals $( 1 . 4 \% )$ did take some Vitamin D supplements but did not exceed the dose of 2000 IU. All 150 individuals did not have any family history of parathyroid or calcium regulatory disease.   
All 150 individuals did not have any history of kidney disease, GI disease, liver disease, calcium-levels related disease, thyroid disease, parathyroid disease, calcium related disease, seizures, chronic disease or bariatric surgery.   
All 150 individuals were not currently taking any medications that are known to affect absorption or catabolism of Vitamin D (including cholesterol absorption inhibitors such as Vytorin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , InegyTM or Zetia; anticonvulsants such as Neurontin, Depakine $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Trileptal; glucocorticoids such as Cortisol, Prednisone and Dexamethasone; HAART (AIDS treatment) or antirejection medications.

Analysis of the reference range study data yielded the following results:

• Lowest 25-OH Vitamin D concentration: $9 . 9 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Highest 25-OH Vitamin D concentration: $6 5 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .   
• Median 25-OH Vitamin D concentration: $2 1 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Observed range (2.5th to 97.5th percentile): 11.3 to $4 1 . 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .
