# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

• CLSI Guideline EP5-A2 • CLSI Guideline EP6-A • CLSI Guideline EP7-A2 • CLSI Guideline EP17-A

# L. Test Principle:

The assay consists of a sample extraction step during which Vitamin D is irreversibly dissociated from its serum transporter. Extracted samples are then analyzed on a microplate reader after the sequential addition of three reagents. The assay is based on the principle of $\alpha$ -complementation of the enzyme $\beta$ -galactosidase and the competition between an enzyme donor-25-hydroxy Vitamin D conjugate, Vitamin D binding protein and the 25-hydroxy Vitamin D content of a serum sample. The 25-hydroxy Vitamin D concentration of a patient sample is proportional to $\beta$ -galactosidase activity measured by absorbance at $5 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Study Protocol:

Two replicates of each of 4 pooled human serum samples (with or without spike) and 5 patient serum samples were tested on 2 separate occasions per day for 10 different days using 2 lots of reagents. The spiked samples were allowed to mix gently at $4 \mathrm { ^ { o } C }$ for 18 hours to ensure that all spiked 25-OH Vitamin D3 is captured by the serum transporter

VDBP. Samples ranged in value from $7 . 8 – 1 0 1 . 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Mean, within-run CV and total precision CV are summarized in the table below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

# Study Protocol:

Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. Samples were prepared by diluting a high patient sample with a sample diluent to obtain eleven concentrations across the measuring range, ranging from 0 to $1 3 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The resulting mean concentrations of each sample were compared to predicted concentrations and yielded a linear regression of $\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 2 1 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 0$ .

# Conclusion:

Based on the results of the linearity study and Limit of detection study, the sponsor claimed that the assay is linear from 5.9 to $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability and value assignment:

Calibrators

The master calibrator batch stock was prepared in house gravimetrically in DMSO. Value assignment of stocks is made by UV absorbance spectrometry calibrated with NIST SRM 935a, based on NIST recommended molar extinction coefficients. The DMSO stock of 25-OH Vitamin D3 was used to build calibration levels by dilution into pooled human serum.

Initial value for calibrators is assigned using the predicate assay. Subsequently, patient serum samples (at least 20) are tested with the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay reagents and calibrators and compared to the values obtained using the predicate assay. The final calibrators values are then assigned by adjusting their initial values to meet the following acceptance criteria for the two-method comparison: Slope $= 1 . 0 \pm$ $) . 1 ; \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } \ge 0 . 9$ . Finally, calibrator value assignment was verified by measuring the 25-

OH Vitamin D content of standard control level 1 and standard control level 2, provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST SRM 972).

# Controls

Normal $( > 3 2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ ) and Abnormal $( < 3 1 . 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) 25-OH Vitamin D controls prepared in human serum are tested with released Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D microplate kits, in 12 replicates, in three runs. The mean obtained values are assigned as control values. The controls are labeled with the assigned values as mean $\pm 2 5 \%$ .

# Stability:

Shelf-life Stability:

Real-time testing at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and accelerated testing at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ were conducted for the control materials and the calibrators. The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The predicted shelf-life, based on results of accelerated testing at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ , is at least 12 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the control materials and the calibrators. Real-time stability testing is on-going to support the predicted shelf-life of 12 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C }$ .

• Open-Vial Stability:

The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria to determine open-vial stability of the control materials and the calibrators have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay reconstituted reagents R1, R2, R3 and thawed calibrators and controls are stable for at least 11 days when stored at 2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Sample Stability:

Stability of samples stored at different conditions was evaluated. Two sample levels were prepared by spiking freshly drawn serum or EDTA plasma with 25-OH Vitamin D. Three aliquots of each sample were processed immediately and analyzed within one hour of processing. Results from these aliquots were used as the basis for comparison to samples that were stored for various time periods and at various storage conditions before processing. Each sample aliquot was measured in duplicates.

Based on results summarized in the below table, the sponsor made the following recommendation in the labeling: “the specimens may be refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for two weeks. For long term storage, they can be stored at ${ \bf - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ . Avoid repeated freezethaw cycles.”

# d. Detection limit:

For LoB determination, saline supplemented with $9 \%$ Bovine Serum Albumin was measured in three independent runs with 20 replicates per run giving 100 determinations in total. The LoB is calculated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest values for the blanks. The LoB claim is $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

For LoD determination, five low serum samples were measured in 3 independent runs with 4 replicates per run. The LoD is defined as $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + ( 1 . 6 4 5 ^ { \ast } \mathrm { S T D E V }$ of Low samples). The five LoD samples were made by diluting 5 commercial serum samples 1:100 with saline supplemented with $9 \%$ Bovine Serum Albumin. The LoD claim is 3.6 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

For LoQ determination, five low samples were tested. For each sample, 40 replicates were obtained from at least 5 independent runs. The level of imprecision used to accept the LoQ was within $20 \%$ . The LoQ claim is $5 . 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The sponsor claimed that the assay has a measuring range from 5.9 to $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference

To determine the level of interference from the substances normally present in serum, the sponsor spiked each of the substances at different concentrations into each of the two unaltered patient serum samples (with $1 8 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $6 5 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ 25-OH D levels). The sponsor defines no significant interference as ${ < } 1 0$ difference between the spiked and the control samples. The interference substances examined and their concentrations tested are listed in the following table:

The sponsor indicates in the labeling that the assay’s results were not significantly affected by the presence of the following substances normally present in the serum:

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Interference</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Concentration</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ascorbic Acid</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10 mM</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Bilirubin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Bilirubin Conjugate</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Triglyceride</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">500 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hemoglobin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

The sponsor states the following in their labeling: “Do not use hemolysed samples.”

Cross-Reactivity

Study Protocol:

To estimate the cross-reactivity of various Vitamin D metabolites with 25-OH Vitamin D3, six identical serum aliquots $\mathrm { ( 1 0 ~ m L ) }$ were each spiked with one of the cross-reactant listed below, to a final concentration of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Cross-reactants stock solutions were made with $100 \%$ DMSO. A seventh serum aliquot of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ was spiked with $100 \%$ DMSO (devoid of Vitamin D) and served as a negative control. All 7 spiked sera were then quantified in quadruplicates. $\%$ Cross-reactivity was calculated using the following the equation:

$\%$ Cross-reactivity $=$ Recovery of cross-reactant spiked sample $\textbf { x } 1 0 0$ Recovery of 25-OH Vitamin D3 spiked sample

Recovery $=$ Measured Vitamin D concentration from spiked sample – Measured Vitamin D concentration from negative control

# Conclusion:

Based on the results summarized in the below table, the sponsor concluded that the assay did not significantly cross react with Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, 1,25-OH vitamin D3, and 1,25-OH Vitamin D2. The assay recovers both 25-OH Vitamin D3 and 25-OH vitamin D2.
