# Next Generation Uric Acid (k102568) Response Attachment H - 510(k) Summary

# Description of Device:

The Uric Acid assay is an in vitro diagnostic assay for use on the ARCHITECT c8000 System for the quantitative determination of uric acid in human serum, plasma, or urine using a uricase methodology. The Uric Acid assay is a two-part reaction. Uric acid is oxidized to allantoin by uricase with the production of hydrogen peroxide (H202). The H2O2 reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) and N-(3-sulfopropyl)-3-methoxy-5- methylanaline (HMMPS) in the presence of peroxidase (POD) to yield a quinoneimine dye. The resulting change in absorbance at $6 0 4 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ is proportional to the uric acid concentration in the sample.

The two-part (R1/R2) configuration of this assay allows reduction of interference from ascorbic acid by inclusion of ascorbic oxidase in the R1 portion of the assay.

Uric acid $+ \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } + 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ EPY Uricase Allantoin + CO2 + HO2 POD . H2O2 + 4-AAP + HMMPS Quinoneimine Dye

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The Uric Acid assay uses a uricase methodology for the quantitative determination of uric acid in human serum, plasma, or urine. The Abbott On-Market Uric Acid assay also uses a uricase methodology for the quantitative measurement of uric acid in human serum, plasma, or urine.

# Summary of Non-Clinical Performance:

The Uric Acid assay is substantially equivalent to the Abbott On-Market Uric Acid assay. Both assays yield similar performance characteristics as demonstrated in the non-clinical performance data in this 510(k) submission.

Dear Ms. Morris:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
