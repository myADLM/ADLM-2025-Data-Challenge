# I. Device Description:

The Audit™ MicroCV ™ Cardiac Markers Linearity Set Cardiac Markers Linearity Set MicroCV Cardiac Markers Linearity Set is a 5 level quality control solution set that contains CKMB, Myoglobin, and TnI analytes as the measurand. It is used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range and reportable range of CKMB, Myoglobin, and TnI analytes. Level A is near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit of instruments. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

Because this product is of human origin, it should be handled as though capable of transmitting infectious diseases. Each serum, plasma or whole blood donor unit used in the preparation of this material was tested by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved methods and found to be negative for antibodies to HIV and HCV and nonreactive for HBSAg. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that HIV, Hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus or other infectious agents are absent, this material should be handled as though capable of transmitting infectious diseases. This product may also contain other human source material for which there is no approved test.

# K. Standard/ Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was performed by measuring multiple replicates of each analyte on a Siemens Centaur XP analyzer. The mean concentration values of each level were plotted (concentration value vs. assigned level) and linear regression values were obtained.

CKMB: y=56.095x-55.705, $R 2 = 0 . 9 9 9 1$ Myoglobin: $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 8 8 . 8 9 \mathrm { x } { - } 1 6 6 . 4 1$ , $\mathrm { R } 2 { = } . 9 9 9 8$ Troponin: y=10.995x-11.297, ${ \mathrm { R } } 2 { = } 0 . 9 9 7 3$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The assigned values of Cardiac Markers quality control material are traceable to an internal standard manufactured using highly purified material.

# Stability:

All stability tests were performed with Siemens reagents on a Centaur XP instrument. Real-time studies are ongoing.

Accelerated Stability: Accelerated stability was performed to predict the product shelf life. Three vials of each level were stressed at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 48 days to predict 18 months stability when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Vials were tested according to “destructive testing.” The accelerated studies are supported by on-going real-time stability studies. The percent loss is calculated compared to Day Zero values and the product is considered stable when the loss reported is $\leq 1 0 \%$ loss. The results showed less than $a \pm 1 0 \%$ difference from the day zero results. The claimed shelflife stability is 18 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Open Vial Stability: Open vial stability was performed to determine the viability of the product during the course of normal use. Four vials of each level were reconstituted, stored for five days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested using “destructive testing.”

The percent loss is calculated compared to Day Zero values and the product is considered stable when the loss reported is $\leq 1 0 \%$ loss. The results showed less than $a \pm 1 0 \%$ difference from the day zero results. The claimed open vial stability is 5 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Value Assignment:

Value assignment was performed by one set of reagent for CKMB, Myoglobin and Troponin I analytes. Each analyte was measured seven times (seven separate vials) and the mean value of each was used to establish target concentration values at each level. The instrument (Centaur XP) was calibrated using Siemens calibrators and the calibration was verified by using Siemens control materials.
