# 4. Description of the Device

# SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit - 60 Plate

Astoria-Pacific Part No. 81-4000-60K Galactose-l-phosphate uridyl transferase test system

KIT CONTENTS:

Substrate Color Reagent Stock Standard Tris Buffer

Four enzyme mediated reactions are employed in the determination of GALT activity. The GALT enzyme catalyzes the conversion of galactose-1-phosphate to glucose-1- phosphate and concurrently the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose. Then, glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. Next, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of NADP to NADPH, catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Finally, a tetrazolium salt, catalyzed by diaphorase, reacts with the NADPH to form the product that is measured to yield GALT activity.

GALT activity is determined by measuring the colored formazan produced by the addition of the color reagent to the incubated blood/substrate mixture.

Patient samples of whole blood collected on standardized filter paper are placed into the wells of a standard 96 well microplate. A buffered enzyme mixture is added to each well and the plate is incubated at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 120 minutes on a plate shaker/incubator. Following incubation, an aliquot of the mixture from each well is transferred to the corresponding wells on a clean 96 well microplate. Color reagent is added to each well, the color is developed over the course of 10 minutes, and the absorbance of each sample is

determined on the plate reader. A blank absorbance reading is made prior to the addition of the color reagent to correct for endogenous sample color.

The color developed is proportional (1:1) to the GALT activity in the sample. A standard curve prepared from a stock NADH solution is used to quantitate the results. Results are expressed as units of GALT enzyme activity per gram of hemoglobin or $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { g } \mathrm { H } \mathrm { b }$ A unit is defined as the quantity of GALT enzyme that catalyzes the formation of one micromole of UDP-galactose per minute at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# 5. Statement of Intended Use

The SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit is for the quantitative determination of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, EC 2.7.7.12 (GALT), activity in whole blood saturated filter paper disks, using a microplate absorbance reader. Measurements of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase are used primarily in the diagnosis and treatment of the hereditary disease galactosemia. This method is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid in newborn screening for decreased levels of GALT enzyme activity, and not for monitoring purposes.

The SPOTCHECK Pro is used for automated sample processing in the application of in vitro diagnostic assays. Specimens containing patient bodily substances are introduced and analyzed in microtiter plates using qualitative/quantitative determination through absorbance measurements.

These devices are intended for use by trained, qualified laboratory personnel.

# 6. Summary of the Technological Characteristics of the Device

# DEVICE COMPARISON

The most significant difference between the SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit and the predicate device is the use of a calibration curve with the SPOTCHECK Kit to quantify results. Additionally, the SPOTCHECK Kit is also intended for use on automated platforms. Both the proposed and predicate devices use approximately the same reagent formulation and both use the same technology (spectrophotometric microplate reader) to determine GALT activity.

Neonatal patient dried blood specimens are punched into microplate wells, eluted and incubated with approximately the same substrate and buffer system on the SPOTCHECK Kit as on the predicate device. On the SPOTCHECK Kit, the tetrazolium salt (MTT) is not introduced into the reagent scheme until the final chemical reaction, whereas on the predicate device the MTT is included in the incubation substrate at the start of the procedure. The final step in the reaction, the formation of the colored formazan, is the same in both devices.

The SPOTCHECK Kit has two additional enzymes in the incubation substrate that are not included on the predicate device. Galactose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and phosphoglucomutase (PGluM) are normally present in clinical specimens, but may become damaged or destroyed if samples are exposed to excess heat or moisture during handling or if samples are stored at room temperature or above for extended periods of time. The two additional enzymes are included so that samples with degradation of G6PD or PGluM are not incorrectly classified as having deficient GALT activity.

# LINEARITY

The assay is non-linear $2 ^ { \mathfrak { n } \mathfrak { d } }$ order regression) in the range of 0.25 to $1 5 \mathrm { U / g H b }$ .This correlation was confirmed by adherence to CLSI EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. The calibration curve, established by the use of NADH standards, conforms to a $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ order regression from 0 to $1 5 \mathrm { U } / \xi \mathrm { H } \ b$ Results $> 1 5 \mathrm { U / g }$ Hb are reported as such.

# ANALYTICAL SENSITIVITY

An overall analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined by adhering to CLSI EP17- A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline. The limit of detection (LoD), defined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected (although perhaps not accurately quantifiable), is $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { g }$ Hb and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) is $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { g }$ Hb. The LoD is determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI EP1 7-A protocol and with proportions of false positives $( { \mathfrak { a } } )$ less than $0 . 3 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $0 . 3 \%$ , based on 300 measurements, consisting of 60 blank and 240 low-level samples; limit of blank $( \mathrm { L o B } ) =$ $0 . 0 8 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { g }$ Hb. The total error (TE, 3xSD) is less than the goal of $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { U / g } ~ \mathrm { H b }$ , assuming that there is no bias due to the unavailability of standard reference materials. Therefore, according to the guidelines in CLSI EP17-A, the $\mathtt { L o D } = \mathtt { L o Q }$ However, a functional LoQ of $0 . 3 ~ [ J / \underline { { \mathsf { g } } }$ Hb was established using a criterion of $\yen 20 \%$ total imprecision at the LoQ. Neonatal specimens with reported concentrations $< 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { U } / \varrho$ Hb are reported as such, and can be presumed positive for galactosemia.

# AUTOMATED and MANUAL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON

A study was performed to compare the SPOTCHECK GALT Reagent Kit processed using the SPOTCHECK Pro automated platform (configured to precisely automate the manual steps) against the manual method. Newborn patient dried blood spot samples $\mathtt { ( n = }$ 128), dried blood spot controls manufactured to mimic newborn specimens, as well as dried specimens consisting of mixed adult blood were analyzed using both manual processing and the SPOTCHECK Pro. A total of 216 samples were analyzed using singlicate measurements for both devices. To reduce sources of error not attributed to the different approaches, the same reagent preparations were used, and individual samples were punched and analyzed using each process on the same day. The study was performed over three days.

This study confirms that manual and automated processing can be expected to provide similar results in screening patients for GALT deficiency.

If manual processing of the reagent kit is intended for use as backup for automated analysis, screening equivalence between the processing methods should be confirmed.

# EXPECTED VALUES and DETERMINATION of CLINICAL CUTOFF

An exemplary normal range was established by analyzing 1752 routine samples and 53 known GALT deficient samples (controls, retrospective galactosemic neonates, and galactosemic non-neonates) at a state screening laboratory using the SPOTCHECK Kit (automated on the SPOTCHECK Pro). The same specimens were analyzed using the predicate device.

Statistics include only results within measuring range of both devices.

Specimens known deficient in GALT yielded results typically below one or both devices' limits of quantitation (49 of 53).

Specimens with results equal to or below the 0.5 and 0.25 percentiles were classified as deficient in GALT activity, or presumptive positive for galactosemia, and require followup testing according to institutional, local, state, regional, and/or national guidelines or regulations. Using the same criteria, cutoffs were very similar to the values for presumptive positive and normal GALT activity using the predicate device.

Each laboratory must determine its range of normal and deficient levels of GALT activity, based on its patient population and analytical variables.

# CLASSIFICATION of SAMPLES

The performance of the SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit was evaluated against the performance of the predicate device according to CLSI EP9-A2: Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline — Second Edition. Patient samples as well as dried blood spot control samples were used in this study.

# Screening Using Manual Processing

An internal study was performed for manual comparison to the predicate device. Newborn patient dried blood spot samples ${ \bf \tilde { n } = 2 4 7 \times }$ , dried blood spot controls with newborn hematocrit, and dried specimens consisting of mixed adult blood were analyzed using both the SPOTCHECK Kit and the predicate device. A total of 292 samples were analyzed using singlicate measurements for both devices. A population of specimens that provided a large number of low GALT activity results was analyzed to ensure a high number of relevant screening classification comparisons.

The SPOTCHECK GALT in vitro diagnostic kit demonstrated a high degree of correlation to specimens classified positive by the predicate device. Additionally, 10 specimens known to be deficient in GALT activity (analyzed in an unbiased manner) were correctly classified.

This evaluation complements the study demonstrating equivalent performance between manual and automated processing. Combined, they demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the new GALT screening method, using manual or automated specimen analysis.

# PRECISION PERFORMANCE

Within-run and total precision for the SPOTCHECK Kit were determined according to CLSI EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline — Second Edition. Samples at 4 different levels of GALT activity were analyzed using 16 replicates on 1 run per day for 5 days (2 distinct calibration curves on 2 plates); a total of 80 data points at each level were collected. Within-run and total precision using the predicate device for normal GALT activity levels was determined by analyzing samples in duplicate during 10 separate runs (data reported below was copied from product insert). The method used tò determine precision of deficient and partial activity GALT samples in the predicate device was not stated.

# Contributions from Hematocrit

To determine any possible effects on the performance of the Astoria-Pacific, Inc. SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent due to varying blood hematocrit, three blood spot samples were manufactured, one with deficient GALT, one near the clinical cutoff, and one with normal GALT. Within each of the three blood spot samples, three different levels of hematocrit $( 4 5 \%$ $5 5 \%$ and $6 5 \%$ ) were achieved by adjusting the quantity of red blood cells prior to spotting on blood spot collection paper.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hematocrit %</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Deficient (n = 6)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Near Cutoff (n = 6)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal (n = 6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>45</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.43 U/g Hb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4 U/g Hb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.4 U/g Hb</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.55 U/g Hb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.7 U/g Hb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.9 U/g Hb</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>65</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.72 U/g Hb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.3 U/g Hb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.3 U/g Hb</td></tr></table>

GALT activity resides in the red blood cells, so it is expected that varying hematocrit will lead to varying GALT response. Samples with lower hematocrit levels had lower GALT activity and samples with higher hematocrit levels had GALT activity. Differences in hematocrit had a statistically significant effect on samples with low GALT activity, however there is no indication that a sample deficient in GALT activity would be misclassified as normal (false negative) due to varying hematocrit levels.

# 7. Determination of Substantial Equivalency

Based on the performance characteristics and comparison data, the SPOTCHECK Kit is safe, effective, and substantially equivalent to the legally-marketed predicate device. The indications for use are essentially the same for the SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit and the predicate device. Technological characteristics are very similar to the predicate device and there is sufficient evidence that demonstrates that the differences do not adversely affect the safety and effectiveness of the SPOTCHECK Kit.
