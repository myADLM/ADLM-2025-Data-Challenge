# L. Test Principle:

AST catalyzes the transfer of amino group from aspartate to oxoglutarate during the formation of glutamate and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by malate dehydrogenase (MHD). During this conversion, an equivalent amount of NADH is oxidized to NAD. The resulting decrease in absorbance at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ is directly proportional to the activity of AST in serum.

ISE measurements are based on the potentiometric Nernst Equation principle. Sample is diluted with a diluent and aspirated into ion-selective electrodes. The measured potential difference between the reference electrode and the ion specific electrodes is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the measured ions.

The ELITech Selectra ProM is based on the colorimetric principle and Lambert Beer’s law which relates the absorption of light to the properties of the material through which light is traveling. Sample that contains the analyte being measured is accurately dispensed into an optical clear cuvette and mixed with accurately dispensed reagent. The analyte in the sample will react with the reagent and a change in color will occur. The change in color is directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

# ELITECH Clinical Systems AST/GOT $\mathbf { 4 + 1 }$ SL

Linearity across the assay range was determined by testing two pools of patient serum, one at a low concentration $( 9 . 9 \mathrm { U / L } )$ ) and one at a high concentration (247.9

U/L). The low sample was prepared by diluting the serum sample pool with saline and the high sample was prepared by spiking the serum sample pool. The high and low samples were mixed to produce 9 intermediate samples. All samples were assayed in triplicate. Data was analyzed using $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } } , 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ , and $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order least square regressions according to CLSI Protocol EP6-A. The difference in predicted values between the first, second and third order models are as follows:

The low sample was prepared by diluting the serum sample pool with saline and the high sample was prepared by spiking the serum sample pool.

Stability

# AST/GOT 4+1 SL

On board stability for the ELITech Clinical Systems AST/GOT was established by real time studies on the ELITech Clinical Systems Selectra ProM. The on-board stability of the reagent is 28 days. The ELITech Clinical Systems AST/GOT is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

ELITech Clinical systems ISE Reference Solution, ISE Diluent and ISE Calibrators are purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k945271). ISE Reference Solution and ISE Diluent should be stored at $1 0 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and ISE Calibrators should be stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and should not be frozen. ISE reference solutions and calibrators are stable until the expiration date stated on the label (reference solution is stable for 18 months, diluent is stable for 24 months). Shelf Life of the ISE calibrators is 24 months at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . ISE calibrators are stable for 30 days when stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after opening. On-board stability of the ISE Reference Solution is 30 days. On-board stability of the ISE Diluent is 3 days.

Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k041227). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: Before reconstitution, the shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol 1 and Elitrol II is 30 months at 2- $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when stored at $1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 5 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $. 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k033501). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: Elical 2 is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ prior to reconstitution. After reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 2 days at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $. 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $- 1 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . The labeling stated that the Elical 2 should be stored tightly capped and protected from light when not in use.

# Value Assignment

Elitrol I and II are value assigned using multiple Vital Scientific PRO M analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of Level I and II are the median of the observed values range. After validation of the target value, a confidence range (high and low values) is then calculated.

Elical 2 is tested against predetermined values on multiple Vital Scientific PRO M using the AST reagent and 2 levels of quality control material. The mean analyte value is calculated and a target value is assigned.

The expected values for the ISE calibrators are determined by analyzing the calibrator in triplicate on multiple ELITech Clinical System Selectra ProM analyzers over several days. The target value of the low and high calibrator is the median of the observed values.

# d. Detection limit:

ELITech Clinical Systems AST/GOT 4+1 SL

A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP-7A. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying a blank sample 60 times on the Selectra ProM analyzer. The LoB was determined using the $9 5 \%$ value. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 4 low $\left( 1 . 7 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L } \right)$ diluted sample pools 60 times on the Selectra Pro M analyzer in one day. The LoD was determining using the median minus the $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile plus the LoB value. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying 4 low $( 5 \mathrm { U / L } )$ diluted sample pools 15 times on the Selectra Pro M analyzer.

LoB, LoD and LoQ were established using the guideline CSLI. Protocols for

# Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline, CSLI document CSLI document EP17-A.

Study Design

Testing for interfering substances was based on CSLI EP-7A. Testing was performed on a minimum of five concentrations for each interfering substance.

The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does not cause $> 1 0 \%$ change between the tested samples and the control sample for AST/GOT $4 { + } 1$ SL.

The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does not cause $> 2 . 6 \%$ change between the tested sample and the control sample for $\mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ .

In the labeling, the sponsor also recommends that each laboratory should establish and maintain its own reference values.

# N. Instrument Name:

Vital Scientific Selectra ProM also trademarked as the Flexor EL 200.

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Automated continuous random access analyzer.

2. Software: FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types: Yes _ _X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Barcoding or manual entry

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Samples in sample tubes or sample cups with a tube adaptor are placed into sample tray. Specimens, calibrators and controls are pipetted by a sample arm into a cuvette rotor. ISE samples are diluted in a cuvette and aspirated via a dedicated ISE probe. A pump located on the ISE module pumps the diluted sample from the cuvette into electrodes. A cuvette blank must be conducted every 24 hours. The cuvette rotor must be replaced every 10,000 tests or when the cuvette blank produces a high standard deviation.

5. Calibration:

On demand calibration. It is recommended to perform a calibration and a quality control measurement after installing a new or fresh bottle of reagent. It is recommended to recalibrate ISEs after installing a new vial of ISE reference solution and/or ISE diluent. ISE calibration is required every 4 hours or when quality control results fall outside the established range after replacing electrode, and after ISE cleaning maintenance. ISE calibrators must not be placed on the rotor more than 10 minutes before they are used.

# 6. Quality Control:

The software contains a quality control program that evaluates control results and determines if they are within specified acceptable limits.

In the labeling the sponsor recommends that control measurements be assayed daily and the frequency depends on the test method, quality control materials should be used in accordance with local, state and/ or federal guidelines.
