862.1215 / Class II

Thi say0(ey nd efeivens ioatin s beuitt ince with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92. The assigned 510(k) number is: K102706.

# Test Description:

Anti CK-M mouse monoclonal antibodies in the reagent 1 inhibit the CK-M subunit in the sample without affecting the CK-B subunits. The CK-B activity is determined by the CK-NAC method and corresponds to half the CK-MB activity.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The CKMB UDR assay is substantially equivalent to Roche CK-MB assay (K003158). Both assays yield similar Performance Characteristics.

# Similarities:

Both assays are used for the quantitative determination of CKMB   
Both assays are based on immunologic inhibition of the CKM subunit of Human Creatine kinase   
Both assays are based on the same Immunological key   
materials: anti CK-M mouse monoclonal antibodies, which are bought from Roche.   
Both assays are based on the Kinetic measurement of the CK-B subunit of the human Creatine Kinase   
Both assays do have $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ as main wavelength   
Both assays utilize reagents in R1 and R2 Liquid format. Both assays are based on human Serum and Li-heparin   
Plasma.   
Both assays yield similar clinical results.

# Differences:

The predicate device assay recommends the use of EDTA plasma specimens. Sentinel assay recommends the use of serum and Li-Heparin plasma only.

# Intended Use:

The CKMB UDR assay is an in vitro diagnostic test used for the kinetic quantitative determination on Unicel DxC 600 System of the CK-MB isoenzyme activity of creatine kinase in serum and Liheparin plasma by inhibition method. The assay is intended for professional use only.

# Performance Characteristics:

Comparative performance studies were conducted using the UniCel DxC 600 Synchron System. Sentinel CKMB UDR assay on UniCel DxC 600 System yielded comparable performances to the Roche CK-MB (K003158) on Roche/Hitachi Modular P800 Analyzer (K953239/A5).

# Method comparison

Sentinel CKMB UDR assay on UniCel DxC 600 System was compared to predicate device Roche CK-MB (K003158) on Roche/Hitachi Modular P800 by testing 306 human sera samples. This comparison showed a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.999, slope of 0.96, and intercept of $2 . 4 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ .

# Conclusions

The generated data demonstrated an acceptable correlation between the CKMB UDR assay on the UniCel DxC 600 System vs. the Roche CKMB (K003158) on Roche/Hitachi Modular P800 Analyzer.

# Imprecision

# Analytical Measurement Range (AMR)

The found lower limit of the AMR of CKMB UDR on the UniCel DxC 600 System was 7.4 U/L. The found upper limit of the AMR was $6 0 0 . 0 \ U / \mathrm { L }$ . The claimed AMR will be 9.0 to 600.0 U/L.

# Conclusions for $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ Summary

Method comparison, Imprecision and AMR data demonstrate that the analytical performance of the CKMB UDR on the UniCel DxC 600 Synchron System is substantially equivalent to Roche CK-MB (K003158) on the Roche/Hitachi Modular P800 Analyzer

Dear Mr. Rota:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing o devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice reirements as t frth in the quality ystems () regulation (1 R Part 820.This er will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): _K102706

Device Name: CKMB UDR

# Indications for Use:

The CKMB UDR assay is an in vitro diagnostic test used for the kinetic quantitative determination on Unicel $\operatorname { D x C } 6 0 0$ System of the CK-MB isoenzyme activity of creatine kinase in serum and Liheparin plasma by inhibition method. The assay is intended for professional use only. Creatine Kinase (CK) catalyses the reversible phosphorylation of creatine by ATP. CK is a dimer composed of two subunits which form three active isoenzymes: BB (CK-1), MB (CK-2), MM (CK-3). CK-BB isoenzyme only rarely appears in serum.

Elevated CK values are due to muscular damages and associated pathologies. CK determination, usually performed with CK2 (also called CK-MB), is used for the diagnosis and follow-up of AMI (acute myocardial infarction) and some muscular diseases.

Prescription Use _ X (Part 21 CFR 801 Subpart D)
