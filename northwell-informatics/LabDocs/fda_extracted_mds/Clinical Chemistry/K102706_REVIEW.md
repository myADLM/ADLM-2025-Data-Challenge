# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indication for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The CKMB UDR assay is an in vitro diagnostic test used for the kinetic quantitative determination on Unicel DxC 600 System of the CK-MB isoenzyme activity of creatine kinase in serum and Li-heparin plasma by inhibition method. The assay is intended for professional use only. Creatine Kinase (CK) catalyses the reversible phosphorylation of creatine by ATP. CK is a dimer composed of two subunits which form three active isoenzymes: BB (CK-1), MB (CK-2), MM (CK-3). CK-BB isoenzyme only rarely appears in serum.

Elevated CK values are due to muscular damages and associated pathologies. CK determination, usually performed with CK2 (also called CK-MB), is used for the diagnosis and follow-up of AMI (acute myocardial infarction) and some muscular diseases.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Beckman Unicel DxC 600 Chemistry Analyzer

# L. Test Principle:

Anti CK-M mouse monoclonal antibodies in reagent 1 inhibit the CK-M subunit in the sample without affecting the CK-B subunits. The CK-B activity is determined by the CK-NAC method and corresponds to half of the CK-MB activity, where creatine kinase catalyzes the conversion of creatine phosphate and ADP to creatine and ATP. ATP then phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in the presence of hexokinase. Finally, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate, reducing $\mathrm { N A D P ^ { + } }$ to NADPH in presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The rate of increase in NADPH formed is proportional to the creatine kinase activity in the specimen and is measured kinetically.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI document EP05- A2 and by following the sponsor’s pre-approved internal protocols and acceptance criteria. Within run and total imprecision were calculated using 2 levels of commercial QC material, 8 levels of human serum pools, and 1 level of spiked human serum pool. Samples were analyzed twice a day in duplicate, for 10 days, using the Unicel DxC 600 instrument. All results met the sponsor’s acceptance criterion of $C V \leq 7 . 5 \%$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were conducted following the sponsor’s internal protocol and acceptance criteria and in accordance with CLSI document EP06-A. Two pools were used to assess the linearity of the assay. Pool 1 was human serum spiked with a concentrated solution of CK-MB to obtain a high activity of $6 5 0 . 1 9 \mathrm { U / L }$ . Pool 2 was a human serum pool. The two pools were diluted to obtain samples with values ranging from 5.73 to $6 5 0 . 1 9 \mathrm { U / L }$ . Linearity across the entire measuring range showed a linear regression analysis that resulted in a slope of 1.00 and a y-intercept of 0.00 $( \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 0 )$ . All data met the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria. The studies support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 9 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

Traceability of the results of both methods against the IFCC Methods was verified with the Certified Reference Material ERMDA455/ IFCC, based on preapproved protocol and pre-approved acceptance criteria. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria are that the percent recovery against the Certified Target value of the ERM-DA455/IFCC must be from $92 \%$ to $10 8 \%$ , which is equivalent to the uncertainty of the ERM-DA455/IFCC certified value $( \pm 4 \mathrm { U / L } )$ by factor 2.

Expected Values

A reagent handling study was performed to asses the risk in case of improper handling, by switching reagent 1 with reagent 2 in the Unicel cartridge compartments. Two samples were tested with 5 lots of reagents under these conditions and the result in every case was an error message on the instrument, demonstrating that improper reagent handling will prevent the release of reportable results.

# d. Detection limit:

A limit of blank (LoB) study was conducted where analyte-free saline was assayed 20 times each on three separate analytical runs using the Unicel DxC 600 analyzers. LoB, or analytical sensitivity claim, was calculated as the absolute mean plus 3 standard deviations. The LoB of $2 . 2 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ obtained from this study met the sponsor’s acceptance criterion of $\leq 3 \mathrm { ~ U / L }$ (the

analytical sensitivity claim of the predicate device).

A limit of quantitation (LOQ) study was conducted by serially diluting a pool of human sera (approximately $3 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ ) and analyzing each dilution in 10 replicates. The mean, SD, $C V \%$ , absolute bias, and total error was calculated for each sample. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was a $\%$ total error of $\leq$ $2 4 . 1 \%$ . The resulting LOQ was $7 . 4 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ . The sponsor’s claimed measuring range for the assay is $9 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Common endogenous interfering substances were evaluated in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP7-A2. Human serum samples at approximate CK-MB concentrations of $2 5 \mathrm { U / L }$ and $4 5 \mathrm { U / L }$ were spiked with various concentrations of interferents and evaluated in triplicate at each interferent level. Absolute bias was calculated at each concentration level as compared with non-spiked human serum. Acceptance criterion was given as an absolute bias of $\pm 2 . 4 \mathrm { U / L }$ $( \pm 1 0 \%$ at the clinical decision level of $2 4 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ ). The results for the $2 5 \mathrm { U / L }$ CK-MB samples and the $4 5 \mathrm { U / L }$ CK-MB samples are shown in the table below. Interference from hemoglobin was not found at $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , however significant interference was found at $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin. The sponsor has notified users in their package insert to not use hemolyzed samples as hemoglobin $> 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ interferes with the test.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

In accordance with EP09-A2, a set of 373 patient human sera was tested for CK-MB using the CKMB UDR assay on the UniCel DxC 600 System and using the Roche CK-MB on Roche/Hitachi Modular P800 Analyzer. Linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman bias analysis was performed for results comparison. The sponsor’s stated acceptance criteria were a linear regression slope between 0.95 and 1.05, and a correlation coefficient (Pearson) $\mathrm { r } > 0 . 9 7 5$ . Sample results ranged from 9.0 to $5 9 9 . 2 \mathrm { U / L }$ , and linear regression analysis generated a slope of 0.96 with a y-intercept of 2.16 and a correlation coefficient of 0.998. The Bland-Altman calculated average bias ranged from - 10.11 to $1 1 . 1 4 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ .

# b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study between serum and lithium heparin plasma samples was conducted using serum as reference, in accordance with CLSI Document EP9-A2. The study was performed on 52 matched patient samples. The slope, intercept and correlation coefficient were calculated by linear regression, and a Bland-Altman bias analysis was performed. Acceptance criteria were a slope between 0.95 and 1.05, and a correlation coefficient (Pearson) $\mathrm { r } > 0 . 9 7 5$ . The samples ranged from 9 to $5 8 2 . 1 \mathrm { U / L }$ . The resulting equation was $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 5 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 6 2$ with a correlation coefficient of 1.000.

The compatibility of different collection tubes used for blood sample collection was evaluated using five sample pools assayed in replicates of 5. The absolute bias was calculated for each tube type as compared to the nonanticoagulated serum baseline specimen. Acceptance criterion was given as an absolute bias of $\pm 2 . 4 \mathrm { U / L }$ $( \pm 1 0 \%$ at the clinical decision level of $2 4 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L } )$ ). Both the Lithium Heparin PST (Gel barrier) tube and the SST (Gel barrier) Serum tube generated results within the acceptance criterion when compared to the serum baseline sample results.

The determined reference ranges were as follows:

Male: 9 – 22.8 U/L Female: 9 – 27.3 U/L
