# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline

# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ SHBG Immunoassay is an electrochemiluminescent, sandwich based assay. The total duration of the assay is 18 minutes.

• 1st incubation: $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample, a biotinylated monoclonal SHBG-specific antibody, and a monoclonal SHBG-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex form a sandwich complex. • 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. • The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.

• Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Previously established in k031717 b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Previously established in k031717 c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Previously established in k031717

d. Detection limit:

Limit of detection studies were performed on the Elecsys 2010 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers according to CLSI EP 17-A.

LoB:

The distribution of values for five analyte free samples pools was determined on two Elecsys 2010 analyzers and two MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers with 3 reagent lots over 3 days, 2 runs per day with a single replicate per run. In total, 60 determinations were obtained per reagent lot. Values for the 3 reagent lots ranged from 0.211 to $0 . 2 6 8 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ on the Elecsys 2010 and from 0.189 to 0.274 on the E170. The sponsor set the LoB claim as $0 . 5 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

LoD:

The distribution of values for five low level human serum samples pools was determined on two Elecsys 2010 analyzers and two MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers with 3 reagent lots over 3 days, 2 runs per day with a single replicate per run. In total, 60 determinations were obtained per reagent lot. LoD was determined according to EP-17-A as:

$\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ S D ~ } _ { \mathrm { t c } }$ tal (of low analyte samples)

LoD values obtained for the 3 reagent lots ranged from 0.313 to 0.412 nmol/L on the Elecsys 2010 and from 0.306 to 0.411 on the E170. The sponsor set the LoD claim as $0 . 8 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

A low level sample set was prepared by diluting 3 human serum samples with an analyte free diluent. The low level sample set was tested in single replicates for 3 days, 2 runs per day on 2 Elecsys 2010 analyzers and 2 MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers with 3 reagent lots ( $\Nu = 1 2$ ) Each reagent lot was evaluated separately. Two lots of calibrators and one lot of controls were used for the study. To determine the LoQ, the differences between the expected value and the measured mean value were calculated for each member of the low level sample set to determine the total error. The average bias and SDs for each member of the low level sample set were calculated. LoQ values obtained for the 3 reagent lots ranged from 0.780 to $1 . 5 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ on the Elecsys 2010 and from 0.490 to 0.660 on the E170. The sponsor set the LoQ claim as $2 . 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

The measuring range of the assay was set at $0 . 8 0 0 - 2 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ . The low end of the measuring range was determined based on the limit of detection.

Testosterone and SHBG concentrations were measured in apparently healthy males $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 1 4 )$ ) and females $\mathrm { ( n { = } 1 6 0 }$ ) using the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ SHBG and Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Testosterone II (K093421) assays on the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ E170 Immunoassay Analyzer. The health status of the apparently healthy group was confirmed by a standard clinical chemistry and hematology profile and health examination. The expected values are presented in the table below:
