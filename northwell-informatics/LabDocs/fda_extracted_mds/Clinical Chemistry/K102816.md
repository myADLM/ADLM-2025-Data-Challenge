Dear Sir/Madam

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to markel the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use statedin the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28. 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug, and Cosmetic Aci (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore. market the device, subject to the eneral controls provisions of the Act.The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices. good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If yur device isclassifid (see above)into eiherclass  (Special Controls)or lass II(MA). itmy be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be foundin Title 21. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts S00 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements. including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807): labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section S10(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device resuls in a classification for your device and thus. permits your device to proced to the marke.

Device Name: GAL-IC Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indications for Use:

GAL-1C Blood Glucose Monitoring System:

The GAL-IC Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm, or palm. Alternative site testing should be performed only during steady-state (when glucose is not changing rapidly). Testing is done outside thc body (ln Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for lay use by people with diabetes, as an aid to monitoring levels in Diabetes Mellitus and should only be used by a single patient and it should not be shared. It is not indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.

GAL-1C Blood Glucose Test Strips:

The GAL-1C Blood Glucose Test Strips are to be used with the GAL-1C Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in capillary whole blood taken from fingertips, palm, or forearm. Alternative site testing should be performed only during steady-state (when glucose is not changing rapidly). They are not indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for nconatal use.

# Indications for Use Statement

510(k) Number (if known): k102816

Device Name: Contrex Plus III Glucose Control Solutions

Indications for Use:

Intended use

The purpose of the control solution test is to validate the performance of the Blood Glucose Monitoring System using a testing solution with a known range of glucose. A control test that falls within the acceptable range indicates the user's technique is appropriate and the test strip and meter are functioning properly.
