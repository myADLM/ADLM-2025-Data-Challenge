# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

# L. Test Principle:

Cortisol in the sample competes with cortisol-enzyme conjugate for binding sites to antibody bound to a microwell. Unbound components are washed away and enzyme is measured by a colored reaction with the tetramethybenzemidine (TMB) substrate. Concentration of the sample is interpolated from the calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Study Protocol:

A precision study was performed by testing 3 levels (approximately 0.6, 4, and 25 $\mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ of pooled clinical saliva samples, assayed in duplicate with 2 runs per day for 20 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ) using 3 different reagent kit lots for each study.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Study Protocol:

Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. A high spiked cortisol sample of human saliva ( $3 3 . 7 8 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ and low cortisol sample of human saliva $\left( 0 . 0 9 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } \right)$ were used in this study. Dilutions were prepared from these two samples to provide various concentrations of cortisol. A total of ten levels of cortisol concentrations were tested. The cortisol concentrations ranged from 0.093 – 33.788 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# Results Summary:

Statistical evaluations using linear regression showed that the assay is linear from $0 . 0 9 3 - 3 3 . 7 8 8 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , yielding a linear regression result of $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 7 3 ~ \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 5 4 0$ , with a correlation coefficient of $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 6$ .

The data provided support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this assay is 0.1 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

Controls and calibrators are included in the test kit. The assigned cortisol values of the calibrators are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cortisol reference material (code 921). Cortisol standard material is purchased from a commercial vendor and prepared stock solution used to make the standards, calibrators and controls is directly compared to NIST material.

Value Assignment of Calibrators and Controls

The initial lot of calibrator materials (stock solution) is value assigned through a correlation study using NIST cortisol reference material. Based on the correlation study with the NIST material, the cortisol values for the stock solution are established. All subsequent standards, calibrators and controls are value assigned against the stock solution. Verification is conducted by direct comparison with each kit lot to the NIST reference material.

7 calibrators are provided at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, and $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

2 controls are provided at 1.0 and $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Stability

The shelf-life and open-vial stability testing protocols for the controls and calibrator materials and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. Calibrator materials are stable until expiration date (9 months) when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

Reagent stability protocol and acceptance criteria was also evaluated and found to be acceptable. Reagents are stable in storage at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 9 months.

Open vial stability protocol and acceptance criteria was evaluated and found to be acceptable. Open vial reagents are stable at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 31 days.

Sample stability was investigated and the protocol and acceptance criteria were found to be acceptable. Specimens are stated to be stable when stored for no greater than 7 days at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 7 days at $2 - 8 \mathrm { \Omega } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and 7 days at ${ } _ { - 1 5 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ (freeze up to 7 times).

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of the blank (LoB), The limit of detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for salivary cortisol was determined from 120 measurements (40 measurements per day over 3 days) on one cortisol deficient sample and one low level cortisol sample $( < 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ . The LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 3 9 2 { \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ , and the LoD was determined to be $0 . 0 5 1 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The calculated LoQ based on a stated bias of $1 3 . 6 \%$ CV was $0 . 0 5 1 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

This assay has a measuring range of 0.1 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference Study Protocol:

An in-vitro interference study was conducted by spiking three levels of Cortisol (low, medium and high) with high concentrations of five potentially interfering substances. The in-vivo experiment was conducted by simulating the intake of five potentially interfering substances by spiking control saliva with either the potential interferent itself or an extract of the potential interferent (food was homogenized and centrifuged, and the supernatant was spiked into control saliva).

# Result Summary:

Based on the sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference (within $10 \%$ recovery of the control sample), the following claims were made:

The below compounds at the indicated concentration do not cause significant interference with the assay.

The Package insert contains the following limitation: “Avoid food consumption, drinking coffee or alcohol, smoking or chewing gum one (1) hour prior to sample collection. Rinse mouth thoroughly with water 15 minutes prior to collection.”

# Cross-Reactivity Study Protocol:

The sponsor evaluated cross-reactivity by using a cortisol-free saliva pool. Structurally related compounds were spiked into the saliva pool at concentrations up to $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for cross reactivity evaluation. $\%$ Cross-reactivity was calculated using the following the equation:

$\%$ Cross-reactivity $=$ Mean cortisol of the Cross-Reactant pool x 100 Concentration of Cross-Reactant

# Result Summary:

Based on the calculated $\%$ Cross-reactivity, only prednisolone was found to significantly cross-react with the proposed assay. The interference of prednisolone is stated in the package insert of the device.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Study Protocol:

A total of 160 patient saliva samples from a commercial vendor were used in the method comparison study. These samples were all collected in the recommended collection tubes, and together with 6 spiked samples they ranged from $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $2 9 . 8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The spiked samples used to cover the upper measuring range of the proposed assay were spiked with different volumes of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ concentration of stock calibrator solution (prepared with the NIST cortisol reference material, code 921) with target concentrations between $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ . Linear regression analysis was performed between the proposed salivary cortisol assay and the predicate device.

# Result Summary:

The Result of Linear Regression analysis yielded a regression equation of $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 6 9 \mathbf { x }$ $+ 0 . 0 9 9 4$ with a correlation coefficient of ${ \bf r } = 0 . 9 8 9 8$ .
