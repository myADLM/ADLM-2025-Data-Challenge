# Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur® Enhanced Estradiol (eE2) Master Curve Material, Level 1 is buffer with bovine serum albumin and preservatives. Levels 2-6 are various levels of USP-Grade estradiol in lyophilized normal male serum with sodium azide $0 . 1 \%$ after reconstitution) and preservatives.

The eE2 Master Curve Materials have expected values (lot specific) of 0, 60, 175, 450, 1500 and $2 7 0 0 p g / m L$ .

The eE2 Master Curve Material (1.0 mL/vial) are lyophilized material and stored at 2 - $8 ^ { \circ } C$

CAUTION! POTENTIAL BIOHAZARD: Contains human source material. While each human serum or plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDAapproved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2, all products manufactured using human source material should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B or C viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these products should be handled according to established good laboratory practices.

# Statement of Intended Use:

The ADVIA Centau $\textcircled{8}$ Enhanced Estradiol Master Curve Material is for in vitro diagnostic use in the verification of calibration and reportable range in the ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Enhanced Estradiol (eE2) assay.

# Performance:

The traceabiliy, value assignment, and stability of the ADVIA Centaur® Enhanced Estradiol Master Curve Materials have been validated following procedures of Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. These Enhanced Estradiol Master Curve Material are substantially equivalent to currently marketed devices with similar intended uses.

Re: k102904 Trade Name: ADVIA Centaur Enhanced Estradiol (eE2) Master Curve Material Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660. Regulation Name: Quality Control Material (Assayed and Unassayed) Regulatory Class: Class I, Reserved Product Codes: JJX Dated: November 5, 2010 Received: November 8, 2010

Dear Ms. Santulli:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976; the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
