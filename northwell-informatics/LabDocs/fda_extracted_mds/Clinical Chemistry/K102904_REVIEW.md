# I. Device Description:

ADVIA Centaur Master Curve Material (MCM) is a single-analyte, lyophilized product containing various levels of USP-Grade estradiol in human serum. The kit consists of 1 vial each of 6 levels. Estradiol levels are value assigned for ADVIA Centaur systems. MCM are for in vitro diagnostic use in the verification of calibration and reportable range in ADVIA Centaur Enhanced Estradiol assay. MCM are not intended for use as routine quality control material.

MCM levels 2 though 6 are manufactured using normal male human serum spiked with USP grade estradiol stock to target values of 60, 175, 400, 1500, and $2 7 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The eE2 MCM1 is manufactured using the eE2 buffer basepool with a target of $0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

The eE2 MCMs are filled at $1 \mathrm { m L }$ into $5 \mathrm { m L }$ amber vials and then lyophilized. The lyophilized material is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The eE2 MCM’s contain human source material. Each human serum or plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDA approved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2. However, all products manufactured using human source material should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B or C viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these products should be handled according to established good laboratory practices.

# K. Standard/ Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Evaluation of Matrix Effects; Approved Guideline - (CLSI EP14-A).

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The ADVIA Centaur eE2 assay and the Master Curve Materials are traceable to IDGC/MS values.

# Stability:

Real time $( 2 \small { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and accelerated ( $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) stability studies are being conducted on at least two lots of ADVIA Centaur Enhanced Estradiol Master Curve Material. The control material is stored at $< - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , which was determined to be appropriate by comparison of the control material stored at ${ } _ { - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ to a master set stored at ${ } _ { - 8 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or standards that are stored at ${ } _ { - 8 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The acceptance criteria states that the percent difference in material must be within $10 \%$ of the ${ } _ { - 4 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ daily dose or the $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ day zero dose with no adverse trends.

Open vial studies are being performed for 42 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Vials are opened at day zero and at each time point, the open vial, a frozen vial (that was placed in aliquots after reconstitution), and a fresh vial are tested. Percent recovery is calculated using the average dose from triplicate results and the acceptance criteria is that the open vial must be within $10 \%$ or two standard deviations from the frozen material. The sponsor will claim that it is stable for 14 day once reconstituted and stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

On-system stability is being measured by using at least two lots of material for 24 hours at room temp in uncapped centaur tubes. 15 sets of material are reconstituted and pooled in $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ polypropylene tubes. The material is then distributed at $1 \mathrm { m L }$ in sample cups. Five cups are capped and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and the other five cups are left uncapped at room temperature. Tubes are capped at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours and then the percent recovery is measured using the average dose from triplicate results against the $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ material. The acceptance criteria require that the percent recovery must be within $10 \%$ or two standard deviations of the $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ stored material. The sponsor will claim that it is stable for 6 hours once reconstituted and placed on the system.

# Value Assignment

Estradiol Master Curve Material is value assigned using an internal estradiol “gold standard” set that uses a panel of real serum samples and was value assigned by Gas Chromatography Mass Specification. The MCM and Gold standards are tested on three different ADVIA Centaur XP systems and MCM values are calculated for each system independently. The assigned value for each MCM is the average analyte recovered and must quality controls are calculated by the recovery of controls using calibrator values and must fall within set specifications. The target specifications for production lots are:

The customer ranges for the product insert are then determined by the following equations:

Upper Limit Customer Range $=$ Assigned Target $^ +$ Assigned Target $\textbf { X \% }$ interval Lower Limit Customer Range $=$ Assigned Target – Assigned Target $\textbf { X \% }$ interval The percent intervals are $\pm 2 5 \%$ for MCM2-MCM6.

# Matrix Effects

The sponsor performed spiking recovery of MCM2-6 to determine matrix effects. A stock solution of USP-Grade estradiol was added to the sample and the material was recovered. The acceptance criteria were that the recoveries across all 6 samples had to be within $\pm 1 0 \%$ and no individual recovery could be more than $\pm 1 5 \%$ . All of their samples met the acceptance criteria and show that there is no significant matrix effect from using pooled human serum with sodium azide as the base matrix for eE2 MCM’s.
