# L. Test Principle:

Cholesterol: Cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to cholesterol and fatty acids by cholesterol esterase (CHE). Then the cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase (CHO) to produce cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen peroxide $\left( \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } \right)$ . $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine (4- AAP) and phenol under the catalytic action of peroxidase to form a colored quinoneimine complex. The absorbance of the quinoneimine complex at $5 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the concentration of cholesterol in the sample.

Triglycerides: Triglycerides are hydrolyzed to glycerol and fatty acids by a lipoprotein lipase. In the presence of ATP and glycerol kinase, the glycerol is phosphorylated to glycerol-3- phopshate, which is then oxidized by glycerol-3-phosphate-oxidase to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 reacts with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-AAP) and $p$ -chlorophenol under the catalytic action of peroxidase to form a colored quinoneimine complex. The absorbance of the quinoneimine complex at $5 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the concentration of triglycerides in the sample.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Cholesterol assay:

A linearity study was performed according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Linearity across the assay range was determined by using two pools of patient serum, one at a low concentration $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and one at a high concentration $( 6 1 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . The low sample was prepared by diluting the serum sample pool with saline and the high sample was prepared by spiking the serum sample pool. Admixtures were prepared by mixing different proportions of low and high pool samples. All samples (11 samples) were assayed in triplicate. The expected values were plotted against the observed values and a linear regression line was fitted with the following regression equation: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 8 5 4 \mathrm { X } + 2 . 5 1 5 2$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 4$ .

Results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the cholesterol assay is linear from $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ .

# Triglycerides assay:

Similarly, linearity across the assay range was determined by using two pools of patient serum, one at a low concentration $2 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and one at a high concentration $( 1 0 7 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . The low sample was prepared by diluting the serum sample pool with saline and the high sample was prepared by spiking the serum sample pool. Admixtures were prepared by mixing different proportions of low and high pool samples. All samples (11 samples) were assayed in triplicate. The expected values were plotted against the observed values and a linear regression line was fitted with the following regression equation: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 3 2 \mathrm { X } - 1 . 4 6 8 7 .$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 7$ .

Results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the triglyceride assay is linear from is $3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The ELITech Clinical Systems Elical 2 has both cholesterol and triglycerides assays traceable to the ID-MS (Isotope Dilution- Mass Spectrometry) reference method.

Traceability to the National Reference System for Cholesterol was established by performing a direct comparison with the cholesterol reference method using human specimens that cover the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) medical decision points. The ability to meet the NCEP’s performance criteria for accuracy was demonstrated through testing and certification by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN). The comparison study was performed using SEPPIM Cholesterol SL reagent and SEPPIM ELICAL 2 calibrator. A certificate from CRMLN was provided by the sponsor. The certificate will expire in 2 years and a list of the certified methods can be found at the following link: http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/crmln.htm

Stability:

Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k033501). Calibrator assigned value was verified by testing on one Selectra Junior analyzer. The sponsor claimed the following for stability: Elical 2 is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to reconstitution. After reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 2 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $. 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $- 1 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ .

Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided to support on-board calibration stability for 28 days for cholesterol and 14 days for triglyceride.

Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k041227). Control assigned value was verified by testing on one Selectra Junior analyzer. The sponsor claimed the following for stability: Before reconstitution, the shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol 1 and Elitrol II is 30 months at 2- $8 ^ { \circ } C$ . After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when stored at $1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 5 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $. 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Value assignment of Elical 2:

Elical 2 is tested against predetermined values on multiple Vital Scientific analyzers using the cholesterol and triglyceride reagents. The mean analyte value is calculated and a target value is assigned.

Value assignment of Elitrol I and II controls:

For both cholesterol and triglyceride assays, assignments are based on two Vital Scientific analyzers with two lot of reagents. A total of 36 measurements were obtained and the mean, SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated. The control ranges were established by calculating the mean $\pm 1 5 \%$ for cholesterol and mean $\pm 1 6 \%$ for triglyceride.

d. Detection limit:

Cholesterol assay:

A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. LoB was determined by running a blank sample 60 times on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 4 low $\left( 3 . 6 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L } \right)$ diluted sample pools 60 times on the Selectra Junior analyzer. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by running 4 low $( 5 \mathrm { U / L } )$ diluted sample pools 60 times on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer. LoB is calculated to be $0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , LoD is

$0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . LoQ is calculated to be $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ based on a total error of $8 . 6 \%$ .

# Triglycerides assay:

A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. LoB was determined by running a blank sample 60 times on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 4 low $\left( 3 . 6 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L } \right)$ diluted sample pools 60 times on the Selectra Junior analyzer. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by running 4 low $( 5 \mathrm { U / L } )$ diluted sample pools 60 times on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer.
