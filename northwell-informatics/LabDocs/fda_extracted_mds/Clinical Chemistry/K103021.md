# 7Comparison to the Cleared Device

The modified device has the same technological characteristics as the current legally marketed predicate device, Evolution ™ (K072369).

8. Performance Data

Cal The cical eo valtiushe El  Bloo Glu Monitoring System components were conducted for purpose of validating the consumer use for the user and the professional accuracy. Test results showed substantial equivalence.

Non-clinical: Verification, validation and testing activities were conducted to establish the Monitoring System. The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

Disinection Studies: CaviWipes Disinecting Towelettes (EPA Reg. No: 46781-8) was validated demonstrating complee inactivation of live virus for use with the meter and the reusable lancing device. There was also no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 1,095 cleaning/disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of device use.

# 9. Conclusion

The conclusion drawn from the clinical and nonclinical tests is that the Element ™ plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is as safe, as effective and performs as well as the legally marketed predicate device, the Evolution ™ (K072369).

Dear Ms. Chung:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
