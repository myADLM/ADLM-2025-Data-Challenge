PREDICATE DEVICE:

Greiner VACUETTE® Blood Collection Tube with Lithium Heparin and Gel

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

# INTENDED USE:

VACUETTE® Blood Collection Tubes with Lithium Heparin and Gel Separator are used to collect, transport and process blood r testing plasma in the clinical laboratory.

# DESCRIPTION:

VACUETTE® Evacuated Blood Collection Tubes are plastic tubes with a pre-defined vacuum for exact draw volumes. They are fitted with color coded VAcuETTE® Safety Caps (green for heparin tubes). The tubes, additive concentrations, volumes of liquid additives, and their permitted tolerances, as well as the blood-to-additive ratio, are in accordance to the requirements and recommendations of the international standards ISO 6710 "Single use containers for venous blood specimen collection" and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's Approved Standards (CLSI).

VACUETTE® Evacuated Blood Collection Tubes with Lithium Heparin and Gel contain a barrier gel in the tube. The specific gravity of this material lies between the blood cells and plasma. During centrifugation the gel barrier moves upward, where it forms a stable barrier separating the plasma from cells. Plasma may be aspirated directly from the collection tube, which eliminates the need for transfer to another container.

The changes for the VACUETTE® Evacuated Blood Collection Tube with Lithium Heparin and Gel are in the Instructions for Use (IFU):

Recommended ${ \mathfrak { g } }$ -force (relative centrifugal force, rcf) change from 2200g to a range of $1 8 0 0 - 2 2 0 0 ~ 9$ . − Recommended tube spin time change from 15 minutes to a range of 10  15 minutes.

The Greiner VACUETTE® Blood Collection Tube with Lithium Heparin and Gel described in this submission is substantially equivalent to the predicate device in intended use, design, or composition of the tube. Verification studies were performed to demonstrate that the lower centrifugation speed and time did not affect laboratory results compared to the current centrifugation speed and time. The following table summarizes the validation and verification studies, the acceptance criteria, and the results.

The analysis of the data from this study demonstrated that the current modified centrifugation conditions for the VACUETTE® Evacuated Blood Collection System are equivalent and can be used for a broad range of clinical chemistry and immunology tests.

Dear Ms. Smith:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and vevvt CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
