# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 15197. In vitro diagnostic test systems. Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

# L. Test Principle:

The AP-1010/AP-1010multi and AP-1020/AP-1020multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use electrochemical methodologies. These systems quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using an amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Performance data are not required for the appearance and name change of the previously cleared device (k090389). The AP-1010 and AP-1020 systems include the same meter and test strips as the multi versions – the only difference is in the names due to the different indications for use (single vs. multiple-patient use)

Labeling in this submission has been confirmed to be at Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 7.4.

The device is intended for single- (AP-1010 and AP-1020 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems) and multiple-patient use (AP-1010multi and AP-1020multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems). Caviwipes disinfecting Towelettes with EPA registration #46781-8 were validated by virucide efficacy testing using Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with the meter and lancing device (for use only with the singlepatient use system). The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 18,250 cleaning and disinfection cycles for the meter (5000 cycles for the lancing device) designed to simulate 5 years of device use. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
