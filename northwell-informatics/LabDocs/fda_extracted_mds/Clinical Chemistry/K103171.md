# Device name

Proprietary name: Elecsys® Anti-TPO CalSet Common name: Anti-TPO CalSet Classification name: Calibrator, Secondary

# Predicate device

The Elecsys® Anti-TPO CalSet is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. We claim equivalency to the c El e  l Anti-TPO test system on K051890).

# Device description

The Elecys®AntiTO CalSe is  lyophlize prouc cnsisting  e anti-TPO antibodies in a human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Intended use

Elecsys Anti-TPO CalSet is used for calibrating the quantitative Elecsys Anti-TPO assay on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

# Reason for submission

The Elecsys® Anti-TPO CalSet is being changed from a liquid to lyophilized material. The formulation of the candidate device (Elecsys® Anti-TPO CalSet, lyophilized) is identical to that of the predicate device, Elecsys Anti-TPO CalSet (liquid, and cleared as part of the Elecsys® Anti-TPO test system on K051890).

# Comparison table

The Elecsys® Anti-TPO CalSet is currently sold to customers as part of the Eleys ssy ki. Up  El Anti-TPO CalSet device, it will be packagd and sold separately from the Elecsys® Anti-TPO assay kit.

Dear Ms. Baumann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such . additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
