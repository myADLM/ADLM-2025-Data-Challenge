# Identification of the Predicate Device:

Device Name: i-STAT $1 ^ { \mathfrak { o } }$ Analyzer

Indications for Use: The i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer is used by trained medical professionals for running a variety of clinical chemistry tests and test panels contained in iSTAT test cartridges. These tests include hematocrit, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, blood gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH), creatinine, lactate, activated clotting time, prothrombin time, bicarbonate/carbon dioxide, troponin, creatine phosphokinase, and beta natriuretic peptide.

Sodium measurements are used for monitoring electrolyte imbalances.   
Potassium measurements are used for diagnosis and monitoring of diseases and clinical   
conditions that manifest high and low Potassium levels.   
Chloride measurements are primarily used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of   
electrolyte and metabolic disorders including but not limited to cystic fibrosis, diabetic acidosis and hydration disorders.   
Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including but not limited to diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.   
Hematocrit measurements can aid in the determination and monitoring of normal or abnormal total red cell volume status including but not limited to conditions such anemia and   
erythrocytosis and blood loss related to trauma and surgery.   
Blood urea nitrogen measurements are used for the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of certain renal and metabolic diseases.   
Ionized calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of   
conditions including but not limited to parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany and disturbances related to surgical and intensive care.   
pH, pCO2 and pO2 measurements are used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of   
respiratory disturbances and metabolic and respiratory based acid-base disturbances.   
Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in   
monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other urine analytes.   
The i-STAT lactate test is useful for (1) the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis in conjunction with measurements of blood acid/base status, (2) monitoring tissue hypoxia and strenuous physical exertion, and (3) diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.   
The i-STAT Kaolin Activated Clotting Time (ACT) test is an in vitro diagnostic test used to monitor high-dose heparin anticoagulation frequently associated with cardiovascular surgery. The i-STAT PT, a prothrombin time test, is useful in monitoring patients receiving oral anticoagulation therapy such as Coumadin or warfarin.   
− Bicarbonate/carbon dioxide measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous potentially serious disorders associated with changes in body acid-base balance. The i-STAT Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of cardiac troponin I in whole blood or plasma. Measurements of cardiac troponin I are used in the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction and as an aid in the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes with respect to their relative risk of mortality.   
− The i-STAT CKMB test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of creatinine kinase MB mass in whole blood or plasma samples. CK-MB measurements can be used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). The i-STAT BNP test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in whole blood or plasma samples using EDTA as the anticoagulant. BNP measurements can be used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of congestive heart failure.   
• The i-STAT Celite ACT test is useful for monitoring patients receiving heparin for treatment of pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis, and for monitoring anticoagulation therapy in patients undergoing medical procedures such as catheterization, cardiac surgery, surgery, organ transplant and dialysis

The i-STAT' 1 Wireless Analyzer (Model 300W) is a variant of the predicate i-STAT 1 Analyzer (Model 300) (K001387) and it provides an additional and alternate method for communication of data to a facility database. The i-STAT 1 Analyzer together with single use i-STAT Cartridges is a complete analytical system that can be used at the point of patient care.

The primary purpose of the analyzer is to run a variety of tests contained in disposable, single-use i-STAT Cartridges. The enabling technology for the i-STAT system is in the microfabricated electrochemical sensors located in the disposable cartridges. The functions related to testing patient samples using this technology are not affected by the addition of the wireless capability.

The capability of the Wireless Analyzer to transmit test results and information by Radio Frequency (RF) transmission is an option that the user may choose but it is not required for the Wireless analyzer to fulfill the intended use or to meet the indications for use.

The principle differences between the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer and the predicate i-STAT Analyzer are:

The i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer incorporates a wireless module based upon the IEEE $8 0 2 . 1 1 ~ \mathsf { b } / \mathsf { g }$ communication protocol ("Wi-Fi") to be used to transmit test results to a Data Manager2.   
The i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer does not support the measurement of glucose test strips.

This application describes and provides information and background related to the incorporation of the wireless module into the i-STAT 1 Analyzer. This design modification provides a new method for users to transmit patient data to a Data Manager. It does not replace the existing method for transmitting data that uses an Infra-Red (IR) transceiver in the i-STAT 1 Analyzer together with accessories that provide a wired connection to a Data Manager. Which method is used to transmit data is selected by the user. Data Manager includes a server-based or personal computer-based utility that facilitates transmission of results from an i-STAT System to a data base maintained by a medical facility.

The operation of the wireless function is temporally distinct from the operation of the measurement cycle. The control of the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer assures that the RF module is not powered during the measurement cycle. All operations during the measurement cycle are identical in the predicate i-STAT 1 Analyzer and in the Wireless Analyzer. Data is provided that shows the power supply is off during the measurement cycle and also during power down of the analyzer. The measurement cycle activities are identical in the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and in the Wireless Analyzer. Therefore no cartridge tests to compare the test performance of the Wireless Analyzer to the predicate i-STAT 1 Analyzer was carried out.

This $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ application establishes the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer to be substantially equivalent to the i-STAT 1 Analyzer. The design modification does not create significant risks and particular attention has been paid to those concerns and issues highlighted in the "Radio-Frequency Wireless Technology in Medical Devices Draft Guidance" FDA January 3, 2007.

The use of the industry standard IEEE 802.1 1 provides a high degree of confidence to the users that the coexistence of the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer within a medical facility is predictable, easily managed, and provides a high degree of assurance that there is a low risk that intentional electromagnetic radiation from the Wireless Analyzer will result in unacceptable interference with other medical equipment in the immediate vicinity.

There is an acceptable, low risk that the radio frequency emissions will result in thermal injury to a patient or user. This is based on Specific Absorption Rate tests conducted by the supplier of the radio frequency module.

The following are the same in the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer.

Both models are compatible with all i-STAT Cartridges. Both models may be used in the same facility locations and by the same medical professionals.   
C The indications for use for each individual test apply regardless of which Analyzer is used to run the tests.   
• The basic design and the materials used are the same in both models. Neither model transmits real-time physiologic information or critical information such as alarms to remote monitoring stations.   
• The JAMS software provides for the control of the transmission of data in both models. In the former, the software directs the transmission using the IR port. In the Wireless Analyzer the software allows the user to direct the transmission using either the wireless module or the IR port. Both models use Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) protocol to ensure that acceptance of corrupted data is improbable. Approximately $9 9 . 9 9 8 5 \%$ of any corrupted data will be detected by the CRC.   
• Both models conform to the laboratory electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standard IEC 61326-2-6 for unintentional emissions and susceptibility.

Both models, in combination with alternating current-powered accessories, conform to the electrical safety requirements of UL 61010-1.

The following are different in the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer compared to the i-STAT 1 Analyzer.

The Wireless Analyzer incorporates a radio-frequency transceiver (IEEE $8 0 2 . 1 1 ~ \mathrm { { b / g } }$ EY protocol) that has been certified as an unlimited module by a Telecommunications Certification Board and accordingly bears a Federal Communications Commission identification number. • The wireless communication will rely upon the IEEE 802.1 1 infrastructure that is already ubiquitous in medical facilities. • The wireless module is not powered during the measurement cycle. • A software utility, used to configure the wireless communication system at installation, is provided as a CD-ROM. • The color is blue (the predicate device is beige) and the word "wireless" is on the bezel. • In the Wireless Analyzer, the ability to run a glucose test strip is disabled.

The following table summarizes features and functions that are in the Wireless Analyzer but are not present in the predicate i-STAT 1 Analyzer.
