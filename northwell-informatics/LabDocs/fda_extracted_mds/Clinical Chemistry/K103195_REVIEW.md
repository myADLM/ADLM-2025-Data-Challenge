Adding wireless functionality to the i-STAT Analyzer (k001387) to communicate testing results to a PC

# C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:

Abbott Point of Care, Inc. i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer

# D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

Hematocrit, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, blood gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH), creatinine, lactate, activated clotting time, prothrombin time, bicarbonate/carbon dioxide, troponin, creatine phosphokinase, and beta natriuretic peptide.

# E. System Descriptions:

# 1. Device Description:

The i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer incorporates a radio-frequency transceiver (IEEE $8 0 2 . 1 1 \mathrm { b / g }$ protocol), also known as a wireless module. This design modification provides a new method for users to transmit patient data to a Data Manager. It does not replace the existing method for transmitting data that uses an Infra-Red (IR) transceiver in the i-STAT Analyzer together with accessories that provide a wired connection to a Data Manager. The capability of the Wireless Analyzer to transmit test results and information by Radio Frequency (RF) transmission is an option that the user may choose but it is not required for the Wireless analyzer to fulfill the intended use or to meet the indications for use. (Which method is used to transmit data is selected by the user.)

The operation of the wireless function during the User Interface application of the JAMS firmware is temporally distinct from the operation of the Measurement Cycle application when the i-STAT test cartridges are being processed and tests are being conducted. The control of the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer assures that the RF module is not powered during the measurement cycle. All operations during the measurement cycle are identical in the predicate i-STAT Analyzer and in the Wireless Analyzer.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

Once the Measurement Cycle within an i-STAT test cartridge has been completed, the test results are stored in the analyzer and are displayed on the Analyzer LCD display where they are available for use by the medical professional. At this point, the User Interface Cycle begins during which the stored test results can be transmitted to a Data Manager via the IR transceiver or

RF transmission at the convenience of the user.

3. Modes of Operation:

This submission only pertains to a wireless mode of data transmission being added to a previously cleared i-STAT Analyzer (k001387). The Analyzer software and the data transmission to a PC via the IR transceiver have been reviewed in that previous submission.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

The following testing was performed to evaluate the wireless function:

1. Testing that demonstrated that i-STAT patient results are transmitted successfully to the pertinent data fields on the receiving computer for all iSTAT tests that can be used with the i-STAT wireless analyzer.   
2. Testing that demonstrated that multiple i-STAT 1Wireless Analyzers can transmit results to a computer simultaneously without corruption of the data or patient mix-up.   
3. Testing that demonstrated that the wireless module is not powered during the measurement cycle   
4. Testing that demonstrated that the wireless module is off if the analyzer is off.

The integrity of transmitted data is assured by the use of:

• A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of data that is the same as that used in the predicate i-STAT 1 Analyzer (Model 300). Approximately $9 9 . 9 9 8 5 \%$ of any corrupted data will be detected by the CRC.   
• A TCP/IP protocol that is the same as used in the predicate device.   
• The IEEE 802.11 protocol that is inherent in the operation of the healthcare facility’s wireless router.
