# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The Elecsys hGH CalSet and CalCheck 5 are traceable to the NIBSC 98/574 international standard.

# Value Assignment:

The Elecsys hGH CalSet assigned values are determined with the Elecsys hGH assay. A master calibrator set is available and traceable to NIBSC 98/574. The assigned values for Elecsys hGH CalSet are read from the master calibration curve. Kit Calibrator (CalSet) values are assigned for each instrument platform (Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411 and E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602). The assigned lot-specific value is the median over a minimum of 6 measurements (two runs on each analyzer, minimal of 3 analyzers of each instrument platform).

For each Elecsys hGH CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are assayed in duplicate on at least three E170 analyzer measuring cells. The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range $1 \mathrm { s } \pm 3 0 \%$ of assigned value, in which $10 \%$ was allotted for between-analyzer platform tolerance, $10 \%$ for stability tolerance and $10 \%$ for precision of the assay. For additional analyzers, the same value assignment procedure is performed.

# Stability:

The stability study for CalSet was performed on cobas e 411. The stability study for CalCheck was performed on E170. The stability protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Shelf-life stability: The accelerated stability testing at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ supports an initial shelf-life claim of 18 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for CalSet and CalCheck. Real-time testing at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going. Stability after reconstitution and freeze/thaw cycles: Real time testing was performed and supports the following claims: Reconstituted Elecsys hGH CalSet is stable for up to 7 days at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ ; up to 28 days at -15 to ${ } _ { - 2 5 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and 1 freeze/thaw cycle. Reconstituted Elecsys hGH CalCheck 5 is stable for up to 5 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . • On-board stability: Real-time testing supports on-board stability of reconstituted CalSet for up to 5 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The CalCheck products are not stored on-board the analyzer, therefore no on-board stability claims are made.
