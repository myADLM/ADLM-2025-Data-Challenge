# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 15197. In vitro diagnostic test systems. Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

# L. Test Principle:

The AP-3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use electrochemical methodologies. The systems quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using an amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The AP-3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are the same meters and use the same test strip; however they have separate names due to their different indications for use (single- vs. multiple-patient use).

# 1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run precision was measured by using five spiked venous whole blood samples (hematocrit ranging from $3 5 \%$ to $50 \%$ ). Each sample was tested on three lots of test strips on ten meters. Ten replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot, and glucose concentration, $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 0$ tests per test strip lot). Results are summarized below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed using ten spiked venous whole blood samples with the following concentrations: 10, 19, 42, 72, 123, 172, 260, 366, 480 and $5 9 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which ranged from 10 to $5 9 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . All samples were tested on three lots of test strips, ten meters (ten measurements per test strip lot), on the AP-3000 Blood Glucose Meter. Glucose concentrations were tested on the YSI 2300 analyzer to generate the expected values. The observed values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was generated with results summarized below:

Linear Regression Analysis: Lot 1: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 7 9 3 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 9 8 9$ , $\mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 2$ . Lot 2: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 6 7 7 \mathbf { x } + 2 . 1 7 1$ , $\mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 3$ . Lot 3: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 7 6 4 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 0 6 4$ , $\mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 6$ .

Based upon the results, the sponsor claims a measurement range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the AP-3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Two levels of Control Solution (Level I and II) are included with each test kit. For each glucose control solution, a reference measurement was taken using an YSI 2300 analyzer. One hundred fifty measurements obtained with candidate meters were performed (30 bottles $^ \ast 5$ measurements/per bottle) for each glucose control solution and the mean value, SD and CV were calculated. Level I and II glucose control solutions were found to have ranges of $7 0 { - } 7 7 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 0 0 { - } 2 1 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , respectively.

Stability characteristics of both levels of Glucose Control Solutions were determined using real time studies. The open vial stability was evaluated at 2, 25 and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (all temperatures at $50 \%$ humidity), while the unopened vial stability was evaluated at $2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ ( $50 \%$ humidity). The sponsor claimed open vial stability of 90 days stored at 2 to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and an unopened vial stability of 20 months stored at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

The stability characteristics of the test strips were evaluated in real-time open and closed vial studies. Open vial stability was determined by evaluating test strips stored at three temperature s (4, 30 and $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ ; $60 \%$ humidity) during a 100 day period. Closed vial stability was determined by evaluating test strips stored at three temperatures (4, 25 and $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ ; $50 \%$ humidity) during a 20 month period. Based upon their results, the sponsor claims an open vial stability of 90 days and an unopened shelf-life stability of 20 months stored at 4 to $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the AP‐3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b.).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing of exogenous and endogenous substances was performed using a protocol based on CLSI EP7-A. A venous blood sample (hematocrit level of 40 $\pm 2 \% )$ was adjusted to two different glucose concentrations (125 and $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each potential interfering substance was added at several concentrations to an aliquot of each of the two glucose concentrations (test) and compared to the same sample without the potential interfering substance (control). Each interferent-glucose sample was tested using ten different meters and three lots of test strips. The YSI 2300 glucose analyzer was used as the reference method. The results are as follows:

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh which can be applied directly to the test strip.

5. Calibration:

The AP-3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Meters must be calibrated with the code found on the current test strip vial label. No further calibration is required.

# 6. Quality Control:

The sponsor has two levels of controls (Level I and II) supplied with this meter. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each control can be measured by following the instructions for “Quality Control Testing” provided in the User Manual for the meter. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is instructed to contact Customer Service if the control results fall outside these ranges.

# P. O therSupportiveInstrum entPerform anceCharacteristicsDataNotCovered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling for the US market by surveying the 150 lay users that participated in the study. Participants varied in age, education, and gender. These lay users also completed a questionnaire to response to whether the device is easy to use and the ‘Instructions for use’ were written in a way that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded that the device is very easy to use.

Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the labeling (User’s Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package insert) was written at the $8 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade level.

Customer service is available between 8:30 am and 5:30 PM-Pacific Standard Time, Monday through Friday. Users are instructed to contact their healthcare providers outside hours of operation. The toll free US phone number is 1-888-873-1021 for customer support.

The device is intended for single (AP-3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System) and multiple-patient use (AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System). Caviwipe Disinfecting Towelettes (Metrex Research Corporation, EPA registration #46781-8) were validated demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B surface antigen for use with the blood glucose meter and the lancing device (for use only with the singlepatient use system). The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 18,250 cleaning and disinfection cycles for the meter (5000 cycles for the lancing device) designed to simulate 5 years of device use. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

EMC testing was evaluated and certified by Electronics Testing Center and a test report was submitted stating that the AP-3000 passed all tests; dated July 30, 2010.

Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures ranging from $^ { - 2 0 }$ to $5 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and relative humidity ranging from 0 to $9 3 \%$ . Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature of 4 to $4 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and humidity range of 0 to $8 5 \%$ .

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude of the AP-3000 BGMS. A venous blood sample adjusted to five different glucose concentrations (54, 81, 126, 271 and $4 5 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) was tested on two meters and a single lot of test strips. Each venous blood sample was evaluated by the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer. Tests were performed at six different elevations (sea level, 2624 feet, 4921 feet, 6266 feet, 7119 feet and 10,742 feet). The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI method, the percent bias against the YSI results was calculated and all results were found to support the sponsor claims that the AP-3000 BGMS can be used at altitudes up to 10,742 feet.

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference from hematocrit using seven different hematocrit levels ( $1 5 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $60 \%$ and $70 \%$ ). For each hematocrit level, five different glucose concentrations (10, 70, 170, 285 and 450 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ were tested against the YSI-2300 Glucose Analyzer. Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested on twenty meters and two lots of test strips. The differences of the glucose meter results at each hematocrit/glucose combination were calculated against YSI-2300 Glucose Analyzer results at $40 \%$ hematocrit. The bias relative to YSI was acceptable to support the claim that hematocrit levels of 20 to $60 \%$ do not significantly affect the glucose results.

A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume requirement for the AP-3000 BGMS. A venous blood sample adjusted to three glucose concentrations (66, 105 and $2 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was tested on one lot of test strips and ten meters. Each blood sample was applied to test strips at five sample volumes (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 and $1 . 1 \mu \mathrm { l } { } \dot { }$ ). Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample volume of ${ \ge } 0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ produced accurate results.
