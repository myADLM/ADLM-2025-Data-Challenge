# System Description:

The ACURA PLUS Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) measures the glucose in whole blood sample by a small electrical current generated in the test strips and sent to the meter for measurement. The system consists of the following devices: ACURA PLUS Meter (Model GM505RA), ACURA PLUS Test Strips, ACURA PLUS Control Solutions for three different glucose concentration ranges (called "Low", "Normal" and "High" ranges, sold separately), Lancing Device, Lancets, User manual, Quick reference guide and Logbook.

# Intended Use:

The ACURA PLUS Blood Glucose Meter is intended for use with the ACURA PLUS Blood Glucose Test Strips for the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood from the fingertip and the alternate sites such as forearm, palm, thigh and calf. The alternate site testing should be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions. The ACURA PLUS Control Solutions are for use with the ACURA PLUS Meter and ACURA PLUS Test Strips to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly.

The ACURA PLUS Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body by people with diabetes at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of a diabetes control program. The system is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared. It is not intended for use on neonates and is not for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes.

# Predicate Device:

1) Device name: CareSens N Blood Glucose Monitoring System 510(k) Number: k083468

) Device name: ACURA Blood Glucose Monitoring System 510(k) Number: k083468/A001

# Comparison with Predicate Device:

The modified ACURA PLUS BGMS has the following similarities to the predicate devices:

1) same intended use,   
2) same operating principle,   
)same fundamental scientific technology, 4) same product specifications,   
) same operating ranges,   
6) manufactured by the same process.

The modifications from the predicate devices are as follows:

1) Meter outer casing design change,   
2) Software modification of displaying averages stored in the meter's memory.

# Technological Characteristics:

The ACURA PLUS BGMS has the same fundamental scientific technology as the predicate devices (CareSens N BGMS, ACURA BGMS).

# Assessment of Performance:

To verify whether the modified feature operates correctly, the validation study was conducted. The test results confirmed that the modified features operated properly. Thus, ACURA PLUS BGMS demonstrated satisfactory performance and is suitable for its intended use.

# Conclusion:

The modifications of ACURA PLUS BGMS do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the device and the intended use. Therefore, based on the information provided in this submission, the ACURA PLUS BGMS is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Dr. Oh:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice réquirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
