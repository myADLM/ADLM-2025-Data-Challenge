Traceability and Value Assignment

A seven-level Master calibration curve is prepared by gravimetric addition of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) digitoxin to drug-free human serum. The master calibrators are value assigned by the reference measurement procedure, Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS) at a reference laboratory.

The commercial calibrators are prepared from a stock solution, created by gravimetric addition of commercial digitoxin to bovine serum at a calculated concentration. The stock solution concentration is determined by measuring recovery on a Dimension RxL instrument calibrated with the digitoxin master calibrators (IDMS value assigned).

Stock solution is spiked into bovine serum to create each commercial calibrator material. For each commercial calibrator lot manufactured, values are verified on a Dimension RxL instrument that has been calibrated with the Master calibrators (IDMS value assigned).

The final bottle values are assigned on Dimension RxL and/or Dimension RxL MAX instruments that have been calibrated with the Master calibrators. Value assignment is conducted using three instruments and three reagent lots, and the assigned value is determined from the mean. The bottle value performance is then verified using acceptance criteria on a Dimension Vista 1500 instrument.

# Stability

Open-vial and ongoing real-time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were described. The data support the package insert claims that open-vial DGTX CAL is stable for up to 30 days after opened if stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and that storage unopened at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ provides stability for 12 months. The expiration date listed on each calibrator bottle label reflects this stability time of 12 months.
