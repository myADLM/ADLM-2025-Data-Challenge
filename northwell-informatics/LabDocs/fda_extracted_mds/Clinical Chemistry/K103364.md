# Device Description:

Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Control is a human serum based product containing constituents of purified biochemicals (tissue extracts of human and animal origin), chemicals, preservatives and stabilizers. Two levels of Control are provided in a lyophilized form. Each level is packaged into a glass amber bottle containing 5mL of product. The product is packaged in single level boxes ( $1 2 \times 5 m L )$ or multiple level boxes $( 6 \times 2 \times 5 m L )$ and stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } C$ .

All human source material was tested and found negative by FDA approved methods for HBsAG, HCV, and HIV-1/2.

# Assessment of Non-Clinical Performance Data:

Tests were conducted to verify specific performance requirements:

Accelerated (high temperature) stress test was done and results support a 2 year st Use life stability testing at $\mathtt { \Omega 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ supports a 20 day life. Use life stability testing under refrigerated $( 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } C )$ conditions support a 7 day life.

# Assessment of Clinical Performance Data:

NA

# Conclusions:

rologialstion icv support the claim of substantial equivalence.

Re: k103364 Trade Name: Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemical Control Regulation Number: 21 CFR $\ S 8 6 2 . 1 6 6 0$ Regulation Name: Quality Control Material (assayed and unassayed) Regulatory Class: Class I, reserved Product Codes: JJY Dated: March 18, 2011 Received: March 21, 2010

Dear Ms. Voo:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
