# L. Test Principle:

Creatininase hydrolyzes creatinine in the sample to creatine. Creatine is hydrolyzed by creatinase to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine is then oxidized by sarcosine oxidase to produce hydrogen peroxide $\left( \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } \right)$ . $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ reacts with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-AAP) and EHSPT (N-Ethyl-N-2(-Hydroxy-3-Sulfopropyl)-m-Toluidine) under the catalytic action of peroxidase to form a colored quinoneimine. The absorbance of the quinoneimine at $5 4 6 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the concentration of creatinine in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study was performed by assaying three serum pools at varying concentrations over 20 operating days, on one Selectra Junior analyzer and with one lot of reagent. Assay runs were performed twice per day and each sample was tested in duplicate. Calibration was performed for each run. The results are summarized below.

Another precision study was performed by assaying three serum pools and one control at varying concentrations over 10 operating days, on two Selectra Junior analyzers and with two lots of reagents. Assay runs were performed once per day and calibrated according to the device labeling. Each sample was tested in duplicate. The results are summarized below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study across the claimed assay range was performed by preparing samples from patient serum pools at a low creatinine concentration (0.28 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ and a high concentration $( 2 2 . 3 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). The low pool contained serum diluted with saline. The low and high pools were mixed in different proportions to create 9 dilutions. Eleven samples in all were assayed in triplicate

Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order least square regressions according to CLSI Protocol EP6-A. Based on the analysis the sponsor determined that first order regression was the best fit. The analysis of the first order regression yielded the following equation:

$1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ order y= 2.2x -1.84

Additionally, the expected values were plotted against the observed values and a linear regression line was fitted with the following regression equation:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 9 3 9 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 1 4 , \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 9
$$

Based on these results, the sponsor claims that the assay is linear from 0.28- $2 2 . 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The calibrator material is purchased from a commercially available source. The creatinine in ELICAL 2 is traceable to ID-MS (Isotope dilution-Mass Spectrometry). Elical 2 calibrator is value assigned from an internal master lot of calibrator using three bottles of reconstituted Elical 2 calibrator evaluated in two runs on two Vital Scientific Flexor Junior Analyzers. The target value is the mean of the observed range of values and is listed on value sheet accompanying each lot of Elical 2. The sponsor claims the following stability for Elical 2 after reconstitution: up to 8 hours when stored at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ C, 2 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and 4 weeks when stored at $- 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (freeze only one). The lyophilized material (unopened) is stable until the expiration date printed on the vial, 11 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Elitrol I and II control solutions are value assigned using two Vital Scientific Flexor Junior Analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of Level I and II are the median of the observed values range. After validation of the target value, a confidence range (high and low values) is calculated. The confidence range and target values are listed on the value sheet accompanying each lot of Elitrol I and II. The sponsor claims the following stability after reconstitution: up to 12 hrs between $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 5 days between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 4 weeks between $- 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (when frozen once). The lyophilized material (unopened) is stable until the expiration date printed on the vial, 30 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor states that the Limits of Blank (LoB), Detection (LoD) and Quantitation (LoQ) studies were conducted following CLSI EP17-A. The LoB study was performed by assaying 60 replicates of a blank sample in one assay run. The LoD was determined by assaying 15 replicates of four diluted patient pools with very low creatinine concentrations in one assay run. The LoQ was determined by assaying 15 replicates of four diluted patient pools with low creatinine concentrations (approximately $0 . 2 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ in one assay run. Each study was performed using one Selectra Junior analyzer and one lot of creatinine reagent.

The sponsor states that the limit of blank is $0 . 0 0 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the limit of detection $0 . 0 0 6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , however the analyzer does not report creatinine values below the claimed limit of quantitation. The limit of quantitation based on the study described above is stated to be $0 . 2 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Imprecision of the samples evaluated in the LoQ study ranged from $1 . 4 { - } 4 . 8 \%$ $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A. Testing was performed on a minimum of five concentrations for each interfering substance. Two different clinically relevant concentrations of creatinine (1.58 and $6 . 6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were used for evaluation. Samples with increasing amounts of potential interferents were tested in triplicate and compared to the same sample without the interferent.

The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does not cause $> 1 0 \%$ change between the tested samples and the control sample.

A positive bias was observed with creatine $\geq 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Calcium dobesilate, Methyl-dopa and L-dopa cause falsely low results at therapeutic concentrations.

A summary of these results and interferences is found in the labeling.
