# Description:

The Mission Liquid Urine Control and Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control are prepared from simulated human urine with purified chemicals, constituents of animal origin, preservatives and stabilizers. The controls are available in two levels, ready to use liquid format packaged in dropper bottles under the brand name Mission Liquid Urine Control and in diptube containers under the brand name Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control. The results of the Mission Liquid Urine Control and Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control are compared to the lot-specific expected values listed in the package insert to ensure the consistent performance of Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and Mission Urine Analyzers.

The Mission Dry Strip Urine Control are firm plastic strips onto which reagent areas are affixed. The negative level strips have five reagent areas containing one or more synthetic ingredients. When placed in a measured quantity of distilled or deionized water, the ingredients dissolve out of the reagent areas to produce a Level 1 Control Solution. The Level 2 strips have six reagent areas affixed. The ingredients on the positive level strips dissolve out to produce a Level 2 Control Solution. The results of the Mission Dry Strip Urine Control are compared to the lot-specific expected values listed in the package insert to ensure the consistent performance of Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and Mission Urine Analyzers

# Intended Use:

The Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control and Mission Dry Strip Urine Control are assayed urine controls intended for use in validating the precision of visual and analyzer reading of urinalysis for one or more of the following analytes: Ascorbic acid, Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone (Acetoacetic acid), Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite and Leukocytes. It is intended for professional in vitro diagnostic use only.

# Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as follows:

Guidance document included the FDA "Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material, Issued on June 7, 2007"

# Laboratory Testing:

The performance characteristics of the Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control and Mission Dry Strip Urine Control were evaluated by the following studies: imatrix effects, control value assignment, temperature flexibility, humidity effect, lighting effect, number of dip times (diptube and dry strip only), incubation time (dry strip only), and shelf life and stability.

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

Not Applicable.

# Conclusion:

The laboratory testing demonstrates that the Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control and Mission Dry Strip Urine Control are safe, accurate and easy-to-use. It also demonstrates that the Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control and Mission Dry Strip Urine Control are substantially equivalent to the Bio-Rad Laboratories Liquicheck Urinalysis Control and Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. Chek-Stix Positive and Negative Control Strips for Urine Chemistry, currently sold on the U.S. market.

Dear Mr. Lenart:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21. CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
