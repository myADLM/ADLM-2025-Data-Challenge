# I. Device Description:

The Mission® Liquid Urine Control and Mission® Liquid Diptube Urine Control are prepared from simulated human urine with purified chemicals, constituents of animal origin, preservatives and stabilizers. The controls are available in two levels, ready to use liquid format packaged in dropper bottles under the brand name Mission® Liquid Urine Control and in diptube containers under the brand name Mission® Liquid Diptube Urine Control. The results of the Mission® Liquid Urine Control and Mission® Liquid Diptube Urine Control are compared to the lot-specific expected values listed in the package insert to ensure the consistent performance of Mission® Urinalysis Reagent Strips and Mission® Urine Analyzers.

The Mission® Dry Strip Urine Controls are firm plastic strips onto which reagent areas are affixed. The negative level strips have five reagent areas containing one or more synthetic ingredients. When placed in a measured quantity of distilled or deionized water, the ingredients dissolve out of the reagent areas to produce a Level 1 Control Solution. The Level 2 strips have six reagent areas affixed. The ingredients on the positive level strips dissolve out to produce a Level 2 Control Solution. The results of the Mission® Dry Strip Urine Control are compared to the lot-specific expected values listed in the package insert to ensure the consistent performance of Mission® Urinalysis Reagent Strips and Mission® Urine Analyzers.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: None was provided.

# Stability:

Accelerated stability studies were performed by placing three lots of Level 1 and 2 dropper and diptube urine controls packaged in dropper and diptube configuration at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 20 days to simulate a 24-month shelf life at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The urine controls were read visually and tested on the Mission U120 Urine analyzer using three replicates. The results indicated that they were within the acceptance criteria ranges for Level 1 and Level 2. Real time stability studies to confirm the 24 month shelf-life are ongoing at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Accelerated open stability studies were performed using three lots of dropper and diptube urine controls at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and at room temperature $( 1 5 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 20 days. The controls were tested on the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and read visually and tested on the Mission U120 Urine analyzer. The results indicated that the Level 1 and Level 2 controls were within the acceptance criteria. Real time studies are ongoing to support the 24 month storage time at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The accelerated stability study for the Mission Dry Strip Urine Controls was performed by placing three lots of Level 1 and Level 2 urine controls at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 80 days and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 200 days. They were then tested on the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and read visually and tested on the Mission U120 Urine Analyzer. All controls were within the established acceptance criteria and the shelf life was determined to be 24 months at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real time stability studies are ongoing to support the 24 month storage time at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Real time open stability studies were performed using three lots of Level 1 and Level 2 Dry Strip Urine Control at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for three months. Strips were tested on the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and read visually and tested on the Mission U120 Urine Analyzer. All controls were within the established acceptance criteria. Real time stability studies are ongoing to support the 24 month storage time at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Stability after reconstitution for the Dry Strip Controls was done by reconstituting three lots of Level 1 and Level 2 controls according to the package insert. The strips were initially tested, and then placed at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 hours. The solutions were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature and then retested on the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and read visually and tested on the Mission U120 Urine Analyzer. All controls were within the established acceptance criteria. Stability after reconstitution for the Dry Strip Controls was set to be 8 hours at $2 { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Value Assignment

Control value assignment for the Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control and Mission Dry Strip was done by testing Level 1 and Level 2 using the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips read visually and tested on the Mission U120 Urine analyzer. Three lots of strips and three analyzers were tested for three consecutive days by three operators. All results for level 1 were negative and all results for level 2 showed positive results.

# Matrix Effects

The sponsor performed spiking studies to evaluate matrix effects of the Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control and Mission Dry Strip urine controls compared to human urine. Matrix 1, Matrix 2, and negative human urine were spiked with zero, low and high level concentrations of analyte and measured in triplicate using three lots of Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strip and tested on the Mission U120 Urine Analyzer. The following analytes were studied for matrix effects: leukocytes, nitrite, protein, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, bilirubin, blood, and ascorbic acid. All results showed that Matrix 1 and 2 of the Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control, and the Mission Dry Strip Urine Control met acceptance criteria and perform similarly to negative human urine pools when spiked with various analytes across the measurement range of the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips.

Temperature and humidity studies found that the Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control and Mission Dry Strip Urine Control can provide expected results when tested between $2 { - } 5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and up to a 24 hour exposure to humidity conditions ranging from $5 . 9 5 \%$ relative humidity. Additionally, lighting studies showed that Mission Liquid Urine Control, Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control and Mission Dry Strip Urine Control can provide expected results when tested under white light (fluorescent), yellow light (sodium vapor) and no light for Levels 1 and 2.
