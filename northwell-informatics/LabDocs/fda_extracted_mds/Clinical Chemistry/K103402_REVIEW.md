Traceability and value assignment

DHEA-S is of synthetic origin and purchased from a commercially available source. The Elecsys DHEA-S CalCheck 5 is traceable to internal master calibrators where DHEA-S has been added gravimetrically into human serum matrix.

Value assignment testing is conducted and must pass pre-defined acceptance criteria. Specifically, each of the five CalCheck levels is value assigned using a minimum of three Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 analyzers and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601 analyzers. Each sample is tested in duplicate for total of at least 6 measurements (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers). The target value for each CalCheck is the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range is calculated as $\pm 2 4 \%$ of the assigned value for levels 3-5 and $\pm 3 0 \%$ of the assigned value for level 2. The $\%$ CV is $4 \%$ for levels 3-5 and $10 \%$ for level 2. The label states that each laboratory should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

To ensure the values assigned using the master platform are transferrable and valid for the other instrument platforms, each Elecsys DHES-A CalCheck 5 level is assayed once a day on 8 Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 and 8 MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602 analyzers. The median value for the 8 analyses must be within $10 \%$ of the master platform assigned value $10 \%$ for between analyzer platform tolerances). After this acceptance criterion is met, the assigned values from the master platform are deemed valid for the Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers.

# Stability

Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. CalCheck 5 is stable for 18 months when stored unopened at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The expiration date listed on each CalCheck bottle label reflects this stability time of 18 months. The reconstituted vials are stable up to four hours at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , as supported by the data and stated in the label.
