Date of Preparation of this Summary: Device Trade or Proprietary Name:

Abbott Clinical Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator

Device Common/Usual Name or Classification Name:

Multiconstituent Calibrator (MCC)

Classification Number/Class:

21 CFR 862.1150/ Class lI (Calibrator, Multi-Analyte Mixture)

# Product Code:

JIX

This summary of 510(k) safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

The assigned 510(k) number is: _(k)103403

# Device Description:

# Original ( Abbott Clinical Chemistry MCC (k981706)

A multi-Analyte Calibrator - human serum based, liquid rcady-to-usc calibrator containing Albumin, Calcium, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Glucose, Phosphorus, Total Protein, Triglyceride, Urea and Uric Acid.

# Modified Abbott Clinical Chemistry MCC (k103403)

A multi-Analyte Calibrator - human serum based, liquid ready-to-use calibrator containing Albumin, Calcium, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Glucose, Iron, Lactate, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Total Protein, Triglyceride, Urea and Uric Acid.

Description of modifications:

The modified Abbott Clinical Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator is substantially equivalent to the original Multiconstituent Calibrator (K981 706). The modifications consisted of certification of the following new analytes:

1. Iron   
2Lactate   
3. Magnesium

These modifications did not significantly change the safety and effectiveness of the device as demonstratcd in the Performance Characteristics Summary.

# Intended Use:

For use in calibration of the Albumin, Calcium, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Glucose, Iron, Lactate, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Total Protein, Triglyceride, Urea and Uric Acid assays.

# Indications for use:

This is an in vitro diagnostic product intended for use as a calibration serum in clinical chemistry assays. The MCC contains 13 analytes in a liquid human serum based matrix. The concentrations and activities are suitable for calibration of the Abbott ARCHITECT c8000 System. Constituent concentrations are available at 2 levels.

# Predicate Device Description: MCC (k981706)

• Human serum based, liquid ready-to-use Containing Albumin, Calcium, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Glucose, Phosphorus, Total Protein, Triglyceride, Urea and Uric Acid Shelf-life of 20 months demonstrated by real time testing

# Modified MCC Device:

Human serum based, liquid ready-to-use. Containing Albumin, Calcium, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Glucose, Iron, Lactate, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Total Protein, Triglyceride, Urea and Uric Acid Shclf-life of 20 months was demonstrated by comparison with predicate using accelerated studies. • The modifications are the addition of Iron, Lactate and Magnesium (at physiological levels) to the formulation. Thesc modifications did not significantly change the safety and effectiveness of the device. The stability data confirms that the stability of the new formulation conforms to the stability claims of the previous formulation and traccability to refcrence materials using the same reference methods has been demonstrated to be substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

In determining substantial equivalence, a direct comparison of new and predicate device was performed, refer to table below.

Value assignment and Traceability:

Value assignment is performed as follows:

The testing is performed independently for each of the analytes, using one Abbott Architect c8000 System. For each analyte, system suitability (validity) is verified by calibrating and testing controls with pre-defined ranges. NIST standards are used for applicable analytes (refer to table on the next page for a list of all standards used). The standards may need to be weighed, dissolved and/or diluted to prepare a solution of appropriate concentration for the value assignment.   
• 20 replicates of cach tested calibrator level and of each respective standard solution are tested.   
• The mean analyte values are calculated using the concentration of the standard solution and the absorbance values of the standard and the tested calibrator.   
• The mean analyte values are verified by calibrating the system with the newly value-assigned calibrator, and measuring the referencc standard solutions. Acceptance criterion: the mean value obtained for the reference standard solution must be within 5% from the known standard concentration.

# Stability:

The expiration date claim is 20 months from product dispensing. Open vial stability claim is 7 days at $2 { \cdot } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 24 hours at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

Data to support shelf-life stability of 20 months was established by accelerated stability studies on Architect c8000 Systems.

Open vial stability was established by incubating opened calibrator vials at 30°C for 28 hours, and at 2-8°C for 7 days, both with 3 calibrator lots. Results of thc open vials (means of at least three replicates) were compared to those of freshly opened calibrator vials.

# Conclusion:

The modified Abbott Clinical Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator (MCC) is substantially equivalent to the Abbott Clinical Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator as demonstrated by results obtained in the studies.
