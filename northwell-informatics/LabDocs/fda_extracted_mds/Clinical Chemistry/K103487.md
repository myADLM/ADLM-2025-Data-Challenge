# Device Description

The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test and TD-5301 Pregnancy Test are in vitro diagnostic medical devices, which use the qualitative assay in determining human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentration in urine. The assay is based on an two-site sandwich immunoassay technology.

TD-5301 Pregnancy Test consists of a test strip coated with reagents and enclosed in a plastic cassette. FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test consists of a meter and a plastic test stick containing a test strip. The meter has a slot where can be plugged with a test stick and activate the procedure. This device uses the same test strip, as TD-5301 Pregnancy Test.

5Intended Use For FORA PNC 100 Digital Pregnancy Test

The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test is an in vitro diagnostic test device for the qualitative determination of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. It is intended for use as an aid in the early detection of pregnancy by lay users. Additional clinical examination should be performed to confirm the pregnancy.

The device uses visually read lateral flow technology for the detection of hCG and provides a digitally read result. The device is intended for home use.

# For TD-5301 Pregnancy Test

The TD-5301 Pregnancy Test (Strip) is an in vitro diagnostic test device for the qualitative determination f human chorionicgonadotropin CG) inurine. It is intended for use as an aid in the early detection of pregnancy by lay users. Additional clinical examination should be performed to confirm the pregnancy.

The device uses visually read lateral flow technology for the detection o hCG. The device is intended for home use.

Comparison to Predicate Device A method comparison was performed by two proposed devices and the predicate. Results show that there is over 99% agreement compared with the predicate. The

visual reading of lines of TD-5301 by lay users yields the same results as the digital readout obtained by FORA PNC100. The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test and TD-5301 Pregnancy Test are substantially equivalent to the One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test (K071930).

# 7. Performance Studies

Test strip used with FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test and TD-5301 Pregnancy Test is identical. The sensitivity, specificity and interference, in-use and strag abs nvd wi

Software validation and meter reliability was performed specifically to ensure the performance of FORA PNC100 electronic read-out result. The meter of FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test meets the safety and EMC requirements of IEC/EN 61010-1:2001, IEC/EN 61010-2-101:2002, EN 61326: 2006, IEC 61000-4-2.

A user study was conducted to evaluate two application methods and the easiness of use by following the instructions, and the results demonstrated that the instruction manual of FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test and TD-5301 Pregnancy Test is understandable and clear enough for user, and devices are easy to operate by following the instructions.

# 8. Conclusion

The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test and TD-5301 Pregnancy Test demonstrate satisfactory performance and are suitable for its intended use. The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test and TD-5301 Pregnancy Test are substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Teling Hsu:

We have reviewed your Section Sl0(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class 1I (Special Controls) or class I11 (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807): labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
