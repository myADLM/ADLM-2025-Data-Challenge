# Device Description:

The iBGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of:

iBGStar Blood Glucose Meter BGStar Test Strips BGStar Control Solution

# Intended Use:

The iBGStarT Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of blood glucose levels in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the ingertip, palms (at the base o the .    u multiple patients. The iBGStar™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (In vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The iBGstar Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not for the diagnosis of, or screening for diabetes, and is not intended for use with neonates.

The iBGStar Diabetes Manager Application is intended for use in the home with the capability of sending glucose readings through email to an individual's healthcare professional in the review, analysis and evaluation of glucose test results to support an effective diabetes management program. It is an optional data management software accessory for use with the iBGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
