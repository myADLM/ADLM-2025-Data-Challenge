# I. Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Calibrator 80 is a 2 level human IgE in equine serum containing detergents and preservatives. Two vials of the lyophilized low calibrator and two levels of lyophilized high calibrator are included. All human source materials used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDAapproved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2. The Calibrators 80 target and acceptance ranges are summarized in the table below:

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: ADVIA Centaur Calibrator 80 is traceable to the WHO international standard 75/502. The values for Calibrator 80 are read off the set of internal standards which is comprised of seven levels and span the range of the assay. These internal Total IgE standards are traceable to WHO material 75/502.

# Value Assignment:

Values are assigned using a set of seven internal standards. Calibrator values are assigned to these internal standards and are verified with the WHO international standard 75/502.

Value Assignment of ADVIA Centaur Calibrator 80 is performed using one ADVIA Centaur Total IgE reagent lot, 20 replicates, and a set of internal standards on one ADVIA Centaur analyzer according to Siemens Value Assignment Procedure. This testing is done in a single day with one operator.

The tIgE assay utilizes a 2-Point calibration system. Calibrator values are assigned using master curve standards which span the entire range of the assay. Two sets of controls are run to verify the validity of the runs. In order to verify that values are correct, the calibrators are substituted for Master Curve standards and known controls are calculated off the newly assigned calibrators. Control values are then compared to specifications to ensure that the values of the new 2-Point calibrators are correctly assigned. The Total IgE Calibrators have expected values of 35 and $1 8 2 5 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# Stability:

Real Time, accelerated, open vial) and on board stability studies were carried out on the ADVIA Centaur. Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate.

Open vial stability:

The open-vial (reconstituted) claim is 60 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

On Board Stability:

The On-System stability claim is onboard 8-hour at room temperature.

Real time/Closed Vial stability:

The Shelf-life stability is 16 months refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ; however it will be updated as additional real time stability data becomes available. Product label will state “Lyophilized–until the expiration date on the vial label”.

Dilution study: Not applicable.
