# II. Description of the new device

The control solution is a buffered aqueous solution with glucose containing no ingredients of biological origin, or in concentrations qualifying as a controlled product under the Controlled Products Regulation. The primary differences in the composition of the OneTouch Select, Ultra and Vita branded Control Solutions to that of the current, OneTouch Ultra Control are the type and relative content of buffer system, type and relative content of the viscosity adjusting agent, type and relative content of the preservative system, a lower concentration of dye, and a relative reduction in the content of water. The OneTouch Ultra control is currently in use with all LifeScan blood glucose test systems under the OneTouch Ultra, OneTouch Select and OneTouch Vita brands. The new control solution is reformulated for optimized performance across these various brands of test strips, and will be distributed under the same brands as the current Ultra control.

# )  Intended use of the device

LifeScan OneTouch Ultra Control Solution is intended for use to verify the performance of the LifeScan OneTouch Ultra Family and the OneTouch Ping™ Meter Remote blood glucose monitoring test systems at a glucose level printed on the test strip vial. The LifeScan OneTouch Ultra Control Solution is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home.

LifeScan OneTouch Select Control Solution is intended for use to verify the performance of the LifeScan OneTouch Select blood glucose monitoring test system at a glucose level printed on the test strip vial. The LifeScan OneTouch Select Control Solution is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home.

LifeScan OneTouch Vita Control Solution is intended for use to verify the performance of the LifeScan OneTouch Vita blood glucose monitoring test system at a glucose level printed on the test strip vial. The LifeScan OneTouch Vita Control Solution is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home.

# (a) (2) Technological characteristics of the device.

This material consists of viscosity-adjusted, aqueous glucose control solution prepared with a single concentration of D-glucose with recovery on the test systems in the range typically considered normal, fasting glucose for a non-diabetic person. This solution has been optimized to simulate the response of whole blood on the LifeScan OneTouch Ultra, Select and Vita branded blood glucose test systems. The solution contains no hazardous, human or animal derived components.

Dear Mr. Byrd:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
