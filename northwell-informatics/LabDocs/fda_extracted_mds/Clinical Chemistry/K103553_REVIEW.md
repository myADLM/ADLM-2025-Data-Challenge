# I. Device Description:

This single level control solution consists of glucose in water with buffers and stabilizers, a viscosity adjusting agent, a preservative, and a dye. The device is formulated to provide glucose values representative of fasting blood glucose values in non‐diabetic subjects. The active ingredient, glucose, is the same analyte measured in blood specimens by the relevant blood glucose test systems. The viscosity and other proprietary characteristics of the solution have been modified to mimic the measurement of blood specimens with this non‐biological, non‐toxic, aqueous solution. The product does not contain red blood cells, and so, cannot be used to assess hematocrit effects on glucose measurement. The solution has a red color to enhance its visibility.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The control solution is formulated gravimetrically to contain $1 1 5 \mathrm { m g }$ glucose/dL solution using scales traceable to NIST traceable mass standards. The solution is verified to conform to specification by testing on YSI 2300 calibrated using NIST traceable calibrators and in parallel to internally prepared standard solutions traceable to NIST SRM 917d.

Value assignment:

Control ranges are provided on the test strip vial label. Following all other manufacturing lot acceptance testing, each lot of test strips is tested using 100 test strips and 50 meters designated for value assignment testing. For value assignment to be valid, the imprecision from this series of measurements must be $\leq 2 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ SD, and at least $9 5 \%$ of all measurement values must fall within a range assigned as mean of this series; $- 1 0 \%$ to $+ 2 0 \%$ .

Stability:

Stability characteristics of the Lifescan OneTouch Ultra, Select and Vita Control Solutions stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ were determined under closed and opened conditions in real time stability studies. The closed and unopened Control Solutions were assayed using an YSI2300 analyzer every three months for 27 months and the results were compared. The study satisfied the acceptance criteria and supports the closed (unopened) bottle claim of 27 months.

An open vial stability of 90 days was demonstrated by comparing the results of material from vials stored at $3 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } / 8 6 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F }$ (opened once per week) to unopened vials stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ using an YSI2300 analyzer. The recommendations in the labeling are to store control solutions at room temperature and additional warnings are given to not refrigerate control solutions.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: The expected values are provided on the test strip vial label.

N. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
