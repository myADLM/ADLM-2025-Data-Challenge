# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Audit™ MicroCV™ Free T4 / Free T3 Linearity Set consists of five levels of human and bovine albumin based matrix. Each level contains the following analytes: Free T4 and Free T3. The five levels demonstrate a linear relationship to each other for their respective analytes, reagents, and instruments.

This product may also be used as a quality control material for these analytes. When used for quality control purposes, it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use the values provided only as guides. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays on automatic analyzers. The Audit™ Free T4 / Free T3 Linearity Set is “For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only”.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Performance testing was conducted on the Biomerieux V12 Compact Mini-Vidas Immunoassay Analyzer (for Free T4) and the Siemens Centaur XP (for Free T3)

# I. Device Description:

The Audit™ MicroCV™ Free T4 / Free T3 Linearity Set is a 5 level quality control solution set containing Free T4 / Free T3 analytes as the messurand. The base matrix is a human and bovine based serum albumin and the free T4 and free T3 in each control are the endogenous levels found in the human and bovine serum used to make each control. The linearity set is used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of Free T4 / Free T3 analytes. Level A is near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit of instruments. Levels $\mathrm { B } - \mathrm { D }$ are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

All human source materials used to produce this product have been tested for HbsAg, anti-HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 and found to be non-reactive by FDA cleared/approved tests.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP6-A: evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The Audit™ Micro CV™ Free T4 / Free T3 Linearity Set is prepared such that a linear relationship exists among all five levels (Levels A through E). Level A has a concentration near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit level of instruments. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E using dilution schemes based on guidelines provided by CLSI EP6-A.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and Value Assignment

All components of the Audit™ Micro CV™ Free T4 / Free T3 Linearity Set are obtained from a commercial vendor and inspected in-house.

Value assignment for each analyte was conducted by repeat analyses on the Biomerieux Mini-Vidas analyzer (Free T4) or the Siemens Centaur analyzer (Free T3). All control material levels for both analytes were measured 4 times (1 lot) and the mean values were used to assign the target concentration values for each of the five linearity set levels. The target ranges were calculated $1 \mathrm { s } \pm 1 5 \%$ of the target value. The mean concentration values of each level were plotted (concentration value vs. assigned level) and a linear regression value obtained. If the five-point linear regression $\mathrm { R } ^ { \hat { 2 } }$ value was greater that 0.95 and if the plots are linear, the product passed the linearity test. Values may change depending on lot, instrumentation, methodology, and assay temperature. Lot-specific expected value ranges are provided in the package insert. Expected value ranges for each level of the linearity set are summarized in the table below.
