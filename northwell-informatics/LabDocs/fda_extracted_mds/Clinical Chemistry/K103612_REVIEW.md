# K. Standard/Guidance Document referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable. b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: ALTI is traceable to the IFCC ALT $@$ $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ primary reference method. The ALT and AST methods uses the older traceability and value assignment methods cleared under k061390 as ENZ 2CAL-KC320.

Value Assignment: For use with the Vista® Alanine Aminotransferase (ALTI) method, the bottle value assignment for ALTI in the Vista® ENZ 2 Calibrator (KC321) is accomplished using an anchor pool, traceable to the IFCC reference method, and then, a master pool assigned based on the anchor pool using the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System. The bottle value assignment for ALT and AST methods uses the older traceability and value assignment methods cleared under k061390 as ENZ 2CAL-KC320.

Stability: Calibrator shelf life for the Dimension Vista™ Enzyme 2 Calibrator was determined to be 12 months using the Dimension Vista System in a real time study. A vial that has been punctured (opened) by the instrument and stored on board has a seven day stability claim. Once cap is removed, assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
