The ammonia formed then reacts with 2-oxoglutarate and NADH in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase to yield glutamate and NAD. Two moles of NADH are oxidized for each mole of urea present. NADH absorbs strongly at 340 nm, whereas NAD* does not. The initial rate of decrease in absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 340 nm/647 nm, is proportional to the urea concentration in the urine sample. In the ACE Calcium-Arsenazo Reagent assay, calcium reacts with Arsenazo III in an acidic solution to form a blue-purple colored complex, which is measured bichromatically at 647 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the calcium concentration in the urine sample. In the ACE Creatinine Reagent assay, creatinine reacts with picric acid in an alkaline medium to form a red-orange colored complex, which absorbs strongly at 505 nm. The rate of complex formation, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at 505 nm/573 nm during a fixed time interval, is directly proportional to the creatinine concentration in the urine sample. In the ACE Inorganic Phosphorus U.V. Reagent assay, under acidic conditions, inorganic phosphorus reacts with ammonium molybdate to form an unreduced phosphomolybdate complex, which absorbs strongly at 340 nm. The increase in absorbance, measured</td><td>K875285</td></tr></table>
