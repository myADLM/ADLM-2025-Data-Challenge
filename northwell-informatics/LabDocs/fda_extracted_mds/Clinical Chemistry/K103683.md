# Device Description:

IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Progesterone assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. Calibration Verification Material (CVM) is traceable to this standard. One set of four vials, $2 m L$ each, containing low, intermediate and high levels of progesterone in processed human serum, with preservative, and a progesterone-free sample. The Calibration Verifiers are supplied in liquid form, ready to use. Store unopened materials refrigerated at $_ { 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ until expiration date. Stable at $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 30 days after opening.

# Warnings and Precautions:

For in vitro diagnostic use.

Follow universal precautions, and handle all components as if capable of transmitting infectious agents. Source materials derived from human blood were tested and found nonreactive for syphilis; for antibodies to HIV 1 and 2; for hepatitis B surface antigen; and for antibodies to hepatitis C.

Sodium azide, at concentrations less than $0 . 1 ~ 9 / \mathrm { d L }$ , has been added as a preservative. On disposal, flush with large volumes of water to prevent the buildup of potentially explosive metal azides in lead and copper plumbing.

# Statement of Intended Use:

For in vitro diagnostic use, for the calibration verification of the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Progesterone assay (LKPW).

# Performance:

The traceability, value assignment, and stability of the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Progesterone calibration Verification Material (CVM) has been validated following procedures of Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. These Progesterone CVMs are substantially equivalent to currently marketed devices with similar intended uses.

Re: k103683 Trade Name: IMMULITE®/IMMULITE 1000 Progesterone Calibration Verification Material (CVM) Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660 Regulation Name: Quality Control Material (Assayed and Unassayed) Regulatory Class: Class I, Reserved Product Codes: JJX Dated: April 15, 2011 Received: April 18, 2011

Dear Mr. Joseph:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
