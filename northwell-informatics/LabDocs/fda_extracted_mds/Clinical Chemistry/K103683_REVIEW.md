# I. Device Description:

The Calibration Verification Material (CVM) contains one set of four vials, $2 \mathrm { m L }$ each, spiked with low, intermediate and high levels of progesterone in processed human serum, with preservative, and a progesterone-free sample. The Calibration Verifiers are supplied in liquid form, ready to use. Store unopened materials refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until expiration date. The product is labeled as stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 30 days after opening.

Warnings and Precautions: For in vitro diagnostic use. Follow universal precautions, and handle all components as if capable of transmitting infectious agents. Individual source materials derived from human blood were tested by FDA approved/cleared methods and found nonreactive for syphilis; for antibodies to HIV 1 and 2; for hepatitis B surface antigen; and for antibodies to hepatitis C. Sodium azide, at concentrations less than $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ , has been added as a preservative. On disposal, flush with large volumes of water to prevent the buildup of potentially explosive metal azides in lead and copper plumbing.

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE Progesterone CVMs are traceable to an internal standard manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. Internal reference standards are prepared using Progesterone stock solution which had its concentration defined by optical density.

# Stability:

Stability studies are being conducted on two lots under the following conditions: real time $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 2 years, room temperature $( 1 5 \small { - } 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for seven days, and accelerated $( 3 5 . 3 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for three days. Current testing supports a seven month storage claim at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and real time studies are ongoing to support a 2 year stability claim.

Open vial studies are being performed for ${ \tt > } 9 0 $ days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Vials are opened and tested at day zero and at each time point. Percent recovery is calculated using the average dose from triplicate results compared to the day 0 testing and the acceptance criteria is that the open vial must be within $10 \%$ from day 0 material for progesterone $\geq 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and within $1 5 \%$ for progesterone $\geq 0 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $< 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The sponsor will claim that it is stable for 14 day once reconstituted and stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Value Assignment

The IMMULITE® calibrators and CVMs are value assigned using purified Progesterone stock solution whose concentration was defined by optical density. The calibrators and CVMs are tested on minimum of 9 runs comprised of minimum 3 systems and 3 different kit lots. The calibrator values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run independently. The average analyte recovered for each CVM assigns their value. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient sample panels and controls using the assigned calibrator and CVM values. Three levels of commercially available controls and four levels of human serum based pools are used to validate the CVM value assignment. The target specifications for production lots are:

The Sponsor spiked three concentrations of progesterone CVM into a reference lot, evaluation lot, and male and female human serum lots. The progesterone values of the reference lot were compared to the evaluation and human serum lots. The acceptance criteria were $1 0 0 \% \pm 1 5 \%$ with an overall average of $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Each of the samples met the acceptance criteria, and the Sponsor concluded that there were no matrix effects.
