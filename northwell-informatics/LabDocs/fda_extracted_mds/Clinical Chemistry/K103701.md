ADVIA Chemistry Liquid Specific Protein Calibrator is substantially equivalent to the Randox Liquid Protein Calibrator cleared under K03 1608 and K061056.

# G. Device Description:

ADVIA Chemistry Liquid Specific Protein Calibrator is a multi-analyte, liquid buffered based product containing multiple analytes (proteins derived from human source). The kit consists of 6 vials each of 6 calibrator levels which are ready for use (no preparation is required). The constituent concentrations of these Calibrators are present at levels 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Level 1 is a zero level. The volume per vial is 1.0 mL.

Anti-streptolysin-O (ASO), Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT), Prealbumin (PREALB), Rheumatoid Factor (RF), Immunoglobulin A_2, (IGA_2), Immunoglobulin G_2 (IGG_2), Immunoglobulin M_2 (IGM_2), Complement C3 (C3), Complement C4 (C4), Haptoglobin (HAPT), Transferrin (TRF), and Alpha-Acid-Glycoprotein (AAG) are value assigned for ADVIA 1650 Chemistry systems.

In addition the calibrator also contains Ferritin and CRP with no specific value assignment on ADVIA Chemistry systems at this time.

# H. Intended Use:

The ADVIA Chemistry Liquid Protein Calibrator is for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry systems for the Alpha-Acid-Glycoprotein (AAG), Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT), Anti-streptolysin-O_2 (ASO_2), Complement C3 (C3), Complement C4 (C4), Haptoglobin (HAPT), Immunoglobulin A_2 (IGA_2), Immunoglobulin G_2 (IGG_2), Immunoglobulin M_2 (IGM_2), Prealbumin (PREALB), Rheumatoid Factor (RF), Transferrin (TRF) methods
