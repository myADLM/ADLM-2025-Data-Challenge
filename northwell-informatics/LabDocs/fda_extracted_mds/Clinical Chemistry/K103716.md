The Elecsys Folate RBC assay employs a competitive test principle using natural folate binding protein specific for folate. Manually prepared hemolysate samples are used with this assay. Folate in the sample competes with the added folate (labeled with biotin) for the binding sites on folate binding protein (labeled with ruthenium complex). Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode encoded on the reagent packaging.

The Elecsys Folate RBC CalSet is a lyophilized product consisting of human serum with folate in two concentration ranges. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix. This calibrator is used to calibrate the Elecsys Folate RBC assay.

()The Elecsys Folate RBC CalCheck is a lyophilized product consisting of a hemolysate with folic acid. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix. This solution is used to verify the calibration established with the Elecsys Folate RBC CalSet.

In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. &gt;5 mg/day), no sample should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin administration. No interference was observed from rheumatoid factors up to a concentration of 1000 IU/mL. In vitro tests were performed on 18 commonly used pharmaceuticals and in addition on human erythropoietin. No interference with the assay was found. It is contraindicated to measure samples of patients receiving therapy with certain pharmaceuticals, e.g. methotrexate or leucovorin, because of the cross- reactivity of folate binding protein with these compounds. In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to streptavidin and ruthenium can occur.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Expected Values RBC Folate (folate in erythrocyte fraction) Expected = 499-1504 ng/mL (2.5th</td><td>Whole Blood Folate (from hemolysate sample) Expected = 209-640 (2.5th - 97.5th percentile)</td><td>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition Expected = 4.6 - 34.8 ng/mL (all ages &amp; male/female)</td></tr></table>

Re: k103716 Trade/Device Name: Roche Elecsys Folate RBC, Folate RBC CalCheck, Folate RBC CalSet Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1295 Regulation Name: Folic acid test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: CGN, JJX, JIT Dated: April 8, 2011 Received: April 12, 2011

Dear Ms. Goodwin:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Tite 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (1 CFR Part 820).This letter wil allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
