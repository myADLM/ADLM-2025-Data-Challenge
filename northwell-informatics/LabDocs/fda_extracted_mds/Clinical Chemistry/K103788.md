# Substantial Equivalence:

It has been demonstrated that the PENTRA C200 can be considered substantially equivalent to the predicate device ABX PENTRA 400 (K052007).

The I.S.E. module has been similarly demonstrated as being substantially equivalent to the predicate device K052007.

The ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP used on the PENTRA C200 has been demonstrated substantially equivalent to the same reagent used on the ABX PENTRA 400 as described in K052007.

# Description:

The PENTRA C200 is a benchtop clinical chemistry analyzer using two measuring principles: absorbance and ion selective electrodes.

The instrument may be summarized as follows :

Multi-parametric (up to 15 simultaneous tests $^ +$ 3 ISE tests)   
On routine or Stat   
90 (without ISE) to 360 (with ISE) tests $1$ hour (in single or bi-reaction mode) (analytical cycle of 40 seconds)   
random access working on primary tubes or sample cups   
ABX PENTRA reagent cassettes are compact and ready-to-use.   
on board bar-code reader is used to identify newly loaded reagent cassettes and samples for patient identification

# Intended Use / Indications for use :

The PENTRA C200 is a discrete photometric benchtop chemistry analyzer for use in clinical laboratories. It is not intended for use in Point of Care settings.

It duplicates manual analytical procedures by performing various steps such as pipetting, mixing, heating and measuring color intensity. The PENTRA C200 is intended for quantitative measurements of a variety of analytes: Glucose, Sodium, Potassium and Chloride.

ABX Pentra Glucose HK CP reagent with associated calibrators and controls are for quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of glucose in serum and plasma using glucose hexokinase method by colorimetry. 5 Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.

The I.S.E. (lon Selective Electrode) module is intended for the quantitative determination of Sodium, Potassium and Chloride in serum, plasma and urine by potentiometry using ion selective electrode with associated reference solution, calibrators and controls.

Measurement of Sodium, Potassium and Chloride are used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
