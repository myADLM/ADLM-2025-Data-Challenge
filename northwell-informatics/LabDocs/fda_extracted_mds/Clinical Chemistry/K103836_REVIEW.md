# K. Standard/ Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

The values for the commercial Dimension ENZ II CAL Levels 1, 2, and 3 are assigned by creating an anchor pool from native human serum and using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry by an IFCC reference laboratory yielding certified results (the zero level pool has a bovine serum albumin matrix). The Master Pools are made by spiking commercially purified ALT into the BSA calibrator base and each Master Pool level is assigned from anchor pool curves run on the Dimension Vista system. An ALT stock solution is created by spiking commercially purified ALT into a BSA base. The concentration is determined from a Dimension® instrument calibrated with Master Pool calibrators. The calculated quantities of ALT stock solution are added to levels 2 and 3 of the commercial calibrator; the zero calibrator is made of bovine serum albumin only. The concentration of the commercial calibrator is verified by measuring recovery on an instrument calibrated with ENZ II Master Pools. Each commercial lot is verified to be within acceptable ranges with an instrument calibrated with Master Pools. The final bottle values are assigned against the master pool curves using multiple instruments and reagent lots. The bottle value for each level is the mean of the replicates.

# Stability:

The calibrators are tested for shelf life projections for a period of at least 12 months, stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The calibrators are tested at structured intervals against a portion of the same lot stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Open vial stability was determined by opening a vial at day 0 and withdrawing an amount of the calibrator and recapping the vial and storing at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The material in the vials was tested on day 8, 15, 22, and 31 versus freshly opened material. Once cap is removed, assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
