# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI - Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices - EP05-A2 CLSI - Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods - EP06-A CLSI - Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples - EP09-A2

# L. Test Principle:

Glucose concentration is measured by an oxygen rate method employing a Beckman Coulter Oxygen electrode. A sample is injected in a reaction cup containing a glucose oxidase solution. The ratio used is one part sample to 76 parts reagent. The peak rate of oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. Oxygen is consumed at the same rate as glucose reacts to form gluconic acid.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run and total imprecision studies were designed from CLSI Guideline EP5-A2, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.” The experimental design utilized duplicate sample analysis, twice daily, over the course of twenty working days.

The objective of this testing was to verify the DxC v5.0 software changes at system level has not induced inadvertent harm to the functioning of the DxC system. This was assessed via an EP5 Random Access Precision performance evaluation with a representative chemistry, Glucose running on DxC 800 System with the v5.0 software.

Results of the within run and total precision evaluation for the SYNCHRON System Glucose (GLUCm) Reagent.
