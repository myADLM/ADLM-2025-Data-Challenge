# 5.0 Device description

AG-608N Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System and AG-608N MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the amount of sugar (glucose)

in whole blood. The glucose testing is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip. Your meter measures the current, calculates the blood glucose level, and displays the result. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

# 6.0 Intended use

# 6.1 AG-608N Single BGMS

The AG-608N single Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh. The AG-608N single Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The AG-608N single Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The AG-608N single Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, nor for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The AGS-1000N single Test Strips are for use with the AG-608N single Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh.

The AG-608N control solutions are intended for use with the AG-608N single Blood Glucose Monitoring System, to check that the glucose meter and test strips are working properly and that you are doing the test correctly. These solutions contain a known range of glucose, as indicated on the bottles.

# 6.2 AG-608N MULTI BGMS

The AG-608N MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh. The AG-608N MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is intended for multiple-patient use in professional healthcare settings as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control program. The system is only used with single-use lancing devices.

The AG-608N MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, nor for neonatal use. Alternative site testing such as the palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The AGS-1000N MULTI Test Strips are for use with the AG-608N MULTI Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and.thigh.

The AG-608N control solutions are intended for use with the AG-608N MULT! Blood Glucose Monitoring System, to check that the glucose meter and test strips are working properly. These solutions contain a known range of glucose, as indicated on the bottles.

Non-clinical test and the clinical test are done according to the above standard.

# 9.0 Comparison to the predict device and the conclusion

AG-608N Single and AG-608N MULTI are similar with the predicate device AG-608, however, the appearance is different from AG-608, it uses the different test strips, AG-608N Single and AG-608N MULTI can test the blood glucose at the alternative site other than the finger, it also has the USB function. The hematocrit range is different, the altitude, the memory capability, the Battery Life are also changed. AG-608N Single and AG-608N MULTI also has a USB function.

However, the test in this submission provides demonstration that these small differences do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness.
