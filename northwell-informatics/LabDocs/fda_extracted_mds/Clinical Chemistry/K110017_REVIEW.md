# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO 15197 and CLSI EP-5A. Venous whole blood adjusted to 5 glucose levels with hematocrit ${ \sim } 4 0 \%$ was used for within-day precision studies. Each concentration was tested 10 times using three test strip lots, for a total of 100 tests per blood glucose level. Results are summarized below:

Within Day precision:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor performed linearity studies using whole blood samples with 11 different glucose concentration levels covering the full measuring range (20- $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Measurements were taken 5 times for each level and the values of the AG-608N meter were compared to those obtained from the YSI-2300. Linear regression analysis is summarized below:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 9 5 9 \mathbf { x } + 2 . 6 7 6 9 , \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 3
$$

The measuring range of the AG-608 N Single/Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor claims that the system accuracy of the AG-608 N Single/Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is calibrated to a laboratory analyzer, YSI 2300. See comparison studies in 2a below.

One levels of control material, Level II (96 to $1 4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) is available for use with this test system.

Value assignment:

The control solutions $\mathrm { ( L e v e l \ I 3 0 - 5 0 m g / d L }$ ; Level I $\mathrm { I } 9 6 { - } 1 4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Level $\mathrm { I I I } 2 8 0 { - } 4 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ are prepared in an aqueous matrix. Value assignment was established using 5 glucose meters and 100 test strips from one test strip lot. The control range for each control solution is listed on the test strip vial. The final control ranges, printed on the vials, are within $\pm 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for Level I and $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the mean value for Level I and II. The expected results may change with each new lot. However, in the package insert, the user is directed to compare their control result with the range printed on the test strip vial.

# Stability:

Control solution and test strip stability was assessed with accelerated studies and on-going real-time studies. Testing supports the claimed shelf life of 24 month shelf-life when stored at $^ { 3 9 }$ to $\delta \boldsymbol { \delta } ^ { \circ } \boldsymbol { F }$ $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of $- 8 0 \%$ and a 90 day stability after opening when stored at 39 to $\delta \boldsymbol { \delta } ^ { \circ } \boldsymbol { F }$ with relative humidity of $- 8 0 \%$ .

d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the devices is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . This range was validated via the linearity study (see section M.1.b.).

e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples at three glucose concentrations ${ \sim } 8 0$ , 120 and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) that were prepared and divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. The potential interferants (2 levels) were added to the sample and each sample was tested 5 times.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison: System Accuracy:

The sponsor conducted an accuracy study to demonstrate that the accuracy of the candidate device is equivalent to the reference method, YSI 2300. Testing was performed with 2 trained operators and a total of 100 capillary samples. The total range of samples tested was $2 5 { - } 5 3 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples ${ < } 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and ${ \scriptstyle > 4 0 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were glycolyzed or spiked. Distribution of blood glucose concentration across the samples tested was in accordance with the ISO15197. The studies met the ISO 15197 accuracy criteria where ninety-five percent $( 9 5 \% )$ of the individual glucose results shall fall within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of the results at glucose concentrations ${ < } 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 2 0 \%$ at glucose concentrations $\ge 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Linear regression results are presented below:

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and other alternative sites (palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh). Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

Auto-coding: No calibration is required from the user, since all test strips have the same one-code.

6. Quality Control:

One level of glucose control solution (Level II), is provided within the kit from the sponsor. An additional two levels Level I and Level III are available for purchase separately, as stated in the labeling. The labeling provides instructions on when to test control materials.. If the test results fall outside the range printed on the test strip vial, the user is instructed to contact the Customer Care Line at 1-

877-342-2385 for customer support available 24 hours a day/7 days a week, except USA Federal Holidays.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Altitude Study: An altitude study was performed in an altitude simulation chamber with whole blood samples obtained from 20 volunteers with the glucose range of 66 to $4 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was tested with 4 glucose meters and one test strip lot. The study protocol, data and acceptance criteria of $\pm 1 0$ individual bias across the entire testing range were provided and found to be adequate. Altitudes up to 10,744 feet $( 3 , 2 7 5 \mathrm { m } )$ do not affect test results.

# 2. Hematocrit Study:

A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 7 glucose concentrations (\~25, ${ \sim } 7 5$ , ${ \sim } 1 5 0$ , ${ \sim } 2 7 0$ , ${ \sim } 3 8 0$ , ${ \sim } 4 7 0$ and ${ \sim } 5 7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). distributed across the measuring range and tested at 10 hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and $6 5 \%$ ). Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested in duplicate of 10 using two test strip lots and 2 glucose meters. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same glucose concentration at normal $( 4 0 \% )$ hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value. All results were within $\pm 1 5 \%$ individual bias supporting the claimed hematocrit range of $20 \%$ .

3. Specimen volume study: A study was performed using samples in the range of 47 to $4 6 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to evaluate effect of different sample volumes $( 2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , $1 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , 0.7 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ , $0 . 6 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) on the performance of this device. Results of samples at each sample volume tested were compared to the corresponding YSI values. Results from these studies support the claimed sample volume of $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

4. Lay user questionnaire: Lay users evaluated the ease of use of the device and the presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the $\mathrm { A G { - } 6 0 8 \ N / \ A G { - } 6 0 8 \ N }$ MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems were easy to use and most answered “easy” and “very easy” to each question.

5. Disinfection studies: Infection Control Studies: The devices are intended for single-patient use (AG-608N Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System) or multiple-patient use (AG-608N Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System). Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters and lancing device by outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration #46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials for each of the meters and lancing device after 11,000 cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps with the CaviWipes. The robustness studies were

designed to stimulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

6. Data transfer study: The 40 study participants, following instructions in User’s manual, were able to transmit results from the meter to the PC application (cleared under k102678) via USB. The study participants ranged in age, education, and were about equally divided between males and females. Those study participants also completed a questionnaire in response to whether the data transmission feature is easy to use. The sponsor concluded that the users’ responses indicated that data transmission function was easy to operate by following the User’s manuals.

7. Temperature and Humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using the AG-608 N glucose meter with venous whole blood samples at 5 glucose levels $( < 5 0 , 5 0 - 1 0 0 , 1 0 1 - 2 0 0 , 2 0 1 - 4 0 0 , > 4 0 1 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Results demonstrated that AG-608 N (meters and test strips) can be stored under conditions of 39 to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ and relative humidity of $- 8 0 \%$ . The test strip labeling states to store the test strips in a cool dry place between 39 to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ . Therefore, the storage conditions for the glucose meter listed in the User’s manuals and supported by the studies are 39 to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ and $- 8 0 \%$ humidity.

8. Open-vial-in-use test strip studies were performed at the combined extremes of $1 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ( $4 6 . 4 \mathrm { - } 5 6 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ RH: $12 \%$ , $1 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $R \mathrm { H } { : } 8 8 \%$ , $4 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 1 0 0 . 4 \mathrm { - } 1 0 7 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ $R H : 1 1 \%$ , and $4 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ RH: $8 8 \%$ with venous whole blood samples at 3 glucose levels $( \sim 7 0 , \sim 1 2 0$ and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). The study protocol, study data when individual measurements were compared to the YSI were reviewed and found to be adequate. Therefore, the operating conditions stated in the User’s manual and supported by the studies are 50 to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (10 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) with relative humidity of $2 5 \%$ to $80 \%$ .

9. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained SMOG grade level scores of 8.0 or lower for the User’s Manual, test strip insert and control insert.

10. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed/passed and a certificate to Andon was provided.
