# Matrix:

Normal horse serum

# Constituents:

Unconjugated Estriol spiked in normal horse serum, with100 ppm Proclin 950 as a preservative.

# Preparation method:

The IMMULITE uE3 Calibration Verification Material levels contain Estriol spiked in normal horse serum and 100 ppm Proclin 950 as a preservative.

# uE3 CVM Value Assignment:

The uE3 reference calibrator values are assigned by using a panel of real serum samples from pregnancy patients which were value assigned by GC-MS. This reference calibrator lot was then used to assign values of uE3 CVM. The reference calibrator and CVM are run on both IMMULITE/IMMULITE $\textcircled{8}$ 1000 and IMMULITE $\textcircled{8}$ 2000 systems. The average observed value for each CVM is used as their assigned value. Quality control is then performed by monitoring the recovery of controls.

# Protocol:

Production lots of calibration verification materials are value assigned against the reference calibrators using multiple reagent lots which are run on at least three different instruments.

# Calculations:

Calibration verification material values are derived using four-parameter weighted data algorithm reduction of the reference calibrator for each run on each instrument. Calibration verification material values are then averaged across all instruments.

# Assay Range (Target u)

0.07-12 ng uE3/mL

# Validation of Value Assignment:

Controls and Calibration Verification Material (CVM) levels are run to examine against the specification.

# Acceptance Criteria:

Calibration Verification Material (CVM) ranges fall within established ranges for all levels.

# Calibration Interval:

Not Applicable for Calibration Verification Material (CVM)

# Traceability:

Calibration Verification Material CVM traceability is internal reference calibrators. Reference calibrators are traceable to individual human samples assigned with GC-MS values.

# Controls:

Commercially available controls are recommended.

# QC Acceptance Limit:

To monitor system performance and chart trends, as a minimum requirement, it is recommended to assay two levels of quality control material on each day that samples are analyzed. It is also recommended to assay quality control samples when performing a two point Adjustment. Use of commercially available control materials with at least three levels is recommended. Control results are considered acceptable if they are within the range published for the system or within the range established by the customer using an appropriate internal laboratory quality control scheme.

The recommended assay adjustment interval was based on the analyte recovery of the controls and samples from kit reagents stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ over time. The control testing frequency is done according to standard practices in clinical laboratory quality control schemes.

# Warnings and Precautions:

Please refer to attached IMMULITE Unconjugated Estriol (uE3) Calibration Verification Material Instruction for Use document for Warnings and Precautions.

# "For In Vitro Diagnostic Use" Statement:

Please refer to attached IMMULITE Unconjugated Estriol (uE3) Calibration Verification Material Instruction for Use document for the In Vitro Diagnostic Use Statement.

Dear Mr. Joseph

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in inierstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
