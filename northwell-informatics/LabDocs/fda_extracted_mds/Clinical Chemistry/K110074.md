# 4. Device Description: 4.1 Blood Glucose Concentration Measurement

The HL568 Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose System is comprised of the HL568 Blood Glucose Meter, HL568 Blood Glucose Test Strip, HL568 Control Solution (2 levels), a lancing device and lancets. All the measured values can be read out in one LCD panel, battery operated and the blood glucose meter is portable. The Subject Device is self-test IVD medical device which is intended for quantitative measurement of blood glucose $\mathfrak { \beta }$ -D-glucose) levels from fresh capillary whole blood obtained from the fingertip and used outside the body only ( in vitro diagnostic use). It is intended for over-the-counter, home use by single patient to measure the glucose concentration for aiding diabetes management.

# 4.2 Test Principle

The test principle based on the electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose oxidase method. Each test strip reacts with glucose in the blood sample to produce a current proportional to the blood glucose level. This reaction is measured by the meter and displayed as the blood glucose result.

# 4.3 USB data transmission Function

The Subject Device is designed to have USB computer interface to allow users make use of their storage memory data more personalized. Users can transfer the readings of their blood glucose meters to the connected personal computer (PC) via USB cable to save and manage their personal data. Once the software program included in the accompany software CD is installed, users can manage their measurement data personally, such as transferring data, deleting data, viewing the readings on a chart and restoring data. (Please refer to Attachment A-4-1, A-4-7(SDS, SRS), A-4-11(Functionality validation report) and A-5-5(D-FMEA) for more detail information)

# 4.4 Audio function

Subject Device, HL568 Blood Glucose Meter is featured with an audio function for use to easily and efficiently perform the glucose testing. It provides an auditory aid for the users to know the measured result by hearing and to use the device step by step. When, $\clubsuit$ or symbol appears on the screen, it indicates the audio function is on with volume from high to low. User can use this optional feature at their discretion. (Please refer to Attachment A-4-1, A-4-7 (SDS, SRS), A-4-11 (Functionality validation report) and A-5-5(D-FMEA) for more detail information)

# 4.5 Special condition for use statement(s)

HL568 Blood Glucose Test Strip and HL568 Control Solution are designed to be used only with the HL568 Blood Glucose Meter. Also, the proposed device is not intended for use in the alternative site testing other than the fingertip.

# 5. Intended Use

HL568 Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG) System is self-test medical device and intended for single patient home-use to monitor the blood glucose $\beta$ -D-glucose) levels in quantitative measurement from fresh capillary whole blood obtained from the finger tip. It is intended for use outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by diabetics at home to measure the glucose concentration for aiding diabetes management. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus.

HL568 Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG) System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared and it is also not intended for use on neonates and should be used with HL568 Blood glucose test strip and HL568 Control Solution.

HL568 Blood glucose test strips are for use with the HL568 Blood glucose meter to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip.

HL568 Control Solutions are for use with the HL568 Blood glucose meter and HL568 Blood glucose test strips to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly.

The device is capable of transferring the storage data to the connected personal computer (PC) via USB cable. In addition, HL568 Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose System is featured with audio function; it could help the user to know the measured result by hearing but is not
