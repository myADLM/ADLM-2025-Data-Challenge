# I. Device Description:

The SYNCHRON MULTI CALIBRATOR is a liquid, ready-to-use multi-analyte, in vitro diagnostic calibrator. The SYNCHRON Multi Calibrator is prepared in a human serum matrix which is stabilized by the use of ethylene glycol. During manufacture, the multiple constituents are spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

The analytes in this calibrator are traceable using prEN ISO 17511 to the following:

Creatinine was removed from the SYNCHRON MULTI CALIBRATOR and is now separate (k095240). The traceability was changed from NIST traceable to Isotope

Dilution Mass Spectrometry, (k071277).

All serum or plasma donor units used in the preparation of this material were tested by FDA approved methods and found to be negative for HIV, and HCV antibodies, as well as non-reactivity for HBs Ag. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus or other infections agents are absent, this material should be handled as though capable of transmitting infectious diseases. This product may also contain other human source material for which there is no approved test.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: Lactate is gravimetrically prepared and is traceable to an older lot of calibrator. Magnesium is traceable to NIST 929.

Value Assignment: Value assignment of the lactate calibrator is established by comparing lactate recovery to the previous lot of calibrator and by evaluating lactate recovery against a commercially available set of standards. Bottle value assignment occurs by performing multiple runs over multiple days with the new lot using multiple SYNCHRON Systems—CX5 CE, CX9 Pro, LX20 Pro, DxC800, and two lots of SYNCHRON reagents. Magnesium value assignment is accomplished using an anchor pool, traceable to the NIST 929 reference method. Bottle value assignment occurs by performing multiple runs over multiple days on multiple SYNCHRON Systems using two lots of SYNCHRON reagents.

Stability: Real time stability study data supports the manufacturer labeling that the Beckman Coulter SYNCHRON Multi-Calibrator is stable for 24 months when stored unopened at -15 to ${ } - 2 0 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real time stability study data supports an open vial stability claim of 20 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Calibrators are not stored on board the instruments.
