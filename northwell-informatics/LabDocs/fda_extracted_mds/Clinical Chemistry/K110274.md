Trade Name:

AutoDELFIA® Neonatal IRT kit B005-212, B005-204

Common Name: Regulation:

AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT kit 21 CFR 862.1725

Classification Name:

Trypsin Test System and Electrode

Product Code:

Predicate Device:

AutoDELFIA® Neonatal IRT kit, B005-112 510(k) Number (K0003668)

Device Description:

The AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT assay is a solid phase, two-site fluoroimmunometric assay based on the direct sandwich technique in which two monoclonal antibodies (derived from mice) are directed against two separate antigenic determinants on the IRT molecule. Calibrators, controls and test specimens containing IRT are reacted simultaneously with immobilized monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific antigenic site on the IRT molecule and europium-labeled monoclonal antibodies (directed against a different antigenic site) in assay buffer. The assay buffer elutes IRT from the dried blood on filter paper disks. The complete assay requires only one incubation step.

Enhancement Solution dissociates europium ions from the labeled antibody into solution where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of the Enhancement Solution. The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The fluorescence of each sample is proportional to the concentration of IRT in the sample.

Intended Use:

The AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT kit is intended for the quantitative determination of human immunoreactive trypsin(ogen) (IRT) in blood specimens dried on filter paper as an aid in screening newborns for cystic fibrosis using the 1235 AutoDELFIA® automatic immunoassay system.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT kit (B005-212/B005- 204) is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed AutoDELFIA IRT kit (B005-112) (K0003668). There are the following similarities and differences between the two kits:

Dear Ms. Susan K. Hamann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
