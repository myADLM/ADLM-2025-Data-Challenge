# Device Description

Neonatal Bilirubin (nBili) is a new parameter offered on the RAPIDPoint 405 (RP405) blood gas system. The RP405 system is a point of care and laboratory testing blood gas analyzer and currently measures a variety of parameters that have been previously cleared. Enabling the nBili measurement is accomplished through software design changes introduced in Software Version 3.7. No hardware or mechanical changes were needed.

# 510(k) Summary - Revised

The nBili test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use by healthcare professionals for the determination of total neonatal bilirubin concentration in the whole blood samples of newborn infants. Measurement of nBili aids in assessing the risk of kernicterus.

# Statement of Intended Use

The neonatal bilirubin test used on RAPIDPoint® 405 systems is an in vitro diagnostic test for the determination of total neonatal bilirubin (nBili) concentration in the whole blood of newborn infants. Measurement of nBili aids in assessing the risk of kernicterus. This test is intended for use in point of care or laboratory settings.

# Summary of Technological Characteristics

The RAPIDPoint 405 system uses multiple wavelength spectrophotometry (CO-oximetry) to measure the transmission of light through a sample of neonate whole blood to determine concentrations of hemoglobin derivatives and bilirubin.

The RAPIDPoint 405 system aspirates the whole blood sample at the sample port and then transfers the sample to the CO-ox sample chamber. As the sample flows through an optical chamber, the CO-ox optics head directs light through the sample and to a polychromator that measures the intensity of transmitted light at different wavelengths.

Iterative least squares analysis is used to determine raw bilirubin values. Raw values are then corrected for hematocrit to produce nBili results.

# Assessment of Performance

Studies were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the RAPIDPoint 405 with nBili parameter and assess substantial equivalence against the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics RAPIDLab 1245 and 1265 (predicate device).

The nBili internal evaluation study entailed testing concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin in oxygenated cord whole blood (which mimics neonatal samples) across the reporting ranges. The nBili external evaluation study included testing at multiple point of care sites with intended use neonatal whole blood samples. Combining these internal and external evaluations for a total of approximately 200 samples, the correlation coefficient (r) value was within the acceptance criteria $( > 0 . 9 0 )$ . Specimens were evaluated against the RAPIDLab 1245 and 1265 predicate devices and based on performance data analyzed, it was concluded that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.

In addition, information on Software Development Life Cycle including software requirements specifications, risk management report, and overall verification and validation results were included to provide additional assurance of device performance.

# 510(k) Summary - Revised

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the studies completed demonstrate that the RAPIDPoint® 405 System Neonatal Bilirubin (nBili) Test is similar to the RAPIDLab 1245 and 1265 predicate device in both Technological Characteristics and Intended Use. The data presented in the submission is a summary of internal evaluation, external clinical evaluation, and software development information. This information provides assurance that the RAPIDPoint 405 system measuring neonate bilirubin has demonstrated substantial equivalence to the currently marketed Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics RAPIDLab 1245 and 1265 predicate device across the reporting range.

Dear Mr. Goldberg,

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
