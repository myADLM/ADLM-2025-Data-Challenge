# Contact Person:

Jonathan Johnson Phone: 646-454-5401 Fax: 800-931-9137

# Date Summary, Prepared:

September 8, 2011

# Device Name:

Propriety Name: EasyGluco® Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System Common Name: Blood Glucose Test System   
Classification Name: Class II, 862.1345 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# Predicate Device:

We claim substantial equivalence to the G5 Infinity Blood Glucose Monitoring System, K082201.

# Device Description

The EasyGluco $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plus Monitor is an in vitro diagnostic device designed for measuring the concentration of glucose in whole blood, which is used with the EasyGluco $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plus Test Strips.

The test principle is:

This device is an in vitro diagnostic product intended for the measurement of glucose concentration in human blood. The principle of the test relies upon a specific type of glucose in the blood sample, the dehydrogenase glucose that reacts to electrodes in the test strip. The test strip employs an clectrochemical signal generating an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is measured by the Meter and displayed as your blood glucose result.

# Intended Use:

The EasyGluco $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm, forearm, calf or thigh as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of

diabetes management in the home by patients with diabetes. The EasyGluco $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be shared with any other person.

EasyGluco $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plus System is for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The EasyGluco $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady-state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The EasyGluco $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plus Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the EasyGluco $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Plus Blood Glucose Monitor for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm, forearm, calf or thigh.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

The US Diagnostics, Inc. EasyGluco $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plus Module is substantially equivalent to the other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Thc most notable, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed item, K082201-G5 Infinity Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# Conclusion:

The EasyGluco $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the following predicate devices: K082201-G5 Infinity Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Dear Mr. Johnson:

We have reviewed your Section Sl0(k) prenarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into cither class II (Special Controls) or class II1 (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You nust comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not timited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR s03); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
