4. Special instrument requirements: Accu-Chek Aviva Blood Glucose Monitor

# I. Device Description:

The FDI Glucose Control is a non-sterile liquid glucose solution that consists of a buffered aqueous solution of D-glucose, a viscosity modifier, preservatives, red dye, and other non-reactive ingredients. The control solution is packaged in a plastic dripper tipped bottle for application of the control solution to the test strip. The red dye is added to the solution to visually confirm the application of the control. Each bottle contains enough solution volume to run 75 tests. This device is a non-sterile, over-the-counter product and is intended for external use only. The solution contains no human or animal derived materials.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP-5: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline, Second Edition.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

Glucose $( 0 . 4 5 \ : \mathrm { g / L ) }$ is added to the control solution. The solution was tested using a commercially available clinical chemistry analyzer against an in-house standard traceable to the NIST Standard reference material 917b. The sponsor states that the $4 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is produced using SRM917 according to the NIST’s “Instructions for Use as a Standard in Clinical Applications” which accompanies the Certificate of Analysis for SRM917.

# Value Assignment:

A single lot of control solutions, with an expected value of $4 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , are tested using a commercially available clinical chemistry analyzer. After this, these control solutions are analyzed using a single AVIVA monitor using three different lots of test strips, 10 replicates per strip lot, over three days. Acceptable ranges are based on pre-determined acceptance criteria established by the manufacturer for glucose recovery for each lot. The glucose control value ranges are lot dependent; therefore the range for each lot is printed on the control solution vial label.

# Stability:

Stability characteristics of the FDI Glucose Control Solution for AVIVA were determined by real time and open vial stability studies.

Closed Vial Stability (Real-time/ shelf-life stability)

Shelf Life (real time stability): Control solutions were prepared at a target concentration of $3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and were stored at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Control). Samples were periodically removed and tested in triplicate on a commercially available clinical chemistry analyzer. This study supports the claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Opened Vial Stability

For open vial stability, a number of test and control vials were evaluated for 13 weeks. A target concentration of $3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was prepared for each control solution. Each day all vials were opened, allowed to stand for ten minutes, then closed and stored at room temperature. Each week one test group vial was assayed and one control group vial was assayed in triplicate using the ACE Glucose assay. The Control vial was opened on the date of performing the assay and then discarded after testing was complete. The study supports the claimed open vial stability of 90 days when stored at $1 5 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
