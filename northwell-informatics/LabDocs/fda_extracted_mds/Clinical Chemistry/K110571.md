Dear Dr. Javitt:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

# 510(k) Number (if known): K110571

Device Name: Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring System Telserve Data Management System - Home Use Telserve Data Management System - Professional Use

Indications for Use:

# Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring System

The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring system is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm, or palm. It is intended for lay use by persons with diabetes to aid in diabetes management. It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) and should be used only by a single patient and should not be shared. Testing is done outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Telcare Blood Glucose Meter, Telcare Blood Glucose Test Strips, and Telcare Glucose Control Solutions. The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring system is not indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Palm and forearm testing should be done only during steady-state times when glucose is not changing rapidly. The Telcare Blood Glucose Meter uses cellular data transmission to send test results to Telcare's remote database,Telserve, and to receive messages from Telserve. The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended to provide automated treatment guidance or decisions, nor is it to be used as a substitute for professional healthcare judgment.

# Telcare Blood Glucose Test Strips

The Telcare Blood Glucose Test Strips are to be used with the Telcare Blood Glucose Meter for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, or forearm. These test strips are intended for lay use by persons with diabetes and should only be used by a single patient. They are not indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Palm and forearm testing should be done only during steady-state times when glucose is not changing rapidly.
