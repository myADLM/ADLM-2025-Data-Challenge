# Legally Marketed Device to Which Equivalence is Claimed

Roche Elecsys Vitamin B12 Immunoassay (K060755)

Intended Use of Device

The ARCHITECT B12 assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle Intrinsic Factor assay for the quantitative determination of vitamin B12 in human serum on the ARCHITECT i System.

# Description of Device

# Reagent Kit

The ARCHITECT B12 assay is a two-step assay with an automated sample pretreatment, for determining the presence of B12 in human serum using chemiluminescent microparticle immnunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex.

Sample and Pre-Treatment Reagent 1, Pre-Treatment Reagent 2, and Pre-Treatment Reagent 3 are combined. An aliquot of the pre-treated sample is aspirated and transferred into a new reactions vessel (RV). The pre-treated sample, assay diluent, and intrinsic factor coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. B12 present in the sample binds to the intrinsic factor coated microparticles. After washing, B12 acridinium-labeled conjugate is added in the second step. Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An inverse relationship exists between the amount of B12 in the sample and the RLUsdetected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.

# Calibrators

The ARCHITECT B12 Calibrators are used to calibrate the ARCHITECT i System when the system is used for the quantitative determination of vitamin B12 in human serum using the ARCHITECT B12 Reagent Kit.

# Controls

The ARCHITECT B12 Controls are used for the estimation of test precision and the detection of systematic analytical deviations of the ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination of vitamin B12 in human serum when using the ARCHITECT B12 Reagent Kit.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics

The ARCHITECT B12 assay utilizes chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology for the quantitative determination of vitamin B12 in human serum. The Roche Elecsys E170 Vitamin B12 assay utilizes technology for the quantitative determination of vitamin B12 in human serum and plasma on the E170 System.

# Summary of Nonclinical Performance

The data presented in the pre-market notification demonstrate that the ARCHITECT B12 assay performs substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the Roche Elecsys E170 Vitamin B12 assay (K060755). Equivalence was demonstrated using the current commercially available Roche Elecsys E170 Vitamin B12 reagents with 172 patient samples covering the range of $8 3 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ to $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .The data presented in the premarket notification provide a reasonable assurance that the ARCHITECT B12 assay is safe and effective for the stated intended use.

Dear Ms. Abano:

We have reviewed your Section $5 ! 0 ( k )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28. 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to vicsha have been cassi nance with the proisons  theFeral Foor and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA) You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Irvi  cass ee ovno las  Speloni  be s c additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Tile 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device resuits in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
