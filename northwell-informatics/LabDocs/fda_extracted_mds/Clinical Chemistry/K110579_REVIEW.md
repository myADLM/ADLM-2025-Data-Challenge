# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT B12 assay is a two-step assay with an automated sample pretreatment, for determining the presence of B12 in human serum using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. Sample and PreTreatment Reagent 1, Pre-Treatment Reagent 2, and Pre-Treatment Reagent 3 are combined. An aliquot of the pre-treated sample is aspirated and transferred into a new reaction vessel (RV). The pre-treated sample, assay diluent, and intrinsic factor coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. B12 present in the sample binds to the intrinsic factor coated microparticles. After washing, B12 acridinium-labeled conjugate is added in the second step. Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An inverse relationship exists between the amount of B12 in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i$ System optics.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

This study was designed based on the CLSI document EP5-A2. Three control levels (low, medium, and high) and 1 serum panel were tested.

Testing was performed using 3 lots of reagents, 2 lots of calibrators, and 1 lot of controls on one ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instrument. One calibrator lot was paired with 1 reagent lot and the other calibrator lot was paired with the remaining 2 reagent lots. The 3 control levels and the serum panel were each tested in replicates of 3, twice daily (a minimum of 2 hours apart), on each of 20 days, using 3 reagent lots on one ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instrument, for a total of 360 replicates.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The study was performed and analyzed based on the CLSI document EP6-A. One ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instrument and 1 lot each of ARCHITECT B12 Reagent Kit, Calibrators, and Controls were used.

A high sample was prepared to a concentration of approximately $2 { , } 2 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ by spiking B12 stock solution into a serum sample. The high sample (Stock A) was mixed with serum containing various levels of low B12 concentration (Stock B). Stock B was diluted with ARCHITECT Wash Buffer $( 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , phosphate buffered saline) or Calibrator A diluent because a B12-deficient (0 $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { p g / m L } } )$ specimen cannot be obtained. Each sample was tested in replicates of 4 using the ARCHITECT B12 assay. Data was analyzed using $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ order, $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ order, and $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order least square regression according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline and the results are summarized below:

$1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ order: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 2 3 4 \mathrm { x } + 4 . 1 8$ $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ order: $\mathrm { \check { y } } = 1 . 1 6 7 6 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 0 0 1 \mathrm { x } ^ { 2 } - 2 8 . 7 9$ $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order: $\mathrm { \dot { y } = 1 . 0 1 9 6 x + 0 . 0 0 0 1 x ^ { 2 } - 0 x ^ { 3 } - 8 . 0 1 }$

The $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order cubic model was the best fit. The percent deviation (DL) from linearity was within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for all samples tested (18 samples ranged from 109 to $2 0 7 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ).

The B12 assay has a measuring range of $1 4 6 - 2 0 0 0 { \mathrm { p g / m L } }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrators: Abbott manufactures B12 internal standards (primary calibrators) gravimetrically using cyanocobalamin (B12) USP Reference Standard. The B12 calibrators (market calibrators) are manufactured and tested against these internal standards.

Primary B12 Calibrator A $( 0 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ is prepared with sodium borate, sodium chloride, water and human serum albumin. The pH of the solution is checked and adjusted, if necessary. Sodium azide is added, and the solution is diluted to final batch size with water, mixed, and filtered. The calibrator diluent is stored at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

Preparation of Primary B12 Calibrators B through F: The cyanocobalamin USP reference standard is gravimetrically diluted with filtered water to create a concentrated reference solution. The concentrated reference solution is gravimetrically diluted with calibrator diluent to create a B12 primary stock solution. Each Primary B12 Calibrator B through F is gravimetrically prepared with B12 primary stock solution and calibrator diluent to target concentrations of 100, 250, 500, 1,000, and $2 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , respectively.

Secondary and Market versions of B12 Calibrator A is prepared the same way as the Primary B12 Calibrator A. Each Secondary and Market version of B12 Calibrator B through F is prepared with ARCHITECT B12 stock solution (cyanocobalamin diluted in calibrator diluent) and calibrator diluent to target concentrations of 110 , 200, 500, 1,000, and $2 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , respectively.

Value assignment: The concentrations of each Secondary B12 Calibrator B through F are determined by comparison of the relative light unit (RLU) values against the corresponding primary calibrators using the ARCHITECT $i$ System. The on-test calibrator is compared to the corresponding primary calibrator using a sample/reference ratio of the grand mean RLU results. The concentrations are adjusted, if necessary, by adding either ARCHITECT B12 stock solution or calibrator diluent, to be within $\pm 1 \%$ of the primary calibrator

RLU values. Market calibrators are similarly assigned values by comparison via RLU values to the secondary calibrators.

Controls: Primary and secondary controls are made similarly to calibrators (above). The B12 primary stock solution is mixed with calibrator diluent to target concentrations of 200, 400 and $8 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The secondary controls are assigned values via the same process described above for secondary calibrators. The ARCHITECT B12 Low and High Control are prepared with ARCHITECT B12 stock solution (cyanocobalamin diluted in calibrator diluent) and calibrator diluent to target concentrations of 251 and $9 1 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The ARCHITECT B12 Medium Control is prepared by spiking human serum containing B12 with ARCHITECT B12 stock solution to a target concentration of $4 5 4 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Value assignment for market controls is similar to that described above for the market calibrators.

Stability: Protocols and acceptance criteria for shelf-life and in-use (open vial) stability were reviewed and found to be adequate. Currently, real-time stability data supports 8 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for controls and 11 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for calibrators; for in use (open vial) stability; in use (open vial) stability for calibrators is one month and for controls is two months. Reagents are stable on board the ARCHITECT $i$ System for 26 days.

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limits study and statistical analysis was performed based on the CLSI document EP17-A. Testing was performed using at least two ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instruments and 2 reagent lots. Both reagent lots were tested on each instrument, along with 1 lot each of ARCHITECT B12 Calibrators and Controls. Four zero-level and 9 low-level samples were tested. Samples were prepared at the following concentrations: 58, 85, 97, 116, 126, 136, 146, 168, and $2 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . All samples were tested in 1 replicate for the zero-level samples and a minimum of 3 replicates for the lowlevel samples on 5 runs over 3 days for each reagent lot and instrument combination for a total of at least 60 replicates for each analyte level.

Limit of Blank (LoB) was calculated to be $6 6 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated to be $8 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is the imprecision where the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ is less than or equal to $10 \%$ . The LoQ was determined to be $1 4 6 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

The B12 assay has a measuring range of $1 4 6 - 2 0 0 0 { \mathrm { p g / m L } }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: A study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the ARCHITECT B12 assay to potentially interfering substances: total bilirubin, hemoglobin, total protein, and triglycerides. The study was performed based on the CLSI document EP7-A2. One ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instrument and 1 lot each of ARCHITECT B12 Reagent Kit, Calibrators, and Controls were used.

A serum specimen pool containing $1 5 0 - 2 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ B12 (low sample) and a serum specimen pool containing $> 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ B12 (higher sample) were obtained. The sponsor defines no significant interference if bias is less than $10 \%$ between the spiked and unspiked sample. Total bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), total protein, and triglycerides showed no significant interference in the ARCHITECT B12 assay for low samples (concentration range: $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ to $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ) and higher samples (concentration range: $>$ $5 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ at the following concentrations:

• Bilirubin $\begin{array} { l } { \leq 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } } \\ { \leq 1 2 \mathrm { g / d L } } \\ { \leq 3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } } \end{array}$   
• Total Protein   
Triglycerides

At a hemoglobin concentration of approximately $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the ARCHITECT B12 assay showed an average interference of $- 1 7 . 5 \%$ with low samples (concentration range: $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ to $2 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ and $- 1 2 . 5 \%$ with higher samples (concentration range: $> 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ . Therefore, the sponsor put the following limitation in their package insert.

“Hemolysis has been demonstrated to exhibit negative interference in this B12 assay. Hemolyzed specimens should not be analyzed.”

Cross reactivity: A study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the ARCHITECT B12 assay to cross-reactivity with cobinamide. The study was performed using one ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instrument and 1 lot each of ARCHITECT B12 Reagent Kit, Calibrators, and Controls.

A serum specimen pool containing approximately $2 3 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ B12 was obtained. A test sample was prepared by adding a $3 6 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ cobinamide stock solution to the serum specimen pool, targeting a cobinamide concentration $\mathrm { { 0 f } \geq 9 , 0 0 0 \ p g / \mathrm { { m L } } }$ . A reference sample was prepared by adding a volume of distilled water, equivalent to the volume of cobinamide stock solution used in the test sample, to the serum specimen pool.

The test and reference samples were each tested once in replicates of 14 using the ARCHITECT B12 assay. Analysis of the test vs. reference sample testing showed $1 . 8 \%$ bias between the test and reference sample. The sponsor claimed that there is no cross reactivity with cobinamide based on the data.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The study was performed based on the CLSI document EP9-A2. The Roche Elecsys E170 Vitamin B12 assay was used as the predicate device.

A total of 198 human serum specimens were tested with both the ARCHITECT B12 and Roche Elecsys Vitamin B12 assays. For the ARCHITECT B12 assay, 2 lots of reagents, 1 lot each of calibrators and controls, and 1 ARCHITECT i 2000SR instrument were used for testing, with specimen testing divided over the 2 reagent lots. For the Roche Elecsys Vitamin B12 assay, 1 lot each of reagents, calibrators, and controls and 1 Roche Elecsys instrument were used for testing. Specimens were tested in replicates of 2 with each assay over a period of 6 days. A specimen tested using the ARCHITECT B12 assay was tested within 24 hours using the Roche Elecsys Vitamin B12 assay. 47 samples were excluded from analysis because they were outside the claimed range of the assay (24 below the LoQ, 23 above $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ . Results of the study are summarized in the table below.
