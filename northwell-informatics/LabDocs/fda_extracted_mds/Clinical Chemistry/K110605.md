# 4. Device Description

The ROMPlus is a rapid test for detection of premature rupture of fetal membranes. The test principle is lateral flow immunochromatography. ROM Plus is available in packages of 5 tests. Each individual test pack contains a sterile polyester swab, specimen extraction buffer solution in a plastic vial and a cassette with integral timer containing the lateral flow strip packed in a foil pouch with desiccant.

The ROM Plus Controls contain one vial each of negative, and positive controls, with integral reconstitution solution.

The Clinical Innovations ROM Plus fetal membrane rupture test is a rapid, qualitative immunochromatographic test for the in vitro detection of amniotic fluid in vaginal secretions of pregnant women with signs and symptoms of ROM. The test detects AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) and PP12 (placental protein 12 or insulin growth factor binding protein) from amniotic fluid in vaginal secretion. The test is for prescription use by health care professionals to aid in the detection of rupture of membranes (ROM) in pregnant women in conjunction with other signs and symptoms.

# 6. Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence

The ROM Plus and the predicate devices cited above are both qualitative, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays intended to aid in detecting rupture of fetal membranes in pregnant women. Detection of results is by visual inspection. The analytes detected by ROM Plus and AmniSure and ActimPROM tests are similar amniotic fluid proteins. ROM Plus uses antibodies to PP12 (IGFBP-1) and AFP (alpha feto-protein). The specimen collection and extraction, test procedure, and reading and interpretation of results is similar between the three devices. All devices are intended for use in point-of-care and clinical laboratory settings. The differences between the ROM Plus and the predicate devices do not impact the safety or effectiveness of the proposed ROM Plus products for their intended uses.

# 7. Performance Testing

A series of nonclinical and clinical studies was conducted to assess the performance of the ROM Plus, These studies evaluated method comparison, repeatability, reproducibility, analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity and interfering substances.

High Concentration ("High Dose Hook" effect) - for the ROM Plus upper-detection range, the PP12 and AFP were tested. Concentrations of PP12 were tested up to 400,000 $\mathfrak { n g / m l }$ and AFP up to $2 0 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ with positive visual results.   
• For $100 \%$ of ROM Plus tests sampled, the lowest limit of detection (LOD) is $5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ for PP12, and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ for AFP (these refer to concentrations in samples of vaginal secretions before dilution with the assay buffer).   
• Reproducibility was tested on different days at six levels of amniotic fluid spiked into a negative control. The assay was run on three lots of ROM Plus to determine the visual positive or negative results. Two low positives, two moderate positives and two high positives were run on three lots of ROM Plus on four different days. No difference in activity was observed.   
• To determine interference and cross-reactivity of the assay, Tylenol, aspirin, and three different bath products (Lever Soap, Noxzema cream, Pert Shampoo), were spiked into the low positive control at a final concentration of $0 . 1 \%$ without visual loss of activity. The same bath products were spiked into the negative-matrix control and shown to be negative. In addition, human semen, urine and blood were spiked into the low positive at a $1 0 \%$ final concentration without loss of activity. Human semen, urine and blood were also spiked into the negative-control matrix and shown to be negative. PP12 assay does not cross-react with IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-4 based on Western Blot results. ROM Plus was shown to be negative when tested with specimens that were positive for bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted diseases. All samples were $\mathsf { p H } { \mathsf { > } } 4 . 5$ .

A multi-center prospective observational study was performed. Clinicians performing ROM Plus testing were masked from the standard Clinical Assessment results. The clinical standard of e k crvl oei  ,e h commonly used in clinical hospital protocol to evaluate ROM. Corrections for ROM based on

subsequent patient chart review was not used in this study for the detection of ruptured membranes.

Results are shown below:
