# Device Name

Proprietary name: Elecsys Prolactin II CalCheck 5   
Common name: Prolactin II CalCheck 5   
Classification name: Single (specified) analyte controls (assayed and   
unassayed)

# Predicate device

The Elecsys Prolactin II CalCheck 5 is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. We claim equivalency to the cleared Elecsys DHEA-S CalCheck 5 (K 103402).

Device Description

The Elecsys Prolactin II CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of prolactin in an equine serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Intended use

The Elecsys Prolactin II CalCheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration verification and for use in the verification of the assay range established by the Elecsys Prolactin II reagent on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

Comparison Table

The table below compares Elecsys Prolactin II CalCheck 5 with the predicate device, Elecsys DHEA-S CalCheck 5 (K103402).

Re: k110613 Trade Name: Elecsys Prolactin II Calcheck 5 Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660 Regulation Name: Quality control material (assayed and unassayed). Regulatory Class: I, reserved Product Codes: JJX Dated: March 02, 2011 Received: March 03, 2011

Dear Ms. O'Maine Adams:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 540.Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notfication" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. }

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
