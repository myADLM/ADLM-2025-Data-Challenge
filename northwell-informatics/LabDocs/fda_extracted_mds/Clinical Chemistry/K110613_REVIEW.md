# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and value assignment

CalCheck 5 is standardized using internally produced master calibrators which are traceable to the $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ IRP WHO 84/500 international standard.

Each of the five CalCheck levels is value assigned using a minimum of three cobas e 601. Each sample is tested in duplicate. The target value for each CalCheck is the median of the observed values.

The sponsor experimentally confirmed the values assigned were transferrable to Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411analyzers. For Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411analyzers, the same value assignment procedure was performed. The assigned values obtained on these additional analyzers were shown to meet the same acceptance criteria as the $\mathrm { E } 1 7 0 / \mathrm { e }$ $6 0 1 / \mathrm { e } 6 0 2$ . Additionally, the acceptance criteria for differences between the master platform and additional analyzer platforms (e) were also met. Therefore, the values assigned to the cobas e 601analyzer/s are transferred and valid for the Elecsys 2010 analyzer/s.

The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

# Stability

Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. CalCheck 5 is stable until the expiration date printed on the vial when stored unopened at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The reconstituted vials are stable for four hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The real time studies are ongoing.
