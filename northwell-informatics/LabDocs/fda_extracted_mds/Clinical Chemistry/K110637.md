Device Name AND CLASSiFICAtION

Trade Name: OneTouch® Verio"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System Common name: Glucose Test System   
Classification:   
OneTouch® Verio™"IQ Blood Glucose Meters and OneTouch® Verio™ Test Strips are Class II devices (21 CFR $\ S 8 6 2 . 1 3 4 5$ , Product Code NBW, LFR)

OneTouch® Verio™M Control Solutions are Class I devices (21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1660), Product Code JJX

# System Description

The OneTouch® Verio™IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the OneTouch® V Bloo Gluc Mter, OneTuch Ver™Te trips, OneTuch VeM an High Control Solutions, Lancing Device, Sterile Lancets and Alternative Site testing Kit (available separately). The Alternative Site Testing Kit comprises the OneTouch® Lancing Device, OneTouch® UltraSoft™ Sterile Lancets, OneTouch®, Clear Cap and Instructions for Use. The OneTouch® Verio"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the glucose content of a blood sample by means of an electrical current produced in the test strip and sent to the meter for measurement.

# Predicate Device

OneTouch® Verio™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K093745)

Intended Use/Indications for Use

The OneTouch® Verio™"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm or palm. The OneTouch® Verio™"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be used for testing multiple patients.

OneTouch® Verio™"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The OneTouch® Verio™"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady-state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The OneTouch® Verio™ Test Strips are for use with the OneTouch® Verio"IQ Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose drawn from the fingertips, forearm or palm.

The OneTuch® VeConol Solus  o e with the OneTouch® VerQ Blo Glucose Meter and the OneTouch® Verio™ Test Strips to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly..

# Comparison to Predicate Device

The Subject device is different from the predicate device for the following aspects:

Meter: ergonomic/physical design, user interface, hardware, modified electronic and software changes.

There are no changes to the OneTouch® Verio™ Test Strips or the OneTouch® Verio™ Mid and High Control Solutions as a result of this $5 1 0 \mathrm { k }$ submission.

There have been no changes to the intended use, operating principle or scientific technology.

# Technological Characteristics

There has been no change to the fundamental scientific technology, which is amperometric detection. The operating principle remains electrochemical reaction.

# Summary Of PerforMance Characteristics

The OneTouch® Verio™"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System (meter, strips, and control solutions) was tested in accordance with ISO 15197:2003(E). Analytical performance testing included system accuracy, repeatability, intermediate precision and linearity testing. A user performance evaluation assessed accuracy of results and usability of the device in the hands of intended users. The OneTouch® Verio™"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System performed similarly to both the predicate device as well as to a laboratory reference method, the Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI).

# System Accuracy

A comparison of system accuracy performance demonstrated that the OneTouch® Verio"IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the OneTouch® Verio™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System are substantially equivalent.
