# Predicate Device

Bio-Rad Liquichek™" Specialty Immunoassay Control (k043108) - 25-OH Vitamin D component

# Summary and Principle

This quality control product can be used as an objective judgment of the laboratory's procedures and personnel techniques. It is a valuable tool to assess good laboratory practices. Three levels of control are available to compare observations with expected ranges therefore assuring consistent performance of the testing system within the clinical range.

# Intended Use

Fujirebio Diagnostics Vitamin D Control is intended for use as an assayed control serum to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analysis of Vitamin D.

# Statement of Substantial Equivalence

Fujirebio Diagnostics Vitamin D Control is intended for use as an assayed control serum to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analysis of Vitamin D.

The Fujirebio Diagnostics Vitamin D Control is substantially equivalent to the 25-OH Vitamin D component of the Bio-Rad Liquichek" Specialty Immunoassay Control. Both of the devices are quality control serum and are used to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for Vitamin D.

The regulatory submission is prepared pursuant to Title 21CFR $\ S$ 862.1660.

A comparison of the features of the Fujirebio Diagnostics Vitamin D Control and the 25-OH Vitamin D component of Bio-Rad Liquichek" Specialty Immunoassay Control are as follows:

Dear Ms. Dolan:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
