# I. Device Description:

The ARK Care Diabetes Management system serves as an interface between the software in compatible glucose meters and a general purpose health management database to assist in the review, analysis and evaluation of blood glucose test results. ARK Care is a secure system designed for home use and professional healthcare settings.

The purpose of the electronic diabetes management system is to help users and healthcare teams manage blood glucose information to help with diabetes management. After the user transmits and stores blood glucose data to the secure database, the ARK Care system allows family members and/or healthcare professionals to view and monitor the user's data and reports. Family and healthcare team members must receive permission from the primary user and create a password protected login before viewing data and allows for secure communications. The user and approved healthcare team members can view the blood glucose data in different formats such as logbooks, charts, and graphs. The data can be viewed through selected time intervals and these intervals can be compared over time to track disease management. The subject can also enter and track other health-related information such as body weight, blood pressure, lab values, and exercise activities. Groups of profiles can be queried for bulk reporting on data related to tracking and trending of outcomes, supporting diabetes disease management in individuals and in managed care organizations.

Thirty eight (38) diabetic adult consumers and six (6) healthcare professionals were recruited and screened for study inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria for participants included that the user was capable of using a computer independently and had at minimum basic computer skills. Personal Users must be a Type 1 or Type 2 diabetic who is actively testing their blood glucose. Professional Users needed to have a degree in a healthcare field that may require interaction with diabetic persons.

Users were given the use of a laptop with the ARK Care website open, a preloaded meter with glucose and control solution values, the User Guide and a set of user (Personal and Professional) instructions to complete study tasks. Program evaluation was measured by completing ease of use and performance questionnaires

The Personal User participants were asked to:

1. Enroll as a patient   
2. Navigation Overview   
3. Create a Care Team   
4. Glucose Meter Upload   
5. Manually add Medication, Lab results, Meals and Insulin using My Data   
Logbooks   
6. View Detail Readings chart in My Charts   
7. View and Print Average Readings charts in My Charts   
8. View Total View chart in My Charts   
9. Sign Out of ARK Care site   
10. Rate the program by completing questionnaires

The Professional participants were asked to:

1. Enroll from an email invitation   
2. Register as a Care Team Member   
3. From My Data $\mathrm { . > }$ Alerts view your team member’s information   
4. Navigation overview   
5. Display Blood Glucose Logbook   
6. Display Medication Log   
7. Display and Print Lab Test Results   
8. Display Meal Log   
9. Display Insulin Log   
10. Display Total View interactive chart   
11. Under My Information $_ { - > }$ Notifications set to Daily updates and save   
12. Sign Out of ARK Care site   
13. Rate the program by completing questionnaires

The scores of “Ease of Use” and “Performance” questionnaires were both over $9 9 \%$ passing. Sixty-eight percent $( 6 8 \% )$ of Personal Users would use this software program to help manage their diabetes and one-hundred percent $( 1 0 0 \% )$ of Professional Users would use this program to assist in managing their patient’s diabetes.

The scores for pass/fail criteria of both groups exceeded $80 \%$ and $70 \%$ required for the acceptance criteria. The clinical data demonstrated that the ARK Care Internet-Based Diabetes Management System for diabetics is easy to use for both personal and professional users. The software performed as expected during the course of the study.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

For each meter that will be claimed as compatible with the ARK Care system a demonstration of accurate data transmission must be performed. This testing includes meter load up and meter memory rollover testing to confirm data synchronization upon after rollover.

Meters are loaded to memory capacity using the low and high controls, in addition a mid level control solution was created by a technician using equal parts of the low and high control solutions. The assigned meter came with a data log sheet. Each result and its details were logged after each individual test. This methodology also prevented duplicate test results in the event that the same dose level was used successively and potentially skewing the data set. In addition the technicians varied the testing of control solutions, low, middle, and high to reduce potential misanalysis of duplicate results on the meter system.

After the meters were loaded to capacity they were passed off to the software validation group. Each meter system was then plugged into the ARK Care system, correct meter platform selected in ARK Care and then meter memory was uploaded and capacity verified against claim.

After initial memory capacity was confirmed ten more results were added to the meters. Results of the data additions were compared against the original load up data.

The above testing confirms the ARK Care system can accurately acquire blood glucose data from the tested glucose meter system.
