# Intended use

Thermo Scientific $M A S ^ { \otimes }$ Omni-CORE ™m is intended for use as an assayed control for monitoring assay conditions in many clinical laboratory determinations. Include MAs® Omni-CORE with patient serum specimens when assaying for any of the constituents. Assay values are provided for the specific systems listed. The user can compare observations with their expected ranges as a means of assuring consistent performance of reagent and instrument.

# Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed

MAS® Omni-CORE is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared MAS® Chem-TRAK H (K092051) and MAS® Immunology (K960824) Controls.

# Description of Device

Omni-CORE is a liquid stable control material prepared from human serum. Analyte levels are adjusted with various animal extracts and non-protein materials including drugs, drug metabolites and purified chemicals. Amylase, ALT/GPT, AST/GOT, CK and Lipase are obtained from porcine tissue; alkaline phosphatase and GGT are from bovine tissue; LDH is from avian tissue. Preservatives and stabilizers are added to maintain product integrity.

The control is offered in three levels with the following configuration:

Dear Ms. Charter:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
