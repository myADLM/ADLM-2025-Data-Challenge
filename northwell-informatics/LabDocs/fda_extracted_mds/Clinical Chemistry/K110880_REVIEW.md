# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for Use below

VALIDATE ® GC3 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of linearity, calibration verification and verification of reportable range. See the package insert for the list of all analytes claimed.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use. For prescription use only.

These tests are not intended for use as routine quality materials or as calibration materials.

4. Special instrument requirements:

The validation and stability studies were conducted using Beckman Coulter AU 680 analyzer.

# I. Device Description:

Each VALIDATE® GC 3 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit contains purified chemicals in a human serum albumin base. Five levels are provided to establish the relationship between theoretical and actual performance of each of the included analytes.

Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test set has been tested using FDA approved methods and found to be non-reactive for HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2.

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Stability

The sponsor provided protocol, acceptance criteria and summary data for stability for up to 8 months that were reviewed and were accepted to be adequate. The real time stability study is ongoing.

# Traceability:

Same as k091225, there are no traceable materials or methods available for the enzymes in GC3.

Value assignment

Value assignment for the following analytes in the predicate device have already been cleared under k091225

Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Amylase (AMY), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Creatine kinase (CK), Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), Lactate Dehydrogenase ( LD) and Lipase ( LIP) The data provided by the sponsor indicates that for these analytes, each level is within the claim range and the five levels are linear.

However, since Cholinesterase (CHE) had not been validated previously value assignment for this analyte was provided separately.

The following table lists the Target recovery, the Mean observed, as well as the absolute difference and $\%$ difference of the Mean / Target.
