\* Test Strips

The Contour NEXT test strips utilize the same enzyme as the predicate Contour test strips (FAD-GDH). The same fundamental technology is also used for obtaining a blood glucose result. They differ in the fact that a different mediator is utilized - MLB mediator (3-( $2 ^ { \circ }$ , $5 ^ { \circ }$ -Disulfophenylimino-3H-phenothiazine) bis sodium salt) while the predicate utilizes Potassium Ferricyanide. The MLB mediator reduces background current and allows for a lower applied voltage. The Contour NEXT test strips have a different electrode pattern that can be used only on the Contour NEXT LINK device and are not compatible with the predicate device Contour USB meter (K091820).

\*\* Control Solutions

The Contour NEXT control solutions are identical in chemical composition to the Contour control solutions (predicate k091820). They differ in the concentration of the buffer BIS-TRIS (BT). The BT concentration in the Contour NEXT control solution is lower. The lower concentration allows the Contour NEXT sample identification algorithm to detect control and provide sufficient signal differentiation between blood and control solution.

\*\*\*Double Dip Function A software feature that allows the user to add additional blood after initially applying an insufficient sample (less than 0.6 uL) is present.

\*\*\*\* Moisture Damage Detection

A software feature that detects sensors that are exposed to humidity for long periods of time is present. If this condition is detected, an error is flagged and the glucose result is not calculated.

\*\*\*\*\*Algorithm

The Contour NEXT LINK device, when Contour NEXT test strip is utilized, employs an algorithm where the current is measured at several points in time (multi-pulse algorithm). The predicate device (K091820) uses an algorithm where the current is measured at a single point in time. The multi-pulse algorithm allows for additional mathematical compensations regarding hematocrit and temperature effects.

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus

ISO 14971: Medical devices – Application of risk management of medical devices

# L. Test Principle:

The CONTOUR® NEXT LINK wireless blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the strip. The blood sample is drawn into the tip of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and potassium ferricyanide. Electrons are generated, producing a current that is proportional to the glucose in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is displayed. No calculation is required.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

Within-run precision was evaluated using venous blood samples at five glucose concentrations across the measuring range. Three lots of test strips were tested each on 10 meters with 10 replicates per meter $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N = 1 0 0 / L o t } )$ ). Results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity for Contour Next test strip was established in this submission using the Contour Next Link wireless meter. A fresh venous blood pool was divided into eight aliquots and glycolyzed at room temperature or supplemented with a glucose stock solution to produce whole blood samples with plasma glucose concentrations across the intended measuring range. All samples were tested on 8 Contour Next Link meters using 3 lots of test strips to generate 24 test results and these results were plotted against the YSI reference values in the liner regression analysis. The result of the regression analysis is summarized in the below table:

Based on these results, the sponsor claims a measuring range of $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ for the Contour Next Link wireless blood glucose monitoring system.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

Traceable to NIST SRM 91, dry D-glucose.

Value assignment:

The value assignment of the Contour NEXT control solutions were determined by an in-house procedure. The control solutions were prepared by gravimetric addition of glucose to achieve target values of $1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for level 1 and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for level 2. During release, each lot of Contour NEXT Test Strips is tested with Contour NEXT Controls $( { \tt n } = 3 6$ per control level), and a range of $\pm 1 1 \%$ around the mean is assigned as the control range for each control level.

# Stability:

Real time stability was performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability of the control solutions and test strips. Stability studies protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be adequate. Unopened control solutions have an 18 month shelf life and are stable for 6 months after first use when stored at $4 8 – 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 9 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } - 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } )$ . The stability data also supports an 18-month unopened bottle shelf life and an open-vial use-life for the

Contour NEXT test strips under storage temperature range of $4 1 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ - $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . This information is provided in the labeling of the test strips and control materials.

d. Detection limit: See linearity study above.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference

The interference studies were carried out using three lots of Contour NEXT test strips. A pool of fresh whole blood at $8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ plasma glucose was measured using the YSI method. The interferents were tested in a doseresponse method at different levels meeting and exceeding the maximum concentration of the substance expected to be encountered in clinical practice. A total of 24 replicates per sample were collected for the six most common interfering substances (acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, bilirubin, uric acid, maltose, galactose) on eight Contour Next meters with each of the three lots of Contour NEXT test strips. The interference studies for the common drugs and anticoagulants were done by collecting 10 replicates from each of the three Contour NEXT test lots on five Contour Next Link Meters. In addition to testing compounds that were known to interfere with electrochemical glucose monitoring systems, testing was also conducted with a variety of common exogenous and endogenous compounds as also listed in the below table.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with reference method (YSL): System accuracy was evaluated according to the ISO 15197 document using

100 participants from a diabetic clinic. A trained HCP collected fingerstick sample from each participant. Each sample was tested in singlet using three different glucose reagent strip lots, 10 vials per lot to yield 300 total results. Six meters were used—two with each reagent strip lot. Fingerstick samples were analyzed on an YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer to provide reference values. The analyses were performed at $2 3 \pm 0 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

In most cases, samples were tested fresh from the finger without any modification. Altered samples ( $10 \%$ of total) were created by either glycolyzing a specimen to lower the glucose concentration or supplementing a specimen with a concentrated glucose solution to increase the glucose level. The distribution of the sample glucose concentrations is specified in the table below.

Clorox $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Germicidal Wipes containing $0 . 5 5 \%$ sodium hypochlorite with EPA registration # 67619-12 was validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus using materials from the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate cleaning and disinfection 1x per week for 5 years. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 6. Altitude Study

To ensure that high altitudes will not affect the system performance, a study was conducted inside a glove box purged with ultra pure nitrogen to simulate high altitude at 22,552 feet (6874 meters).

Two lots of reagent test strips were tested on five Contour $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Next Link wireless meters in duplicate (total $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 0$ ) with 15, 41, and $65 \%$ hematocrit whole blood supplemented to achieve target plasma glucose levels of 40, 90, and $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Mean assay results obtained inside the glove box were compared to the plasma YSI glucose values, and to the lab-elevation values. The difference for glucose values ${ < } 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the percent difference for glucose values $\geq 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was calculated. The mean bias across all hematocrit levels for glucose values ${ < } 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\geq 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ are acceptable.

The results support a system claim of up to 6874 meters (22,552 feet).

7. Hematocrit study:

The hematocrit sensitivity of the Contour Next Link system was evaluated. Three lots of reagent test strips were tested on five Contour $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Next Link wireless meters in triplicate (total $\mathtt { n } = 1 5$ ) with 15, 20, 30, 42, 55 and $65 \%$ hematocrit whole blood at 5 glucose concentrations of 40, 90, 127, 329 and $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Sample bias was calculated relative to the YSI reference method. The results support the sponsor’s claim that the system is accurate in hematocrit range of $1 5 \mathrm { - } 6 5 \%$ .
