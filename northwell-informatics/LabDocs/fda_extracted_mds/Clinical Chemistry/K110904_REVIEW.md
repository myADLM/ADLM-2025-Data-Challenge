# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and Value Assignment: Control solutions are derived from gravimetrically prepared stock solutions and analyzed in-house. Value assignment was determined through multiple analyses in- house on instrumentation calibrated with a master lot of calibrator. Control values were also confirmed in external studies with 9 different instrument families in 203 laboratories. Assigned control ranges are listed in the labeling by instrument family and analyte methods.

Stability: Real time stability studies were conducted for closed and open vials. Shelf-Life and Open Vial Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate.

Shelf-Life – The sponsor provided real time stability data demonstrating that the Randox Liquid Urine Controls, Levels 2 and 3, can be stored for 2 years at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Open-vial – The sponsor provided data demonstrating that upon opening a vial, the material is stable for 30 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
