Device Description:

Poly-Chem 90 Total Bilirubin is for the quantitative in vitro measurement of the level of total bilirubin in human serum on the Poly-Chem 90 clinical chemistry analyzer. The test methodology is a colorimetric method based on that described by Jendrassik and Grof (1938). Total bilirubin is determined in the presence of caffeine, which releases albumin bound bilirubin, by the reaction with diazotized sulphanilic acid.

Intended use:

Poly-Chem 90 Total Bilirubin is for the quantitative in vitro measurement of the level of total bilirubin in human serum on the Poly-Chem 90 clinical chemistry analyzer. Measurements of the level of bilirubin, an organic compound formed during the normal and abnormal destruction of red blood cells, are used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver, hemolytic hematological, and metabolic disorders, including hepatitis and gall bladder block.
