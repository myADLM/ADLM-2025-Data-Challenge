# L. Test Principle:

The Enzymatic Vitamin B6 Assay is based on PLP-dependent recombinant homocysteine- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a } , \gamma$ -lyase (rHCYase), which is prepared in the apo-enzyme form by stripping off the cofactor PLP (vitamin B6). The restoration of enzymatic activity by reconstitution of the holoenzyme depends on the amount of PLP in the plasma bound to apo-enzyme (Reaction 1) and produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S combines with N,N – dibutyl phenylene diamine (DBPDA), which then forms a chromophore (Reaction 2). The absorbance of this compound is read at $6 6 0 - 6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was determined as described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Protocol EP5-T2 Evaluation of precision performance of clinical chemistry devices. Three PLP levels plasma samples were assayed in duplicate for two runs per day for 20 days. The results are summarized below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was performed according to the CLSI protocol EP06-A Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. Pooled human plasma sample was spiked with PLP to a concentration above the measuring range of the device and diluted with calibrator 0 to make six intermediate levels. Each level was measured with the device and the mean observed values were compared to the expected values. Samples tested ranged from 251.3 to $7 . 8 5 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ and the observed results were within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected values for each of the concentrations tested in the claimed measuring range. The results were plotted as a least-squares linear regression of the expected concentration versus the observed concentration with a resulting regression equation of: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 9 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 0 0 0 5 6 .$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9$ .

The device claims a measuring range from 15.6 to $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

There is currently no internationally recognized reference method or reference material for pyridoxal $5 ^ { \circ }$ -phosphate (PLP). Calibrator values are assigned by HPLC measurement for each calibrator. Multiple measurements are performed and the mean value is calculated for value assignment. These calibrators are used to assign the target values and ranges for the quality control samples. These products contain human sourced and/or potentially infectious components. Donor units of components sourced from human plasma have been tested and found to be nonreactive for HBsAg, HIV-1 RNA or HIV-1 Ag, anti-HCV and anti-HIV-1/HIV-2.

Real-time stability testing was conducted by the firm and the protocols and acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor stated that their acceptance criteria for all stability studies was $< 1 0 \%$ difference from the day 0 value. The reagents, calibrators, and controls are stable until the date shown on the label when stored as instructed. Open vial stability testing was performed and showed that the kit is stable for one month when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after opening.

Stability of stored specimens (frozen storage and refrigerated) and the effect of freezing/thawing on the measurement of PLP by the A/C Enzymatic Vitamin B6 Assay were evaluated. EDTA-plasma specimens were shown to be stable for at least one year frozen at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and for two weeks when refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for this evaluation are recovery within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . The sponsor notes care should be taken to limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles when stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were evaluated as recommended in CLSI EP17-A Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. The calculations resulted in an LoB of $9 . 2 8 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ and an LoD of $1 3 . 1 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ . The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was also evaluated as recommended in CLSI EP17-A and resulted in an LoQ of $1 5 . 6 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ , which met the sponsor’s requirement of a $\%$ CV of $< 2 0 \%$ .

The cross reactants shown below were each spiked into a plasma sample with 50 nmol/L PLP. These samples were then evaluated with the device and the cross reactivity was calculated. Results are summarized below.

Triglyceride, bilirubin, and hemoglobin interference was evaluated by adding each interferent to EDTA plasma samples with PLP concentrations of 32.5 nmol/L and $1 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ . The concentration of each interferent tested and the results are summarized below.
