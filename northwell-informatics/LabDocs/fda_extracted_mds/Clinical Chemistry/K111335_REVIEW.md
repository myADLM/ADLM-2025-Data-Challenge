# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI guidelines: C28-A3, Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; EP6-A Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; EP9-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; EP17-A Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.

# L. Test Principle:

The ST AIA-PACK ACTH is a two-site enzyme immunoassay which is performed in the ST AIA-PACK ACTH test cups. ACTH present in the test sample is bound with goat polyclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody. The magnetic beads are washed to remove unbound enzymelabeled polyclonal antibody and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4- methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The enzyme alkaline phosphatase causes oxidation of 4MUP to 4MU. 4MU is excited at $3 6 5 \mathrm { n m }$ and comes to ground state at $4 4 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ releasing fluorescent energy. The amount of fluorescent energy is measured by the detector. The amount of enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional to the ACTH concentration in the test sample. A standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated using this curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Performance in this 510(k) was evaluated on the Tosoh AIA 2000 (Model 022100.)

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study followed the CLSI protocol, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods (EP5-A2). The precision study for the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay was evaluated utilizing three AIA-2000 analyzers and 3 different lots of reagents. Precision was assessed by assaying three levels of unaltered EDTA plasma specimens. Estimates of total and withinrun precision were obtained from measurements of 2 replicates in a single run, 2 times a day for 20 non-consecutive days. This equaled to a total of 40 runs and 80 determinants. One calibration curve (obtained on the first day) was used throughout.

The following results were obtained when tested with three unaltered plasma samples using three sets of reagents. A result of one reagent lot is shown below. Similar results were obtained with the two additional lots tested.

Also see Detection Limit section below regarding precision at lower levels.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor’s claimed reportable range is $2 – 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . To evaluate linearity, high and low samples (EDTA plasma) were serially diluted and assayed on the new device. The high samples were prepared by spiking a plasma sample and the low samples were prepared by diluting a low concentration sample with the AIA diluting solution. For each level tested, the average of four replicates was determined. The recoveries relative to expected concentrations based on dilution of the high and low samples, and the mean and SD’s of the replicates, are listed below. (In additions see the Detection

Limit Section for additional recovery determinations near the claimed assay lower limits.)

The equation determined by linear regression was: $\mathrm { Y = } 0 . 9 9 8 \mathrm { X + } 4 . 5$ , $R 2 { = } 0 . 9 9 9$ . In addition the data was evaluated according to CLSI guideline EP6 and the sponsor’s criteria for linearity.

High dose hook was evaluated by spiking samples up to $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The measured concentration read as $>$ high limit, (although the raw signal decreased at concentrations $> 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

Dilutions of high spiked samples, 2000 to 20,000 starting concentrations. No significant bias (relative to expected) was observed.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Calibrators:

Value assignment and traceability:

The device is traceable to primary reference material containing commercially available purified ACTH (Human, 1-39), which is value assigned using another RIA test. Values were further validated by replicate measurements on multiple instruments for specific lots.

Calibrator values are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Target Values(pg/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Estimateduncertainty inassignedvalues(pg/mL)1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>31</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>800</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>81</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2700</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>215</td></tr></table>

Real time storage:

Expiration of ST AIA-PACK ACTH CALIBRATOR SET was determined by using three different lots of CALIBRATOR SET, one AIA-2000 analyzer and three reagent sets. Reagents were stored at 8 - 12 degree C. The system was calibrated using the stored calibrator set on the day of assay. Each calibrator was assayed in 5 replicates and the mean and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated, at multiple time points including and past the expiration date. The protocol and acceptance criteria provided were adequate for the claim of 12 months at 2-8 degrees C.

Calibrator in-use stability:

Three sets of calibrator material were opened and reconstituted at time points before the measurement, and stored refrigerated. The system was calibrated using the stored (test) calibrators and recovery and precision of pooled samples stored at -70 degree C were evaluated as unknowns. The protocol and acceptance criteria provided were adequate to support the claim of in-use calibrator stability of one day when stored for one day tightly sealed and refrigerated at 2-8 degrees C.

# Control materials:

Stability: Control materials opened and closed stability was evaluated as described for calibrators, except that open control stability testing extended to 7 days. The protocol and acceptance criteria were adequate to support shelf-life stability of months and open vial stability is 7 days when store at 2-8 degrees C.

Value assignment:

The AIA-PACK ACTH CONTROL SET contains assigned concentration ranges of ACTH. The assigned range is determined using two analyzers and two reagent lots with 5 replicates per sample using the manufacturer’s working calibrators. The range is assigned as $+ / - 2 0 \%$ of the grand mean and is designed to provide target control levels of approximately 50 (target range approximately 40 to 60) and 300 (230 to 350) $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ of ACTH.

# d. Detection limit:

The lower limit of the assay range is based on the LoQ according to the CLSI EP17- A guideline. Fifteen samples were evaluated ranging from the LoB to 4 times the LoB. These samples were assayed 2 times a day for over 5 days. LoB is determined to be $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . LoD is determined by testing 60 blank and 60 low samples. LoD is determined to be $0 . 7 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . LoQ is determined to be $1 . 2 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . At that concentration CV was between $10 - 2 0 \%$ (and bias based on linearity was $< 5 \%$ ).

The sponsor claimed that the measuring range of the assay is 2.0 to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

ACTH fragments and related peptides were purchased from an outside vendor (Refer to the following table 1). ACTH fragments and related peptides were dissolved in ST AIA-PACK ACTH SAMPLE DILUTING SOLUTION (SDS) and adjusted to 10 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to prepare a stock solution. $3 0 \mathrm { u L }$ of fragments were diluted with $2 { , } 9 7 0 \mathrm { u L }$ of EDTA plasma to $1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Concentrations of 500 and $5 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ were prepared by further dilution with EDTA plasma.

The specimens were measured in duplicate using the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay at one site using one AIA-2000 analyzer and a single lot of reagent each. The mean and percent recovery was calculated as (Apparent value / Control value) $\textbf { x } 1 0 0$ .

ACTH 1-10, 11-24, beta-MSH and beta-Endorphin do not interfere the assay up to $1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

ACTH recovery was less than $90 \%$ in the presence of ACTH 1-17, 1-24, 18-39, alphaMSH $( > 5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ or ACTH 22-39 $\mathrm { ( > 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 p g / m L ) }$ . These fragments may negatively affect the ACTH assay. It is likely that these fragments bind to either the antibodies on beads or the enzyme-labeled antibodies. Therefore, if these fragments were contained excessively in the test sample, lower values may be reported.

Specimen pools at three concentrations of ACTH were evaluated by adding interfering substance and assaying utilizing the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay on the AIA-2000. The average of triplicate measurements for each level was calculated. The specimen value without adding interfering substance was used as the reference value. The sponsor defines non-significant interference as recovery within± $10 \%$ of the unspiked samples. No significant interference was observed when endogenous compounds were tested up to the following concentrations.

Heparin (up to $5 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ ). Acetominophen (up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ). Acetylsalicylic acid (up to $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Ampicillin (up to $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ). Ibuprofen (up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ). Theophylline (up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ). Hemoglobin (up to $4 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) Conjugated bilirubin (up to $1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) Free bilirubin (up to $1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) Lipemia ( up to $1 6 6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) Rheumatoid factor (up to $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ )

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 160 EDTA plasma specimens were assayed in singleton utilizing the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay on the AIA-2000 analyzer and the Roche Elecsys-ACTH on the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 (Elecsys module) analyzer. A combination of fresh and frozen specimens was utilized for this study. Sample selection criteria included only sample stability and integrity (e.g., no known hemolysis, lipemia or icteric). Of the 160 samples.154 were unaltered patient samples. Another 6 were prepared by mixing patient samples. Samples exposed to repeated freeze-thaw cycles were not used. Samples containing particulate matter were centrifuged prior to testing. Prior to assay, frozen samples were brought to room temperature slowly, and mixed gently.

Testing was done at one site utilizing one AIA-2000 analyzers and one MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 (Elecsys module) analyzer. Results are shown below.

# b. Matrix comparison

Not applicable; specimen collection and handling states EDTA plasma is required for the assay.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable; Clinical sensitivity and specificity is not typically provided in 510(k)s for this type of assay.   
b. Clinical specificity: See a, above.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The package insert states that each laboratory should determine a reference interval corresponding to the characteristics of the population being tested. Clinical results must be interpreted with regard to concomitant medications administered to the patient.

The reference range study was conducted with reference to the CLSI protocol entitled: How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory (C28-A3).

A total of 121 well-characterized unaltered EDTA plasma specimens from ambulatory patients with no known history of pituitary or adrenal disease were assayed in singleton utilizing the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay on the AIA-2000 analyzer. Specimens from 110 males between the ages of 26 to 60 years and 11 females between the ages of 28 to 44 years were included in this study. Samples were collected between 8 AM and noon and frozen below -70 degree C until testing. Prior to assay frozen samples were brought to room temperature $( 1 8 - 2 5 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ slowly, and mixed gently. Samples exposed to repeated freeze-thaw cycles were not used. Samples containing particulate matter were centrifuged prior to testing.

Testing was done at one site utilizing one AIA-2000 analyzer. Instrument maintenance and QC records were reviewed to ensure the instrument was functioning within normal guidelines.
