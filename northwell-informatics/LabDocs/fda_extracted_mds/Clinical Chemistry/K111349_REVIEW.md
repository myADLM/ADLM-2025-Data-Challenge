3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use

Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers including the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, cobas e 411, cobas e 601, and cobas e 602 analyzer platforms.

Note: cobas e 411 share the same analytical core as Elecsys 2010; cobas e 601, and cobas e 602 share the same analytical core as E170.

# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of SHBG in human and equine (horse) serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels. The sponsor declared in the labeling that all products derived from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A.

During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:   
Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 is traceable to the NIBSC 95/560 international standard.

# Value Assignment:

For each Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are assayed in duplicate on at least three E170 analyzers. The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range $1 \mathrm { s } \pm 3 0 \%$ of assigned value, in which $10 \%$ was allotted for between-analyzer platform tolerance, $10 \%$ for stability tolerance and $10 \%$ for precision of the assay.

Values are assigned for each lot of Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 in combination with each Elecsys SHBG reagent lot available.

For additional analyzers (Elecsys 2010), the same value assignment procedure is performed. The assigned values obtained on 2010 are compared to those obtained on the E170. Differences between the analyzer platforms are within the $10 \%$ tolerance, therefore, the values assigned to the E170 (and cobas e 601, e602) are transferred to and valid for the Elecsys 2010 (and cobas e 411).

# Stability:

The stability studies for SHBG CalCheck 5 were performed on the cobas e 601. Because these studies are not analyzer-dependent, these results, in addition to real-time stability study results, can be applied to the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, cobas e 411 and cobas e 602. The stability protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Shelf-life stability:   
The accelerated stability testing performed at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ supports an initial shelf-life claim of 18 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real-time testing at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going to support a claim of 36 months.   
Open-vial stability after reconstitution :   
Real time testing was performed and the data support the package insert claim that reconstituted Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .   
On-board stability:   
The SHBG CalCheck 5 products are not stored on-board the analyzer, therefore no on-board stability claims is made.
