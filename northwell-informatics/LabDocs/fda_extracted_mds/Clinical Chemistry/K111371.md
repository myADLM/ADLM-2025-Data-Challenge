# Description:

The On Call" Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a quantitative assay for the detection of glucose in capillary whole blood sampled from the fingertip, palm, and forearm. The glucose measurement is achieved by using the amperometric detection method.

The test strip has a reagent system including glucose oxidase and a mediator that reacts with glucose in the whole blood sample to produce an electrical current. This current is measured by the meter, and after calculation by the meter, the blood glucose concentration reading is displayed on the meter display, calibrated to a plasma reference.

# Intended Use:

The On $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { C a l l } } ^ { \mathfrak { D } }$ Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an electrochemical enzymatic assay for the quantitative detection of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip by people with diabetes at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control programs. Alternate (forearm and palm) testing sites should be used only when blood glucose level is not changing rapidly. The On Call® Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be shared. It is for in vitro diagnostic use only.

® The On Call Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, or use on neonates.

® The On Call Chosen Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the On Call Chosen Blood Glucoe Meterin th quantitative measurement  glucose in capillary blood fro the fingertip, forearm and palm.

® $\otimes$ EPY The On Call Chosen Blood Glucose Control Solution is for use with the On Call Chosen Blood Glucose Meter and Strips as a quality control check to verify that the meter and test strips are workng tgether proper nd that he te peigcorecy.

# Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as follows:

Guidance documents included the "FDA Guidance for Industry In Vitro Diagnostic Glucose Test System" and "FDA Guidance for Total Product Life Cycle for Portable Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems" as well as "Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices."

Compliance to applicable voluntary standards includes EN ISO 15197:2003 "In vitro diagnostic test systems  Requirements for in vitro whole blood glucose monitoring systems intended for use by patients for self testing in management of diabetes mellitus."

# Laboratory Testing:

The performance characteristics of the On Call" Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System were evaluated by performing the following studies: repeatability precision, intermediate precision, linearity, interfering agents, hematocrit effect, temperature effect evaluation  blood & control solution, low battery effect, altitude effect, sample volume, humidity effect, simulated shipping study  test strip & control solution, control value assignment, meter testing, software validation testing, electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety testing as part of meter and strip validation testing.

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

Clinical studies were conducted with lay persons and trained laboratory technicians using the On Call" Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The study data were presented evaluating the system accuracy of the On Call" Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared to the YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS (K913806) per the ACON Clinical Study Protocol for the Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Study results indicate that nonprofessional, inexperienced lay persons were able to obtain comparable blood glucose readings when using the On Call" Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System as compared to the results obtained by the trained technicians. In addition, the participating lay persons were questioned and responded as satisfied with the ease of operation by following the Instructions for Use in the User's Manual and the overall performance of the On Call Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# Conclusion:

The laboratory testing and clinical study results demonstrate that the On Call Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System is safe, effective and easy-to-use. It also demonstrates that the On Call\* Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System meets the accuracy requirements per EN ISO 15197 and as such is substantially equivalent to the One Tuch Ultra Blood Glucose Monitoring System, currently sold on the U.S. market (K002134).
