# Device Description:

Medisign MM1000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Medisign MM1100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, and Medisign MM1200 Blood Glucose Monitoring System are basically provided with a blood glucose meter, blood glucose test strips (10T), and a carrying bag including user manual, quick reference manual and log book. Blood glucose test strips (25T, 50T), blood glucose control solutions (Level A, Level B), check strip, diabetes management software, and data

transporting cable are sold separately.

Medisign MM1000 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Medisign MM1100 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System, and Medisign MM1200 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System are basically provided with a blood glucose meter, blood glucose test strips (10T), and a carrying bag including user manual, quick reference manual and log book. Disposable lancing device, blood glucose test strips (25T, 50T) blood glucose control solutions (Level A, Level B), check srip, diabetes management software, and data transporting cable are sold separately.

Eac box o test strips contains one vial o 10 test srips,one vialo 25 test strips,one vialof 50 test strips, or two vials of 25 test strips. Each test strip contains the following reagent compositions: glucose oxidase (A. Niger) 2.5 units, redox mediator $- 3 2 . { \dot { 3 } } \mu 9$ and buffer & non-reactant - $5 0 . 5 \mu _ { 9 }$

Each box of control solutions (Level A and Level B) contains one vial of aqueous control solution $\left[ 4 \mathsf { m } \right]$ each): Level A contains $0 . 1 1 \%$ concentrations of glucose (approximately $\mathsf { I } 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Level B contains $0 . 2 3 \%$ concentrations of glucose (approximately $3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Only the differenceamongsix blood glucose monitoring systes above is the appearance  the top cases of the meters. Six blood glucose monitoring systems use the same PCB, the same LCD, the same Software, the same test strip, and the same control solution.

Dear HL Jung:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA mav publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of

Page 2 -

the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market. If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796-5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (301) 796-5760. For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its tol-free number (800) 638-2041or ( 301) 796- 5680 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.
