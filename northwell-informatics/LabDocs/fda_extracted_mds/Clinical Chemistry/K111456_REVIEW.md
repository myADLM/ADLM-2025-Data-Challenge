# L. Test Principle:

Glucose in the blood sample reacts with glucose oxidase on the test strip and an electrical current is produced. This current is measured by the meter and displayed as the blood glucose result. The strength of these currents changes with the amount of glucose in the blood sample. The meter automatically interprets this reaction. Glucose measurements are reported as plasma equivalents.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

The Medisign MM1000, MM1100, MM1200, MM1000 Multi, MM1100 Multi, and MM1200 Multi blood glucose monitoring systems are identical in technological characteristics. All six test systems use the same test strips and are identical with the exception of their names, meter cover appearance, and indications for use (single- vs. multiple-patient use); therefore, one set of performance data was provided.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability studies were carried out by testing venous blood at five venous blood glucose concentrations (HCT $42 \%$ ) ranging from $4 2 { - } 3 3 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Three lots of MM1000 glucose test strips were tested on ten MM1000 glucose meters with ten replicates per meter. To evaluate intermediate precision, the sponsor tested three levels of control solutions on ten MM1000 glucose meters and three lots of MM1000 glucose test strips over the course of 10 days. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation (CV) were determined for each level as summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was carried out using nine different levels of venous whole blood sample ranging from 18, 48, 65, 147, 272, 374, 452, 561, and $6 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 4 2 \% \mathrm { H C T } )$ as determined by the YSI reference method. Samples were altered to reach the low and high end of the glucose concentration range. Each glucose level was measured with one lot of glucose test strips on two MM1100 glucose meters. Least-square regression analysis is summarized below.

The claimed reportable range of the MM1000, MM1100, MM1200, MM1000multi, MM1100multi, and MM1200 multi blood glucose monitoring systems is 20 to 600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples below or above the claimed measuring range are flagged by the meter as $\mathrm { ^ { \circ } C O ^ { \circ } }$ or “HI”, respectively.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The Medisign blood glucose monitoring systems are factory calibrated and further calibration by the user is not necessary for operation. The calibration is traceable to NIST SRM #917c.

# Test Strip Stability

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the Medisign test strips were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended storage temperatures of $4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Controls Value Assignment and Stability

Value assignment for the control solutions is based on repeat testing using twentyfive Medisign test strips for every lot of test strips and five Medisign glucose meters. Value ranges are as follows:

Control Solution Level A: Target value is $1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Control Solution Level B: Target value is $3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the glucose control solutions were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended storage temperatures of $4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the Medisign blood glucose monitoring systems is 20 to 600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b of this decision summary).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interferences studies were performed by adding common endogenous and exogenous substances to two sets of venous blood samples at $1 4 0 { - } 1 8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 250-350 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ plasma glucose and calculating bias relative to a control of the same samples. Studies done by collecting five replicates using one test strip lot at a therapeutic and a toxic level of each common endogenous and exogenous compound. Significant interference was defined by the sponsor as ${ > } 1 0 \%$ bias. No significant interference was observed up to the levels shown in the table below for the following interfering substances:

# P. O therSupportiveInstrum entPerform anceCharacteristicsDataNotCovered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study - A study was performed to evaluate the blood hematocrit (HCT) effect on the performance of the Medisign MM1000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System across the measuring range of the assay. Whole blood samples were tested in replicates of 12 with the Medisign system using one lot of strips and six meters. Glucose concentrations at each HCT level $( 3 0 \%$ , $42 \%$ , and $5 5 \%$ ) were compared to results obtained with the YSI-2300 reference method. Data from samples at $30 \%$ and $5 5 \%$ were also compared to results from samples at $42 \%$ . The data met acceptance criteria for the claimed HCT range. The sponsor included the following limitation in the labeling: “Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cells in the blood. HCT levels of $30 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \%$ were shown not to affect glucose measurements with this device. If you do not know your hematocrit level, consult with your health care professional.”

2. Altitude Study - The effect of altitude was evaluated inside a chamber to simulate sea level and a high altitude condition of 11,480 feet. Three lots of the Medisign test strips were tested on three meters, ten strips per meter, with $42 \%$ HCT whole blood at five different glucose concentrations ranging from 126 to $5 1 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Simulation chamber test results were compared to the YSI reference values. Average assay bias was less than $\pm 5 \%$ . The sponsor included a limitation in the labeling indicating that the test strip may be used at altitudes up to 10,000 feet.

3. Temperature and Humidity Studies - A study was performed to evaluate the effect of temperature and humidity on the performance of the Medisign (MM1000) Blood Glucose Monitoring System at three glucose levels (74, 120, and $3 0 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) using whole blood samples. Samples were tested at each glucose level with the Medisign system using one lot of strips and three meters. Glucose concentrations at each humidity level $( 1 0 \% , 4 0 \%$ , and $90 \%$ RH) and temperature combination $( 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } , 2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ , and $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) were compared with results obtained with the YSI-2300 reference method. The study results support the manufacturer’s claims of operating conditions within $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ RH and $1 0 { - } 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

4. Sample Volume Study - A sample volume study using fresh whole blood samples at 61, 122, 257, 409, and $5 1 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose was performed by testing one lot of Medisign glucose test strips in replicates of 5 on one Medisign glucose meter at different sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and $0 . 7 \mathrm { u L }$ ). Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample volume of ${ \ge } 0 . 5$ uL produced accurate results and samples ${ < } 0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { u L }$ give an error code.

5. Readability Study - Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the labeling (user manual for single-patient use, test strip package inserts, and control solution package insert) were written at the 8th grade level.

6. Usability Study - A usability study was performed to assess the ease of use of the labeling by recruiting 156 lay users (ages18 to ${ > } 5 1$ ) who were provided with the test kit containing labeling for the US market. Participants varied in age and education, and were about evenly divided between men and women. These lay users also completed a questionnaire to respond whether the device is easy to use and the instructions for use were written in a way that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded the device was easy to use and the instructions were easy to understand.

7. Customer service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Toll free phone number is 1-888-885-6677 for customer support.

8. EMC Testing - EMC testing was evaluated and certified by One Tech Corp and a certificate test was issued to Tianjin Empecs on December 28, 2010.

9. Cleaning and Disinfection Studies - The device is intended for single- (Medisign MM1000, MM1100, and MM1200) and multiple- (Medisign MM1000 Multi, MM1100 Multi, and MM1200 ) patient use. Caviwipes disinfecting Towelettes with EPA registration #46781-8 were validated by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus using materials from the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 11,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of device use. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
