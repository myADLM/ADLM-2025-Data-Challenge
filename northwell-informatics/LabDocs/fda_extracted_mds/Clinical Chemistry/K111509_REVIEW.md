# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATIONDECISION SUMMARYINSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE

A. 510(k) Number: k111509   
B. Purpose for Submission: New submission for an accessory data management software application for cleared glucose meters   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: SweetSpot Diabetes Care, Inc. SweetSpot Diabetes Data Management Service   
D. Type of Test or Tests performed: Diabetes data management system

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description: The SweetSpot Service allows patients or healthcare professionals to download data from blood glucose meters (BGM) and generates a report from the downloaded data, which is delivered to the healthcare professional for use in patient management. The Service is comprised of three different types of data retrieval stations, a Fetch Utility, a data processing and storage platform, report generation software, and an information delivery service.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The Service is Microsoft Windows and Apple OSX compatible, and is delivered as Software as a Service (SaaS) over the internet. The Service centrally manages data and activities through multiple, loosely-coupled units of functionality.

The SweetSpot Service is comprised of 3 subsystems: Kiosk, Fetch Utility, and SweetSpot Platform. The Fetch Utility resides on a Kiosk and is updated from the Platform as needed. If the Back-Office Web Application is used, the Fetch Utility is called from the Platform for each instance of use (it does not reside on a standalone computer). The Platform resides on web.

# 3. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer,   
webserver, or mobile device?   
Yes X or No Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?   
Yes or No X .

If a BGM uses wireless or Bluetooth $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ communication, the Kiosk is capable of detecting these signals and downloading the BGM data using 802.11(g) or Bluetooth $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2.1 protocols.

The SweetSpot Service operates in the following manner:

The patient or clinician “checks-in” (downloads) BGM data The BGM data are sent to the SweetSpot Platform on the Web The SweetSpot Platform performs various data processing steps on the BGM data The SweetSpot Platform generates a report from the BGM data The SweetSpot Service delivers the report to the clinician, and to the patient if requested
