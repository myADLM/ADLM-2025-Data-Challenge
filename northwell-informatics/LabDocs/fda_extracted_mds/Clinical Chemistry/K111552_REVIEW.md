# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of L-3,3,5-Triiodothyronine (T3) in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels. The sponsor declared in the labeling that all products derived from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A.

During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:   
Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The assayed value of each CalCheck level was standardized against reference standards by weighing T3 into an analyte-free human serum matrix. The reference standard used was T3, BCR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ certified Reference Material, from a commercial vendor. BCR is a registered trademark of the European Commission.

# Value Assignment:

For each Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are assayed in duplicate on four E170 analyzers. The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained from 8 determinations of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range $1 \mathrm { s } \pm 1 8 \%$ of assigned value, in which $10 \%$ was allotted for between-analyzer platform tolerance, $4 \%$ for stability tolerance and $4 \%$ for precision of the assay.

Values are assigned for each lot of Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 in combination with each Elecsys T3 reagent lot available.

For additional analyzers (Elecsys 2010), The Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 was run once a day on 8 Elecsys 2010 analyzers for a total of 1 day. The assigned values obtained on Elecsys 2010 are compared to those obtained on the E170. Differences between the analyzer platforms are within the $10 \%$ tolerance, therefore, the values assigned to the E170 (and cobas e 601, e602) are transferred to and valid for the Elecsys 2010 (and cobas e 411).

# Stability:

The stability studies for T3 CalCheck 5 were performed on Elecsys 2010. Because these studies are not analyzer-dependent, these results, in addition to real-time stability study results, can be applied to the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, cobas e 411, cobas e 601 and cobas e 602. The stability protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Shelf-life stability:   
The accelerated stability testing performed at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ supports an initial shelf-life claim of 24 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real-time testing at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going to support a claim of 36 months.   
Open-vial stability after reconstitution :   
Real time testing was performed and the data support the package insert claim that reconstituted Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .   
On-board stability:   
The T3 CalCheck 5 products are not stored on-board the analyzer, therefore no onboard stability claims is made.
