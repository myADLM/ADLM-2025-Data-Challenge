# Executive Summary

Detailed performance characteristics and comparison analysis are given in this filing that demonstrates substantial equivalence of the Cystatin C POC Test Kit to predicate device that is currently being marketed. The performance characteristics of the Cystatin C POC Test Kit are substantially similar to that of the approved predicate device (k093680). Performance data and risk analysis indicates that differences should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Cystatin C POC Test and offers POL users an in vitro diagnostic device system to measure Cystatin C in human blood samples.

# Device Description:

Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test Kit contains reagents intended for use with the SMART analyzer for the quantitative determination of Cystatin C (Cys C) in human venous whole blood samples. Measurement of Cystatin C can assist in the assessment of renal transplantation status, monitoring GFR in nephrotoxic drug therapy, and monitoring GFR in acute and chronic kidney diseases including diabetic nephropathy. Cystatin C POC Test reagents are similar to the predicate Diazyme Cystatin C assay reagents (k093680). The similarities and differences in composition and format are noted in Table 1 below. The Cystatin C POC Test is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Cystatin C in the venous whole blood sample binds to the specific antiCystatin C antibody, which is coated on latex particles, and causes agglutination. The degree of the turbidity caused by agglutination can be measured optically and is proportional to the amount of Cystatin C in the venous whole blood sample. The Cystatin C concentration is expressed as ${ \mathrm { m g / L } }$ Cystatin C by use of a lot specific calibration curve that is stored in an RFID card provided with each SMART test kit.

Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test Control Kit is intended for use as quality controls for the Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test and is packaged separately. The controls are made from human venous whole blood and are in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) state. The quality controls assist laboratory users in verification steps ensuring that the assay reagents are functioning correctly. QC materials are run exactly as samples. Users are instructed to verify the calibration curve with the controls and run controls each time a new lot of reagents are received. If QC materials fall outside laboratory acceptable range, users are instructed to re-test and call manufacturer customer service if problem persists.

SMART Analyzer (k092911) is a compact cuvette based spectrophotometer (10 inches x 5.5 inches $\textbf { x } 5 . 5$ inches) machine for point-of-care testing designed to analyze readings from single use reagent cuvette. The instrument only uses the Diazyme Reagent System (DRS) cuvette and caps and performs assay with a preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card. The DRS cuvette is supplied prefilled with Reagent 1 (R1) and the DRS cap is supplied prefilled with Reagent 2 (R2). The DRS cuvette and caps are kept separate until use. Users are instructed (see proposed labeling) to add $2 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of sample to the DRS cuvette prefilled with R1 containing proper amount of detergent for venous whole blood lysis. Users are then instructed to snap in place DRS cap and insert into analyzer. The instrument warms the cuvette to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and after a predefined period adds the reagent R2 found in the DRS cap. The reagents and samples are mixed magnetically and absorbance readings are taken at $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .The lot specific RFID card contains reagent addition time, mixing time, reading time and calibration curve.

The Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test system thus consists of the following:

Cystatin C POC Test Kit. Reagents are provided in prefilled tubes, cuvettes and cuvette caps. The DRS cuvette and cuvette caps can only work with the SMART analyzer.   
Cystatin C POC Test Control Kit. Controls are provided for quality control of the Cystatin C POC Test.

Equipment needed for Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test:

SMART Analyzer (K092911).

# Comparison studies

# Method comparison with predicate device

To demonstrate accuracy, the candidate device was tested with individual samples and the results compared to predicate device (k093680) using CLSI EP9-A2: Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using patient samples as a guideline. The method comparison study was performed internally at Diazyme laboratories and externally at three POL sites.

# Internal method comparison

Paired human whole blood-serum samples (venous whole blood and plasma from the same individual) were tested for comparison. The whole blood samples were tested with the Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test on SMART analyzer and the correspondent plasma samples were tested with predicate Assay (k093680) on Hitachi 917. A total of fifty five (55) EDTA whole blood specimens were tested with Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test. The correspondent plasma samples were tested with Diazyme Cystatin C on Hitachi 917 analyzer.

# Rationale for Considering the Device Substantially Equivalent to Devices Approved for Inter-state Commerce

Diazyme Cystatin C Assay (k093680) was selected for method comparison. The reagents used for the POC Test are similar to the predicate and were used to develop the application (parameter) for the SMART Analyzer. The only difference is the addition of detergent Triton100 $( 0 . 1 2 5 \% )$ is to Reagent R1. The similarity and differences for the predicate reagent versus the POC Test reagents are given in the table below.
