# Indications For Use:

The FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip. The FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use.

The FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip.

FreeStyle Control Solutions are for use with the FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Monitoring System as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

# Description of the Device:

The FreeStyle InsuLinx Meter, in conjunction with the FreeStyle InsuLinx Test Strips works on the principal of coulometric biosensor technology, measuring glucose by its reaction with Glucose Dehydrogenase (GDH) in blood samples or control solutions, through electrochemical mediation.

The device automatically logs blood glucose results and other events to create a customized logbook. The FreeStyle InsuLinx System has a large touch screen and a user interface designed for an easy user experience.

Patient and Healthcare Professionals can pre-program audible and visual reminders for blood glucose testing, or other individual needs.

Weekly messages feature assist the patient in identifying patterns in their blood glucose results. Using a rolling report, the measured glucose values are summarized according to the proportion within, above, or below the predetermined target range entered by the patient or HCP. These results are displayed in a simple graphical format and include a count of the tests performed. An additional algorithm compares the prevailing blood glucose levels during the preceding week with simple messages relating to achievement versus target glucose levels.

The FreeStyle InsuLinx System has 'plug and play' software that automatically installs on a computer without the need for a CD or internet access (via the meter's USB port and a provided cable). It also provides access to the structured reports for both the healthcare professionals and patients.

The FreeStyle Auto-Assist software produces six different reports to facilitate discussion between patients and their health care professionals in the review, analysis, and evaluation of historical blood glucose test results to support an effective diabetes management program. The software also shows trends in blood glucose data in both graphical and text format for guided interpretation.

The Snapshot Report is a general summary of the data for a specified date range. The Modal Day Report shows the daily patterns of blood glucose levels over a   
specified date range The Logbook Report is a table of blood glucose for each day in the specified date   
range. The Daily Statistics Report provides an overview of blood glucose over the date   
range in a series of charts and tables. The Meal Event Averages Report compares the before and after meal blood glucose   
level averages for the morning, mid-day and evening times over the specified date range. The Meter Settings Report shows current meter settings.

These reports provide detailed information on glucose monitoring, and are designed to enable healthcare professionals and patients to assess the effectiveness of diabetes management and then plan appropriate changes to therapy regimens.

The FreeStyle InsuLinx System may be packaged within a cardboard carton, in addition to the following components and accessories listed below.

# Principles of Operation:

The FreeStyle InsuLinx Meter (in conjunction with FreeStyle InsuLinx blood glucose test strips) utilizes coulometric biosensor technology to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in whole blood samples and in FreeStyle Control Solutions.

The FreeStyle InsuLinx Meter measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose biosensor is capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by virtue of the glucose specificity of the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) present on the glucose test strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are transferred via a co-factor and mediator to the meter where they are read as a small electrical current. The current is integrated over the analysis time to generate charge which is directly proportional to the level of the glucose in the applied sample.

The FreeStyle InsuLinx Meter does not require calibration prior to use with the FreeStyle InsuLinx Test Strips. The device is prepared for use by inserting a FreeStyle InsuLinx test strip in the test strip port. Upon strip insertion, the meter will turn on automatically and perform a display check. The 'apply blood'message is displayed for the user to apply blood to the test strip until the meter begins the test. Blood detect will occur when the meter detects trigger current from the test strip, when enough blood has covered the strip electrodes. Following the blood detect, the meter performs the glucose assay measurement.
