# L. Test Principle:

Xylidyl blue-1 $^ +$ Mg\*\* → Mg-xylidyl blue complex (red)

Under the alkaline conditions of the Magnesium reagent, magnesium present in the sample, when mixed with reagent, frms a red complex with the diazonium salt of xylidyl blue.The concentration of magnesium in the sample is directy proporional to the amount of xylidyl blue Magnesium complex formed and can be measured spectrophotometrically by the decrease in absorbance measured at $6 6 0 \mathsf { n m }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

a.Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision testing was performed according to CLSI guideline EP5-A2. Samples, including serum pools and control materials, were tested twice per day in duplicate for 20 days. Results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed in accordance with CLSI protocol EP6-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures, a Statistical Approach, and the Sekisui Diagnostics Magnesium method was demonstrated to be linear across the reportable range from $0 . 2 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L }$ (0.08 mmol/L) to $8 . 0 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L }$ (3.29 mmol/L). A high concentration serum pool was diluted with saline to produce 11 concentrations of magnesium. Samples were assayed in replicates of four. The results were used to generate best fit regression lines using a linear equation.

Nonlinearity is less than allowable nonlinearity.

Summary of Linear Fit

Slope 1.01

Intercept 0.013 mg/dL

N 11

The linearity testing confirmed a reportable range of 0.3 - 8.0 mg/dL (0.12 - 3.29 mmol/L).

# c. Detection limit:

The determination of the method detection limits was performed according to the CLSl EP17-A Guideline, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline. Limit of Detection (LoD) is defined as the smallest amount of an analyte that the method can reliably detect to determine presence or absence of the analyte. LoD was determined by measuring 60 replicates of a zero magnesium sample and 60 replicates of the low concentration serum control sample.

The results were used following the EP17-A guidelines to calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection, and Limit of Quantitaion (LoQ). The Limit of Blank was determined as 0.15 mg/dL magnesium. The Pooled SD for the low values of the samples was determined as 0.06 mg/dL; therefore, the LoD is calculated to be $0 . 2 5 \boldsymbol { \mathsf { m g } } / \mathsf { L }$ . The LoQ represents the magnesium concentration where the CV is less than or equal to $20 \%$ The LoQ is therefore $0 . 3 0 \mathsf { m g / L }$ .

# Analytical specificity:

Interference studies on the effects of endogenous and exogenous substances were designed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Potentially cross-reactive or interfering substances that were evaluated included five endogenous substances (unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipemia, and ascorbic acid).Three samples of human serum with different concentrations of magnesium were tested with the potential interference substances and analyzed in quadruplicate on the Roche Hitachi 717 automated analyzer. No significant interference was defined to be within $+ / -$ EPY $10 \%$ of the corresponding control result for the high magnesium sample.

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed based on the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. Serum samples $_ { ( n = 1 0 0 ) }$ were obtained for the study, of which 100 were determined to be within the reportable range of the candidate method and the Predicate method (sample recoveries ranged from $0 . 5 m g / d L$ to $7 . 3 \ : \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L }$ magnesium. The Beckman Coulter method on the AU640 was used to compare the results performed using the Sekisui Diagnostics Magnesium Assay on the Roche Hitachi 717 automated analyzer. The results demonstrate the Sekisui Diagnostics Magnesium test method on Roche Hitachi 717 is substantially comparable with the Beckman Coulter magnesium assay on AU640 analyzer. A summary of the regression statistics is provided below:

Samples, $\mathsf { n } =$ 100

Slope: 0.981

Intercept: 0.00 mg/dL

Correlation: 0.9848 b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was conducted using fresh samples from non-fasting donors drawn as serum, and Li Heparin plasma. Sekisui Diagnostics Magnesium method with serum was used to compare the results obtained using the Sekisui Diagnostics Magnesium Assay with plasma on the Roche Hitachi 717 automated analyzer. The results demonstrate the Sekisui Diagnostics Magnesium test method with plasma is substantially comparable with the Sekisui Diagnostics Magnesium test method with serum on Roche Hitachi 717 analyzer. A summary of the regression statistics is provided below:

Samples, n= 54 Slope: 1.009 Intercept: -0.12 mg/dL Correlation: 0.9903
