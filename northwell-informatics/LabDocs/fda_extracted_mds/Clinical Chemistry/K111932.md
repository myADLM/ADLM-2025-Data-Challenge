The iglucoseTM System does not measure, interpret or make decisions on the data that it conveys, nor is it intended to provide automated treatment decisions, or to be used as a substitute for professional healthcare judgment. All medical diagnosis and treatment are to be performed under the supervision and oversight of an appropriate healthcare professional.

# Device Description:

The iglucose™ System is designed to assist individuals with diabetes with their record keeping management, by automatically tracking and storing historical blood glucose readings. It has been developed for home or health care facility settings as an aid in supporting diabetes management. iglucose™M is designed to connect to glucose meters and automatically transmit blood glucose reading(s) to a secure database. Users can then utilize the iglucoe™M diabetes management portal (web-based application) to view their blood glucose readings as well as to generate and display reports. At the user's discretion, authorized individuals can also view blood glucose readings and reports.

More specifically, the iglucose System is comprised of the following:

iglucose™M Device   
Secure Database   
•iglucose™M Diabetes Management Portal (web-based application)

The iglucose™M device is approximately the size of a cell phone and has a rechargeable battery. It connects to compatible FDA cleared glucose meters via a data cable and extracts data from a glucose meter. It then wirelessly (via the cellular network) transmits data (blood glucose readings, date and time) from a glucose meter to a secure database. Software used for the database enables the data to be viewable in an organized manner via the iglucose™M diabetes management portal (web-based application). At the user's discretion, the data can be communicated via email, SMS text message and/or fax.

Data can be displayed in a logbook form. In addition, data can be displayed and trended in reports that are in tabular and graphical formats such as line graphs, pie charts and histograms.

# Summary of Characteristics Compared to Predicate Devices:

The Intended Use and Indications or Ueof the predicate devices and the igucose Syste ar virtually the same and all are intended or over the counter use.Intended users are home users and health care providers.

The operation of the subject device is similar to the predicate devices in that the user connects the device to a compatible glucose meters and then initiates the transmission of glucose readings from the glucose meters to a central database. The user or healthcare provider can then access and view glucose readings using a web-based application. The features of the method of operation are described in the table below.

The underlying technology of the iglucose™ System is similar to that of the predicate devices in that they all connect to compatible glucose meters and transmit the glucose readings to a secure central database. They each transmit data using wired or wireless telecommunication. The transmitted data can then be accessed and reviewed by users and healthcare providers. All devices supply historical readings, reports and graphs to the user.

Minor Differences:

There are four minor differences between the iglucose™M and the two predicate devices: 1. Connection to the glucose meters, 2. Power source, 3. Type of telecommunications technology used to communication method with central server and 4. Method of outbound communication of information. These are described in the table below.
