# Device Description

The Access Folate Calibrators are a six level calibrator set intended to calibrate the Access Folate assay for the quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, plasma (heparin) and red blood cells using the Access Immunoassay System. The calibrator set provides calibrators at six levels  zero and approximately 1.2, 3.1, 6.2, 12.4 and 24.8 ng/mL (2.8, 7.0, 14.0, 28.1, and 56.2 nmol/L). The calibrators are contained in $4 . 0 m L$ vials. The calibrator vials are intended for storage at $\bullet 2 0 \%$ or colder.

Calibration cards are provided with each calibrator kit. Calibration cards contain bar codes that are encrypted with the individual calibrator concentrations for each calibrator level.

Folate Calibrator S0 is intended for use with Access Folate assay to dilute patient samples containing analyte concentrations greater than the analyte specific S5 calibrator. Folate Calibrator S0 is a buffered matrix with human serum albumin (HSA) surfactant, < 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.25% ProClin 300. Contains 0.0 ng/mL (nmol/L) folate.

# Intended Use

The Access Folate Calibrators are intended to calibrate the Access Folate assay for the quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, plasma (heparin) and red blood cells using the Access Immunoassay Systems.

Dear Ms. Oetter:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Irev csboveitecas Sloas may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be in   Co Fedeal Regulatios CFR), rts 800 to . I ition, FAy publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter wil allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA inding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
