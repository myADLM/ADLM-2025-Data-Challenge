# L. Test Principle:

Indirect potentiometric measurement with Ion-Selective Electrode i.e., ISE measurements are based on the potentiometric and Nernst Equation principle. The sample is diluted with a diluent and aspirated into ion-selective electrodes. The measured potential difference between the reference electrode and the ion specific electrodes is proportional to the Logarithm of the concentration of the measured ions.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed with three pooled human serum samples at three different concentrations of CO2, on two separate Selectra ProM analyzers, over twenty operating days. Samples were tested in duplicate twice a day $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ). The results are summarized in the tables below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of CO2 System was studied by mixing a sample with high value $( 4 3 . 0 \mathrm { m E q / L } )$ and a sample with low value $\mathrm { 1 0 . 8 \ m E q / L ) }$ to obtain 11 levels with equidistant concentrations of CO2. All samples were tested in triplicate on the Selectra ProM analyzer. The expected values were plotted against the observed values and a linear regression line was fitted with the following regression:

$\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 3 8 7 \cdot 0 . 9 \ : \mathrm { m E q / L }$ $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 8$

The Standard error of the estimate, Sy.x is equal to $0 . 2 \mathrm { m E q } / \mathrm { L }$ .

The results of the linearity study support the CO2 assay measuring range from 10.8 to $4 3 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m E q / L }$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

CO2 value is traceable to the Standard Reference Material SRM 924a (of the National Institute of Standards and Technology).

# Stability:

Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k033501). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: ELITech Clinical Systems ISE Calibrators is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to reconstitution. After reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at $1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 2 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $- 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and ${ } _ { - 1 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The labeling stated that the Calibrators should be stored tightly capped and protected from light when not in use.

# Value Assignment

ELITech Clinical Systems ISE Calibrators are value assigned using multiple Vital Scientific Selectra ProM analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of Level I and II are the median of the observed values range. After validation of the target value, a confidence range (high and low values) is then calculated.

It is recommended to recalibrate after setting-up of a new vial of ISE Reference Solution or of ISE Diluent then every 4 hours when quality control results fall outside the established range, after replacing electrode, and after ISE cleaning and maintenance

# d. Detection limit:

Detection limit is based on linearity study performed above. In addition, method comparison study also supports the low end measuring claims of $1 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m E q / L }$ .

The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of the device is $1 0 . 8 - 4 3 . 0 \ \mathrm { m E q / L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

An endogenous interfering substances study was performed according to the CLSI EP7-A guideline. Serum samples containing the analyte at two levels (low and high) of the test were spiked with the potentially interfering substance unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin,, turbidity, ascorbic acid, hemoglobin and acetylsalicylate to several concentrations. Samples were then run in triplicate using the ProM analyzer. The recovery of the test at each concentration of interferents was calculated by comparing the mean result of testing with no interferents to the mean result at each level tested. The sponsor defines non-significant interference as bias $< 1 0 \%$ between the spiked and unspiked samples. The highest level tested with no significant interference is listed in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed between the predicate device (ROCHE CO2-L reagent) on a cobas c111 analyzer and the candidate device (Elitech Clinical Systems $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 ) }$ on a Selectra ProM according to the CLSI guideline EP9-A2. This study was performed using 99 serum patient samples ( including 5 spiked and 3 diluted samples) and over a span of 5 days.

Regression analysis of the results yielded the following:

$$
\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 0 8 \mathrm { x } + 2 . 2 \mathrm { m E q / L }
$$

$\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 8 5$   
$\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 7 0$   
Standard error of the estimate $\mathrm { S y . x } = 1 . 3 \ \mathrm { m E q / L }$ . Sample range tested from 11.1 to $4 2 . 9 \mathrm { m E q / L }$

b. Matrix comparison: 40 paired serum and plasma (lithium heparin) samples, ranging from 11.7 to $3 9 . 7 ~ \mathrm { m E q / L }$ ( including 2 spiked and 2 diluted ), were tested on Selectra ProM according to the CLSI guideline EP9-A2.

Regression analysis of the results yielded the following:

$\mathrm { y = 0 . 9 7 3 ~ x - 0 . 1 ~ m E q / L }$   
$\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 5$   
$\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 1$   
Standard error of the estimate $\mathrm { S y . x } = 0 . 9 \mathrm { m E q / L }$ .

The sponsor claimed that lithium heparin is an acceptable anticoagulant to be used with the CO2 assay.
