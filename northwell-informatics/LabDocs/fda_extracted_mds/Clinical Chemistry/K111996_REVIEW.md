Stability:

Unlabeled vials are purchased from a contract manufacturer and ELITech labels and kits the vial using their labeling. Real-time and accelerated stability studies for open and closed-vials were performed and all lots met the acceptance criteria. The shelf life is 36 months prior to reconstitution when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 7 days after reconstitution when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 28 days when stored between $\mathbf { - } 2 0$ to $- 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ when frozen once.

# Value Assignment

The target values and ranges were determined and defined by ELITech on ELITech Clinical Systems Selectra analyzers equipped with ISE module using ELITech Clinical Systems ISE Na, K, Cl and Total CO2 reagents and ISE calibrators. Calibration was performed with ELITech Clinical System ISE Calibrators which is traceable to reference material. The assignment protocol was performed on two different analyzers with 48 measurements in total (2 analyzers, 2 lots, 3 vials and 4 measurements per vial). The results for ISE Control I are as follows:
