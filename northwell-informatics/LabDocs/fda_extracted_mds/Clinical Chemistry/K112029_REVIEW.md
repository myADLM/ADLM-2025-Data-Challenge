# Value Assignment:

EliTech performs verification on the provided calibrator values using Elitech’s test systems on each calibrator lot. If the value provided by the manufacturer verifies, then it is used on the value sheet provided to the end user. When each new lot is received, the new lot is used to calibrate the system using the provided value. Then already-validated lots of control and an earlier lot of ELICAL are run as unknowns in quadruplicate on 2 Selectra analyzers, using 2 reagent lots, and 3 test vials per lot. If the result (mean of 48 tests) obtained is within the specification, $+ / - 9 \%$ of the previously assigned bottle values, then the supplier’s value is accepted.

Value assignment for the ELITROL I and ELITRIOL II control solutions was performed by quadruplicate runs on 2 Selectra analyzers, using 2 reagent lots, and 3 test vials per lot. The mean analyte value is calculated and a target value is assigned. The labeling states that obtained control solution values should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific value sheets and that laboratories should establish appropriate quality control procedures when using this product for its intended use. The labeling also states that laboratories should recalibrate when reagents lots change, when quality control results fall out of range, and after a maintenance operation.

# Stability:

Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k033501) with no change to the content and the packaging except the labeling change. The sponsor claimed the following stability determined by the provider: ELICAL 2 is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to reconstitution. After reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 2 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $- 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under $\mathbf { k } 0 4 1 2 2 7 ,$ ) with no change to the content and the packaging except the labeling change. The sponsor claimed the following stability determined by the provider: Before reconstitution, the shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol I and Elitrol II is 30 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when stored at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 5 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $- 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
