Identification / Product Name: Fastep™M hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Test

# 510(k) SUMMARY (Cont.)

# Description:

The Fastep™™ hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Test are distributed in Cassette format. Each test reagent strip contains mouse monoclonal anti-α-hCG antibody coated membrane and a dried chemical pad containing mouse monoclonal anti- $\cdot \beta$ -hCG anybody colloidal gold conjugate. The control antibodies are goat anti-mouse IgG.

# Intended Use:

The Polymed Therapeutics' Fastep™ hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Test is rapid chromatographic immunoassays for the visual, qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in serum or urine specimen to aid in the early detection of pregnancy. For Professional Use Only.

The test kits are for health care professionals use including professionals at physician's office labs (POLs) or point-of-care site (POC).

# Predicate Kit:

Teco Diagnostics One-Step Urine/Serum Combo Pregnancy Card Test is used as predicate device for Polymed Therapeutics' Fastep™ hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Test to compare their performance of required studies. The clinical serum specimens used for acuracy study were quantitatively confirmed by Abbott Architect i2000 instrument.

510(k) numbers for predicate devices are: Abbott Architect i2000 instrument k093318 Teco Diagnostics One-Step Urine/Serum Combo Pregnancy Test k964461

# Performance:

The product performance characteristics of Polymed Therapeutics' Fastep™ hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Test was evaluated in the blind-labeled spiked control studies and blind-labeled clinical specimen correlation study (including POLs site study). The results of these studies demonstrate Polymed Therapeutics' Fastep™ hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Test to be substantially equivalent to the performance characteristics of Teco's One Step Pregnancy Urine/Serum Test. Correlation studies, using 145 clinical specimen sets, produced a minimum of $9 8 . 3 \%$ accuracy.

# Conclusion:

Of these specimen sets tested in serum and urine device, results of Accuracy, POL site study demonstrate the substantial equivalency between Polymed Therapeutics' Fastep hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Test and the Teco One- Step Pregnancy Urine/Serum Test panel. It is also demonstrated that Polymed Therapeutics' Fastep™M hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Test is safe and effective in detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in serum or urine sample to aid in the early determination of pregnancy.
