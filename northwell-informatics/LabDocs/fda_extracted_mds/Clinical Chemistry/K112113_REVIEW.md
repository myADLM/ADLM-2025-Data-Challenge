# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The five levels of the CalCheck 5 kit are assigned based on the measuring range of the assay. Each level was standardized using the Elecsys Myoglobin STAT assay, which was standardized against an in-house reference preparation as follow: 1) There is no international standard for myoglobin. A stock solution of Myoglobin antigen is prepared by weighing in myoglobin antigen purchased from a commercial vendor and then dissolving it in Human sera (buffered to $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 0 $ ). 2) The different master calibrators are prepared by weighing in the necessary amount of stock solution and diluting it accordingly with the buffered human serum. 3) Finally, bottles are filled with the master calibrators and lyophilized.

Once the produced CalChecks are determined to meet the specifications, the Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5 is released for the value assignment utilizing the Elecsys 2010 master calibration curve to calculate $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ from corresponding magnitudes of chemiluminescent emission detected by a photomultiplier.

# Value Assignment:

For each Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are assayed in duplicate on at least three Elecsys 2010 analyzers. The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers) of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range is defined as $\pm 2 7 \%$ of the assigned value for levels 2 $( 7 \% \mathrm { C V } )$ and $\pm 3 0 \%$ of the assigned value for level 3- $5 ( 1 0 \% \mathrm { C V } )$ .

Reagent-specific value assignments were performed for each lot of Elecsys Myoglobain CalCheck 5 in combination with each Elecsys Myoglobin 18-minute assay and Elecsys Myoglobin STAT (9-minute assay, k083260) reagent lot using 8 Elecsys 2010 analyzers once a day in a total of 8 runs. To ensure the values assigned using the master platform are transferrable and valid for the other instrument platforms, the same value assignment procedure is performed separately using cobas e 411, cobas e 601 / Cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers. For MODULAR ANALYTICS

E170, only 18-minute reagent was performed because no STAT (9-minute) functionality is available on this analyzer. The assigned values obtained on the additional analyzers are compared to those obtained on the Elecsys 2010.

Acceptance criteria for all stages of the process were met. It is stated in the package inserts that each laboratory should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

# Stability:

Opened-vial and accelerated Shelf-life stability studies were performed to verify the stability claims for the Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5 on the cobas e 411. Since these studies are not analyzer-dependent, these results can be applied to the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, Elecsys 2010, cobas e 601, and cobas e 602.

1) Open-Vial Stability: Real-time testing was performed for the Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5. The data support the package insert claims that reconstituted Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20- $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

2) Shelf-life stability: The accelerated stability testing performed supports an initial shelf-life claim of 15 months when the Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5 are stored under normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real-time testing at 2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going to support a claim of 24 months.
