Device to Which Substantial Equivalence is Claimed:

Audit® MicroCV™ Immunoassay Linearity Set Aalto Scientific, Ltd., Carlsbad, CA K062668

# E. Description of the Device

The Audit® MicroCV™ T-Uptake Calibration/Verification is a human and bovine albumin based, liquid set of QC material. Each level of the set contains T-Uptake analyte. It is used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of T-Uptake. Level A is near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit of PModular analyzer. Levels B, C, and D are prepared in a manner such that an equal distance exists between each consecutive level.

# F. Statement of Intended Use

Audit® MicroCV™ T-Uptake Calibration/Verification Set consists of five levels of human and bovine albumin based serum containing T-Uptake. The Audit® MicroCV™M T-Uptake Calibration/Verification Set is a quality control material intended for use in the quantitative verification of calibration and reportable range of the Roche T-uptake Assay when performed on the P-Modular Analyzer When used for quality control purposes, it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use the values provided

Dear Ms. Lyakov:

We have reviewed your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Tite 1, Code f Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 5. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements; including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket.notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
