# Device description / test principle

The AQT90 FLEX is a cartridge-based immunoassay, based on time-resolved fluorescence using a europium (Eu) chelate as the fluorescent label. The test receptacles for the assay are $3 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ test cups, which contain the antibodies used for capture of the analyte, and the Eu chelate labeled antibodies used to trace the captured analyte. The sample is added to the test cup together with assay buffer. The cup is then incubated to allow formation of the immuno-complex, and subsequently washed to remove unbound antibodies and sample material. Finally, the cup is exposed to excitation light, and after a delay the emitted light generated by the fluorescent label Page 2 of 9 is measured by single photon counting; this measurement cycle is repeated up to 3,300 times. The total count is then compared to an assay calibration curve to obtain a quantitative measurement of the analyte's concentration in the sample.

This technology uses dried reagents deposited in the test cups and in the calibration adjustment cups - no liquids other than the sample itself together with the assay buffer are required. Total assay time is less than 20 minutes. In summary, the procedure is as follows:

1Metering of an exact amount of sample and assay buffer and dispensing into a test cup   
2. Incubating for 7-15 minutes at $3 7 ~ 0 \mathrm { C }$   
3. Washing of the test cup to remove unbound tracer antibodies and sample material   
4. Drying the test cup   
5. Measuring

# 4. Device intended use

AQT90 FLEX is for in vitro diagnostic use. The AQT90 FLEX analyzer is an immunoassay instrument based on the quantitative determination of time-resolved fluorescence to estimate the concentrations of clinically relevant markers on whole-blood and plasma specimens to which a relevant anticoagulant has been added. It is intended for use in point-of-care and laboratory settings.

AQT90 FLEX Myo Test Kit includes 10 AQT90 FLEX Myo Test cartridges and one AQT90 FLEX Myo CAL cartridge. AQT90 FLEX Myo Test is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of myoglobin in EDTA or lithium-heparin whole blood or plasma specimens on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer in point of care and laboratory settings. It is indicated for use as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of heart disease, e.g. acute myocardial infarction.

AQT90 FLEX Myo CAL cartridge is for in vitro diagnostic use. For calibration adjustment of the Myo Test, as indicated on the cartridge, on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer.

AQT90 FLEX LQC Multi-CHECK, Levels 1, 2 and 3, is for in vitro diagnostic use. For use with the AQT90 FLEX analyzer as a liquid quality control serum (LQC) to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analytes listed on the specification insert.

# 5. Medical device to which substantial equivalence is claimed

The AQT90 FLEX Myo Test Kit and Myo CAL cartridges are substantially equivalent in features and characteristics to the ARCHITECT STAT Myoglobin test and ARCHITECT STAT Myoglobin Calibrators, 510(k) number K042924.

The AQT90 LQC FLEX Multi-CHECK, Levels 1, 2 and 3, is substantially equivalent in features and characteristics to the Liquicheck Cardiac Markers Plus Control LT, 510(k) number K050537.

# Summary of clinical performance data

The AQT90 FLEX Myo assay (y) was compared to the predicate device, the ARCHITECT STAT Myoglobin $( \times )$ using Li-heparin whole blood samples in the range $2 4 { \cdot } 8 5 6 ~ { \mu \mathfrak { g } } / \updownarrow$ (ng/mL) and plasma samples in the range of $2 2 { - } 8 8 2 \ \mathsf { n g / m L } \left( \mathsf { \mu g / L } \right)$ with the AQT90 FLEX Myo assay. The relationship between the two methods was determined by Passing-Bablok regression. The regression lines and correlation coefficients were found to be y = 1.07 x ARCHITECT + 15, r2 = 0.99 with whole blood, and $\forall \ : = \ : 1 . 0 2 \ : \times$ ARCHITECT $^ { + 1 3 }$ , $\mathsf { r } ^ { 2 } = \mathsf { 0 } . 9 9$ with plasma.

Dear Ms. Hellmann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796-5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (301) 796-5760.
