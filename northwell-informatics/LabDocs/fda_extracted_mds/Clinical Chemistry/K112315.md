# Common Name:

Urine Pregnancy Test

# Predicate Device:

ACONTM hCG One Step Pregnancy Test Strip (Urine) (K993203)

Product Code:

JHI

Device Classification / Name:

21 CFR§862.1155 / Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) Test System, Class II

Intended Use:

The y.b.t. Pregnancy Test is an immuno chromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of HCG in human urine. The test is intended for use as an aid in the early detection of pregnancy.

Physiologic Basis of the Test:

Human Chorionic Gonadotropin is a hormone produced by the placenta shortly after implantation. Since hCG is present in the urine of pregnant women, it is an excellent marker for confirming pregnancy.

# Device Description:

The test is available in two formats: strip and cassette.Both of them are intended for prescription use. Both of them have the same memebrane format, reagents and flow characteristics. Devices are packaged one device per pouch with 1 devices per kit.

# Summary of Performance Data:

# SESITIVITY

The test will detect hCG in urine at concentration of 25 mlU/ml and higher. This sensitivity level has been confirmed with hCG standards (25, 50, 250, 2500, and $5 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m } | \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m l } )$ in urine calibrated against the WHO Third I.S. Occasionally, specimens containing less than 25 mlU/ml hCG can give positive results.

# SPECIFICITY

# Menopausal urine samples

A study was performed using urine specimens from 20 postmenopausal women. Urine of postmenopausal women can interfere with pregnancy testing due to elevated concentrations of gonadotropic hormone structurally similar to hCG. All 20 samples tested negative with the y.b.t. hCG Card.

# Potentially interfering substances

The following substances did not interfere with hCG testing using y.b.t. hCG Card when added to urine samples containing 0 mlU/ml and 25 mlU/ml hCG:

# Cross reactive glycoprotein hormones

The following hormones structurally related to hCG did not interfere with hCG testing using the y.b.t. hCG Card when added to urine specimens at the concentrations indicated below:

Luteinizing hormone 100-1000 mlU/ml, Follicle stimulating hormone 100-1,000 mlU/ml Tyroid stimulating hormone 100-1,000 mlU/ml

# Method Comparison

60 positive and 60 negative patient urine specimens confirmed with routine diagnostic method were tested against y.b.t pregnancy test strip at two certified hospital. The results showed $100 \%$ consistence.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive Urine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative Urine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y.b.t(+)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y.b.1 (-)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>120</td></tr></table>

Positive agreement: $( 6 0 + 0 ) / 6 0 = 1 0 0 \%$ . Negative agreement:: $( 0 + 6 0 ) / 6 0 = 1 0 0 \%$ Specificity: $( 6 0 + 6 0 ) / ( 6 0 + 6 0 ) = 1 0 0 \%$

# PRECISION

# Intra-assay

In the study, eleven replicate assays were performed with each of three specimens containing 0, 25, and 250 mlU/ml hCG. Correct negative and positive results were registered in $100 \%$ of the assays.

# Inter-assay

The study involved the same three specimens containing 0, 25, and 250 mlU/ml hCG. The samples were analyzed in eleven independent assays with y.b.t. hCG Card originating from three different lots at different times during two months. Again, expected negative and positive results were registered in $100 \%$ of the assays.

# STORAGE AND STABILITY

Store Y.b.t. Preganacy Test Strip at temperature ranges $2 - 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ in the sealed pouch. Refer to the expiration date for stability. Do not freeze. Use the strip immediately once the sealed pouch is opened.

# Conclusion:

The result of these studies demonstrate that y.b.t pregnancy test is substantially equivalent with the predicate Acon Pregnancy Test

Dear Dr. Patel:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). . This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
