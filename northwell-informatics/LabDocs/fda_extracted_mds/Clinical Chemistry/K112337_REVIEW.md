K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable. c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability and Value Assignment

Control solutions are derived from gravimetrically prepared stock solutions and analyzed in-house. Each lot of Liquid Immunoassay Premium is submitted to a number of reference laboratories using multiple instruments and values are assigned from a consensus of the results obtained by these laboratories. With each lot a control range is provided for each analyte and instrument. The control range is equivalent to the mean $\pm 2$ SD. Assigned control ranges are listed in the labeling by instrument and analyte.

# Stability

Real time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.

The stability claim for the controls is 12 months at $^ { - 2 0 }$ to $\mathrm { - 7 0 ~ } ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ for unopened vials. Thawed unopened vials stability claim is 30 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Thaw stability claim for opened vials is 7 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable. $b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable.
