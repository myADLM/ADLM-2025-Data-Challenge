# I. Substantial Equivalence

I, resewed

Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution for NIPRO TRUEresult substantially equivalent in function, safety and efficacy to currently marketed devices for the same intended use as shown in the following tables:

<table><tr><td>Characteristic Name: 510(k), Date: Number of levels:</td><td>Predicate Device TRUEtest Control Solution (for use with TRUEresult BGM) K080641, Aug 19, 2008 2, representing hypoglycemic, and typical fasting glucose levels</td><td>Modified Device Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution for NIPRO TRUEresult 2, representing hypoglycemic, and typical fasting glucose levels glucose 6 mL LDPE vial with dispensing tip</td></tr></table>

# II. Description of the new device

Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution for NIPRO TRUEresult is a buffered aqueous solution with glucose containing no ingredients of biological origin, or in concentrations qualifying as a controlled product under the Controlled Products Regulation. The Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution is formulated for optimal performance on NIPRO TRUEresult glucose meters. The product is provided in 2 levels, 1 representing hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) and 2, representing typical fasting blood glucose levels in non-diabetic persons.

# )  Intended use of the device

Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution for NIPRO TRUEresult is intended for use to verify the performance and correct operation of the NIPRO TRUEresult Glucose Test Systems. Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution for NIPRO TRUEresult is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home.

() ( Technological characteristics of the device.

This material consists of viscosity-adjusted, aqueous glucose control solution prepared with a concentration of D-glucose to provide recovery on the test systems in the ranges typically considered hypoglycemic, and normal, fasting glucose for a non-diabetic person. This solution has been optimized to simulate the response of whole blood on the blood glucose test systems manufactured by NiPRO. The solution contains no hazardous, human or animal derived components.

Sumary  non-clinical tsts submit with the rmarket notiicatin or he . Tests were conducted to verify specific performance requirements:

a) Closed bottle stability (Shelf-life) b) Stability after opening (Use-life) c) Transport Stability   
d) Test response

Dear Mr. Byrd:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class ⅡI (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
