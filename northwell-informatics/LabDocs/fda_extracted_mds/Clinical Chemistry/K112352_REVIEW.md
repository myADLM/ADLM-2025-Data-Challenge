L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

New lots of material are verified to ensure the trueness of measurement are equivalent to prior lot of the same material $( \pm 3 \% )$ using YSI 2300 or equivalent calibrated with solutions provided by YSI traceable to NIST SRM 917.

# Value Assignment:

The analytical values for each production lot of material are confirmed by comparison of new production lots of material to the Reference Lot of product with the same formulation in parallel measurement on the YSI 2300 reference method in order to maintain lot‐to‐lot variability within close tolerances.

Value assignment for each production lot of control solution was conducted with both types (NIPRO or Liberty) of current version blood glucose meters, test strips and quality control solutions purchased through retail outlets. Briefly, three lots of test strips for each meter/strip type combination are evaluated following the following sequence:

(1) Five measurements of control solution distributed with each meter (NIPRO or Liberty branded) on each of two meters to qualify the meters and test strip lots or use. All measurement values must fall within value assignment provided by the manufacturer for the control solution printed on the test strip vials (total 30 measurements).   
(2) Ten measurements of the Glucose Meter‐Check Solution on each of two meters, on each of the three lots of test strips (total 60 measurements).   
(3) Value assignment for Glucose Meter‐Check Control Solution for NIPRO TRUEresult is determined as the mean of all measurements on all meters and test strips $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (Level 1) and $\pm 1 7 \%$ of the mean value (Level 2), providing a single acceptable value range for all test strips.

Acceptance criteria: Resulting value assignment is deemed acceptable if $> 9 5 \%$ of all individual measurements values fall within the range of acceptable values determined by this method.

For each released lot, $> 9 5 \%$ $( 1 0 0 \% )$ of all measurements of Meter‐Check control Level 1 and Level 2 were found to be within these limits and therefore, the acceptance criteria are met. The results of a representative value assignment protocol are presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td>Control Level</td><td>Meter Brand</td><td>Test Strip Brand</td><td>Control Brand (Level)</td><td>Pooled Mean</td><td>Pooled SD</td><td>Pooled CV%</td><td>Within Limits</td></tr><tr><td>Low (1)</td><td>NIPRO TRUEresult</td><td>TRUEtest</td><td>TRUEtest (1) MeterCheck (1)</td><td>47.0 47.7</td><td>0.7 0.7</td><td>1.6% 1.5%</td><td>100.0% 100.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Mid (2)</td><td>Liberty Blood Glucose</td><td>Liberty</td><td>Liberty (1)</td><td>47.6</td><td>1.0</td><td>2.1%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Monitor</td><td></td><td>MeterCheck (1)</td><td>47.5</td><td>1.0</td><td>2.1%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>NIPRO TRUEresult</td><td>TRUEtest</td><td>TRUEtest (2)</td><td>116.7</td><td>2.7</td><td>2.3%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>MeterCheck (2)</td><td>118.0</td><td>2.6</td><td>2.2%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Monitor</td><td>Liberty Blood Glucose</td><td>Liberty</td><td>Liberty (2) MeterCheck (2)</td><td>114.2 116.3</td><td>1.8 4.3</td><td>1.6% 3.7%</td><td>98.0% 100.0%</td></tr></table>

The acceptable range is printed on the control solution vial label. The package insert clearly instructs users to always compare their result to the range printed on the control solution vial, not on the test strip vial label.

# Stability:

Product stability has been established based on real time studies.

(1) Open-Vial Stability: Acceptable performance $4 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage after opening at the end of 90‐days) is determined as less than $10 \%$ change in glucose concentration in product stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ as measured by YSI 2300 against reference material of the same product stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Product is opened and 5‐7 drops dispensed weekly during this period to simulate heavy use.

(2) Closed-Vial Stability: Acceptable performance $4 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage at the end of twenty‐four months) is determined as less than $10 \%$ change in glucose concentration in product stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ as measured by YSI 2300 against reference material stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

(3) Transport Stability: Acceptable performance (product should withstand $\leq - 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for at least 5 days followed by at least 5 days at $+ 4 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ following the freeze/thaw cycle) is determined as less than $10 \%$ change in glucose concentration in product stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ after freeze/thaw as measured by YSI 2300 against reference material stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The following warning is displayed in the warning and precaution section of the labeling to mitigate the risk of misuse and misinterpretation of the control solutions:

IMPORTANT: The result of a control test with this solution is NOT automatically marked as a control solution test.

PLEASE NOTE: When using this control material on the NIPRO TRUEresult Blood Glucose Meter, the control results can not be differentiated from the patient’s results and therefore will be incorporated into the calculation of the patient’s average glucose concentration.

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
