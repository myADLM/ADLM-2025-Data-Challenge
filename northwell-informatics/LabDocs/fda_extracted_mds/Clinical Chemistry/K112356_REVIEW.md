L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and Value Assignment

The Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution is traceable to high precision gravimetry with reagent grade raw materials and calibrated instrumentation. The analytical values for subsequent production lots of material are confirmed by comparison of new production lots of material to the Reference Lots in parallel measurement on the YSI 2300.

Value assignment for test strips is determined for each lot of control solution using three lots of each type of test strips and two meters of each type (of the four claimed AgaMatrix BGMS in the labeling). Ten measurements were performed for each meter/test strip lot of each type of the AgaMatrix BGMS. The assigned values represent a range of $- 2 0 \%$ to $+ 2 0 \%$ of the mean value of all measurement on all meters and test strips determined by this testing, and are represented on each vial of control solution. The assigned range value is acceptable if $> 9 5 \%$ of all individual measurements is within the range.

# Stability:

Close bottle stability of 24 months when stored at 2 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ is claimed in the labeling. The real time stability study protocol was followed to test control solutions from close bottles every three months over a period of 24 to 27 months. The change in glucose concentration in product stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ as measured by YSI 2300 was compared against reference material stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The pre-set acceptance criteria were met.

Open bottle stability of 3 months when stored at 2 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ is claimed in the labeling. The real time stability study protocol was followed to test control solutions from open bottles every other week over a period of 13 weeks. The change in glucose concentration in product stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ as measured by YSI 2300 was compared against unopened reference material stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \mathrm { \circ } } \mathrm { C }$ .

The pre-set acceptance criteria were met.

The product stability during transport was tested for 5 days at $- 1 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F }$ $\left( - 2 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C } \right)$ , and $1 1 3 ~ \mathrm { { ^ { o } F } }$ $( 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The change in glucose concentration in product stored at - 1ºF $\left( - 2 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C } \right)$ and $1 1 3 ~ \mathrm { { ‰} }$ $( 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ as measured by YSI 2300 was compared against reference material stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \mathrm { \circ } } \mathrm { C }$ . The pre-set acceptance criteria were met. Glucose Meter-Check Control solution for AgaMatrix meets transport stability requirements and can be shipped without special consideration.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

An expected range for the Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution is printed on the vial label of the control solution. The sponsor provides the following in the package insert: “The acceptable range printed on the control solution vial are different from the ranges printed on the test strip vial. When using this Glucose Meter-Check Control Solution, you should always compare your result to the range printed on the control solution vial. (DO NOT compare your results to the acceptable range for any other test strip type.)”

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
