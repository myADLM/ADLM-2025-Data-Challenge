The AU5800 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer is substantial equivalence to the AU2700 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (Docket Number K002982), currently in commercial distribution.

# 5.0 Device Description

The AU5800 clinical chemistry analyzer is a fully automated, random access analyzer, designed for ultra-high throughput laboratories. This system is designed to suit varying workloads and is available in different configurations, from a one-single photometric module AU5810, up to a four-photometric module AU5840. The AU5800 analyzer measures analytes in samples using the same reagents, calibrators, quality control (QC) materials and other consumables used within the AU series of instruments. This ensures the same reliable results and references ranges across the AU family members. This system carries out automated analysis of serum, plasma, urine samples and other body fluids and automatically generates results. Electrolyte measurement is performed using a single or double cell lon Selective Electrode (ISE) which is also common among the other members of the AU family.

# 6.0 Intended Use

The Beckman Coulter AU5800 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer is an automated chemistry analyzer that measures analytes in samples, in combination with appropriate reagents, calibrators, quality control (QC) material and other accessories. This system is for in vitro

diagnostic use only. Applications include colorimetric, turbidimetric, latex agglutination, homogeneous enzyme immunoassay, and ion selective electrode.

# 7.0 Comparison to the Predicate

The AU5800 Clinical Chemistry System is a family member of the AU series of analyzers, including the AU2700 (K002982) to which the substantial equivalence comparison is claimed. The devices have same / similar design and modes of operation. The key features are summarized in the following table.

# Comparison testing

In order to further demonstrate the comparability of the Beckman AU2700 and the proposed new Beckman Coulter AU5800, the following reagent performance testing was performed on a representative number of assays:

Linearity   
Precision   
Method Comparison   
Sensitivity   
Interference   
Reference Range

The AU5800 chemistry analyzer uses same lon Selective Electrode (ISE) and reagents, as well as the same menu of reagents currently available on the AU2700. Representative assays from the AU chemistry menu were selected to demonstrate equivalency between the proposed AU5800 and the predicate device. The studies were selected from reviewing the applicable sections of FDA's eSubmitter software tool for instrument only submissions and utilizing the FDA's Guidance for Industry and FDA staff Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy.

The remaining reagent application validations not presented within the 510(k) will be validated using risk management, design controls, and the principles from FDA's Guidance for Industry and FDA staff Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy. The core validation principles are linearity, control/standard recovery, method comparison, precision, sensitivity, interference, prozone tolerance and onboard/calibration frequency studies. Reference ranges will be verified, where appropriate. No reagent application will be released to the market without the satisfactory completion of the validation process.

# 8.0 Summary of Performance Data

The submission provides the data necessary to demonstrate this equivalence based on the performance validations and comparisons conducted between the representative reagents and analyzer platforms. Based on this data, the new AU5800 Chemistry Analyzer is substantially equivalent to the referenced predicate(s).

Traceability

The traceability information in the reagent 510ks was updated via K043460 on the calibrator to align with the current IFU claims.
