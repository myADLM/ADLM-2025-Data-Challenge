# Identification of the Predicate Device: i-STAT Lactate Test part of the $\mathrm { C G 4 + }$ Cartridge (K982071)

11,

# Indication for Use Statement

The i-STAT Lactate Test is indicated for (1) the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis in conjunction with measurements of blood acid/base status, (2) monitoring tissue hypoxia and strenuous physical exertion, (3) diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.

The i-STAT Lactate Test, as part of the i-STAT System, is intended for the in vitro measurement of lactate in arterial, venous, or capillary whole blood.

# Current and proposed labeling for i-STAT Lactate Test

This 510(k) submission supports an additional statement to the "Clinical Significance" section of the labeling.

# Current "Clinical Significance" section of the labeling

Elevated levels of lactate are mainly found in conditions of hypoxia such as shock, hypovolemia, and left ventricular failure; in conditions associated with diseases such as diabetes mellitus, neoplasia, and liver disease; and in conditions associated with drugs or toxins such as ethanol, methanol, or salicylates.

# Proposed "Clinical Significance" section of the labeling

Elevated levels of lactate are mainly found in conditions of hypoxia such as shock, hypovolemia, and left ventricular failure; in conditions associated with diseases such as diabetes mellitus, neoplasia, and liver disease; and in conditions associated with drugs or toxins such as ethanol, methanol, or salicylates.

Hyperlactatemia is an indicator commonly used to detect tissue hypoperfusion, pulare au sn surgl.

# Justification of the Labeling Change

The clinical value of an elevated blood lactate level in patients with sepsis as well as patients with hypoperfusion as the result of trauma or following cardiac surgery has been well established. A comprehensive review of the literature supporting the change to the "Clinical Significance" section has been provided.

Dear Ms. Hartley:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
