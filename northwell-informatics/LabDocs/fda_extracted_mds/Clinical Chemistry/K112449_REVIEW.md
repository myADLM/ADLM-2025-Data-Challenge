# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test is a sandwich immunoassay employing monoclonal (mouse) antibodies specific for hCG and uses chromatographic principles to separate bound from free color label. The appearance of two lines in the test window indicates detection of hCG while the appearance of one line in the test window indicates no detection of hCG. If no line is in the test window the test is invalid. The test is standardized against the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard for Chronic gonadotropin 75/589.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

The identity and concentrations of samples used in all studies were masked to the operator.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

An inter lot precision evaluation for midstream and dip cup was performed on three lots by three operators over multiple days, with 15 replicates for each standard tested (0, 6.25, 25, 50 and $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m l \ h C G }$ ). Standards used for spiking contain purified hCG traceable to the WHO International $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Standard. Samples with concentrations of $6 . 2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and below were negative for $100 \%$ of measurements. Samples with concentrations of $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and above were positive for $100 \%$ of measurements. See also the detection limit study in Section d below, which included testing additional near-cutoff concentration samples using multiple test lots.

Another study was conducted to evaluate lay user reproducibility using spiked samples. In this study samples were assayed by both lay users and professionals. Negative urine samples were spiked with commercially available purified hCG, traceable to the WHO International $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Standard. Three assay lots were tested in this study and no difference in results was observed between lots. Concentrations of 12 mIU/mL hCG and greater were consistently read as positive ( $100 \%$ agreement), and negative samples were consistently read as negative. A total of 50 lay users participated in the study, each testing one spiked sample (as well as their own urine sample).

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This is a qualitative device.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test is traceable to the manufacturer’s quantitative method, which is calibrated with the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard for Chronic Gonadotropin 75/589.

# Stability

Real-time and accelerated stability testing showed that the QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test device is stable and detection limit was unchanged for 24 months when stored at $3 6 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ . Protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

To determine the detection limit, studies were performed by multiple operators using both the midstream and dip-cup methods. Negative human urine samples were spiked with commercially available purified hCG. Concentrations (shown in the table below) are traceable to the WHO International 4th Standard. Results are expressed as the number of positive samples to the total number of samples analyzed. See below:

# e. Analytical specificity:

An interference study was performed with the QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test device using two urine sample pools - one negative for hCG, and one containing $1 2 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ of hCG standard. Each potential interfering substance was added to both samples and replicates of each sample were tested using multiple lots. The highest interferent concentrations tested, are tabulated below.

Cross-reactivity with hyperglycosylated hCG was also evaluated. Samples containing $\mathrm { 8 - 1 0 ~ m I U / m L }$ hyperglycosylated hCG yielded positive results.

f. Assay cut-off:

The detection limit for a positive test using the QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test (Midstream and Dip cup Format) is shown above in the detection limit section, 1.b.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Comparison studies between the QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test and a predicate device were conducted by healthcare professionals, using samples collected at 3 hospital sites, on 3 lots of each device format. Results are tabulated below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Predicatenegative results</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PredicatePositive results</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>New devicepositive results</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>65</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>New devicenegative results</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>176</td></tr></table>

In addition to the testing by professionals, 109 lay users tested their own urine samples using the midstream method, following only the proposed package insert instructions. There was $100 \%$ agreement between the QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test results by lay users and professional results. The results were also in agreement with predicate device results. Questionnaire results were included in the $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ to demonstrate that lay users (of various educational backgrounds) felt the test was easy to perform.

b. Matrix comparison:

Not applicable.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Detection of hCG in early Pregnancy Clinical Samples:

A total of 1020 urine samples were collected from 102 individual women. Selection criteria for subjects in this study were women between the ages of 18-39 attempting to become pregnant. Women were to keep a documented record of three menstrual cycles prior to the collection of samples. Samples were collected from women whose menstrual cycle lengths were within 25-31 days and whose start days were within $+ / .$ - 3 days from the median day over three months. Samples were collected from each study subject starting 10 days before and ending 2 days after the expected menstrual period. The day of the expected period was estimated based on the average number of menstrual cycle days reported for the previous 3 cycles. Women with negative results were followed up to confirm that they were not pregnant in that cycle. Samples were masked and randomized prior to testing. Testing was performed on 3 device lots. No differences were observed between lots. Results are summarized in the table below.

# $b$ . Clinical specificity:

To demonstrate the incidence of false positive results in older women who may have higher levels of pituitary hCG, samples were collected from 104 pre- menopausal women (estimated as age 17-39), 103 peri-menopausal women (estimated as age 41- 55) and 107 menopausal women (age ${ > } 5 5$ ) in whom pregnancy was not suspected. No pre-selection or pre-screening of hCG levels was performed prior to testing with this device. No positive results were observed in this study. The product labeling includes a statement that “If you are not sure of the result, you may want to re-test your urine in the week after your missed period. If you are still unsure, you should consult your doctor”.
