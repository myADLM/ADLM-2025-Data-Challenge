# Device Name

Proprietary name: Elecsys T4 CalCheck 5   
Common name: T4 CalCheck 5   
Classification name: Single (specified) analyte controls (assayed and   
unassayed)

# Predicate device

The Elecsys T4 CalCheck 5 is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. We claim equivalency to the currently marketed Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 (K111552).

Device Description

The Elecsys T4 CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of T4 in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Intended use

The Elecsys T4 CalCheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration verification and for use in the verification of the assay range established by the Elecsys T4 reagent on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers, for in vitro diagnostic use only.

The table below compares Elecsys T4 CalCheck 5 with the predicate device, Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 (K111552). The predicate shows that T4 CalCheck 5 is substantially equivalent to T3 CalCheck 5, with several key similarities. The shaded fields indicate similar characteristics between the candidate device and the predicate device.

Dear Dr. Leuther:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
