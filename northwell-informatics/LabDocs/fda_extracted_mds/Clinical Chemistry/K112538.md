The cholesterol liberated by the esterase, plus any endogenous free cholesterol, are both oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to yield hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide then acts to oxidatively couple p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-amin- oantipyrine in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, producing a red colored quinoneimine complex which absorbs strongly at 505 nm. The amount of chromogen formed, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance, bichromatically at 505 nm/647 nm, is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration in the sample.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">The HDL-C Assay utilizes two reagents, the second containing a In the ACE LDL-C Reagent assay, detergent 1 solubilizes non-LDL</td><td>unique detergent. This detergent solubilizes only the HDL lipoprotein particles, thus releasing HDL cholesterol to react with the cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase, in the presence of a chromogen to produce color. The detergent also inhibits the reaction of the cholesterol enzymes with LDL, VLDL and chylomicron lipoproteins by adsorbing to their surfaces. The amount of chromogen formed, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at 592/692 nm, is directly proportional to the HDL cholesterol concentration in the sample.</td></tr><tr><td>lipoprotein particles (HDL, VLDL and chylomicrons) and releases cholesterol: The cholesterol is consumed by cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase in a non-color forming reaction. In a second reaction, detergent 2 solublizes the remaining LDL particles and forms peroxide, via the enzymes cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase. The peroxide, in the presence of peroxidase and two peroxidase sub- strates, 4-aminoantipyrine and DSBmT, results in a purple-red color. The amount of color formed, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at 544/692 nm, is directly proportional to the LDL cholesterol concentration in the sample.

In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glycerol kinase, the glycerol is converted to glycerol-1-phosphate and the ATP to adenosine diphosphate.
