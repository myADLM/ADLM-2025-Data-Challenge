Monitoroperation is self-prompting using three user interface buttons. In addition tomeasuring glucose, the monitor also stores patient test and quality control testdata.The self-prompting menu system is navigated by means of a three-button keypad.It offers audible feedback for user inputs, and audible and/or visual feedback forprompts and user alerts.</td></tr><tr><td>loss.</td><td>A "battery low" warning will alert the user to change the batteries. Battery charge state information Is available on the "monltor status screen". The user can select the auto shutoff option to conserve power when the monitor is not in use. Test data and monitor setup information will be stored in a non-volatile format to prevent data Nova Max One Blood Glucose Test Strips The test strips contain a reaction layer that contains a glucose-enzyme (greater than 1.0 lU) and ferricyanide as a mediator and will utilize glucose dehydrogenase flavin-adenine dinucleotide (GDH-FAD) chemistry. The test strip is touched to a drop of blood to initiate the test process. The strip is designed such that when a drop of blood is touched to the end of the strip, the blood is drawn into the reaction space via capillary action. A simple one-step process provides a blood glucose result. Ten test strips will be provided with the meter kit and will also be available separately in vials of 25 strips. Historical data (on file at Nova Biomedical) shows minimal differences between lots of test strips produced over 2 years. As a result, test strips will now be manufactured to meet a single calibration code requirement, allowing for the elimination of a calibration step for the user when using the Nova Max One Blood Glucose Monitor. Control Solutions The control solutions are aqueous assayed solutions, containing buffered D- Glucose, viscosity-adjusting agent, preservatives and other non-reactive ingredients (dye). They contain no products of human origin. There are three levels of controls (1, 2 and 3).

The Nova Max One Biood' Glucose Monitor is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood. It is intended for single-patient home use and should not be used for testing multiple patients. It is intended for self testing outside the body by people with diabetes mellitus as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The Nova Max One Blood Glucose Monitor is specifically indicated for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh whole blood capillary samples obtained from the fingertip or alterative site testing (AST) on the forearm. AST on the forearm can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, and it is not intended for use on newborns.

Nova Max One Glucose Test Strips are intended for use only with the Nova Max One Blood Glucose Monitor for quantitative tests. The Glucose Monitor is intended to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood obtained from the finger tip or alternative site testing (AST) on the forearm. AST can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions. The Glucose Monitor is calibrated to provide plasma equivalent results to laboratory methods. Nova Max One Glucose Test Strips are for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). The Monitor should only be used by a single user in the home and should not be shared by users. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, and it is not. intended for use on newborns.

Nova Max Control Solutions are intended for use with the Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results. There are three levels of controls, (Levels 1, 2, 3).
