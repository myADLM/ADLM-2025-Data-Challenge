# Description:

The On CallVivid Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a quantitative assayor the detection o guin capillary who blod sampld fro  grt, pl and frear.The guco measurement is achieved by using the amperometric detection method.

The test strip has a reagent system including glucose oxidase and a mediator that reacts with glucose in the whole blood sample to produce an electrical current. This current is measured by the meter, and after calculation by the meter, the blood glucose concentration reading is displayed on the meter display, calibrated to a plasma reference.

# Intended Use:

The $\begin{array} { r } { 0 \ n \ C \mathrm { a } 1 \vert ^ { \mathfrak { B } } . } \end{array}$ Vivid Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an electrochemical enzymatic assay for the quantiative detection o gucose in resh capillary whole blood rom he ng, forearm, and palm by people with diabetes at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control programs. Fingertip, forearm and palm testing sites should be used alternately only when blood glucose level is not changing rapidly. The On Call $\otimes$ Vivid Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be shared. It is for in vitro diagnostic use only.

This device is not indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes.   
Alternative site testing can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.   
Alternative site testing (AST) should not be used to calibrate continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) nor for use in insulin dose calculations. The On Call Vivid Blood Glucose Meter and Strips are to be used with the On Call Vivid Blood Glucose Monitoring System; it measures glucose in capillary whole blood from the fingertip, forearm and palm.   
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
