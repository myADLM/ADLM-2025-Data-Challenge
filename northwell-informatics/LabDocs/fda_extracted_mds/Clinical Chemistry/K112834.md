Standard/Guidance Document Reference (if applicable): FDA / CDRH: Abbreviated (510k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators: Final Guidance for Industry  Version 2011. Date: 02/22/1999

Test Principle: Not applicable.

Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision performance specifications are defined in the individual quality control test protocols. These are typically less than $3 . 0 \%$ coefficient of variation. Precision performance for the lowest concentration set is based on resolution of the analyzer at that level.

# 510(k) SUMMARY MULTI-ANALYTE CHEMISTRY STANDARDS

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):   
See each individual Comparative Information Table for the specific NIST Standard Reference materials used.

d. Methodology for Concentration Verification: Each product Certificate of Analysis includes a description of the methodology used to verify the gravimetric concentration. This document is included in each kit.

# VALUE ASSIGNMENT:

Assigned concentrations are primary standard values. These standard values are assigned by gravimetric procedure and indicate weight per volume composition using standard source materials of known purity. The gravimetric concentrations are verified and lot certified using NIST Standard Reference materials or equivalent primary standards if NIST is not available. Reference method verification is used when available.

# STABILITY:

Real time stability studies are conducted according to Verichem Standard Operating Procedure number 40. Acceptance criteria for multi-level components are identical to the Verichem Quality Control End Test Procedure. Our real time stability testing utilizes a freshly prepared identical product as a reference to determine change in analyte concentration over time. NIST material is included in the stability testing.

e. Detection limit: Not applicable.

f. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.

g. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies: a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies: Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: See each individual product insert.

Conclusion: We have shown that these Verichem devices are similar to the predicate devices in terms of analytes, intended use, performance characteristics, value assignment, matrix and stability. I recommend that this device be found substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to the predicate device(s).

Dear Mr. Dimonte:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
