# Multi Chemistry Standard Kit:

Five (5) lots of standard kits containing five levels of the following analytes: creatinine, glucose, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, triglyceride, and urea nitrogen at $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { t } } = 2 4$ months for each analyte except for phosphorus $( \mathrm { t } { = } 2 1$ months) and compared to a reference control.
