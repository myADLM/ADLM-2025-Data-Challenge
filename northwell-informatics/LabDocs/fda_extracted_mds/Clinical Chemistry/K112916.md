# 5. Intended use

# TysonBio MD100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System :

The TysonBio MD100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood samples. Capillary samples may be drawn from the fingertip, palm and forearm. The TysonBio MD100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The TysonBio MD100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The TysonBio MD100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The TysonBio MD100 Test Strips are for use with the TysonBio MD100 Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in venous whole blood sample and fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm or palm.

The TysonBio MD100 Control Solutions is for use on the TysonBio MD100 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and providing accurate results.

# TysonBio MD100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System :

The TysonBio MD100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary and venous whole blood samples. Capillary samples may be drawn from the fingertip. palm and forearm. The TysonBio MD100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is intended for multiple-patient use in professional healthcare settings as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control program. This system should only be used with auto-disabling, single-use lancing devices. The TysonBio MD100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The TysonBio MD100 Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the TysonBio MD100 Pro Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in venous whole blood sample and fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm or palm.

The TysonBio MD100 Control Solutions is for use on the TysonBio MD100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and providing accurate results.

# Test principle

The test principle is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose dehydrogenase. There has been no change to the fundamental scientific technology.

Dear Wen-Hai Tsai:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
