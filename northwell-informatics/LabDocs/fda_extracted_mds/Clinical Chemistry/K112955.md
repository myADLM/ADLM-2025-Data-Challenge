Product Codes: KHP, JJX

Predicate Device: K100602 - Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System

Device Description:

Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System

# Intended Use:

# Indications for Use:

The Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System is intended for in vitro diagnostic use by healthcare professionals for multiple patient use in a professional healthcare setting for clinical and for point-of-care usage for the quantitative determination of Lactate (Lac) in fresh venous and arterial whole blood specimens as an aid to evaluate the acid-base status of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis. It is not for use on capillary blood specimens. It Is intended to provide plasma equivalent results to laboratory methods.

Summary of Technological Characteristics:

The Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System has the same fundamental scientific technology and intended use as the currently marketed Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System (K100602). Both the Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System and the proposed Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System are hand held devices with similar intended use to quantitatively measure the lactate levels in whole blood. The principle of operation is the same for the proposed and predicate device. Each utilizes a test strip that is inserted into a meter for results within 13 seconds.

# Comparison to Predicate Devices:

The proposed Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System uses the same fundamental scientific technology, similar specifications, and has the same intended use as the predicate Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System (K100602).

# Performance Studies:

Laboratory testing was performed on the proposed Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System. The laboratory studies demonstrated that the blood lactate results from the Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System were substantlally equivalent to the current methods for blood lactate measurements.

# Conclusion:

Results of laboratory and clinical testing demonstrate that the performance of the Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System has the same intended uses, with similar technological characteristics and can produce results that are substantially equivalent to results obtained on the predicate device. The system performs as intended and raises no new safety or effectiveness issues.

Dear Mr. MacDonald:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
