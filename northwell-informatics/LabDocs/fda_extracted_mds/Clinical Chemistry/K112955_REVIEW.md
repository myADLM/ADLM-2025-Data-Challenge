# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced :

None were referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The Nova StatStrip Lactate Test Strips have an electrode that measures lactate. Lactate in the blood sample mixes with the reagent on the test strip to produce an electric current. The amount of current produced is proportional to the amount of lactate in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

The Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System is physically identical to the predicate Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System cleared in k100602 except for the extended lactate measurement range $( 0 . 3 \sim 2 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m M }$ vs $0 . 7 \sim 2 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m M } )$ . The software has been modified to accommodate the extended measurement range. Other than the differences mentioned above the performance characteristics of this device are the same as the predicate.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Previously established in k100602

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed using adjusted whole blood samples with 9 different lactate concentrations ranging from 0.2 to $2 1 \mathrm { m M }$ with the following target concentrations: 0.2-0.6, 1.0- 2.0, 3.0-4.0, 5.0-7.0, 8.0-9.0, 10-12, 13-15, 16-18, and 19- $2 1 \mathrm { m M }$ , respectively. Three lots of test strips were used with five StatStrip Lactate hospital test meters for this study. Two measurements were taken on each meter for each sample solution. The result of each lot of test strip was plotted against the paired results from the CCX laboratory analyzer (as reference measurement). Results of the regression analysis are summarized below:

Based on the linearity study results, the sponsor claimed that the measuring range of the device is 0.3 to $2 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Close vial and open vial stability for Lactate Control Solution and Lactate Linearity Solution and value assignment of the Lactate Control Solution were established and cleared in submission k100602. Please refer to k100602 for information.

d. Detection limit: LoQ previously established as 0.3 mmol/L in k100602.   
e. Analytical specificity: Previously established in k100602   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable   
g. Cleaning and Disinfection Previously established in k100602

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Since this candidate device is identical to the predicate device, only an in-house method comparison was performed.

A total of 105 whole blood specimens, with the concentrations distributed across the $0 . 3 { - } 2 0 \mathrm { m M }$ reportable range were analyzed on the Nova Stat Profile CCX Analyzer (comparative method) and each of the three lots of test strips on the Nova StatStrip lactate meter (candidate method). The result of each test strip was plotted against the paired results from CCX. Results of the regression analysis are summarized below:
