# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

· ISO 14971:2007. Medical devices-Application of risk management to medical devices. ISO 15197. In vitro diagnostic test systems. Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

# L. Test Principle:

Same as predicate devices cleared under k101635.

The glucose biosensors recognize the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by virtue of the specificity of the enzyme FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) present on the test strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are transferred via a cofactor and mediator to the meter where they are read as a small electrical current. The

magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

The current devices differ from the predicates in the modification of meter physical appearance and data transmission method from data port to blue tooth. The modifications do not affect the analytical function of the meter and the current devices use the same test strips as cleared in the predicate devices in k101635.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Same as predicate devices cleared under k101635.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor claims the same measuring range as established for the predicate devices. The sponsor claims $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ for the TD-4257 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ m g / d L }$ for the TD-4257 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: Traceable to NIST SRM 91, dry D-glucose.

The control solutions were cleared under k093724.

Test strips were cleared under k101635. Data provided by the sponsor supports closed vial stability of TD-4239 test strips for 18 months and open vial stability of 3 months when stored at the recommended conditions of $2 ^ { \circ } - 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 3 5 . 6 ^ { \circ } - 8 9 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ , between $10 \%$ - $8 5 \%$ R.H.

Calibration: calibration of the test strip is done by inserting the code strip into the meter when opening a new vial of test strips.

d. Detection limit:

The claimed measuring ranges are the same as the predicate devices; $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ for the TD-4257Blood Glucose Monitoring System and $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ m g / d L }$ for the TD4257 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference Study:

Same as predicate devices cleared under k101635.

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:

Xylose: Do not test blood glucose during or soon after an absorption test. Xylose can give falsely elevated results.

There is no significant interference $( \leq 1 0 \% )$ in the presence of galactose, maltose, fructose or mannitol observed in blood glucose tests as demonstrated in studies up to $1 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Lipemic Effects: Blood triglycerides up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (22.8 mmol/L) do not affect the results significantly $( \leq 1 0 \% )$ , but may affect results at higher levels.

f. Assay cut-off:

Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. An accuracy test using the Quality Control current board (QC board) was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of 10 TD-4257 meters in glucose range of $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 7 0 0 ~ m g / d L }$ .

The QC board is designed to simulate 12 levels of glucose concentration: 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 160, 200, 280, 400, 550 and $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when connected with the meter, it will send an electrical current to the meter equivalent to the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction at a certain glucose concentration. The meter then process the current and display it in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ unit.

The same procedure was also performed on 10 predicate meters of TD-4239. For the current device TD4257, the CV of the mean of 10 meter measurements was between $0 . 0 0 \% { - } 0 . 4 0 \%$ at the 13 glucose levels. For the predicate meter TD-4239, the CV of the mean of 10 meter measurements was between $0 . 0 0 \% { - } 0 . 3 2 \%$ at the 13 glucose levels. The sponsor concluded that the accuracy of the modified TD-4257 meter was consistent through out the 13 glucose intervals with CV significantly below the set acceptance criteria of $5 \%$ .

2. Altitude:

The sponsor claims that the TD 4257 BMGS can be used at altitude up to 15,000 feet based on study performed on the predicate device TD4239 in k101635.

3. Hematocrit:

The sponsor claims a hematocrit range of $20 \mathrm { - } 7 0 \%$ based on study performed on the predicate device TD4239 in k101635.

4. Temperature and humidity:

The sponsor claims that the TD-4257 meters operates at $5 0 - 1 0 4 ~ \mathrm { ^ { \circ } F }$ $( 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , and relative humidity between $10 \% - 8 5 \%$ based on study performed on the predicate meters k101635.

5. Drop tests and vibration tests were conducted. The study protocol and test report were reviewed and deemed acceptable.

6. EMC testing was performed for TD4257 and TD4257 multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems by an accredited EMC Testing Laboratory ETC. A test certificate was issued to Taidoc Technology Corporation on December 28, 2009.

7. Disinfection and Robustness studies:

Due to the casing changes in the new devices as compared to the predicates, new Disinfection and Robustness studies were performed for TD4257 and TD4257 multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems.

The disinfection studies were performed on these meters by an outside commercial testing service to determine the robustness of the meter to the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of blood borne pathogens, particularly Duck hepatitis B virus (HBV). Micro-Kill Plus™ disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No: 59894-10-37549) were validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meters. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meters and lancing device after 10,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of healthcare professional use and 5 years of use by lay users. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

8. The software changes related to the modified functions (Bluetooth data transmission and memory storage of up to 1000 tests) were tested and the intended functions were validated.
