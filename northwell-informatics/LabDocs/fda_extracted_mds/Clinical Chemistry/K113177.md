# Fujirebio Diagnostics Vitamin D Control (k110641)

# Summary and Principle:

This quality control product is intended to allow an objective measurement of a laboratories performance (procedures and personnel techniques) in comparison to known values. Two clinically relevant levels of controls are available to compare observations with expected ranges therefore assuring consistent performance.

# Intended Use:

The Quantimetrix Complete D 25-OH Vitamin D Control is intended for the quality control of laboratory procedures used to quantitate Total 25-OH Vitamin D.

# Statement of Substantial Equivalence:

The Quantimetrix Complete D 25-OH Vitamin D Control is intended for the quality control of laboratory procedures used to quantitate Total 25-OH Vitamin D.

The Quantimetrix Complete D 25-OH Vitamin D Control is substantially equivalent to the Fujirebio Diagnostics Vitamin D Control. Both of the devices are quality control serum and are intended for the quality control of laboratory procedures used to quantitate Total 25-OH Vitamin D.

The regulatory submission is prepared pursuant to Title 21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1660.

A comparison of the features of the Quantimetrix Complete D 25-OH Vitamin D Control and the Fujirebio Diagnostics Vitamin D Control are as follows:

Dear Kalyna Snylyk:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
