# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Complete D 25-OH Vitamin D control is intended to monitor the performance of clinical assays used to quantitate total 25-OH Vitamin D.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For in vitro diagnostic use only   
For prescription use only   
DiaSorin Liaison users should dilute Level 1 and Level 2 by $7 5 \%$ (3 parts control to 1 part Liaison $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Vitamin D Specimen Diluent).

4. Special instrument requirements:

None

# I. Device Description:

The Quantimetrix Complete D 25-OH Vitamin D Control is supplied liquid in two levels and consists of a human serum matrix containing preservatives.

The Quantimetrix Complete D 25-OH Vitamin D Control is supplied in two levels; each kit contains 3 vials of level 1 or level 2 per box. The controls are supplied as a ready-to-use liquid, requiring no reconstitution. They are prepared in human serum matrix spiked with 25-Hydroxyvitamin $\mathrm { D } _ { 2 }$ and 25-Hydroxyvitamin $\mathrm { D } _ { 3 }$ in order to achieve the two levels. The preservatives have been added to inhibit microbial growth.

The Quantimetrix Complete D 25-OH Vitamin D Control is prepared in a human serum matrix and contains other human source materials. All blood donor units comprising the serum pool have been tested and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C and HIV 1 and 2 antibodies when tested by FDA accepted methods. Handle these controls with the same precautions used when handling any potentially infectious material.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

The 25-OH Vitamin D2 and D3 are purchased from commercial vendors. The Complete $\mathrm { D } \ @$ 25-OH Vitamin D Control is traceable to NIST reference material SRM972.

# Stability

Shelf life and open vial stability:

Real-time testing at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ was conducted and is still on-going. The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The current real time and accelerated stability test results support two year shelf life stability, one year open vial stability when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 30 days open vial stability when stored at room temperature $( 1 8 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

# Value Assignment

The control ranges as determined using LC-MS-MS, DiaSorin Liaison, LCMS-MS Isotope Dilution, IDS EIA and IDS-RIA assays are provided in the assigned value sheet for each lot release. Control range was determined from replicate measurements using IDS-RIA, IDS-EIA, LC-MS-MS Isotope Dilution, DiaSorin Liaison, and LC-MS-MS. The ranges were determined as mean $+ / - 2$ SD around the mean for LC-MS-MS and DiaSorin Liasion; and as $+ / - 2 0 \%$ CV around the mean for LC-MS-MS Isotope Dilution, IDS-EIA and IDS-RIA assays.

In the labeling the sponsor recommends that each end user laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use the assigned value sheet as guidance only.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The control ranges for each assay are provided in the assigned value sheet for each lot release.

The expected ranges have been established from inter-laboratory data. Each laboratory should establish its own precision parameters.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
