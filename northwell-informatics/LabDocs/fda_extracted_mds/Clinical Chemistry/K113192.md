# 3.  Device:

Proprietary Name: Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System   
Common Name: Blood Glucose Test System System, Test, Blood Glucose, Over The Counter   
Classification Name: Glucose Oxidase Single(specified) analyte controls

Classification: Class II, 21 CFR 862.1345 Classification Product Code: NBW Subsequent Product Codes CGA, JJX

# 4. Predicate Device:

GLUCOLAB Auto-coding (IGM-0022) Infopia Co., Ltd.

# K091157

# 5. Description:

The Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the meter, test strips and control solutions (low, normal and high levels), a lancing device and sterile lancets (sold separately; accessory). The blood glucose test system is an in vitro diagnostic device designed for measuring the concentration of glucose in whole blood sample by means of an electrical current produced in the test strip and sent to the meter for measurement.

# 6. Indications for use:

The Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm, forearm, calf and/or thigh. The Healthpro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be shared.

The Healthpro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady—state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and that the test as a quality control checks to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

# 7. Technological Characteristics:

The Healthpro Blood Glucose Monitoring System has the same fundamental scientific technology as the GLUCOLAB Auto-coding (IGM-0022) predicate device, K091 157. But the performance characteristic between them shows slight difference.

# 8. Performance Data:

The Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed in accordance with ISO 15197:2003. The clinical performance evaluation testing included system accuracy, user performance and alternative-site blood glucose measurement. The non-clinical performance evaluations are validated and tested, it conducted to establish the performance, functionality and reliability characteristics of the Healthpro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

Disinfectant CaviWipes with the EPA registration number of 46781-8 has been validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus of use with the meter and the reusable lancing device. There was also no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and the lancing device after 1,095 cleaning/disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of device use.

# 9. Conclusions:

Infopia Co., Ltd. concludes that the Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is safe and effective also, substantially equivalent to predicate device, GLUCOLAB Auto-coding (IGM-0022), K091157.

Dear Ms. Chung:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA mav publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
