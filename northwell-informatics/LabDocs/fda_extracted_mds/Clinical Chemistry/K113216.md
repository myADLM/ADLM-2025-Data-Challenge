# Device Description

Lactate (Lac) is a new parameter offered on the RAPIDPoint 500 (RP500) blood gas system. The RP500 system is a point-of-care and laboratory testing blood gas analyzer and currently measures a variety of parameters that have been previously cleared. Enabling the lactate measurement is accomplished through software design changes introduced in Software Version 2:0 and requires the use of a RAPIDPoint 500 Measurement Cartridge. No hardware or mechanical changes were needed.

# 510(k) Summary

# Statement of Intended Use

The RAPIDPoint 500 system is intended for in vitro diagnostic use and is designed to provide the determination in whole blood for the following parameters:

Partial pressure of carbon dioxide   
• Partial pressure of oxygen   
• pH Sodium Potassium lonized calcium Chloride Glucose Total hemoglobin and fractions: $f ( 2 , H _ { 2 }$ , fCOHb, fMetHb, fHHb Neonatal bilirubin Lactate

This test system is intended for use in point of care or laboratory settings.

# Indications for Use

Lactate. Lactic acid measurements that evaluate the acid-base status are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of the blood).

# Summary of Technological Characteristics

The integrated lactate sensor uses an amperometric method where the working electrode contains the enzyme lactate oxidase.

The lactate measurement is performed by a sensor that incorporates amperometric technology. The lactate biosensor is a complete electrochemical cell. A constant voltage, called a polarizing voltage, is maintained during analysis. In the lactate sensor, lactic acid from the sample interacts with the lactate oxidase on the surface of the measuring electrode to form pyruvic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The polarizing voltage is sufficient to cause oxidation of the hydrogen peroxide to oxygen. The loss of electrons in the oxidation of $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ creates a current flow that is directly proportional to the lactate concentration in the sample.

# Assessment of Performance

Studies were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the RAPIDPoint 500 with lactate parameter and assess substantial equivalence against the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics RAPIDLab 1265 (predicate device).

The lactate internal evaluation study entailed testing concentrations of lactate in whole blood across the reporting range. The lactate external evaluation study included testing at multiple point-of-care sites with intended use whole blood samples. Combining the results of the external evaluation for a total of over 140 samples, the coefficient of determination $( r ^ { 2 } )$ value was within the acceptance criteria $( > 0 . 9 0 )$ . Specimens were

# 510(k) Summary

evaluated against the RAPIDLab 1265 predicate device and based on performance data analyzed, it was concluded that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.

In addition, information on Software Development Life Cycle including software requirements specifications, risk management report, and overall verification and validation results were included to provide additional assurance of device performance.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the studies completed demonstrate that the RAPIDPoint® 500 System Lactate (Lac) Test is similar to the RAPIDLab 1265 predicate device in both Technological Characteristics and Intended Use. The data presented in the submission is a summary of internal evaluation, external clinical evaluation, and software development information. This information provides assurance that the RAPIDPoint 500 system measuring lactate has demonstrated substantial equivalence to the currently marketed Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics RAPIDLab 1265 predicate device across the reporting range.

Dear Mr. Goldberg:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class ⅢI (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
