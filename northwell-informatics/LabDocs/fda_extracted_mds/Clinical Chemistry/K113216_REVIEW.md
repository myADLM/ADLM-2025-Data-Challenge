RAPIDPoint 500 system

# I. Device Description:

Lactate is a new parameter offered on the RAPIDPoint 500 instrument (formerly the RAPIDPoint 405 instrument) previously cleared under k002738, k020616, and k110277. The RP500 system is a point-of-care and laboratory testing blood gas analyzer and currently measures pCO2, p O2, pH, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, glucose, fO2Hb, fCOHb, fMetHb, fHHb and neonatal bilirubin. The measurement of lactate is accomplished through modification of the existing RP500 software and the addition of an integrated lactate sensor into a new RP500 Measurement Cartridge, which is a RP405 Measurement cartridge modified for lactate. To facilitate the lactate measurement, the RP500 Measurement Cartridge includes a modified reagent and the integrated lactate sensor chip.

# L. Test Principle:

The lactate measurement is performed by a sensor that incorporates amperometric technology. The lactate biosensor is a complete electrochemical cell. A constant voltage, called a polarizing voltage, is maintained during analysis. In the lactate sensor, lactic acid from the sample interacts with the lactate oxidase on the surface of the measuring electrode to form pyruvic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The polarizing voltage is sufficient to cause oxidation of the hydrogen peroxide to oxygen. The loss of electrons in the oxidation of $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ creates a current flow that is directly proportional to the lactate concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed precision studies in-house following the guidelines provided in “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline—Second Edition” using 4 lithium heparinized whole blood samples (prepared fresh for every run), 3 instruments, at least 2 operators, 3 lots of sensors and 3 lots of reagents. Each blood sample was measured in duplicate, twice a day in both modes (syringe and capillary) for a minimum of 20 days. The results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted with lithium heparinized whole blood samples ranging from 0.11 to $3 0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m m o l }$ . The samples were run in replicates of six on one analyzer in syringe mode. The result of linear regression analysis is summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.979</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.087</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{}$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9854</td></tr></table>

The execution of first, second and third order linear regression did not indicate statistically significant non linear regression coefficients in either the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ order or $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order models.

The reportable range of this device for lactate measurements is 0.18 to 30 mmol/L.

. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Calibrators: There is a 2 point calibration using automated on-board reagents. The $2 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ lactate calibrator value assignment is conducted using the lactate oxidase spectrophotometric method and is traceable to a commercially available standard. The production lots are value assigned against the standard in several test runs using multiple samples in multiple replicates against multiple replicates of the standard on one instrument. Previously released lots are tested in each run. The protocols and acceptance criteria for the sponsor’s pre-defined acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy were reviewed and found to be adequate.

Quality Control Materials: Quality Control materials recommended for use with this system were previously cleared under k970956. The automatic quality control materials (AQC) cartridge was previously cleared under k020616.

Reagent and calibrator stability: The sponsor evaluated the device’s stability claims following a protocol designed to evaluate the measurement cartridge shelf life under customer use conditions. The sponsor monitors the

performance of the device using whole blood samples, quality control samples and calibration verification materials that are evaluated at a day (predetermined as the designated test point) for each monthly stability interval. Since the calibrators are within the reagent cartridge, the stability of the calibrators is monitored along with the reagent stability. The proposed protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.

# d. Detection limit:

For the Detection Limit studies, 2 lots of sensors and 2 lots of reagents were used. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined using the wash reagent (no lactate added). One lot of wash reagent was analyzed in replicates of 11 on 2 instruments over 5 days (for a total of 5 reagent lots). The results were found not to be Gaussian. Therefore, the LOB was determined as the nonparametric $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile. The LoB was calculated to be $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined using lithium heparinized whole blood collected from 5 donors. Eleven replicates of each sample were analyzed on 2 analyzers over 5 days. The LoD was calculated as $\mathrm { L o D = L o B }$ ${ } + \mathrm { C } _ { \beta } { } ^ { * } \mathrm { S D }$ where SD is the pooled standard deviation and $\mathrm { C _ { \beta } }$ was calculated according to the following formula: ${ \mathrm { C } } _ { \beta } \div ( 1 { - } 1 { \div } ( 4 \ X$ degrees of freedom of the estimated SD). The LoD was calculated to be $0 . 1 1 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined using lithium heparinized whole blood collected from 5 donors. Each sample was analyzed in replicates of 5 on 4 instruments over 7 days. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration tested at which the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of the device is less than $20 \%$ . The LoQ was determined to be $0 . 1 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies:

Lithium heparinized whole blood samples were spiked to either $0 . 7 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ or 2.6 mmol/L lactate. The samples were split and either spiked with an interferent or an equivalent volume of solvent and then run on 2 instruments in syringe mode using 2 lots of sensors. The low lactate samples were measured in replicates of 8 and the high lactate samples were measured in replicates of 5.

The bias was calculated using the following formula: Bias $=$ (mean test-mean control)

The percent interference was calculated using the following formula: $\%$ interference $=$ (bias/mean control) $\ast 1 0 0$ .

The sponsor defined no interference if the bias was within $\pm 1 0 \%$ .

Lithium heparinized whole blood samples were collected and run in replicates of 2 on 6 proposed devices and 2 predicate devices, using 3 lots of reagents in syringe mode and capillary mode using 3 operators. Ordinary least squares regression was used to determine the coefficient of determination $( \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } )$ and Orthogonal Deming regression analysis was performed to determine the slope and intercept using singlicate values from the proposed device and the predicate device.

The sponsor also performed method comparison studies at 3 point of care (POC) sites using at least 3 typical POC operators and one instrument per site. One cartridge lot and one reagent lot was used for this study. Left over clinical specimens were analyzed in duplicate using either syringe $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 2 )$ or capillary $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 6 7 )$ sampling modes, however, the statistical analysis used the first replicate only. Less than $10 \%$ of the samples in the study were spiked samples. Ordinary least squares regression was used to determine the coefficient of determination $( \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } )$ and Orthogonal Deming regression analysis was performed to determine the slope and intercept. The results are summarized below:
