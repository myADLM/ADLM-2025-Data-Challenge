The instrument accepts the physical patient samples, performs the appropriate optical or potentiometric measurements on those samples and communicates that data to an integral Panel PC. The Panel PC uses keyboard or touch screen input to manually enter a variety of data, control and accept data from the instrument, manage and maintain system information and generate reports relative to patient status and</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">instrument performance. The Panel PC also allows remote download of patient requisitions and upload of patient results via a standard interface. In the ACE Cholesterol Reagent assay, cholesterol esters in serum are completely hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to free cholesterol and free fatty acids. The cholesterol liberated by the esterase, plus any endogenous free cholesterol, are both oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to yield hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide then acts to oxidatively couple p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-aminoantipyrine in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, producing a red colored quinoneimine complex which absorbs strongly at 505 nm. The amount of chromogen formed, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance, bichromatically at 505 nm/647 nm, is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration in the sample. The HDL-C Assay utilizes two reagents, the second containing a unique detergent. This detergent solubilizes only the HDL lipoprotein particles, thus releasing HDL cholesterol to react with the cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase, in the presence of a chromogen to produce color. The detergent also inhibits the reaction of the cholesterol</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at 592/692 nm, is directly proportional to the HDL cholesterol concentration in the sample. In the ACE LDL-C Reagent assay, detergent 1 solubilizes non-LDL lipoprotein particles (HDL, VLDL and chylomicrons) and releases cholesterol. The cholesterol is consumed by cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase in a non-color forming reaction. In a second reaction, detergent 2 solublizes the remaining LDL particles and forms peroxide, via the enzymes cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase. The peroxide, in the presence of peroxidase and two peroxidase sub- strates, 4-aminoantipyrine and DSBmT, results in a purple-red color. The amount of color formed, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at 544/692 nm, is directly proportional to the LDL cholesterol concentration in the sample. In the ACE Triglycerides Reagent Assay, triglycerides in serum are hydrolyzed by lipase to form glycerol and free fatty acids. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glycerol kinase, the glycerol is converted to glycerol-1-phosphate and the ATP to adenosine diphosphate. Glycerol-1-phosphate is oxidized by glycerol phosphate oxidase to yield hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide then acts to oxidatively couple p-chlorophenol and 4-aminoantipyrine in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, producing a red colored quinoneimine complex which absorbs strongly at 505 nm.
