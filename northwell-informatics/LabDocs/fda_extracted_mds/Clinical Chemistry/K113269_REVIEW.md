# L. Test Principle:

In the presence of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ , $Z \mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ and AMP as a phosphate acceptor, alkaline phosphatase hydrolyzes $p$ -nitrophenyl phosphate substrate into inorganic phosphate and $p$ - nitrophenol (yellow compound with an absorbance peak at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ ). The rate of the formation of $p$ -nitrophenol is directly proportional to the alkaline phosphatase activity as follows:

$p { \mathrm { - N P P + H _ { 2 } O } } \longrightarrow$ Inorganic phosphate $^ + p$ -Nitrophenol (yellow; can be measured using a $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ spectrophotometer)

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

This study followed the CLSI EP5-A2 “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices” guideline. Within-run and Total Precision studies were performed for alkaline phosphatase. Studies were performed by conducting 2 runs per day, two measurements per run, for 3 levels of serumbased samples and 2 levels of controls, on 2 Selectra ProM analyzers for 20 operating days. Data for level 1 is from a diluted human serum pool sample, level 2 is from a natural serum pool sample, and level 3 is from a spiked human serum pool sample. Two lots of reagent were used for the study. The results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ALP Levels</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Elitrol I</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Elitrol II</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No. ofSamples</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No. ofReplicates(per run)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean (U/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>57</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>144</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>262</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>82</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>224</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total %CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within-RunSD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within-Run%CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.8</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted based on the CLSI EP06-A guideline by comparing observed versus expected values for 11 equally-spaced serum samples. Two pools of patient serum samples were prepared to obtain one high and one low concentration. A high concentration of sample was obtained by spiking the serum pool $\left( 1 0 2 3 ~ \mathrm { U / L } \right)$ and a low concentration of sample was prepared by diluting the sample pool with buffered saline solution $( 2 0 ~ \mathrm { U / L } )$ . Using the high and low pooled samples, eleven levels of inter-mixtures with equidistant activities were prepared, with all samples assayed in triplicate on one Selectra ProM instrument. Data was analyzed using $1 ^ { \dot { \mathrm { s t } } } , 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ , and $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order least square regressions. A $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ order linear regression was generated as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Th</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{2}$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>StandardError (U/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ConcentrationRanges tested</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EALP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9681</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.1406</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9996</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9998</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20-1023 U/L</td></tr></table>

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the ALP IFCC SL assay is linear across the measuring range of 20 to $1 0 2 3 \mathrm { U / L }$ .

Dilution Study:

The sponsor performed a 1:10 manual dilution study with 10 spiked samples using saline as the diluent. Ten spiked serum samples with ALP analyte concentrations between 991 and $9 8 7 4 \ \mathrm { \ U / L }$ were diluted 1:10. The $\%$ recoveries between the expected and observed values are within $10 \%$ . Therefore, the sponsor claimed that the ALP concentration greater than the upper claimed measuring range $\left( 1 0 2 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L } \right)$ can be diluted manually 1:10 with saline.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The sponsor claims that the Elitech ALP IFCC SL assay is traceable to the IFCC formulation (Tietz, 1983), by manual measurement.

Stability of the reagent: The shelf-life of ALP IFCC SL reagents is 18 months (tested using 2 lots) when stored at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The shelf-life stability is based on their real-time stability study, which is still on-going. The on-board stability and calibration frequency is 1 day. Shelf-life and on-board stability study protocols have been provided and found to be adequate.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limits of Blank (LoB), Detection (LoD) and Quantitation (LoQ) studies were conducted following the CLSI EP17-A guideline for ALP IFCC SL. Two Selectra Pro M analyzers and two lots of a validated reagent were used. The LoB values were determined by analyzing a blank sample 60 times using 2 reagent lots over 2 analyzers over multiple days. The LoD and LoQ studies each used 4 diluted sample pools prepared from 4 different patient sample pools of known activities in order to obtain an activity close to four times the calculated value of the LoB or the expected LoQ, respectively. LoD and LoQ values were determined by measuring each of the 4 diluted sample pools 15 times (measuring low activity of analyte for LoD and samples diluted in saline for LoQ) in one run across two analyzers using two reagent lots on multiple days (2-5 days).Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Detection Limits</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4 U/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6 U/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20 U/L</td></tr></table>

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline for alkaline phosphatase. Seven to nine increasing concentrations of potential interferents, tested in triplicate, were spiked into low $( 1 5 0 \mathrm { U / L } )$ , medium (250 U/L), and high $( 9 0 0 \mathrm { U / L } )$ levels of pooled patient serum samples. The sponsor’s definition of no significant interference is $\leq 1 0 \%$ difference between the tested and the control samples. There was no significant interference between alkaline phosphatase and interferents in the concentration ranges indicated in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interferents</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Highest level tested with nointerference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3141 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Unconjugated bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30.0 mg/dL, (513 µmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Conjugated bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29.5 mg/dL, (504 µmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ascorbic acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20.0 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acetylsalicylic acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>200 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acetaminophen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed using the ALP IFCC SL reagent on a Selectra ProM analyzer and Roche Diagnostics Alkaline phosphatase acc. to IFCC Gen.2 reagent on a cobas c111 analyzer according to the CLSI EP09- A2 guideline. A total of 100 serum patient samples were used, including 5 diluted and 5 spiked samples. The sample range tested on the candidate device was 20 to $1 0 2 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ . The result of the linear regression is shown below:

<table><tr><td>Slope (95% Confidence Interval)</td><td>Intercept (95% Confidence Interval</td><td>r</td><td>R2</td></tr><tr><td>1.025 (1.017 to 1.034)</td><td>0.909 (-4 to 3)</td><td>0.998</td><td>0.997</td></tr></table>

b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was performed with 40 paired serum and plasma (in lithium heparin) samples using one Selectra ProM analyzer, according to the CLSI EP09-A2 guideline. Two samples were diluted and 3 samples were spiked. The sample range tested was 21 to ${ } ^ { 8 7 8 } \mathrm { ~ U / L }$ . The result of the linear regression is shown below:

<table><tr><td>Slope (95% Confidence Interval</td><td>Intercept (95% Confidence Interval)</td><td>r</td><td>R2</td></tr><tr><td>1.10 (1.096 to 1.111)</td><td>-3 (-5 to -1)</td><td>1.000</td><td>0.999</td></tr></table>

Based on the data, the sponsor claims that lithium heparin is an acceptable anticoagulant for the collection of plasma samples.
