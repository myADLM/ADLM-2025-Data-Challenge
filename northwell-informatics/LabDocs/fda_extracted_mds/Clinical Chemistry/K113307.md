Device Description

GoodLife AC- $3 0 0 \sim 3 0 5$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System and GoodLife AC- $3 0 0 { \sim } 3 0 5$ Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System consist of:

(1) Glucose Meter   
(2) Glucose Test Strips   
(3) Two levels of glucose control solutions (Level I and Level II) may be purchased separately. Glucose control solutions were previously cleared under K032985.   
(4) Check Strip   
(5)Instruction for use

These models have the same intended use and technological characteristics except the housing of the meter. Although the different shapes of housing, the materials are the same.

[Test Principle]

GoodLife AC- $3 0 0 \sim 3 0 5$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System and GoodLife $A C - 3 0 0 \sim 3 0 5$ Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System are electrochemical biosensor system that measures the amount of electric current produced then displays the result as a blood glucose level on the LCD monitor. When the blood is drawn into the blood reaction zone of the test strip, the glucose in the blood sample mixes with a special chemical in the test strip, which produces a small electric current. The reaction current is proportional to the amount of glucose in the blood. The result is displayed on the LCD monitor and automatically stored in the meter for future use.

[Control Solution]

The GoodLife Glucose control solution is intended for in vitro diagnostic use (i.e. for external use only) to assess the performance of the GoodLife AC- $3 0 0 \sim 3 0 5$ with GoodLife AC Blood Glucose Test strips or $A C - 3 0 0 \sim 3 0 5$ Professional Blood Glucose monitoring system with AC Professional Blood Glucose Test strips. There are two levels of controls (Levels 1,2).

[Check Strip]

The Check Strip can be used to check that the meter is operating properly. It is composed of PCB, resistor, top cover and bottom cover.

[Device Calibration]

The device is calibrated by implicit coding process. While inserting the test strip into strip slot to perform the blood glucose test, the coding procedure is complete. The meter will apply formula including this parameter of code to calculate the glucose value.
