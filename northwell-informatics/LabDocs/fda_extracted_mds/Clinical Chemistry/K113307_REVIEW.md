# L. Test Principle:

The GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use Glucose dehydrogenase-FAD enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. A glucose dehydrogenase sensor based on the carbon electrode adopting the amperometric assay utilizes the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone for the oxidation of glucose. As a result of this reaction, two electrons are produced forming an electrical current that is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The GoodLife AC-300 Blood Glucose Meter was chosen as the representative meter for the twelve meter models in the single and multiple patient use meter model series. The AC-300 meter was used for all performance studies as the twelve meter models are identical; the only differences between each meter are the shape of the meter and the size and shape of the buttons; however the functions of all twelve meters are identical. The GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems utilizes test strips under two names: GL GoodLife AC Blood Glucose Test Strips (for models: AC-300, AC-301, AC-302, AC-303, AC-304, AC305) and GL GoodLife AC Professional Blood Glucose Test Strips (for models: AC300 professional, AC-301 professional, AC-302 professional, AC-303 professional, AC-304 professional, AC- 305 professional glucose meters)

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run precision was measured by using EDTA venous whole blood as the anti-coagulant at six different glucose concentrations. Each blood sample was adjusted to a hematocrit level ranging from $30 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \%$ and verified by an automated method. Each sample was tested on 3 lots of test strips on 30 meters (10 meters per test strip lot). Ten replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot, and glucose concentration, $( \mathrm { N } { = } 1 0 0$ per test strip). Results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity study was designed following CLSI EP6-A guideline. Venous (EDTA) whole blood samples were drawn and spiked to target analyte levels. Eight (8) target levels were prepared with glucose stock solutions to glucose concentrations ranging from $< 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to ${ > } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (18, 40, 107, 119, 184, 276, 476, $6 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). A total of 480 strips from 3 strip lots were used for this study. Each sample was tested on 160 strips per lot (3 lots of test strips) using two meters. All samples were also tested on a YSI analyzer to generate the expected values. The observed values were plotted against an average of the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was generated with results summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{}$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.01</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.51</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.23</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.995</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.01</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.36</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Combined</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.01</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.03</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996</td></tr></table>

The sponsor’s claimed measurement range for glucose is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Glucose Monitoring Systems are traceable to the NIST SRM 917a reference material.

Control solutions previously cleared: See k032985 for traceability, stability, and expected value information.

Test Strip Stability:

Shelf Life: GL GoodLife AC blood glucose test strips were stored at $( 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 5 \% \pm 5 \% \mathrm { R H } )$ , $( 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $6 5 \% { \pm } 5 \% \mathrm { R H }$ ), and $4 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 5 \% \pm 5 \% \mathrm { R H } )$ . For this study, one lot (28 vials, 25 strips per vial) of test strips were used and were divided into 3 groups stored at temp/humidity combinations specified above for real time shelf life stability testing. Glucose values obtained using the GL GoodLife meter were compared to glucose values obtained using YSI reference method at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12,18, and 24 months. The sponsor claims shelf life of 24 months when stored at ${ 5 0 { - } 1 0 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } }$ $( 1 0 – 4 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Open Vial test strip stability: 156 vials (25 strips per vial) of GL GoodLife AC blood glucose test strips from one (1) lot were divided into 3 groups and stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 5 \% \pm 5 \% \mathrm { R H } )$ , $( 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $6 5 \% \pm 5 \% \mathrm { R H } )$ ), and $( 4 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 5 \% \pm 5 \% \mathrm { R H } )$ . Eight (8) different blood glucose concentrations were tested 10 times using one meter. Glucose values obtained using the GL GoodLife meter were compared to glucose values obtained using YSI reference method at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 13 weeks. The sponsor claims open vial stability of 90 days after first opening when stored at 50-104 $^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 1 0 – 4 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Common endogenous and exogenous substances were evaluated for interference by first spiking venous whole blood (collected in tubes containing EDTA) to two levels of glucose concentrations $( 6 0 - 7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 250-350 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and then dividing each level to a control and test aliquot. The endogenous and exogenous substances to be evaluated were then added to the test aliquot. Each interfering substance was evaluated at 4 concentrations on 3 lots of test strips. Bias was calculated as the difference between the test and control concentration groups. The following tables show the test concentrations for each potential interfering substance:

System accuracy study:

This study was designed following ISO 15197:2003(E) using 100 fresh capillary blood samples collected from participants from a diabetic clinic and measured using two AC-300 meters. Fingerstick samples were collected by two trained technicians over a 10 day period. Venous blood was also collected and measured on the YSI analyzer. Pooled and altered samples were used for glucose values less than $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and greater than $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; each sample allowed to glycolyze or spiked with a stock glucose solution to the desired glucose level. Results obtained using the AC-300 meters were compared to results obtained using the YSI 2300 (reference method). The range of samples tested was $3 1 - 4 5 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

5. Calibration:

There is no calibration required for the GL GoodLife meter by the user. The meter is plasma-calibrated.

# 6. Quality Control:

GL Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations (Levels 1 and 2) can be run with this device. The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the control solutions to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the control solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Altitude Study:

This study was conducted at three sites to evaluate the effect of altitude on the GL GoodLife BGMS. One lot of test strips was tested on 4 meters. Eight different venous whole blood (EDTA) glucose concentrations were evaluated on each meter in replicates of five at each site and at altitudes of 0.33 feet, 5,741 feet, and 8,800 feet. The samples tested spanned the device measuring range. These blood samples were evaluated using both the GL GoodLife blood glucose meter and an YSI glucose analyzer. Each test strip glucose value was compared to the YSI method and then analyzed as a percent bias. The glucose values obtained using the GL GoodLife glucose meter had acceptable biases compared to YSI to support use at altitudes up to 8,800 feet. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 8,800 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems.

2. Hematocrit Study:

The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using seven different hematocrit (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 55, $60 \%$ ) levels distributed across the glucose measuring range $( 2 0 - 6 0 0 { \mathrm { m g / d L } } )$ . Each glucose concentration/hematocrit level was tested in replicates of six (6) using one (1) meter. The results support the sponsor’s hematocrit claim of $30 \% - 5 5 \%$ .

3. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study:

In this study, two meters were evaluated at 10 combined temperature and relative humidity conditions $( 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , $4 0 \%$ , $4 2 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ with $1 5 \%$ RH and $( 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , $4 0 \%$ , $4 2 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ with $8 5 \% \mathrm { R H }$ ). Each sample was compared to the YSI reference method. The meters and test strips were at each temperature/humidity combination for at least 30 minutes prior to glucose concentration testing. Eight venous whole blood samples were adjusted to the following glucose concentration levels: $( < 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $2 0 { \cdot } 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 51-110 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 111- $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 5 1 { - } 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $2 5 1 { \mathrm { - } } 4 0 0 ~ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ , $4 0 1 { - } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and ${ > } 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } $ ) and were evaluated on each meter in replicates of five (2 meters x 5 replicates). The results demonstrate that accurate readings can obtained after exposure to temperatures ranging from $5 0 \sim 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $1 0 \sim 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity conditions at 15 and $8 5 \%$ .

4. EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing of the GL GoodLife Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed following the requirements of ISO 15197:2003 (E). A signed technical compliance statement was provided demonstrating that EMC testing was performed following standards listed in the test report.

5. Sample volume study:

HMD Biomedical performed a sample volume study to demonstrate that $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of whole blood is sufficient volume for the GL GoodLife AC-300 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. For this study, whole blood sample volumes ranging from $0 . 3 \mu \mathrm { L } - 0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ were evaluated using three different lots of test strips. The blood glucose sample results collected using the GL GoodLife Meter were compared with glucose values obtained with the YSI reference method and supported the minimum sample volume claim of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

6. Infection control:

The device (GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring systems) is intended for single (AC-300 - 305) or multiple patient use (AC-300M - 305M). Clorox Commercial Solutions $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg No.67619-12) were validated by virucide efficacy testing using Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using materials from the meter. Robustness studies were also performed demonstrating that there was no change in device performance or in the external materials of the meters after 520

cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate single-patient use or after 18,250 cleaning and disinfecting cycles to simulate 5 years of multiple patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

7. Readability: A Flesch-Kincaid analysis was conducted and the resulting grade level at which the device labeling is written is as follows:
