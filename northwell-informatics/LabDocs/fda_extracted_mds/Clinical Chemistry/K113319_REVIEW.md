D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Real-Time PCR   
E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Rotor-Gene Q MDx is a real-time PCR analyzer designed for thermal cycling and real-time detection of PCR amplicons. The Rotor-Gene Q MDx (“RGQ”) uses a centrifugal rotary design for thermal cycling where each tube spins in a chamber of moving air, intended to keep samples at a uniform temperature. Detection is performed as each tube aligns with the detection optics, where the sample is optically excited and the resulting fluorescent signal is collected from a single optical pathway. Software version 2.1.0 or higher has been validated for use with the artus® Infl A/B RG RT-PCR assay.

The artus® Infl A/B RG RT-PCR assay is being submitted separately, but concurrent with this RGQ instrument submission. Please refer to the artus® Infl A/B RG RTPCR assay 510(k) submission (k113323) for the artus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Infl A/B RG RT-PCR assay analytical and clinical testing which includes limit of detection, limit of blank, reactivity, cross-reactivity, interference, precision, carry-over / cross-contamination, multi-center reproducibility, and testing of prospectively collected and banked specimens. The instrument has six sets of excitation and emission channels available to induce and measure fluorescence at specified wavelengths. Only excitation and emission channels referred to as “red” “crimson” and “green” have been validated for in vitro diagnostic use.

2. Principles of Operation:

Samples tubes are provided in groups of connected tubes and caps. Capped and hand labeled tubes are placed into a position labeled ring shaped holder which fits onto a spindle inside the instrument. The inside of the instrument acts as a lowmass–forced air oven. Heating is achieved by a nickel-chrome element in the lid and the chamber is cooled by venting the air out through the top of the chamber while ambient air is blown up through the base. The RGQ rotary format employs a centrifugal process where samples spin continually at 400 rpm during a run. Centrifugation promotes thermal uniformity between samples, prevents condensation and removes air bubbles, but does not pellet DNA.

During centrifugation each tube passes by an optical excitation source and detection zone where a fluorescence signal is simultaneously excited and detected. Samples are excited from the bottom of the chamber by a light-emitting diode. Energy is transmitted through the thin walls at the base of the tube. Emitted fluorescence passes through emission filters on the side of the chamber and is then collected by a photomultiplier. There are six excitation sources and six detection filters which require no calibration or compensation. Each assay specified dye is compatible with only one set of excitation/emission filter pairs. The optical path length is fixed for all excitation wavelengths; this precludes the use of an internal reference dye.

# 3. Modes of Operation:

The RGQ software utilizes assay packages to control the in vitro diagnostic workflow. Selecting an assay specific locked analysis template switches the software to an assay specific mode. This forces the loading of a restricted graphical user interface (GUI), which removes access to menus, menu items, quick launch buttons, etc. that are not required for the assay specific workflow. The assay specific locked analysis template includes, as applicable to the individual assay, the required parameters for cycling, data acquisition, data analysis, quantitation standards, acceptance of controls, reporting, etc. The assay package also includes a report template that specifies the format of the assay report. Each in vitro diagnostic application using the RGQ will require at least one assay specific locked analysis template file.

The RGQ instrument is also capable of performing laboratory-defined (uservalidated) applications including high-resolution melting analysis, end-point thermal cycling, protein analysis, and enzyme kinetics. The FDA is not reviewing, clearing or approving any of the open-mode/laboratory-defined functionalities and requires documentation and evidence that these functionalities do not interfere with IVD functionalities.

# 4. Specimen Identification:

Samples are manually transferred into samples tubes; each tube has a cap with sufficient space to include a hand written unique identifier or barcode. Tubes are placed in a ring shaped holder that locks the caps in place and has uniquely identified locations. In the software, the user matches the unique sample ID with the holder location ID. The keyed ring containing the sample tubes is placed into the instrument and the run is started. If the lid is opened at anytime during a run, results are not reported.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen sampling and handling is performed manually following user laboratory SOPs and the artus $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Infl A/B RG RT-PCR user manual.

6. Calibration:

Optical Temperature Verification (OTV) is a method that verifies the in-tube temperature in the Rotor-Gene Q MDx. While it is not required for the RotorGene Q MDx, calibration of in-tube temperature can be a laboratory requirement. The OTV procedure provides a means for users to comply with potential site specific calibration interval requirements. OTV is performed using a Rotor-Disc $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ OTV Kit.

OTV uses the optical properties of three thermochromatic liquid crystals (TLC) as absolute temperature references. When heated, TLCs change from opaque to transparent at very precise temperatures $5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $7 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } $ ). TLCs are not inherently fluorescent; therefore, it is necessary to cover the excitation source with a fluorescent insert so that the TLC transition points can be detected by the Rotor-Gene Q MDx optical system. TLCs that are below their transition temperature are opaque and reflect light. A portion of the reflected light scatters towards the detector and is measured as an increase in fluorescence. When the intube temperature reaches the TLC transition point, the TLC becomes transparent, and light passes through the sample rather than being reflected toward the detector, resulting in a decrease in fluorescence. The change in fluorescence is used to determine the precise transition temperature of each TLC. The transition temperature is compared with the temperature reported by the factory calibration file for the OTV Rotor-Disc to verify whether the Rotor-Gene Q MDx is within temperature specification.

# Endurance testing

The endurance of the RGQ instrument was assessed by subjecting an instrument to repetitive simulated use were each use cycle consists of opening the lid, closing the lid, running a model PCR cycle, acquiring fluorescence data during the run (fluorescent beads are loaded in the tubes), opening the lid, closing the lid, and waiting five minutes to allow the instrument to cool. The cycle was repeated at least 2250 times, which is the estimated number of cycles expected in a five year period assuming 225 work days and two runs per day. The endurance testing was executed and successfully completed (VER-00000024).

Functional design verification testing demonstrated that the Rotor-Gene Q MDx design satisfies its design input requirements for the required ramp rate of $1 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / \mathrm { s }$ and $1 . 3 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / \mathrm { s }$ for thermal ramp-up and ramp-down rates respectively. The input requirement for temperature uniformity can not be measured in a specific test setup due to physical limitations. Thermal accuracy and uniformity will be validated during assay specific testing. The centrifuge speed was verified to meet the design input requirement of 400 RPM within the specified tolerance.
