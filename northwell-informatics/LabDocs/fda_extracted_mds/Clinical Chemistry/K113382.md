In the ACE γ-GT Reagent assay, γ-GT in serum catalyzes the transfer of the γ- glutamyl group from L-γ-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-nitroanilide to glycylglycine in the reagent. The product, 5-amino-2-nitrobenzoate, absorbs strongly at 408 nm. The rate</td><td>alanine and α-ketoglutarate substrates in the reagent to L-glutamate and pyruvate. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the reduced cofactor to the cofactor. The rate of conversion of the reduced cofactor to the cofactor can be determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance bichromatically at 340 nm/647 nm. This rate of conversion from the reduced cofactor to the cofactor is a function of the activity of ALT in the sample. In the ACE AST Reagent assay, aspartate aminotransferase in serum converts the L- aspartate and α-ketoglutarate in the reagent to oxalacetate and L-glutamate. The oxalacetate undergoes reduction with simultaneous oxidation of NADH to NAD+ in the malate dehydrogenase catalyzed indicator reaction. NADH absorbs strongly at 340 nm, whereas NAD+ does not. Therefore, the rate of conversion of NADH to NAD+ can be determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance bichromatically at 340 nm/647 nm. This rate of conversion from NADH to NAD* is a function of the activity of AST in the sample. Lactate dehydrogenase is added to prevent</td></tr><tr><td>Intended Use:</td><td>of increase in absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 408 nm/486 nm, is directly proportional to the γ-GT activity in the sample.
