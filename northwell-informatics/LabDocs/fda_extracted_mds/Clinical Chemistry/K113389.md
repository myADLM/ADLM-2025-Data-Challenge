The instrument accepts the physical patient samples, performs the appropriate optical or potentiometric measurements on those samples and communicates that data to an integral Panel PC. The Panel PC uses keyboard or touch screen input to manually enter a variety of data, control and accept data from the instrument, manage and maintain system information and generate reports relative to patient status and instrument performance. The Panel PC also allows remote download of patient requisitions and upload of patient results via a standard interface. In the ACE BUN/Urea Reagent assay, urea in serum is hydrolyzed to yield ammonia and carbon dioxide in the presence of urease. The ammonia formed then reacts with 2-oxoglutarate and NADH in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase to yield glutamate and NAD. Two moles of NADH are oxidized for each mole of urea present. NADH absorbs strongly at 340 nm, whereas NAD* does not. The initial rate of decrease in absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 340 nm/647 nm, is proportional to the urea concentration in the sample. In the ACE Creatinine Reagent assay, creatinine reacts with picric acid in an alkaline medium to form a red-orange colored complex, which absorbs strongly at 505 nm. The rate of complex formation, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at 505 nm/573 nm during a fixed time interval, is directly proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.</td></tr><tr><td>NADPH. NADPH strongly absorbs at 340 nm, whereas NADP* does not. Therefore, the rate of conversion of NADP* to NADPH can be determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance bichromatically</td><td>nm, is directly proportional to the uric acid concentration in the sample. In the ACE CK Reagent assay, serum creatine kinase initiates the conversion of creatine phosphate to creatine with the transfer of a phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), forming ATP. The ATP is then used in the phosphorylation of D-glucose to form D- glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. This reaction is catalyzed by hexokinase. The enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reduction of D-glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP†). The series of reactions triggered by serum creatine kinase and ending in the formation of</td></tr><tr><td>Intended Use:</td><td>Indications for Use: The ACE BUN/Urea Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration in serum using the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System.

For in vitro diagnostic use only. The ACE Creatinine Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of creatinine concentration in serum using the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System. Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other urine analytes.

System throughput will be higher when the test workload includes ISE's. The instrument has a capacity of 40 reagent containers on board. A reagent cooling system maintains the reagents at 12°C during instrument operation. Reagent containers are identified by computer coded labels to simplify system operation. All reagents in the system must include an identification label on the container. Sample and reagent sensing notify the operator of a depleted condition during operation. The system performs analysis at a reaction temperature of 37°C. An electrolyte subsystem capable of measuring sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations is included. Primary draw tubes may be introduced one at a time into the system for closed tube sampling. Positive tube identification can be achieved with an optional barcode scanner. An aliquot volume sufficient for all tests ordered is transferred and stored and the closed tube is returned to the user. Sample cups are introduced to the system one at a time or by sample ring segment.
