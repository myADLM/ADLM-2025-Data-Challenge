System throughput will be higher when the test workload includes ISE's. The instrument has a capacity of 40 reagent containers on board. A reagent cooling system maintains the reagents at 12°C during instrument operation. Reagent containers are identified by computer coded labels to simplify system operation. All reagents in the system must include an identification label on the container. Sample and reagent sensing notify the operator of a depleted condition during operation. The system performs analysis at a reaction temperature of 37°C. An electrolyte subsystem capable of measuring sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations is included. Primary draw tubes may be introduced one at a time into the system for closed tube sampling. Positive tube identification can be achieved with an optional barcode scanner. An aliquot volume sufficient for all tests ordered is transferred and stored and the closed tube is returned to the user. Sample cups are introduced to the system one at a time or by sample ring segment. Disposable cuvettes are loaded in bulk and then automatically injected as needed by a cuvette hiopper system. The ACE Axcel clinical chemistry optical system is capable of monitoring a maximum of 48 cuvettes at one time. The absorbance optical system is capable of absorbance measurements in a linear range of 0.0 to 2.0 absorbance units (at 0.67 cm pathlength). Sixteen wavelengths are measured simultaneously using a photodiode array.</td></tr><tr><td>Performance Data: at three separate POL sites, using the Alfa Wassermann ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System (y) and the Alfa Wassermann ACE Clinical Chemistry System (x), least-squares regression analysis yielded correlation coefficients of 0.9819 to 0.9952, standard error estimates of 0.80 to 1.21, confidence interval slopes of 0.951 to 1.081, and a confidence interval intercepts of -1.99 to 1.65.</td><td>Performance data for the Alfa Wassermann ACE Reagents run on the Alfa Wassermann ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System included precision, accuracy, and detection limit data.
