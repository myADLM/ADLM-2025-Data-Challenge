The rate of increase in absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 408 nm/486 nm, is directly proportional to the alkaline phosphatase activity in the sample. In the ACE AST Reagent assay, α-amylase hydrolyzes the 2-chloro-p- nitrophenyl-α-D-maltotrioside substrate to release 2-chloro-p- nitrophenol and form 2-chloro-p- nitrophenyl-α-D-maltoside, maltotriose and glucose.
