<table><tr><td colspan="2">K113438, page 86 Product Code CHI</td></tr><tr><td>Predicate Devices:</td><td>Manufacturer for analyzer/reagent system predicate: Alfa Wassermann ACE Clinical Chemistry System (K931786)</td></tr><tr><td>Device Descriptions:</td><td>ACE Reagents (K000781, K944911) The ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System consists of two major components, the chemistry instrument and an integrated Panel PC. The instrument accepts the physical patient samples, performs the appropriate optical or potentiometric measurements on those samples and communicates that data to an integral Panel PC. The Panel PC uses keyboard or touch screen input to manually enter a variety of data, control and accept data from the instrument, manage and maintain system information and generate reports relative to patient status and instrument performance. The Panel PC also allows remote download of</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">patient requisitions and upload of patient results via a standard interface.</td><td>In the ACE Direct Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC) Reagent assay, Direct TIBC Color Reagent, an acidic buffer containing an iron-binding dye and ferric chloride, is added to the serum sample. The low pH of Direct TIBC Color Reagent releases iron from transferrin. The iron then forms a colored complex with the dye. The colored complex at the end of the first step represents both the serum iron and excess iron already present in Direct TIBC Color Reagent. Direct TIBC Buffer, a neutral buffer, is then added, shifting the pH and resulting in a large increase in the affinity of transferrin for iron. The serum transferrin rapidly binds the iron by abstracting it from the dye-iron complex. The observed decrease in absorbance of the colored dye-iron complex is</td></tr><tr><td>directly proportional to the total iron-binding capacity of the serum sample. The absorbance is measured at 647 nm. In the ACE Serum Iron Reagent assay, transferrin-bound iron in serum is released at an acidic pH and reduced from ferric to ferrous ions. These ions react with ferrozine to form a violet colored complex, which is measured bichromatically at 554 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the serum iron concentration.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>In the ACE Lipase Reagent Assay, serum lipase acts on a natural substrate, 1,2-diglyceride, to liberate 2-monoglyceride. This is hydrolyzed by monoglyceride lipase (a highly specific enzyme for monoglyceride) into glycerol and free fatty acid. Glycerol kinase acts on glycerol to form glycerol-3-phosphate, which is in turn acted on by glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide. Peroxidase converts the hydrogen peroxide, 4-Aminoantipyrine and TOOS (N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-m-toluidine) into a quinine dye. The rate of formation of the dye, determined</td></tr><tr><td>Intended Use:</td><td>bichromatically at an absorbance of 573 nm/692 nm, is proportional to the lipase activity in the sample.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Indications for Use: The ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System is an automated, discrete, bench-top, random access analyzer that is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of constituents in blood and other fluids.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4"></td><td>The ACE TIBC Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of total iron-binding capacity in serum using the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System.

An electrolyte subsystem capable of measuring sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations is included. Primary draw tubes may be introduced one at a time into the system for closed tube sampling. Positive tube identification can be achieved with an optional barcode scanner. An aliquot volume sufficient for all tests ordered is transferred and stored and the closed tube is returned to the user. Sample cups are introduced to the system one at a time or by sample ring segment. Disposable cuvettes are loaded in bulk and then automatically injected as needed by a cuvette hopper system. The ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System optical system is capable of monitoring a maximum of 48 cuvettes at one time. The absorbance optical system is capable of absorbance measurements in a linear range of 0.0 to 2.0 absorbance units (at 0.67 cm pathlength).
