# Value Assignment

VIT D Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kits are manufactured such that a linear relationship exists among Levels 1 through 5 and to provide an equal distance between Levels 1 to 5; Level 1 being the lowest concentration and Level 5 being the highest. A base matrix containing an analyte value of zero is also provided with the kit. The base matrix can be used to make dilutions of Level 1 to obtain a result lower than Level 1, if needed. The dilution scheme is achieved by calculating the delta between two consecutive levels (2, 3) and applying it to subsequent levels. Additionally, using recovered values for Levels 1 and 5 using a percentage calculation can give the required levels (CLSI EP06 Appendix A).

Target values for the linearity set were determined using the 25- Hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) assay on the DiaSorin Liaison analyzer. Actual recovered values were used to calculate target values for each level of the linearity set using a linear regression technique. Appropriate equal distance values were entered as the $\mathbf { \check { x } } ^ { \prime }$ values and recovered values from the levels were used as ‘y’ values to calculate a regression equation. The resulting ‘y’ values were used as target values for each of the five levels. Expected target values may change depending on instrumentation, methodology, and assay temperature. Typical value ranges are provided in the package insert. Typical value ranges for each level of the linearity set are summarized in the table below.

Stability

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Closed vial stability of the VALIDATE VIT D Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit was determined using real-time open vial studies as a worst case scenario and is on-going. The sponsor recommended storage temperature is -10 to $- 2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .
