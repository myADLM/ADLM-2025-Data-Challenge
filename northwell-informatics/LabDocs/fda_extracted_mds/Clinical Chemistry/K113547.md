Dear Dr. MacFarlane,

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

# Indications for Use Statement

510(k) Number (if known): k1 13547

Device Name: GAL-1E Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indications for Use:

The GAL-1E Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm, or palm. Alternative site testing should be performed only during steady-state (when glucose is not changing rapidly). Testing is doneoutside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated or ay use by people with diabetes, as an aid to monitoring levels in Diabetes Mellitus and should only be used by a single patient and it should not be shared. It is not indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.

The GAL-1E Blood Glucose Test Strips are to be used with the GAL-1E Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in capillary whole blood taken from fingertips, palm, or forearm. Alternative site testing should be performed only during steady-state (when glucose is not changing rapidly). They are not indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.
