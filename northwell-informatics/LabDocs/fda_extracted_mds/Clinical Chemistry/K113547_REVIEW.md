# L. Test Principle:

The GAL-1E and GAL-1E Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzyme assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an amperometric measurement device using current generated for the redox reaction as the measureable response.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The GAL-1E and GAL-1E Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are identical meters. The differences between these meters are that they are marketed under

different trade names and also differ in their intended use population (single-patient use vs. multiple-patient use.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision previously reviewed in the GAL-1C submission (k102816).

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity study was designed following CLSI EP6-A guideline. Venous whole blood was used for this study. Eight target glucose concentrations were prepared by either spiking glucose stock solution into the sample or by allowing the sample to undergo glycolysis to achieve the following levels:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose range(mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15-20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35- 60</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>70-85</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>115 - 150</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>195-230</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>290 - 330</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>400 - 450</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>600 - 620</td></tr></table>

A total of 40 strips per lot (3 lots total) were used at each glucose concentration using 10 GAL-1E meters. All samples were also tested on a YSI analyzer to generate the expected values. The observed values were plotted against an average of the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was generated with results summarized below:

System accuracy study:

This study was conducted using samples collected from 158 participants. Samples containing $< 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of glucose were allowed to glycolyze and to obtain sample values ${ \mathrm { > } } 4 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , samples were spiked with a glucose stock solution. The range of samples tested was $3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $5 0 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (according to YSI) collected by fingertip. Nine (9) GAL-1E meters and three (3) lots of GAL-1E test strips were used. Results obtained by the trained professional were compared to YSI. The glucose meter measurements obtained using the GAL-1E BGMS were compared to the YSI method for fingerstick, palm, and forearm samples. The results are shown in the following tables:

# GAL-1E Blood Glucose Meter

The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach (EPA Registration # 56392-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter and lancing device after 1,825 cleanings and 1,825 disinfection steps with the Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# GAL-1E Multi Blood Glucose Meter

The device system is intended for use in multiple patients with use of a single use, auto-disabling lancet device. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach (EPA Registration # 56392-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter and lancing device after 10,950 cleanings and 10,950 disinfection steps with the Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

7. Readability: The readability of the labeling (user guides, test strip package insert and control solution package insert) was previously reviewed the GAL-1C (k102816) submission using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis and were found to be written at the ${ 8 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade level. The labeling of the candidate meters (GAL-1E and GAL-1E multi) are identical to the GAL-1C meter.

8. LO/HI Detection:

The low and high detection limits were evaluated to ensure that glucose values $< 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ are reported by the meter as “LO” and values ${ > } 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ are reported as “HI”.

9. Drop Test:

In this study, twenty five (25) GAL-1E meters were dropped from a height of 1 meter onto a concrete floor. Each meter was dropped (without a test strip) on all 6 sides, two times per side, and additionally (with a test strip), dropped on the strip holder side two times. All meters did not break throughout the drop test study, maintained functionality after being dropped, and provided accurate glucose control readings (Contrex Plus III level 1) $8 5 - 1 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .
