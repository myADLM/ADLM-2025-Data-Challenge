# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification OIVD Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)

To: THE FILE

RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER: k113670

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable (delete/add items as necessary) for the Element Blood Glucose Monitoring System:

1. The name and 510(k) number of SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device: Infopia Co., LTD, Element Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System, cleared under k103021.

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials. (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

# This change was for:

Change the battery type from Alkaline AAA batteries to $3 . 0 \lor$ lithium DR2032 batteries   
Design of the bottom cover of the meter has changed slightly due to the change in battery   
Removal of the voice function   
Location of the display icons were changed   
Change in physical dimensions of the meter from 82Lx54Wx24H to 82Lx54Wx18H   
Change in weight of the meter from 69 g to $4 8 { \mathfrak { g } }$ (battery included)   
Change in the name from “Element plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System” to “Element   
Blood Glucose Monitoring System”

4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.   
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied   
c) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity should include: A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.

6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for Use Enclosure (and Class III Summary for Class III devices).

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrates that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their pre amendment) device.

The device is intended for single-patient use only. CaviWipes (EPA registration #46781-8) were validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the modified meter and lancing device after 1,095 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate one cycle a day, over 3 years of single-patient use. The labeling has been revised for adequate instructions on the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
