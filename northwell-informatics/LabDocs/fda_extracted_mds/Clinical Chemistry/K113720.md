# Device Name

Trade Name: Randox Maternal Controls Levels 1, 2 and 3

Common Name: Maternal Controls Levels 1, 2 and 3

Classification: Multianalyte Controls, All kinds (Assayed and Unassayed)

Product Code: JJY

Predicate Devices

Bio-Rad Lyphochek Maternal Serum Controls Levels 1, 2 and 3

# Device Description

Randox Maternal Controls are manufactured at three levels, Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. The analyte concentrations in each of the three levels have been chosen to span a range that includes the chemically significant or medical decision level(s). The analyte concentrations have been reviewed by a panel of experts to ensure that the concentrations are clinically relevant for use in routine hospital laboratories.

# Intended Use

The Randox Maternal Controls Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 are intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quality control of Unconjugtaed Estriol and Total BHuman Chorionic Gonadotrophin methods on clinical chemistry systems.

# Similarity to Predicate Device

Both are assayed quality control serums.   
Both are intended to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analytes named in the product insert.   
Both are in vitro diagnostic devices.   
Both devices are in lyophilised format and manufactured from human serum.

# Stability

Accelerated stress tests have been used to predict shelf life for controls stored routinely at $+ 2 - + 8 ^ { \circ } C$ . A control stored at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ for 1 week is tested against the control stored at routine temperature and recovery assessed. If a percentage deviation between stressed and routine is below $10 \%$ then a 1 year shelf life would be assigned to the control. For every week stressed at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ that passed these criteria then 1 year shelf life would be added.

i.e. Controls stored for 3 weeks at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ which passed criteria would be given 3 years of shelf life.

# Conclusion

Testing results indicate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Dr. Armstrong:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
