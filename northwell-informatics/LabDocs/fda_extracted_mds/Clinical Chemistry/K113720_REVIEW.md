# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indication(s) for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Randox Maternal Controls Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 are intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quality control of Unconjugated Estriol and Total $\beta$ -Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin methods on clinical chemistry systems.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For in vitro diagnostic use For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Values are listed in the package insert for several analyzers

# I. Device Description:

Randox Maternal Controls are manufactured at three levels, Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. The analyte concentrations in each of the three levels have been chosen to span a range that includes the chemically significant or medical decision level(s) for each analyte (Free Estriol and Total $\beta$ -Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin [Beta hCG]). The analyte concentrations are clinically relevant for use in routine hospital laboratories.

Human source material from which this product has been derived and has been tested at the donor level for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV1 & HIV2) antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen $\left( { \mathrm { H b s A g } } \right)$ and the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and were found to be non-reactive based on FDA approved methods.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability

The analytes contained in the Randox Maternal Controls were obtained from commercially available standards.

# Stability

Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. Closed vial (shelf-life) stability at the recommended storage temperature of (2 to 8 $^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } $ ) was demonstrated based on accelerated stability. Closed vials are stable until the date printed on individual vials. Real-time closed vial stability studies are on-going. For open-vial stability, the sponsor demonstrated that reconstituted serum is stable for 7 days at the recommended storage temperature of 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . All storage recommendations are provided in the labeling.

# Value Assignment

Value assignment was determined for each analyte contained in the Randox Maternal Controls using multiple analyzer platforms and replicate analysis of samples by external clinical laboratories and internal testing conducted at Randox Laboratories Ltd.

Value assignment data were collated and an appropriate target value was assigned to each analyte based on the average of the observed values. Ranges were then assigned depending on the analyte. The labeling states that obtained values should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific value sheets and that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable
