# 5.3 Description of the New Device

The epoc Chloride and Creatinine tests are being added as additional sensors to the existing single use test card that is used with the epoc Blood Analysis System. This test card is inserted into the epoc Reader and all analytical steps are performed automatically. Patient and user information may be entered into the mobile computing device (epoc Host) during the automated analysis cycle.

The epoc Blood Analysis System is an in vitro analytical system comprising a network of one or more epoc Readers designed to be used at the point of care (POC). The readers accept an epoc single use test card containing a group of sensors that perform diagnostic testing on whole blood. The blood test results are transmitted wirelessly to an epoc Host, which displays and stores the test results. The epoc System is intended for use by trained medical professionals as an in vitro diagnostic device for the quantitative testing of samples of whole blood.

The test card panel configuration currently includes sensors for Sodium Na, Potassium $\mathsf { K } ,$ Ionized Calcium iCa, pH, $p C O _ { 2 } ,$ $p 0 _ { 2 } ,$ Lactate, Glucose and Hematocrit Hct. This submission adds Chloride and Creatinine to this list of approved tests. To perform a blood test, a new test card is inserted into a card reader's card slot with white label face down. When fully inserted, the test card is automatically engaged in the reader.

The card insertion process:

Brings the cards sensor module into contact with the reader's electrical contact array;   
Brings the card's measurement region, which is the fluidic channel above the sensor array, into thermal contact with the reader's heater assembly for heating the measurement region to $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$   
Actuates the opening of the fluidic valve in the card and causes delivery of calibrator fluid from the reservoir to the measurement region.

After calibration, and upon a prompt by the reader (LED visual and audio beep), the user introduces a blood sample for measurement through the blood sample port to the card's measurement region. When sensors are contacted by the blood sample they generate electrical signals proportional to analyte concentrations in the blood sample, which are transmitted wirelessly by the Reader to the epoc Host. The epoc Host displays and stores the blood test results.

The epoc Host will also display calculated values based on the new analytes:

Anion Gap: $\mathsf { A G a p } = ( \mathsf { N a } + ) \cdot ( \mathsf { C l } - + \mathsf { c H C O 3 } - )$

Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (IDMS-traceable MDRD type): $\mathbf { e G F R } \ = \ \mathbf { 1 7 5 } \ \times$ (Crea-1.154) $\pmb { \times }$ (Age-0.203) $\pmb { \times }$ (0.742 if female, 1 if male)

Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, if African American (IDMStraceable MDRD type):   
eGFR- $\textsf { a } = 1 7 5 \textsf { x }$ (Crea-1.154) $\pmb { \times }$ (Age-0.203) $\pmb { \times }$ (0.742 if female, 1 if male) x 1.212

Crea concentration is in units of $\max / \min$ Age and gender $\because M ^ { \prime \prime }$ or $" { \mathsf { F } } ^ { \prime \prime } .$ ) are user inputs. eGFR, eGFR-a are both reported on the epoc System. eGFR, eGFR-a values are not reported if age is less that 18 years old or greater than 70 years old.

Numeric values will be reported for values between 2-60 $\mathsf { m L } / \mathsf { m i n } / 1 . 7 3 \ m ^ { 2 }$ Values $\tt { > } 6 0$ will be reported as $> 6 0 ~ \mathsf { m L } / \mathsf { m i n } / 1 . 7 3$ $m ^ { 2 }$ . This range is based on the specific National Kidney Disease

Education Program (NKDEP) recommendation for reporting eGFR values. Please refer to the following web link: http://nkdep.nih.gov/lab-evaluation/gfr/reporting.shtml.

The following additional statement appears in our labeling: eGFR $>$ 60 does not exclude the possibility of mild renal disease. Further laboratory testing may be necessary to distinguish normal renal function from mild renal disease.

Addition of the epoc Chloride and Creatinine tests comprises three (3) changes to the epoc System:

1. Addition of the new sensors on the test card (described below); 2. Modification of the epoc System software application to accommodate the new tests (refer to Section 16 - Software); 3. Labeling changes including indications for use (refer to Section 04 - Indications for Use Statements and Section 13 - Proposed Labeling and Packaging).

This data supports the claimed reportable ranges of $6 5 { - } 1 4 0 \ m M$ for Chloride and 0.3 $\mathbf { - 1 5 . 0 0 \ m g / d L }$ for Creatinine.

# 5.5.3 Traceability

Chloride ion concentration values assigned to controls and calibrator fluids are traceable to NIST standards.

Creatinine concentration values assigned to controls and calibrator fluids are traceable to NIST standard SRM 967. The epoc Creatinine test is calibrated to an IDMS-traceable whole blood method and reports plasma equivalent concentrations.

# 5.5.4 Detection Limit

This study was performed in-house as per CLSI EP6-A recommendations for evaluation limits of detection and quantification. The low end of the reportable range for the epoc chloride test $( 6 5 ~ \mathsf { m M } )$ and the epoc creatinine test $( 0 . 3 0 \ m g / \mathrm { d L } )$ are greater than or equal to the limit of detection and are statistically discernable from the limit of blank.

# 5.5.5 Analytical Specificity

Interference testing based on CLSI "Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline", CLSI document EP7-A2. was performed in-house on the epoc chloride and creatinine sensors. In each of these tests a pooled human serum was aliquoted into two (2) samples. The test sample was spiked by addition of interferent, while the control sample was spiked by the addition of the solvent of the interferent. The bias between the mean of six replicates on both the control sample and the test sample with added interferent was calculated. The concentration of interfering substance considered as causing no clinically significant interference is defined as a bias (difference between the test and the control sample) of:

$\mathsf { \leq 0 . 2 \ m g / d L }$ for creatinine concentrations ≤2 mg/dL and $\leq 7 . 9 \%$ for creatinine concentrations $^ { > 2 }$ mg/dL;

$\leq 4 . 2 \%$ for chloride concentrations $\leq 1 2 5 \ m M$ and $5 5 . 2 \%$ for chloride concentrations $> 1 2 5 \ m M$ .
