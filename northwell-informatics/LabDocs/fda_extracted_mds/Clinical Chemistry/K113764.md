# II. Description of the new device

Glucose Meter-Check Solution for Infopia is a buffered aqueous solution with glucose containing no ingredients of biological origin, or in concentrations qualifying as a controlled product under the Controlled Products Regulation. The Glucose Meter-Check Solution is formulated for optimal performance on Infopia glucose meters using Infopia test strips.

)Intended use of the device

Glucose Meter-Check Solution for Infopia is intended for use to verify the performance and correct operation of Infopia blood glucose monitoring test systems utilizing the Element family of blood glucose test strips. Glucose Meter-Check Solution for Infopia is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home.

)Technological characteristcs of the device.

This material consists of viscosity-adjusted, aqueous glucose control solution prepared with a single concentration of D-glucose with recovery on the test systems in the range corresponding to Interval 2 of the glucose contration intervals for evalution of intermediate precision in ISO $1 5 1 9 7 ^ { 2 }$ (96 to $1 4 4 m g / \mathrm { d L } )$ . This solution has been optimized to simulate the response of whole blood on the blood glucose test systems manufactured by Infopia using Infopia blood glucose test strips. The solution contains no hazardous, human or animal derived components.

(Summary of non-clinical tests submitt with the premarket notiication for he devce.

# TPLC disclaimers

We are continuing to improve and enhance the TPLC Universe and the TPLC sheets. When more data is available we will update this message.

Please realize that in this initial release:

Recall data is only available since October, 2009.   
In the Premarket Under Review section and the Recall section, the premarket submission or recall is only included if the product code is specified in CTS. The MDR count is a count of reports and contains duplicate reports.   
MDR track action or additional information letters is not available yet.   
EIR data related to inspections is not yet displayed.   
The TPLC name which consolidates variations on manufacturer names is not yet implemented.   
Publications are not yet linked in.

We are working hard to address these issues and many can be addressed before the next release.

Dear Mr. Byrd:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf k )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title , Codeof Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with allthe Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
