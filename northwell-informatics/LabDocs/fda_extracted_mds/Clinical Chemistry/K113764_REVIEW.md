# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable. c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The Glucose Meter-Check $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Solution for Infopia is made of an in house glucose material. The glucose used on this preparation is traceable to SRM 917 via measurement by YSI 2300 calibrated with solutions provided by YSI traceable to SRM 917.

# Control Value Assignment

For the Glucose Meter-Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Solution for Infopia, the analytical values for each production lot of material are confirmed by comparison of new production lots of material to the Reference Lot of product with the same formulation in parallel measurement on the YSI 2300 reference method in order to maintain lot‐to‐lot variability within close tolerances.

# Stability

Real time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.

The claimed Control stability is 24 months at $2 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for unopened vials and at 3 months for open vials when stored at $2 { - } 3 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:
