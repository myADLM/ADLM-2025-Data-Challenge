# Device description

# Assay:

The Homocysteine Enzymatic Assay is based on an enzyme cycling assay principle that assesses the co-substrate conversion product. In this assay, oxidized homocysteine (Hcy) is first reduced to free Hcy which then reacts with a co-substrate, S-adenosylmethionine, to form methionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), catalyzed by a Hcy Smethyltransferase. SAH is assessed by coupled enzyme reactions where SAH is hydrolyzed into adenosine (Ado) and Hcy by SAH hydrolase, and Hcy is cycled into the Hcy conversion reaction to form a reaction cycle that amplifies the detection signal. The formed Ado is immediately hydrolyzed into inosine and ammonia which reacts with glutamate dehydrogenase with concomitant conversions of NADH to $\bar { \mathsf { N A D } } ^ { + }$ .The concentration of Hcy in the sample is indirectly proportional to the amount of NADH converted to NAD\* which is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .

# Calibrator:

The Homocysteine Calibrator Kit is a liquid, ready-for-use calibrator based on human serum. It is a single level calibrator with lot specific values and diluted on board the analyzer to create a 5-point calibration curve.

# Control:

The Homocysteine Control Kit consists of two ready-for-use controls based on human serum. The adjusted concentrations of the control components are in the low range for Control I and in the elevated range for Control 2.

Dear Ms. Hollandbeck:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
