For prescription use only.

The labeling contains a prominent black-box warning:

Specimens from patients who are on drug therapy involving S-adenosyl-Lmethionine may show falsely elevated levels of homocysteine. Patients who are taking methotrexate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, anticonvulsants and 6- azuridine triacetate may have elevated levels of homocysteine due to their effect on the metabolic pathway.

4. Special instrument requirements:

Performance studies were conducted on Roche/Hitachi cobas c501 system

# I. Device Description:

The Homocysteine Enzymatic Assay is based on an enzyme cycling assay principle that assesses the co-substrate conversion product, NAD, which is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The reagent contains three bottles

with the following ingredients:

R1 NADH reagent: S-adenosylmethionine, TCEP, 2-oxoglutarate, NADH   
R2 Enzyme reagent: homocysteine S-methyltransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, casein (bovine)   
R3 Start reagent: adenosine deaminase (bovine), S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase, casein (bovine).

The Homocysteine Calibrator Kit is a liquid, ready-for-use calibrator based on human serum. It is a single level calibrator with lot specific values and diluted on board the analyzer to create a 5-point calibration curve.

The Homocysteine Control Kit consists of two ready-for-use controls based on human serum. The adjusted concentrations of the control components are in the low range for Control 1 and in the elevated range for Control 2.

The labeling states that all products prepared from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be free from HbsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods were FDA approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A.

# L. Test Principle:

Homocysteine Enzymatic Assay is based on a novel enzyme cycling assay principle that assesses the co-substrate conversion product instead of assessing co-substrate or

Hcy conversion products of Hcy. In this assay, oxidized Hcy is first reduced to free Hcy which then reacts with a co-substrate, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), to form methionine (Met) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), catalyzed by a Hcy Smethyltransferase. SAH is assessed by coupled enzyme reactions where SAH is hydrolyzed into adenosine (Ado) and Hcy by SAH hydrolase, and Hcy is cycled into the Hcy conversion reaction to form a reaction cycle that amplifies the detection signal. The formed Ado is immediately hydrolyzed into inosine and ammonia which reacts with glutamate dehydrogenase with concomitant conversions of NADH to $\mathrm { N A D + }$ . The concentration of Hcy in the sample is indirectly proportional to the amount of NADH converted to NAD+ (ΔA340nm).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within run and between-run precision studies were performed following the CLSI guideline EP5-A2 for 21 days, two runs per day on the same cobas c 501 analyzer. Two aliquots per each human sera pools (HSP), (2 diluted, 1 native, and 2 spiked) samples and controls together with one reagent lot, one lot of calibrator were used in the study. The results are shown in the table below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed in-house using blood samples as per CLSI EP6-A recommendations for evaluation of linearity. A dilution series consisting of 11 dilutions was prepared separately using a spiked, high analyte human serum pool and a high analyte, human plasma pool in parallel to produce samples with values ranging from 2.78 to $5 0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ .

Homocysteine levels were measured in triplicate for each sample using cobas c 501 analyzer, and the recovered median values were compared to the theoretical values. The linear regression analysis of the study is shown below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R^{}$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0054</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.2478</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9995</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0214</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.7411</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9995</td></tr></table>

The results fulfilled the specifications for the linearity claims of 3 to 50 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ .

The extended measuring range using automated rerun with dilution was validated by performing an experiment comparing the instrument auto-rerun results with a simple manual dilution. The test results showed the difference between the automated dilution and the manual dilution is within the acceptance criteria of $+ / - 1 0 \%$ recovery.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

This method has been standardized against NIST SRM 1955 reference material. The target values for calibrator and controls are traceable to the NIST SRM 1955 reference material.

# Stability

i) Reagent stability Shelf (real-time) Stability: 14 months On-Board stability: 4 weeks after dilution   
ii) Calibrator stability Closed-Vial Stability: 15 months at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ Open-Vial Stability: 2 hours at $1 5 . 2 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ or 28 days at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$   
iii) Controls stability Open-Vial Stability: 2 hours at $1 5 . 2 5 ~ ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ or 28 days at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ Close-Vial Stability: 15 months at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$

d. Detection limit:

The study was performed in-house as per CLSI EP17-A recommendations for evaluation limits of detection and quantification.

LoB was determined by measuring an analyte-free sample with 3 reagent lots,

5 determinations each on 2 cobas c 501 analyzers, total 6 runs $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 6 0 )$ ) over 3 days. Data analysis was based on determination of the 95th percentile of the 60 measured values. LoD was calculated based on $\mathrm { L o D { = } L o B + 1 } . 6 5 3 \mathrm { X }$ $\mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { t o t a l } }$ .

The results are LoB: $0 . 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ ; LoD: $0 . 7 2 \mu \mathrm { M }$ . The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is $3 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } }$ to $5 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing based on CLSI “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline”, CLSI document EP7-A2. Significant interference was considered present by the sponsor if the $\%$ recovery exceeded $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected $100 \%$ recovery.

i) Exogenous interferences:

Individual drug was added to two separate patient sample pools with low or high homocysteine concentrations and examined for potential effect on homocysteine determination by the Homocysteine Enzymatic test system. No significant interference was found for the following drugs:

Acetylcysteine, Ampicillin-Na, Ascorbic acid, Ca- Dobesilate, Cyclosporine, Cefoxitin, Heparin, Intralipid, Levodopa, Methyldopa, Metronidazole, Phenylbutazone, Doxycycline, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Rifampicin, Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Theophylline, Cystathionine, Pyruvate, Glutathione, S-adenosylmethoinine, H-hydroxylamine HCl and glycerol.

Physiological concentration (Sub-uM range) of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) have no significant interference on this assay, however, SAH has a significant positive interference at high pharmacological doses.

Samples containing 3-deazaadenosine should not be used since it is known to inhibit one of the key enzymes used in the assay.

ii) The effects of endogenous interference on the quantitation of homocysteine by the Homocysteine Enzymatic test system were determined on the cobas c 501 analyzer at two Homocysteine levels. The study showed:

Icterus: No significant interference up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ unconjugated Bilirubin.

Hemolysis: No significant interference up to $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ hemoglobin Triglyceride: No significant interference up to $1 7 9 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ triglyceride iii) Protein interference was investigated using two human serum pools at homocysteine concentration of 12.6 and $4 1 . 3 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ , respectively. Each pool was used to create a dilution series of 10 test levels of protein spanning between 13 to $1 2 8 . 9 \ : \mathrm { g / L }$ . The results showed no interference by total protein up to $1 2 8 . 9 \ : \mathrm { g / L }$ .
