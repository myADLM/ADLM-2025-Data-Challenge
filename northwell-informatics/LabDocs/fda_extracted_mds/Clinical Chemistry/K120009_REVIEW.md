# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone immunoassay is based on a competitive test principle with anti-testosterone (sheep, monoclonal) coated paramagnetic microparticles and chemiluminescence detection. In the first step, sample, assay specific diluent and anti-testosterone (sheep, monoclonal) coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. Testosterone present in the sample binds to the anti-testosterone coated microparticles. After incubation, testosterone acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to the reaction mixture. After further incubation and washing, Pre-Trigger and Trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). The concentration of testosterone is interpolated from a calibration curve established with calibrators of known testosterone concentration.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were performed following CLSI EP6-A guideline. Three samples were diluted to produce 3 sets of 9 evenly distributed sample pools covering assay measuring range of 4.33 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The linearity samples were tested with a minimum of 2 replicates on two $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instruments over the range of 3.82 to $1 8 6 2 . 2 7 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The measured vs. expected linear regression analysis generated a linear regression as follows: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 1 2$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 8$ .

The data support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range for the device is 4.33 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

Calibrators: Abbott manufactures Testosterone internal standards (primary calibrators) gravimetrically using USP Testosterone at each concentration level. The Testosterone calibrators (market calibrators) are manufactured and tested against these internal standards.

Primary Testosterone Calibrators are prepared in a phosphate buffer synthetic matrix containing Sodium Chloride, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and an antimicrobial agent. Calibrators are prepared gravimetrically to target 0, 2.88, 5.77, 46.14, 360.50, and $8 6 5 . 2 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ Analyte containing calibrators are prepared with a $1 1 5 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ $\mathrm { 4 0 n m o l / L }$ ) Testosterone stock solution.

Market versions of the Testosterone Calibrators are prepared the same way as the Primary testosterone Calibrators. Each of the Market Calibrators is prepared with testosterone stock solution and 2nd Generation Testosterone Calibrator/Control Diluent to target concentrations 0, 2.88, 5.77, 46.14, 360.50, and $8 6 5 . 2 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ (0, 0.1, 0.2, 1.6, 12.5, and $3 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L } $ .

Controls: Primary controls are prepared in a phosphate buffer synthetic matrix containing sodium chloride, BSA and an antimicrobial agent. Controls are prepared gravimetrically to target 8.7, 57.7, and $2 0 1 . 9 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ (0.3, 2.0, and 7.0 nmol/L). Analyte containing controls are prepared with a $1 1 5 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ (40 nmol/L) Testosterone stock solution.

Market versions of the Testosterone Controls are prepared the same way as the Primary testosterone Controls. Each of the Market Controls is prepared with testosterone stock solution and 2nd Generation Testosterone Calibrator/Control Diluent to target to target 8.7, 57.7, and $2 0 1 . 9 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ (0.3, 2.0, and $7 . 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ )

Value assignment: The concentrations of each Market Testosterone Calibrator are determined by comparison of the relative light unit (RLU) values against the corresponding Primary Testosterone Calibrators using the ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone $i$ System. The Market Calibrator is compared to the corresponding Primary Calibrator using a sample/reference ratio of the grand mean RLU results. The concentrations are adjusted, if necessary, by adding either testosterone stock solution or Calibrator A until they match the Primary Calibrator concentrations within the specification limits.

Value assignment for the Market Testosterone Controls follow the same procedure as for Market Testosterone Calibrators, please see above.

Stability: The sponsor provided the stability study protocol for reagent, calibrators and controls. The protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate. The real time stability studies are on going. The sponsor claims shelf-life and open-vial stability 12 months for calibrators, 11 months for controls. The on board stability for the reagent is claimed to be 9 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A guideline.

The zero-level samples (for determination of the LoB) and the low-level samples (for determination of the LoD) were tested with a minimum of 2 replicates for the zero-level samples and 1 replicate for the low-level samples in 5 separate runs over a minimum of 3 days. Testing was performed on 2 ARCHITECT i 2000SR instruments using 2 lots of ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone Reagents, 2 lots of ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone Calibrators and 1 lot of Controls. Samples on both instruments were tested with both reagent lots. The LoB was determined to be $1 . 7 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ $( 0 . 0 6 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ and the LoD was determined to be $2 . 6 7 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ . The LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that meets an interassay imprecision of $< 2 0 \%$ . The LoQ was observed to be $4 . 3 3 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ with an inter-assay CV of $1 5 . 6 \%$ .

The claimed measuring range of the device is 4.33 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Potential interference was evaluated following CLSI EP7-A2 guidance.

Test samples were prepared by spiking each compound at the concentration level listed in the tables into a serum sample with each level of testosterone (201.9 and $7 0 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } ) }$ . Reference samples were prepared by adding solvent that was used to prepare the compound stocks to a serum sample of each of the two levels of testosterone (201.9 and $7 0 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ ). Spiked samples and reference samples were tested in a minimum of 12 replicates on one $i 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { s R }$ instrument using one lot each of ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone Reagents, Calibrators, and Controls.

Results of the spiked samples were compared with the reference samples and $\%$ recovery was calculated. Non-significant interference was defined as recovery of $< \pm 1 0 \%$ of control value, Based on the data the sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and concentrations listed below.

Therefore, these compounds were included in the package insert,

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:

“Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Specimens containing HAMA may produce anomalous values when tested with assay kits such as ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone.”

“A strong interaction with D-Norgestrel ( $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 n g / m l ) }$ , 19-nortestosterone (Nandrolone), Ethisterone, 11b-Hydroxytestosterone, and 11-Ketotestosterone was found. Do not use samples from patients receiving these compounds.”

“Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous results may be observed. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.”

# b. Matrix comparison:

The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study using 54 sample sets. Each sample set consisted of a control tube type (Plastic serum tube) and at least one of the blood collection tubes (Glass serum tube, Plastic serum separator tube, Plastic serum separator II Advance tube and Plastic dipotassium EDTA tube) collected from one donor during one draw. Samples ranging from 14.61 to $1 4 3 0 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ were analyzed on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0$ system. The samples collected in control (Plastic/Serum) tube $\mathbf { \rho } ( \mathbf { x } )$ were compared to the sample from one of the paired comparator tubes (y) and the Passing/Bablok regression analysis results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tube type/Anticoagulant</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Regression Analysis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glass/Serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y = 1.01x - 0.01       $r2}=0.999</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plastic/Serum Separator</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y = 0.98x - 0.01       $r{2}=0.998</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plastic/Serum Separator II Advance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y = 0.98x + 0.01       $r{2}=0.99</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plastic/Dipotassium EDTA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y= 1.05x -0.01       $r{2}=0.998</td></tr></table>

The sponsor claimed that serum (including serum collected in serum separator tubes) and plasma $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA) are acceptable collection tubes for use with the Architect $2 ^ { \mathrm { { \bar { n } d } } }$ Generation Testosterone assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected ranges for the ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone assay were obtained from testing a minimum of 120 samples from apparently healthy individuals in the following categories: normal males, 21-49 years of age with an intact reproductive system, and normal females 21-49 years of age. Additional samples were tested from apparently healthy males and females $( > 5 0$ years of age). The data are summarized in the table below.
