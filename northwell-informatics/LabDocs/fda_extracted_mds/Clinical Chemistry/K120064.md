4Device Description

PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of:

(1) Glucose Meter   
(2)Glucose Test Strips   
(3)Two levels of glucose control solutions (Level I and Level II) may be purchased separately. Glucose control solutions were previously cleared under K032985.   
(4) Check Strip   
(5)Instruction for use

[Test Principle]

PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an electrochemical biosensor system that measures the amount of electric current produced then displays the result as a blood glucose level on the LCD monitor. When the blood is drawn into the blood reaction zone of the test strip, the glucose in the blood sample mixes with a special chemical in the test strip, which produces a small electric current. The reaction current is proportional to the amount of glucose in the blood. The result is displayed on the LCD monitor and automatically stored in the meter for future use.

# [Control Solution]

The PRECICHEK Glucose control solution is intended for in vitro diagnostic use (i.e. for external use only) assessing the performance of the PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose monitoring system and PRECICHEK ACH Blood Glucose Test strips. There are two levels of controls (Levels 1,2).

[Check Strip]

The Check Strip can be used to check that the meter is operating properly. It is composed of PCB, resistor, top cover and bottom cover.

[Device Calibration]

The device is calibrated by implicit coding process. While inserting the test strip into strip slot to perform the blood glucose test, the coding procedure is complete. The meter will apply formula including this parameter of code to calculate the glucose value.

# 5. Intended Use

The PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood sample drawn from the fingertips only. The PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be shared.

The PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.

The PRECICHEK ACH Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips only.

The PRECICHEK Glucose Control Solutions are for use with the PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System and PRECICHEK ACH Blood Glucose Test Strips to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly.
