Device Description The ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA001S Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists f the ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA004S Blood Glucose meter and the ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-BA006A Blood Glucose test strips, ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* control solutions, lancing device, and commercially available sterilized lancets. This system utilizes amperometric method to generate a current. The size of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose

presented in the sample, providing a quantitative measure of glucose level in whole blood.

Intended Use

ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA001S Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) at home. It is used for quantitative measurement of glucose level in fresh capillary whole blood samples (from the finger, the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and the thigh). The alternative site testing can be only used during steady-state blood glucose monitoring. The ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA001S Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use by a single person and should not be shared. In additional, it is intended for use at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It should not be used for the diagnosis of diabetes, or for the testing of neonates.

The ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA001S Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems consists of the ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA001S Blood Glucose meter and the ADVOCATE® Redi-Code† BMB-BA006A Blood Glucose test strips. The ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA001S meter are used only with ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-BA006A Blood Glucose test strips to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from finger tips, the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and the thigh. The ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA001S Blood Glucose Meter also includes speaking functions but has not been validated for use by the visually impaired.

The ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* control solutions are for use with the ADVOCATE® Redi-Code\* BMB-EA001S Blood Glucose Monitoring System as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

Dear Mr. Lai:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labelino. and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
