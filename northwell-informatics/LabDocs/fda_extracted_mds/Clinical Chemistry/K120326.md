# 3. Device description / test principle

The AQT90 FLEX is a cartridge-based immunoassay, based on time-resolved fluorescence using a europium (Eu) chelate as the fluorescent label. The test receptacles for the assay are $3 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ test cups, which contain the antibodies used for capture of the analyte, and the Eu chelate labeled antibodies used to trace the captured analyte. The sample is added to the test cup together with assay buffer. The cup is then incubated to allow formation of the immuno-complex, and subsequently washed to remove unbound antibodies and sample material. Finally, the cup is exposed to excitation light, and after a delay the emitted light generated by the fluorescent label is measured by single photon counting; this measurement cycle is repeated up to 3,300 times. The total count is then compared to an assay calibration curve to obtain a quantitative measurement of the analyte's concentration in the sample.

This technology uses dried reagents deposited in the test cups and in the calibration adjustment cups - no liquids other than the sample itself together with the assay buffer are required. Total assay time is less than 20 minutes. In summary, the procedure is as follows:

Metering of an exact amount of sample and assay buffer and dispensing into a test cup   
2. Incubating for 7-15 minutes at $3 7 \ \circ \mathrm { C }$   
3.Washing of the test cup to remove unbound tracer antibodies and sample material   
Drying the test cup   
5.Measuring

# 4. Device intended use

AQT90 FLEX CKMB Test Kit includes 10 AQT90 FLEX CKMB Test cartridges and one AQT90 FLEX CKMB CAL cartridge. AQT90 FLEX CKMB is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of creatine kinase isoform MB in EDTA or lithium-heparin whole-blood or plasma specimens on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer in point of care and laboratory settings. It is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

AQT90 FLEX CKMB CAL cartridge is for in vitro diagnostic use intended for the calibration of the CKMB test on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer by establishing points of reference to estimate CKMB values.

AQT90 FLEX LQC Multi-CHECK, Levels 1-3, is for in vitro diagnostic use. For use with the AQT90 FLEX analyzer as a liquid quality control serum (LQC) to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analytes listed on the specification insert.

# 5. Medical device to which substantial equivalence is claimed

The AQT90 FLEX CKMB Test Kit and CKMB CAL cartridges are substantially equivalent in features and characteristics to the VIDAS Creatine Kinase MB (CKMB) Assay and the VIDAS Creatine Kinase MB (CKMB) Calibrator, 510(k) number K962549.

The AQT90 LQC FLEX Multi-CHECK, Levels 1, 2 and 3, is substantially equivalent in features and characteristics to the Liquicheck Cardiac Markers Plus Control LT, 510(k) number K050537.

# Summary of clinical performance data

The AQT90 FLEX CKMB assay (y) was compared to the predicate device, the VIDAS Creatine Kinase MB (CKMB) Assay $( \boldsymbol { \mathsf { x } } )$ using lithium-heparin plasma and whole blood samples in the range of $2 . 1 - 2 1 7 \ n g / m L \left( | | { \bf g } / \mathrm { L } \right)$ and $\pmb { 1 . 5 - 2 7 7 \eta } \pmb { \mathrm { p } } \llap { / } \pmb { \mathrm { m L } } ( \pmb { \mu } \pmb { \mathrm { g } } / \mathsf { L } ) ,$ respectively. The relationship between the two methods was determined by Passing-Bablok regression. The regression lines and correlation coefficients for whole blood samples were for Poc Site $\mathbf { 1 } = 0 . 9 3 \times \cdot 0 . 2 ;$ . ${ \mathsf n } = 4 3$ • $\mathsf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ , for POC Site $2 = 0 . 9 3 { \tt x } + 0 . 0 ;$ $n = 4 6$ ; $\mathsf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8$ and for POC Site $3 = 0 . 9 6 x \cdot 0 . 5$ ; $n = 4 8$ • $r ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 5$ . For plasma samples the regressions lines and correlation coefficients were for Poc Site $1 = 0 . 9 4 \times$ - $\dot { 0 } . 3 ; \Pi = 4 4 ; \Gamma ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ , for POC Site $2 = 0 . 9 6 \times + 0 . 0$ : $n = 4 6$ ; $\mathsf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ and for POC Site ${ \mathfrak { 3 } } =$ EPY $0 . 9 3 x \cdot 0 . 4$ $n = 4 8$ : $r ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 5$ .

Dear Gitte Friis:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisioñs (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
