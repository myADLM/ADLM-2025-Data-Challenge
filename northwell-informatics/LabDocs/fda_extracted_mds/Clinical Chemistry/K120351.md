CGA - glucose oxidase, glucose   
NBW - system, test, blood glucose, over the counter   
JJX - Quality control material

Panel:

Clinical Chemistry (75)

# Intended Use:

The CareSens N POP Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a measuring meter, test strips and control solutions. The CareSens N POP Blood Glucose Meter is intended for use with the CareSens N Single Blood Glucose Test Strips for the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood from the fingertip and alternative sites such as the forearm, palm, thigh and calf. Alternative site testing should be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions. The CareSens Control Solutions are for use with the CareSens N POP Meter and CareSens N Single Test Strips to check that the meter and the test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly.

The CareSens N POP Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing, in vitro (outside the body) testing at home by people with diabetes as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of a diabetes control program. The system is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared. It is not intended for use on neonates and is not for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes.

# Device Description:

The CareSens N POP Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) measures the glucose level in whole blood sample by the meter using a small electrical current generated in the test strips. The system consists of the following: the CareSens N POP Meter, CareSens N Single Test Strips, CareSens Control Solutions with two different glucose concentrations ("Control A" and "Control $\mathbf { B } ^ { \ast }$ ranges, sold separately), Lancing Device, Lancets, User's manual, Quick reference guide and Logbook.

Type of Test:

Quantitative, Amperometric method, Glucose oxidase (Aspergillus sp.)

Test Principle:

The reagent on the test strip produces a small electrical current using glucose as a substrate in the blood sample. The Meter converts the electrical current to a concentration of glucose.

# Technological Characteristics:

The CareSens N POP BGMS has the same fundamental scientific technology as the predicate CareSens N BGMS.

Assessment of Performance Characteristics:

When compared with CareSens N BGMS, the basic features of the CareSens N POP BGMS (including the intended use, operating principle, and fundamental scientific technology) are all the same except for the meter's appearance and output value. The CareSens N POP BGMS uses the same test strips (just a different name) and control solutions being used in the CareSens N POP BGMS. So, its performance, safety and effectiveness show results similar to the predicate device. Therefore, to check the features newly added to the CareSens N POP, validation testing was conducted and each feature was checked through the test results on whether or not they operated properly.

Summary of Pre-cleaning and Disinfection:

Disinfection studies were performed on the CareSens N POP meter and lancing device by an outside commercial testing service to determine the robustness of the meter and lancing device to the recommended pre-cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of blood-borne pathogens, using hepatitis B virus (HBV). CLOROX GERMICIDAL Wipes (EPA Reg. No: 67619-12) was validated for complete inactivation of live virus inoculated on the materials of the meter and lancing device. We have also demonstrated that 260 each of pre-cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of use has affected neither the performance nor on the external materials for the meter and lancing device.

# Conclusion:

Based on the information provided in this submission, the CareSens N POP BGMS is substantially equivalent to the predicate CareSens $\aleph$ BGMS. The CareSens N POP.BGMS has met the performance, safety, and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
