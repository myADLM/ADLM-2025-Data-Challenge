# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The Hitachi Clinical Analyzer is an automatic, bench-top, wet chemistry system intended for use in clinical laboratories or physician office laboratories. The instrument consists of a desktop analyzer unit, an operations screen that prompts the user for operation input and displays data, a printer, and a unit cover. The analyzer unit includes a single probe, an incubation rotor, carousels for sample cups and reagent cartridges, and a multi-wavelength photometer. The single-use reagent cartridges may be placed in any configuration on the carousel, allowing the user to develop any test panel where the reagent cartridges are available.

The S TEST reagent cartridges are made of plastic and include two small reservoirs capable of holding two separate reagents (R1 and R2), separated by a reaction cell/photometric cuvette. The cartridges also include a dot code label that contains all chemistry parameters, calibration factors, and other production-related information, e.g., expiration dating. The dimensions of the reagent cartridges are: $1 3 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m } \ \mathrm { ( W ) } \times 2 8 \ \mathrm { m m } \ \mathrm { ( D ) } \times 2 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ (H).

System operation: After the sample cup is placed into the carousel, the analyzer pipettes the sample, pipettes the reagent, and mixes (stirs) the sample and reagent together. After the sample and reagent react in the incubator bath, the analyzer measures the absorbance of the sample, and based on the absorbance of the reactions, it calculates the concentration of analyte in the sample. The test system can measure analytes in serum or plasma and results are available in approximately 15 minutes per test. This submission is for reagent cartridge test systems for glucose.

# Chemistry reactions:

Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of ATP. When the glucose-6-phosphate is converted into 6-phosphogluconic acid by glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), NADP is converted into NADPH with an increase in absorbance at $3 4 0 \ \mathsf { n m }$ . The concentration of glucose can be determined by measuring the amount of change in absorbance of NADPH.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Nonclinical Data

A series of studies were performed that evaluated the following nonclinical performance characteristics for glucose: analytical sensitivity (limits of detection), linearity, 20-day inhouse precision, interference testing, in-house method comparisons, and matrices comparison between serum and various plasma options.

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limits of Detection)

The study followed CLSI EP17. The sensitivity for glucose was calculated to be $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . In a second experiment with three low-level samples assayed 6 times a day for 3 days on three separate analyzers, the limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined to be $5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# Linearity

The study followed CLSI EP-6A. The S TEST glucose is linear between 5 and ${ 5 0 0 } ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# 20-day In-house Precision

The studies followed CLSI EP5-A2, where three levels of samples were each tested fourtimes a day for 20 days. The results were as follows:

# Interference Testing

The studies followed CLSI EP7-A2. The data demonstrated that the S TEST for glucose was not affected by high levels of the following substances at the levels noted:

Hemoglobin: no interference up to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin for glucose around 200 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin for low glucose levels $( { \sim } 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .   
Unconjugated bilirubin no interference up to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin for glucose around 200 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and up to $6 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin for low glucose levels $( { \sim } 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .   
Triglyceride: no interference up to ${ \bf 8 0 0 m g / d L }$ triglycerides.   
Ascorbic acid: no interference up to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ascorbic acid.

# Method Comparisons

The method comparison study evaluated 100 serum samples; matched aliquots were assayed with both the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with S TEST GLU reagent cartridge and the Roche/Hitachi cobas 6000. The data were analyzed by least squares linear regression (Hitachi $= \mathbf { y }$ -axis), and the results were as follows:

Glucose (mg/dL)   
$n { = } 1 0 0$ Y   
$y { = } 0 . 9 9 x - 2 . 7$   
correlation coefficient $( \boldsymbol { \mathbf { r } } ) = 0 . 9 9 4$ EY   
$95 \%$ confidence interval of the slope $= \ 0 . 9 8$ to 1.02; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the y  
intercept $= . 5 . 5$ to 0.8

# Matrices Comparisons

A study was performed to validate the use of sodium citrate, lithium heparinized, and K3 EDTA plasma as alternatives to serum for the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with S TEST GLU reagent cartridges Thirty-eight (38) matched serum/plasma samples that spanned the glucose dynamic range were assayed in singleton and the results were compared using least squares liner regression (plasma $=$ y-axis). The performance characteristics were as follows.

# 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Clinical Data

Studies for precision and method comparison (accuracy) were performed at three external POL-type sites to evaluate the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with S TEST GLU reagent cartridge in one of its targeted intended use environments, the physician's office laboratory.

For the external site precision study, each site received three blinded serum samples (the Precision Panel, labeled A, B, and C) that were chosen to represent low, intermediate, and high concentrations of each analyte. Each sample was assayed six times per day for five days, reporting 30 results per level per analyte. Precision estimates for within-run precision and total precision were as follows:

For the external site method comparisons study, each POL site received approximately 50 blinded serum samples that were chosen to represent as full a range of analyte concentrations as possible, and a central laboratory received a matched aliquot for each serum sample. Each sample was assayed by the Hitachi system at the POL sites, and by the Roche cobas 6000 (predicate system) at the central laboratory. The results were analyzed by least squares linear regression (Hitachi $=$ y-axis), and the performance characteristics were as follows:
