# Identification / Product Name:

Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# Device Description:

Our Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a Meter, Blood Glucose Test Strips, Three Control Solutions, Lancing Device and Lancets.

The Rightest Meter, Blood Glucose Test Strips, and Lancing Device are manufactured by BIONIME Corporation. The Rightest Meter, when used with the Rightest Test Strips Blood Glucose Test Strips, quantitatively measures glucose in fresh capillary whole blood. The performance of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System is verified by the Control Solution.

# Intended Use:

The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM650 is intended for in vitro diagnostic use (outside of body). It is indicated to be used by a single user at home to measure the glucose concentration as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The glucose concentration is measured with quantitative capillary whole blood (from the fingertip, palm, and forearm), by using Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GM650.

This device is not intended for testing neonate blood samples and is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus. And this device should not be used for testing multiple patients. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady-state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strips GS650 are intended for use with the Rightest Blood Glucose meter GM650 in the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm and forearm.

Rightest Control Solutions GC650 are intended for use with the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM650 to check that both the glucose meters and test strips are working properly. These solutions contain a known range of glucose, as indicated on the bottles.

# Predicate Kit:

The Bionime Diabetes Management System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device noted below:

Device Name: RightestTM Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM550

510k No.: k092052 Device Company: Bionime Corporation

# Technology Characteristics:

Bionime's Rightest™M GM650 system is an electronic device that utilizes the electrical characteristic technology for measuring the glucose level in human blood. A relatively small drop of blood is placed on a disposable test strip coated with FAD-glucose Dehydrogenase (FADGDH) which interacts with the software driven digital talking meter. Within five seconds, the level of blood glucose will be shown on the digital display screen.

Rightest™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System, with an auto-coding feature, requires only minimum of 1 microliter of blood for the testing, therefore it reduces the time and effort required for testing and improves the compliance of diabetic people to their testing regimens.

Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as follows:

Verification and validation of test results were evaluated to establish the performance, functionality and reliability of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The evaluation included precision, linearity, interference and hematocrit.

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

# System Accuracy Study:

The accuracy study of the Rightest™" Blood Glucose Monitoring System Model GM650 was performed by comparing whole blood (plasma equivalent) glucose values on the Rightest™M meter with plasma glucose values on a lab instrument.

A total of 118 patients were participated. The study result demonstrates that the accuracy 0 Rightest™" Blood Glucose Monitoring System Model GM650 met the acceptance criteria.

# User Performance Study:

A User performance study was performed to demonstrate that lay consumers could obtain accurate results using the subject device. The study was performed by 161 consumers testing capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm and forearm sample sites. The study result shows substantial equivalence to Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System used in finger, palm and forearm position.

# Performance:

The results of aforementioned studies demonstrate satisfactory performance of Bionime RightestTM Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM650, and the device is easy to use and the results are understandable by the target users.

# Conclusion:

The results of the verification and validation studies of the Bionime Diabetes Management System demonstrated that the product is safe and effectiveness in the hands of lay users and health care professionals. The product is substantial equivalence to the predicate device, Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System Model GM550.
