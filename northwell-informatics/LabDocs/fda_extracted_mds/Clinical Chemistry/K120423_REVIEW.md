# L. Test Principle:

The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM650 uses electrochemical methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an amperometric method. The system employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems - GE300 Talking BGMS and Rightest BGMS GM650 meters are identical to each other except for the trade names. Therefore performance characteristics for only Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM650 have been provided.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and 15 mixed pools of venous blood samples in glucose concentrations (as measured by YSI) of 0, 9, 29, 50, 86,154, 210, 238, 325, 346, 401, 462, 492, 591, and $6 2 9 { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . Each level was measured in triplicate with each of 3 test strip lots and the values from the Rightest GM650 meter were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300. Results from regression analysis:

Test strip lot #1: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 2 5 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 6 6 4$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 5 6$   
Test strip lot #2: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 2 6 \mathbf { x } - 5 . 0 0 9 0 $ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 6 3$   
Test strip lot #3: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 0 9 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 8 6 2 8$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 5 2$

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ .

The measuring range of these systems is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . Results equal to or below 20 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ are reported as “Lo” and results greater than or equal to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ reported as “Hi.”

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Control solutions and test strips cleared under k110737.

Traceability:

The Bionime Rightest Model GM650 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST SRM 917A reference material.

d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the system is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood with two levels of glucose concentrations (60 - 100 and $1 5 0 - 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool and each of 18 potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was added to the test pool. Each compound was tested at two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations.

Each sample was analyzed 5 times with the Rightest GM650 meter and the $\%$ difference between the interferent containing sample and the control sample calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as $\leq 1 0 \%$ difference relative to the control sample. Results are presented in the table below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling: Xylose concentrations $\geq 1 0 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ and Uric acid ${ \ge } 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may interfere with the test resulting in inaccurate test results.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor states that this study was performed in accordance with ISO 15197.

Testing was completed by comparing the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System against the YSI-2300 glucose analyzer (reference method). The study was conducted with a total 118 subjects. Three lots of test strips were used in the study.

Fresh venous blood samples and capillary blood from fingertip, palm and forearm (ranging between $3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 5 2 8 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose concentrations) from different individuals were used, except for five samples with glucose concentrations ${ < } 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ that were incubated to allow glucose to glycolize. For concentrations $> 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , four spiked samples were used. Samples collected from fingertip, palm and forearm were tested with the Rightest $\mathrm { G M } 6 5 0$ and within 5 minutes was also tested with the YSI meter.

Yes X or No_

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

5. Calibration:

A single calibration code is programmed into the meters at the time of manufacturing and no user input is required for calibration.

6. Quality Control:

Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system. The meter has a function for the user to select the level of control solution they wish to run to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as patient results. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results when the measurements are performed in the “CS measurement mode”. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

# 1. H em atocritStudy:

A study to evaluate the effects of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 6 glucose concentrations (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330 and $3 6 0 { - } 4 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ at 6 hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 and $6 5 \%$ ). Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested in triplicate on 3 meters using 3 lots of test strips. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same glucose concentration at normal $( 4 5 \% )$ hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value. Data provided for the claimed hematocrit range of $30 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \%$ met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $\pm 1 5 \%$

# 2. AltitudeStudy:

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the GM650 BGMS. Test samples were tested on 3 meters in triplicate with 3 different strip vials using venous whole blood from healthy donors. Three glucose concentrations (ranging from 43.5- $3 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ at three corresponding altitude levels (3280, 6561 and 9842 feet,) were tested in a controllable temperature /humidity chamber against a 0 meter level as a control. Each venous blood sample was also tested by the YSI 2300 analyzer. The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI method and the percent bias was determined at each level against the YSI results. The sponsor showed the bias was within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for all three altitude levels tested. Based on the data, the sponsor claims that the GM650 can be used up to 9842 feet

# 3. Sam plevolum estudy:

A sample volume study was performed to verify the minimum test strip sample volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the BGMS. Three lots of test strips were used to test spiked or glycolized venous whole blood at three glucose concentrations (40-60, 80-120 and $3 0 0 { - } 3 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Blood at each of these concentrations was applied to strips at 6 target sample volumes of 0.6, 0.65, 0.75, 0.8, 1.0, and $1 . 2 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The sponsor concluded that sample volumes of ${ 2 0 . 7 5 \mu \mathrm { L } }$ produced accurate results ( the sponsor showed were within $8 \%$ ), Samples ${ < } 0 . 7 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ gave an Er 4 error code . The labeling provides instructions and graphics to assist the user in obtaining and applying an adequate sample volume.

# 4. Userperform ancestudy:

As part of the user performance study summarized in section M.2.a above, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that they could successfully perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.

# 5. Readability assessm ent:

The Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment of the product labeling determined that the Owner’s Manuals and test strip inserts for both proposed devices were written at the 8th grade level.

# 6. Tem peratureand hum idity studies:

Temperature and humidity studies were conducted that demonstrated that the devices can be used at temperatures from 6 to $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and at a relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ . The sponsor tested the extreme combinations of temperature and humidity and the results supported the claimed ranges.

# 7. Electromagnetic Compatibility:

EMC testing was performed/passed and a certificate granted to Bionime Inc. was provided.

# 8. Infection ControlStudies:

The device is intended for single-patient use only. Discide Ultra disinfecting towelettes with EPA registration #10492-4 were validated demonstrating validation using hepatitis B surface antigen testing using materials from the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meters and lancing device after 550 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of meter and lancing device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
