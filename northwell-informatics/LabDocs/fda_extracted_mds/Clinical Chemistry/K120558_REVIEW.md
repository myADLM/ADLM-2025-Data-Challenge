# E. System Descriptions:

Device Description: The OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reveal Diabetes Management Application (App) is a diabetes management tool that can help the user determine what blood glucose test results mean. This allows the user and their health care professional to better monitor and adjust their diabetes care plan. The App is designed to work in conjunction with the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio™ Sync Meter. Using the Bluetooth $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ feature on the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio™ Sync meter and Apple $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ device, blood sugar test results can be sent directly from the meter to the App.

# Principles of Operation:

The OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reveal Diabetes Management Application has a software feature that alerts users to low and high blood glucose patterns. This software feature has also been implemented on another cleared LifeScan blood glucose meter, the One Touch Verio IQ Blood Glucose Meter.

The OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reveal™ Application (App) is designed to run under Apple iOS $^ { 4 + }$ operating systems on the following devices:

iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS C iPod Touch 3rd and 4th Gen iPad 1st and 2nd Gen

The App stores blood glucose test results, events and user settings. The App's memory capacity is 2500 blood glucose results and events; and is limited to a maximum of 1 year of results and events. In addition to receiving blood glucose measurement readings from the OneTouch Verio Sync Meter via

Bluetooth, storing and displaying them, the App provides the following features and tools for the user:

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

a) A usability study was performed with One hundred sixty-eight (168) subjects, including 21 pediatric Subjects (ages 12 to 18 years). The study was conducted at two clinical sites. Each subject attended two site visits, with a home testing period between the visits.

During Site Visit 1:

The HCP issued a Home Testing Kit to the Subject and briefed the Subject on the study procedures and requirements but provided no training on the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio BGMS or OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ VerioOneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reveal Diabetes Management Application. The subject demonstrated (without guidance from the HCP) the ability to pair and sync the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio meter and the iPod Touch using the labeling. The HCP and Subject scheduled a date and time for Site Visit 2 to complete the study.

During the home testing period (5-7 calendar days), the Subject performed the activities specified on the Home Testing Form using the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio BGMS, OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reveal Diabetes Management Application, and labeling.

During Site Visit 2:

Orientation – The Subject familiarized himself/herself with the use of the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio App “Share” feature in the   
OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio Application according to the Orientation Testing Form.   
Instructions for Use – The Subject completed two self  
administered instructions for use questionnaires (Meter   
Instructions for Use Questionnaire and App Instructions for Use Questionnaire).   
Human Factors Assessments – The Subject performed HF tasks; an HCP observed and evaluated the Subject’s technique and recorded the results on the Human Factors Assessment Form. Subject Feedback – The Subject completed a self-administered User Acceptance Questionnaire regarding ease of use and other HF aspects of the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio BGMS and OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reveal Diabetes Management Application.   
Subjects were briefed on study procedures and requirements but received no training on use of the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Verio BGMS or OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reveal Diabetes Management Application.

Lay User Human Factors Assessments – The success rates for all 44 assessments on the Human Factors Assessment Form meet the assigned risk-based acceptance criteria of better than $9 3 . 8 \%$ success, thus validating the critical areas to test that are the basis for those assessments.

Lay User Feedback – The proportions of neutral-or-better responses for all 21 items on the User Acceptance Questionnaire meet the acceptance criterion of meeting better than $8 1 . 0 \%$ of neutral-or-better feedbacks, thus validating the critical areas to test that are the basis for those questionnaire items.   
b) Software installation, connectivity and data transmission as intended to be use, was assessed and verified to achieve $100 \%$ accuracy for data transmission.   
c) Bench Testing was performed on data from one meter to test meter memory rollover and data transmission, this included full memory data transmission, plus additional data to validate correct data rollover in the app. All data fields were $100 \%$ accurate.   
d) The app has the function of being able to link to more than one meter. The applicant tested 8 meters for configuration syncing and data transmission. All data fields were $100 \%$ correct.   
e) Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes.   
f) The sponsor provided the results of a Flesch-Kincaid readability study which indicated a Grade Level Score of 7.8 for the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reveal Diabetes Management Application and owner’s booklet.   
g) The sponsor provided third party device conformity to EMC standards related to Radio Frequency Fields from Hand-Held and Body-Mounted Wireless Communication Devices for Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), and Information Technology Equipment Safety.

# K. Proposed Labeling:
