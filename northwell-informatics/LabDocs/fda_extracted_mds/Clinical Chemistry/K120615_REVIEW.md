I. Device Description: The Alere Cholestech LDX $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System is a small, portable analyzer and test cassette system. The System is for in vitro diagnostic use only. The Analyzer uses reflectance photometry (the amount of light reflected from a solid surface) to measure the amount of substances in blood. The analyzer measures color changes of the four reagent pads. The amount of color formed is converted by the analyzer to a concentration and the results are shown on the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. The assays for use on the Analyzer include total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TRG), glucose (GLU), and by calculation, low-density lipoprotein (LDL).

The modification that is the subject of this submission is with regards to a software upgrade. The software used to run the Alere Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X @ }$ Analyzer is provided as an upgradable Read Only Memory (ROM) Pack that connects to the Analyzer on the back panel. The ROM pack upgrade includes a humidity sensor attached to the front casing of the ROM pack and is backwards compatible to all Alere Cholestech LDX $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzers.

# L. Test Principle:

The Alere Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X @ }$ System combines enzymatic methodology and solidphase technology to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. Samples used for testing can be whole blood from a fingerstick (collected in a lithium heparin-coated capillary tube) or venipuncture. The sample is applied to an Alere Cholestech LDX $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ cassette. The cassette is then placed into the Alere Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X @ }$ Analyzer where a unique system on the cassette separates the plasma from the blood cells. A portion of the plasma flows to the right side of the cassette and is transferred to both the total cholesterol and triglyceride reaction pads. Simultaneously, plasma flows to the left side of the cassette where the low- and very low-density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) are precipitated with dextran sulfate $( 5 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { M W } )$ and magnesium acetate precipitating reagent.5 The filtrate, containing both glucose and HDL cholesterol, is transferred to both the glucose and HDL cholesterol reaction pads.

The Alere Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X @ }$ Analyzer measures total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol by an enzymatic method based on the method formulation of Allain et al,5 and Roeschlau.6 Cholesterol esterase hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters in the filtrate or plasma to free cholesterol and the corresponding fatty acid. Cholesterol oxidase, in the presence of oxygen, oxidizes free cholesterol to cholest-4-ene-3-one and hydrogen peroxide. In a reaction catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase, the peroxide reacts with 4- aminoantipyrine and N-ethyl-N-sulfohydroxypropyl-m-toluidine, sodium salt (TOOS) to form a purple-colored quinoneimine dye proportional to the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol concentrations of the sample.

The Alere Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X @ }$ Analyzer measures triglycerides by an enzymatic method based on the hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipase to glycerol and free fatty acids. Glycerol, in a reaction catalyzed by glycerol kinase, is converted to glycerol-3- phosphate. In a third reaction, glycerol-3-phosphate is oxidized by glycerol phosphate oxidase to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and hydrogen peroxide.7 The color reaction utilizing horseradish peroxidase is the same as for the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.

The Alere Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X @ }$ Analyzer measures glucose by an enzymatic method that uses glucose oxidase to catalyze the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide. The color reaction utilizing horseradish peroxidase is the same as that for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The resultant color in all the reactions is measured by reflectance photometry.

A brown (magnetic) stripe on each cassette contains the calibration information required for the Alere Cholestech LDX $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer to convert the reflectance reading $( \% \mathrm { R } )$ to the total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose concentrations.

# Cholesterol and Triglycerides

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute issued the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) in May, 2001.1 The ATP III report presents NCEP’s updated clinical guidelines for cholesterol testing and management and describes the following classifications for cholesterol and triglyceride testing:

<table><tr><td>Analyte</td><td>mg/dL</td><td>mmol/L</td><td>Classification</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">LDL cholesterol</td><td>&lt;100</td><td>&lt;2.59</td><td>Optimal</td></tr><tr><td>100-129</td><td>2.59  3.34</td><td>Near optimal/above optimal</td></tr><tr><td>130 -159</td><td>3.36 - 4.11</td><td>Borderline high</td></tr><tr><td>160-189</td><td>4.14 - 4.89</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>≥190</td><td>≥4.91</td><td>Very high</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Total cholesterol</td><td>&lt;200</td><td>&lt;5.18</td><td>Desirable</td></tr><tr><td>200 - 239</td><td>5.18 -6.19</td><td>Borderline high</td></tr><tr><td>≥240</td><td>≥6.22</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">HDL cholesterol</td><td>&lt;40</td><td>&lt;1.03</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>≥60</td><td>≥1.55</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Triglycerides</td><td>&lt;150</td><td>&lt;1.69</td><td>Normal</td></tr><tr><td>150-199</td><td>1.69 - 2.25</td><td>Borderline high</td></tr><tr><td>200 - 499</td><td>2.26 - 5.64</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>≥500</td><td>≥5.65</td><td>Very high</td></tr></table>

The ATP III identified HDL cholesterol levels below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (1.03 mmol/L) as associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in men and women.1 A high HDL cholesterol level greater than or equal to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (1.55 mmol/L) is protective and decreases CHD risk.

# TC/HDL Ratio

A ratio of 4.5 or less is desirable. A ratio greater than 6.0 suggests a high risk of CHD.2

# Non-HDL

ATP III identifies non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol) as a secondary target of therapy in persons with high triglycerides $( \geq 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .

The goal for non-HDL cholesterol in persons with high serum triglycerides can be set at $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ higher than that for LDL cholesterol on the premise that a VLDL cholesterol level ${ \leq } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is normal.1

# Glucose

The American Diabetes Association has identified categories of increased risk for diabetes based upon glucose4:

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) $1 0 0 - 1 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (5.6 -6.9 mmol/L); impaired fasting glucose 2-hr plasma glucose in the $7 5 \mathrm { - g }$ oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) $1 4 0 - 1 9 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $7 . 8 \mathrm { - } 1 1 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L } \rangle$ ; impaired glucose tolerance

For these tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and becoming disproportionately greater at higher ends of the range.

The American Diabetes Association has criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus based upon glucose4:

$\mathrm { F P G } \geq 1 2 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ b $7 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l } / \mathrm { l }$ ). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least $8 \mathrm { ~ h r }$ .   
2-h plasma glucose $\geq 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $1 1 . 1 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ) during an OGTT. The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of $7 5 \ \mathrm { g }$ anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.   
In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose $\geq 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (11.1 mmol/L).

In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnosis should be confirmed by repeat testing. When screening for diabetes, any abnormal glucose result should be referred to a physician for further follow-up.
