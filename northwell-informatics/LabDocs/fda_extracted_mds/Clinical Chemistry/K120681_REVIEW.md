# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

This enzymatic method is based on the method by Slein using hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymes. The ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) method is a two-component reagent. Sample is added to Reagent 1, which contains the buffer, ATP, and NAD. Absorbance readings of the sample in Reagent 1 are taken and are used to correct for interfering substances in the sample. Reagent 2 is added, which initiates the reaction. Glucose is phosphorylated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the presence of hexokinase. The glucose-6- phosphate that forms is oxidized in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causing the reduction of NAD to NADH. The absorbance of NADH is measured as an endpoint reaction at $3 4 0 / 4 1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The difference between the absorbance in Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 is proportional to the glucose concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase (GLUH_3) Reagent was previously 510(k) cleared under k101854. The only change to the device in the current submission is the addition of an additional anticoagulant, sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate. Additional testing was performed and submitted to demonstrate that the performance of sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate samples is substantially equivalent to the originally cleared device. All other performance data was previously reviewed under 510(k) number k101854, which is referenced below.

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Previously cleared, see k101854

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Previously cleared, see k101854 The claimed measuring range of the device is from $4 { \mathrm { - } } 7 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Previously cleared, see k101854   
d. Detection limit: Previously cleared, see k101854   
e. Analytical specificity: Previously cleared, see k101854   
f. Assay cut-off: Previously cleared, see k101854

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Previously cleared, see k101854

b. Matrix comparison:

Eighty two matched serum plasma sample sets were compared with the device. Serum and plasma sample sets were each collected from the same patient. The plasma was collected in the anticoagulant being evaluated. The samples consisted of 56 unaltered patient samples and 26 samples that were either spiked with glucose or diluted in order to cover the complete measuring range of the device. Samples ranged in concentration from $5 - 6 9 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was measured $\mathrm { n } { = } 1$ on the Siemens ADVIA 1650 Chemistry System. Linear regression was performed with the following results: $\mathbf { y } =$ $1 . 0 1 1 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 7 8$ with $\mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 9$ . The $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals were $1 . 0 0 3 -$ 1.019 for the slope and -1.18 to 2.73 for the y-intercept.

Urine and CSF samples are not derived from whole blood and are not directly comparable to serum and plasma samples so they were not tested in this evaluation.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable
