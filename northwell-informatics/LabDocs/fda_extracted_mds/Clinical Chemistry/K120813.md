# 5.0 Device description

Health BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System consist of blood glucose meter, single use test strips, sterile lancets, lancing device and the control solutions.

The new device iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System is based on an electrochemical biosensor technology (electrochemical) and the principle of capillary action. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in 5 seconds. The control solution available is used to test the performance of the device. It uses the same technological characteristics for testing with its predicate device.

The appearance of iHealth BG3 meter is different from the predicate device. More over, the new device iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System can not display the test results itself, it has to connect an iPhone or iPod touch to complete its function.

# 6.0 Intended use

iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System is intended to be used for:

quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf or thigh   
single person measurement only and should not be shared   
self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control

The iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, or for neonatal use.

Alternative Site Testing (AST) should be done only during steady state times when glucose levels are not changing rapidly.

The AGS1000l test strips are intended for use with the iHealth BG3 meter to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf or thigh using the iHealthBG3 meter

# 8.0 Performance summary

iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System conforms to the following standards:

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems- Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

Non-clinical test and the clinical test are done according to the above standard.

# 9.0 Comparison to the predict device and the conclusion

iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System is similar with the predicate device AG-608N Single blood pressure monitor, the two devices are both for single people use, they use the same test strip, and can test the blood glucose at the alternative site. The hematocrit range, the altitude and the use function are all the same. The appearance of the two device is different, and iHealth BG3 meter does not have a LCD itself, it must be connected to an iPone or iPod touch to display measurement results. More over, the memory capability of the new device is changed, and the new device neither has the USB function nor Voice function.

However, the test in this submission provides demonstration that these small differences do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness.
