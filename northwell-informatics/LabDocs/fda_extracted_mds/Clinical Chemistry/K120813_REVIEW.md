# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip is measured by the meter and is displayed on an iPhone or iPod touch as the corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The device is a modification of a cleared AG-608N meter (k110017) to connect and provide the User Interface with iOS iPhone and iPod using the same test strip and control cleared with the AG-608N meter in k110017. Meter, strip and analytical module are unchanged. The sponsor conducted necessary validation of the device, such as human factors testing and bench testing (see Section P).

N. Instrument Name: iHealth BG3 Meter

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device:

Yes __x__ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?:

Yes __x____ or No __

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___x_ _ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and other alternative sites (palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh). Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

Auto-coding: No calibration is required from the user, since all test strips have the same one-code.

6. Quality Control:

No quality control (QC) tracking software is provided. The user is advised to monitor QC material when testing is within labeled range. Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system. Control solution Level 2 is provided with the kit. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. O therSupportiveInstrum entPerform anceCharacteristicsDataNotCovered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Applicable temperature and humidity studies; sample volume study; Altitude study; hematocrit study were established in k110017

1. A readability assessment was conducted by SMOG method on the instructions for use, and they were found to be at 8th grade reading level or below.

2. Human Factors testing

A human factors study was conducted with 30 lay user participants, using 30 iPhones, 30 iPod Touch devices, 60 iHealth BG3 meters (30 will dock iPhone and 30 will dock iPod Touch) and 3 lots of test strips. As part of the human factors study, the 30 lay user participants used their own fingersticks to evaluate data accuracy to the 30 iPhones, as described in section M.3.c. above. The study participants had varied, but not advanced computer skills. The first 10 users used test strip lot 1, the second 10 users used test strip lot 2, and the last 10 users used test strip lot 3. The users were given labeling in English and instructed to set up and use the system as intended to be used. Results of this study are described in section M.3.c above.

Lay user questionnaire: Lay users evaluated the ease of use of the device and the presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System was easy to use and most answered “easy” and “very easy” to each question.

3. Bench testing performed for data from meter to iPhone or IPod device Bench testing was performed to verify the transmission accuracy of electrical signals between Apple's mobile operating system for iPhone and iPod platforms (iOS) and glucose meter. This evaluation consisted of the following: sending of data (output from the glucose meter) and receiving of data (input

into the iOS device). Data from the glucose meter and the receiving data on iOS device, was in $100 \%$ agreement

4. Bench testing memory limits and rollover synchronization. Testing was performed to evaluate that the iOS and device can save 10000 records and that the records can rollover properly in the iOS app. The criteria for successful rollover of data were that when the memory is full, the new record will replace the record that existed from the first record. The stated acceptance criteria was met for this study

5. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed/ passed. A certificate verifying that EMC testing was performed and passed was provided.

6. The applicant provided software documentation and testing that supports the device was developed and is under good software lifecycle processed.

7. Disinfection studies/Infection Control Studies: The devices are intended for single-patient use (iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System). Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters and lancing device by outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration #46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials for each of the meters and lancing device after 11,000 cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps with the CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to stimulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

The sponsor provides a disposable sleeve for the iPod or iPhone to be used with each test strip, not to be reused and to be disposed of as bio-hazard, therefore no disinfection studies were required of the iPod or iPhone.

8. Customer service is available Monday through Friday 8:30 am to $5 { : } 3 0 \ \mathrm { p m }$ Pacific Standard Time at the following toll-free number: 1-855-816-7705. The labeling instructs patients to contact their healthcare provider at all other times for help)
