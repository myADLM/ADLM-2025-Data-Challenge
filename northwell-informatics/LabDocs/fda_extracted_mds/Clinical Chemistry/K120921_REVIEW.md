# L. Test Principle:

The Clever Choice Voice $^ +$ S, Clever Choice Voice+ M, Clever Choice+ S (non-voice version), and Clever Choice $^ +$ M (non-voice version) glucose meters use glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzyme assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an amperometric measurement device using current generated for the redox reaction as the measureable response.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

This submission encompasses four meter models. Given that all four meter models are identical with the exception of two meters including a voice function (Voice+ S and Voice $\mathbf { \Lambda } + \mathbf { M }$ models), only one set of performance data is provided throughout the submission.

# N. Instrument Name:

Clever Choice Voice $^ +$ S Blood Glucose Monitoring System Clever Choice Voice $^ +$ M Blood Glucose Monitoring System Clever Choice+ S Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# Clever Choice+ M Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ___X_____ or No _

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No ____X_

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X__ ___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

5. Calibration:

There is no calibration required for the Clever Choice meters by the user. The meter is plasma-calibrated.

6. Quality Control:

There are 3 levels of glucose control solutions available separately. Level 2 is provided with the start up kit. The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the control solutions to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as a patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the control solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Altitude Study : To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Clever Choice meters, 20 whole blood venous samples were collected, using lithium heparin as the anticoagulant, and then split into 3 environmental simulation chambers $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0$ , glucose range $7 2 . 3 - 3 4 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). One lot of test strips was used in the study and each whole blood part was evaluated on four meters and compared to the YSI 2300 reference method. The environmental chambers were set to recreate three different altitude levels: 3,280 feet (1000 meters), 6,560 feet (2000 meters), and 10,744 feet (3275 meters). Additionally, samples were evaluated at sea level. Results obtained were analyzed as a percent bias compared to YSI. Based on the data, the Clever Choice Voice+ S ,Clever Choice Voice+ M, Clever Choice+ S (non-voice version), and Clever Choice $^ +$ M (non-voice version) glucose meters can be used at altitudes up to 10,744 feet (3275 meters).

2. Hematocrit Study: The test strips and meter system for this submission are identical to those cleared in k101307. Please see k101307 for information regarding hematocrit effects on this test system.

3. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples at target glucose concentrations (70, 125, $3 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ to evaluate combined temperature and relative humidity conditions ( $1 2 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 2 5 \%$ RH, $2 3 \ \%$ RH, $3 8 ~ \%$ RH, $12 \%$ RH, 12 $^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 6 0 \% \mathrm { R H }$ , $3 8 ~ \mathrm { ^ { o } C / 8 0 ^ { \circ } / { \circ } R H } )$ ). The results demonstrate that accurate readings can obtained after exposure to temperatures ranging from $5 0 - 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 1 0 - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity conditions ranging from $2 5 \% - 8 0 \%$ .

# 4. EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing:

The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing (EMS) had been performed and the Clever Choice meters were found compliant (IEC 61326, IEC 61010).

5. Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip sample volume requirement for the Clever Choice meters using blood samples at seven glucose concentrations (44.5, 63.1, 117, 168, 249, 356 and $4 3 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Five sample volumes were evaluated in this study (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1.0 and $2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). Results support the claimed sample volume of $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

6. Infection control: The device is intended for both single- and multiple-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Cavi-Wipes with EPA registration #46781-8. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device (only for use with the single-patient use systems) after 11,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient device use and 3 years of multiple-patient device use.. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

7. Readability: The results from the SMOG formula readability assessment demonstrated that the user’s manuals, test strip package insert, and control solution package insert are at an 7.98 to 8.0 grade reading level.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
