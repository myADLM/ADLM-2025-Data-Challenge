# Executive Summary

Detailed performance characteristics and comparison analysis are given in this filing and demonstrate substantial equivalence to predicate device that is currently being marketed. The performance characteristics of the Diazyme HCY POC Test Kit are substantially similar to that of the approved predicate device DIAZYME HOMOCYSTEINE 2 REAGENT ENZYMATIC ASSAY KIT (k071971). Performance data and risk analysis indicates that differences should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the HCY POC Test and offers POL users an in vitro diagnostic device system to measure HCY in human serum/plasma samples.

# Deseription of the Device:

Diazyme HCY POC Test Kit contains reagents intended for use with the SMART analyzer for the quantitative determination of Homocysteine (HCY) in human serum or plasma. Diazyme HCY POC Test is based on a novel enzyme cycling method as published in the Journal of Clinical Chemistry. In this assay, oxidized HCY is first reduced to free HCY which then reacts with a co-substrate, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) catalyzed by a HCY S-methyltransferase to form methionine (Met) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is assessed by coupled enzyme reactions including SAH hydrolase, adenosine (Ado) deaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase, wherein SAH is hydrolyzed into adenosine (Ado) and HCY by SAH hydrolase. The formed HCY that is originated from the co-substrate SAM is cycled into the HCY conversion reaction by HCY S-methyltransferase. This forms a co-substrate conversion product-based enzyme cycling reaction system with significant amplification of detection signals. The formed Ado is immediately hydrolyzed into inosine and ammonia which reacts with glutamate dehydrogenase with concomitant conversion of NADH to NAD+. The concentration of HCY in the sample is indirectly proportional to the amount of NADH converted to NAD $^ +$ (∆A340nm).

Diazyme Homocysteine POC Controls were cleared in previous FDA filing k042448.

SMART Analyzer (k092911) is a compact cuvette based spectrophotometer (10 inches x 5.5 inches x 5.5 inches) machine for point-of-care testing designed to analyze readings from single use reagent cuvette. The instrument only uses the Diazyme Reagent System (DRS) cuvette and caps and performs assay with a preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card. The DRS cuvette is supplied prefilled with Reagent 1 (R1) and the DRS cap is supplied prefilled with Reagent 2 (R2). The DRS cuvette and caps are kept separate until use. Users are instructed (see proposed labeling) to add $2 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of sample to the DRS cuvette prefilled with R1 containing proper amount of detergent for whole blood lysis. Users are then instructed to snap in place DRS cap and insert into analyzer. The instrument warms the cuvette to $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ and after a predefined period adds the reagent R2 found in the DRS cap. The reagents and samples are mixed magnetically and absorbance readings are taken at $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The lot specific RFID card contains reagent addition time, mixing time, reading time and calibration curve.

The Diazyme HCY POC Test system thus consists of the following:

HCY POC Test Kit. Reagents are provided in prefilled tubes, cuvettes and cuvette caps. The DRS cuvette and cuvette caps can only work with the SMART analyzer.   
HCY POC Test Control Kit. Controls are provided for quality control of the HCY POC Test.

# Indication (s) for use

Diazyme's HCY POC Test Kit is intended to be used with the SMART analyzer in a Point-ofCare setting for the in vitro quantitative determination of total L-homocysteine in serum or plasma. The assay can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients suspected of having hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

# Performance Characteristics:

# Precision/Reproducibility

# Precision study at manufacture site

The precision of the Diazyme HCY POC Assay was evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A guideline with some modifications. In the study, three serum controls containing 7.3, 11.87, and $2 9 . 3 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ HCY were tested in duplicate, two runs per day, over ten working days. The first five days used Lot 1, HT00209, and subsequent five days used Lot 2, HT00309. This was performed on three different SMART Analyzers. The results indicated good precision and are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.3μmol/LHCY</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.87μmol/LHCY</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29.32µmol/LHCY</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No. of Points</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean (μM)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within CV%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.2%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total CV%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.4%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.3%</td></tr></table>

Conclusion: Within precisions for three levels of HCY serum samples are $3 . 2 \%$ for $7 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ HCY, $1 . 8 \%$ for $1 1 . 8 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ HCY, and $2 . 8 \%$ for $2 9 . 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ HCY. Total precisions (CV) for three levels of HCY serum samples are $3 . 4 \%$ for $7 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ HCY, $3 . 5 \%$ for $1 1 . 8 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ HCY, and $3 . 3 \%$ for $2 9 . 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ HCY. These results meet precision criteria.

Conclusion: For the 9 serum samples containing HCY from $1 0 . 2 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ to $4 2 . 7 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ,a $C V \%$ of less than $8 \%$ was obtained at the three POL sites.

# Linearity/assay reportable range:

Ten levels of linearity set were prepared by diluting a serum control containing ${ 5 0 } { \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } }$ HCY with saline according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP6-A. The samples prepared were tested using the Diazyme's HCY POC Assay in triplicate. After linear regression, an equation of Recovered HCY = 0.9749 \* Expected HCY + 0.751 and correlation coefficient $\mathtt { R } ^ { 2 }$ of 0.9992 were obtained.

The linearity of Diazyme HCY SMART Assay is linear $3 - 5 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ .

Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrator

HCY POC Test calibration is traceable to the higher order NIST SRM 1955.

Calibration Radio Frequency Identification Card (RFID card)   
HCY POC Test utilizes a RFID card that is preprogrammed with a reagent lot specificcalibration curve and is supplied in each kit. When RFID card is inserted into SMART analyzer slot (assay procedure step), the lot specific calibration curve is automatically utilized for assay test. RFID cards are programmed at the manufacturer site and are subject to the same quality control checks as the reagents and controls.

Lot specific calibrator values to be generated for RFID card calibration curve programming are traced to reference Diazyme Homocysteine calibrator values (k071971) and are value assigned as follows:

To construct Diazyme HCY SMART Assay RFID card calibration curve, 5 levels of calibrators used in the predicate device (k071971) are tested with the Diazyme HCY POC Test reagents on SMART analyzers to obtain the rate of absorbance change. The calibrator value and the mean of absorbance change are programmed into cards by using a card writer.

After creation of the RFID card it is used for in process and final QC testing (Step 3: Final calibration values). Tests include NIST SRM 1955, Diazyme Homocysteine Controls, and serum samples.

# Stability

Two lots of the Diazyme HCY POC Assay reagents were used for this study. The reagents from each lot were kept $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ refrigerator. In the study, two levels of serum control samples containing $7 . 3 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } ,$ ,and $2 9 . 5 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ homocysteine were tested. At indicated time, the Diazyme HCY POC Assay reagents were removed from storage and tested. The real time data so far showed that the HCY POC Test is stable for at least 10 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage. The real time stability testing is on-going.

# LoB, LoD,LoQ

The LoB, LoD, and LoQ of the Diazyme HCY POC Test Kit were determined according to CLSI EP17.   
A.

$\mathrm { L o B } = 0 . 0 6 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ ${ \mathrm { L o D } } = 0 . 3 2 { \mathrm { ~ \mu m o l / L } }$ $\mathrm { L o Q } = 3 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$

# Interference

# Common endogenous substance interference

The level of interference from the substances normally present in the serum was determined by using Diazyme Homocysteine SMART Enzymatic Assay to test $1 2 \mu \mathrm { M }$ and $2 9 \mu \mathrm { M }$ HCY serum samples spiked with various concentrations of substances following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP7-A "Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry": dose-response guidelines.
