# L. Test Principle:

Total Galactose is measured colorimetrically following the completion of two enzyme assisted reactions and the color formation reaction. The first reaction entails conversion of Galactose-1-Phosphate (Gal-1-P) to Galactose (Gal), catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase.

Alkaline Phosphatase Gal-1-P Gal

In the second reaction, Gal is converted to galactonolactone through the galactose dehydrogenase Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide redox pair (NAD $^ +$ /NADH)-coupled reaction.

The NADH produced is proportional to the Gal concentration.

The final reaction, catalyzed by 1-methoxy PMS, employs a tetrazolium salt (MTT) and produces a formazan dye that is measured colorimetrically.

1-methoxy PMS NADH $^ +$ MTT Colored Formazan $^ +$ NAD+

The color developed is proportional to the Total Galactose concentration in the sample. A standard curve prepared from a stock Galactose solution is used to quantitate the results.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The within-run and total precision of the SPOTCHECK Neonatal Total Galactose Microplate Reagent Kit was evaluated according to the CLSI Guideline EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods with modifications.

Evaluation of precision utilized samples that were prepared from whole blood, with hematocrit adjusted to $5 5 \%$ , and spiked with analyte at three different concentrations typical for “normal” $( 3 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , “near cutoff” $( 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and “galactosemic” $( 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Samples were analyzed over five days, one run per day, sixteen replicates of each sample per run.

To evaluate the imprecision due to multiple calibrations, two calibration curves were used with each run and each curve was used to quantify half of the replicates for each sample. This precision protocol was run using both the manual and the automatic analyzers, and precision was evaluated separately for each method.

Testing for the automated device was conducted using a single kit lot and one operator, and testing for the manual device was conducted using two kit lots, one instrument, and one operators. The results are summarized in the tables below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The claimed measuring range for the SPOTCHECK Neonatal Total Galactose Microplate Reagent Kit is 1.4 to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for both the manual and SPOTCHECK Pro (i.e. automated) methods. This range is supported by the linearity and detection limits studies.

Linearity studies were performed as recommended in CLSI Guideline EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach.

One human whole blood specimen with hematocrit adjusted to $5 5 \%$ was spiked with 50:50 mix of galactose/galactose-1-phosphate to provide 18 concentrations at equally spaced intervals. Four replicates at each level were analyzed in a single run using both manual and SPOTCHECK Pro processing.

To evaluate the data for linearity, first, second and third order regressions were performed to determine if any non-linear terms were significantly different from zero. Significance of the non-linear terms is determined through a t-test per CLSI EP6-A.

Fitted regression models for Manual method are:

Linear: $y = 0 . 9 5 5 x - 0 . 3 I \vartheta$ Second order: $\gamma = 0 . 0 0 x ^ { 2 } + 0 . 9 5 9 x - 0 . 3 6 2$ Third order: $y ^ { ' } = 0 . 0 0 x ^ { 3 } - 0 . 0 0 3 x ^ { 2 } + I . 0 3 3 x - 0 . 8 0 0$

Fitted regression models for SPOTCHECK Pro method are:

Linear: $y = I . 0 I 4 x - 0 . 7 I 0$ Second order: $\gamma = 0 . 0 0 x ^ { 2 } + I . 0 I 9 x - 0 . 7 6 8$ Third order: $y ^ { ' } = 0 . 0 0 x ^ { 3 } - 0 . 0 0 I x ^ { 2 } + I . 0 3 6 x - 0 . 8 7 I$

The t-test results for the non-linear terms of the second (b2) and third (b3) order regression analysis indicate that non-linear terms are not significant for both manual and SPOTCHECK Pro processing. Because there are no significant non-linear terms and the goal for repeatability has been met, the system is judged to be linear in the range of the LoQ to the high calibrant (1.4 to 50 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for manual and 1.4 to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for SPOTCHECK Pro).

The package insert states that values below $1 . 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and above $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ should be reported as ${ < } 1 . 4 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $> 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The kit calibrators are traceable to a purchased certified reference galactose material. Each primary stock solution and new calibrator lot is tested and compared to the reference standard stock solution, and acceptability of less than $2 \%$ difference of each new lot when compared to the standard stock solution is required for lot release.

Real-time stability including shelf-life, transport, and in-use stability studies for the entire kit are performed, including the calibrators. Additionally, accelerated stability studies are also performed separately for the entire kit (including calibrators). The study protocols and statistically calculated acceptance limits were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Stability claims include 2 years storage unopened at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and 28 days stored after reconstitution at $2 - 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) studies for the SPOTCHECK Neonatal Total Galactose Microplate Reagent Kit were conducted using CLSI Guideline EP 17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.

Limit of the Blank was calculated for a total of 60 measurements of a blank control (blank filter paper punch). The LoB was determined separately on the manual TGAL operation and the SPOTCHECK Pro.

The LoB was estimated to be:

$1 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (manual) $0 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (SPOTCHECK PRO)

The Limit of Detection (LoD) and the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were determined from low concentration (normal) samples prepared to simulate neonatal blood and spotted on filter paper and one kit lot, analyzed 30 times per plate on 2 separate plates for a total of 60 observations on each of 3 samples for both manual and SPOTCHECK Pro processing. Prior to spotting, human serum and human red blood cells are combined to approximate a representative neonate hematocrit of $5 5 \%$ . To establish the LoQ, since an estimate of bias is not assured, the following goal for Total Error (TE) was used: “imprecision at any concentration greater than or equal to the LoQ shall not exceed $2 0 \%$ . The LoD was estimated to be:

$1 . 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (manual)

$1 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (SPOTCHECK Pro)

Since the TE was less than the LoD, $\mathrm { L o Q } = \mathrm { L o D }$ . Therefore the LoQ was estimated to be:

$1 . 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (manual) $1 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (SPOTCHECK Pro)

However, the LoD for the kit was conservatively set as $1 . 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for both methods.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Potential interference from several compounds was tested according to CLSI EP07-A2. Two levels of potential interferent and three levels of total galactose (i.e., normal, near cut-off, galactosemic) were evaluated. All samples were analyzed in a single run with 8 replicates from each control and test sample set. Significant interference was defined as a percent difference from the control sample of $> 1 0 \%$ . The tested compounds are listed in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Potential Interferent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Highest tested concentration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Albumin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6000 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ascorbate</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Conjugated Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fructose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>γ-Globulin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6000 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1200 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glutathione</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>200 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mannose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sulfamethoxazole</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3264 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Trimethoprim</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Unconjugated bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

The results, as summarized in the package insert, are:

“The following substances were tested and no evidence of interference found: conjugated bilirubin up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , unconjugated bilirubin up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , protein (albumin and gammaglobulin) up to $6 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin up to $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , sulfamethoxazole up to $4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , ascorbate up to $6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , glucose up to $1 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , mannose up to $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . There is evidence that lipemia with lipid concentrations of $3 2 6 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , fructose concentrations of $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , glutathione concentrations of $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , or trimethoprim concentrations of $4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may increase assay response slightly at low (normal) levels of total galactose, but that effect was not seen at a concentration near the projected cutoff or at elevated concentrations for any of the potential interferents, and is of no clinical significance.”

Screening Study 2: A supplemental study was performed to evaluate the screening performance of the SPOTCHECK TGAL assay with 11 retrospectively collected samples from newborns with diagnosed galactosemia along with 8 manufactured samples elevated in total galactose and 161 presumed negative neonatal specimens. The samples from newborns with Classic Galactosemia were analyzed randomly amongst the presumed negative neonatal specimens and manufactured samples.

\* Nine samples screen positive with both the predicate and the SPOTCHECK TGAL Manual were from newborns confirmed to have Galactosemia. The other ten samples were the 8 manufactured samples and 2 samples from unaffected newborns (false positives).

Two samples that were GALT deficient but had normal total galactose screening during the initial screening performed in the laboratory had the following results:

$\ddagger$ One sample from a newborn confirmed to have Galactosemia was screen positive with the predicate and screen negative with the SPOTCHECK TGAL Manual. This sample was later found to be from a baby with Classic Galactosemia who had been on soy formula since birth; a sample from a baby on soy formula is known to be a cause of false negative results (noted in the limitations of the assay).

† One sample from a newborn confirmed to have Galactosemia was screen negative with both the predicate and with the SPOTCHECK TGAL Manual.

The package insert states: “Samples from infants who are on soy formula or who have not received a milk feeding prior to sampling may provide a false negative result1,2. Samples from infants who have received a blood transfusion may also lead to a false negative result.3”

ª There were two discrepant samples when measurements obtained with the proposed assay were compared to the predicate measurements. However, these samples were originally classified as screen negative sample therefore of the 180 samples tested in the supplemental study; two are false positives when the $9 9 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile is applied.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The summary of the results from the 2037 newborn specimens and 51 manufactured blood spot specimens tested with this kit is shown in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SPOTCHECKManual</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SPOTCHECK ProAutomated</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>99.5th percentile</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.5 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.9 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

The package insert includes precautionary language that each laboratory should establish their own reference range and cut-off values and that cut-offs from another galactose screening test should not be used. Also included in the labeling is the recommendation that screening presumptive positive samples be tested with a confirmatory diagnostic method and to follow local requirements for follow up testing.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
