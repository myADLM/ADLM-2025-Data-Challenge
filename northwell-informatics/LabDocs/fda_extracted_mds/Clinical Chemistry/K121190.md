) Device name:

Trade name: CONTOUR®NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System   
FDA Product Code: NBW   
Classification name: Blood Glucose Test System, Over  
the-Counter (21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1345)

Predicate device:

CONTOUR®NEXT LINK Wireless Blood Glucose Meter (ReferenCe: CONTOUR®NEXT LINK Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K110894))

)Device description:

The CONTOUR®NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a small handheld blood glucose meter that utilizes dry reagent test strips and liquid controls for the measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes. The meter together with the test strips and control solutions is referred to as the CONTOUR®NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

5) Intended Use:

The CONTOUR®NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an over the counter (OTC) device utilized by persons with diabetes in home settings for the measurement of glucose in whole blood, and is for single-patient use only and should not be shared. The CONTOUR®NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System is indicated for use with fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip and palm only.

# Bayer HealthCare

CONTOUR®NEXT Test Strips are intended for self-testing by persons with diabetes for the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood samples from 20 to 600 mg/dL.

The CONTOUR®NEXT Control Solutions are aqueous glucose solutions intended for use in self-testing by people with diabetes as a quality control check.

The CONTOUR®NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus and is not intended for use on neonates.

# Data demonstrating substantial equivalence

The CONTOUR®NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System features a small handheld blood glucose meter that is substantially equivalent in its intended use and fundamental scientific technology to the predicate, CONTOUR®NEXT LINK Wireless Blood Glucose Meter featured with the CONTOUR®NEXT LINK Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K110894). Both devices utilize the same CONTOUR®NEXT dry reagent strips and liquid controls for the measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes. Additionally, both devices utilize the same blood glucose measurement algorithm and automatic calibration. The chief differences between the devices is the removal of the ability to wirelessly transmit glucose results to an associated Medtronic device, the use of replaceable batteries as a power supply, and a different look and size for the meter.

The risk analysis methods used to assess the design of the subject device were a Hazard Analysis and Failure Modes and Effects Analyses (FMEA).

In brief summary, the risks identified as applicable to the CONTOUR®NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System are listed in the table below along with their corresponding Verification and Validation Activities' acceptance criteria and results.
