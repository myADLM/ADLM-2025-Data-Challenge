The Access AccuTnl $+ 3$ reagents, AccuTn $\cdot + 3$ calibrators and the Access 2 Immunoassay System compose the Access Immunoassay System for the quantitative determination of cardiac troponin I (cTnl) in human serum and plasma.

The Access AccuTnI+3 reagent packs contain specific reagents for the in vitro diagnostic measurement of cTnl including:

Paramagnetic particles coated with mouse monoclonal anti-human cardia troponin I suspended in TR1S buffered saline, with surfactant, bovine serum albumin (BSA) matrix, $- 0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide, and $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin® 300. 0.1N NaOH. • TRIS buffered saline, surfactant, $< 0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide and $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin 300. Mouse monoclonal anti-human cTnl alkaline phosphatase conjugate diluted in ACES buffered saline, with surfactant, BSA matrix, protein (bovine, goat, mouse), $< 0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide, and $0 . 2 5 \%$ ProClin 300.

The Access AccuTnl $+ 3$ Calibrator set contains multi-point calibrators for use with the Access AccuTnI $+ 3$ assay. Individual vials contain zero or approximately 0.3, 1.2, 5.0, 25 and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ~ ( \mu g / L ) }$ of recombinant cardiac troponin I complex, respectively, in a buffered BSA matrix, with surfactant,   
$< 0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide, and $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin 300.

The Access 2 Immunoassay System is an in vitro diagnostic device used for the quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative determination of various analyte concentrations found in human body fluids.

Conclusion: The information provided above demonstrates that the new device, the Access AccuTnl $+ 3$ Reagent and Access AccuTnl $^ { + 3 }$ Calibrators, have the same intended use as the predicate device. The Access 2 instrument has the same intended use as the predicate device. In addition, verification and validation testing, the clinical and analytical data, the clinical use of the product reflected in current MI diagnostic guidelines, and other scientific information provided in this submission demonstrate that the Access AccuTnI+3 Reagent, Access AccuTnl $^ { + 3 }$ Calibrators on the Access 2 Immunoassay Systems is as safe and effective as the predicate devices. Taken together, this information establishes the substantial equivalence of Beckman Coulter's products to predicates.

Dear Ms. Oetter:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions f the Federal FoodDrug and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and -adulteration.—Please-note:-CDRH-does-not-evaluate-information-related-to-contract-liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
