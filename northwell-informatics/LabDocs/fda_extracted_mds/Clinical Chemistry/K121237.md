# Performance Characteristics

The Cliniqa Beta HCG Control Level 1,2,3 and the Cliniqa Beta HCG Calibration Verification Controls, Levels 1, 2, 3 was evaluated for value assignment and stability. See the following sections for details.

# Traceability

Traceability is dependent on the manufacturer of the reagents used for value assignment. Calibration of the Roche Elecsys HCG plus Beta reagent is standardized against the $4 ^ { \mathfrak { t h } }$ International Standard for Chorionic Gonadotropin from the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) code 75/589.

# Value Assignment

The Mean and Expected Range for each method shall be presented in each lot-specific insert of Cliniqa Beta HCG Controls and Calibration Verification Controls. The indicated values shall be derived from analysis of vials representative of the entire lot. The raw data obtained for each method shall be averaged to obtain the Mean. The Expected Range of the Mean shall be determined by combining estimates of assay variance as determined by participating laboratory data and other currently available studies.

The Expected Range of the Mean is provided to assist the laboratory until it has established its own mean and standard deviation. The indicated Mean and Expected Range of the Mean is provided to serve only as a guide in assessing the performance of test method in laboratories.

Assignment of values shall be performed using the reagents, calibrators, and controls available at the time of assay by the manufacturer.

Real-time and accelerated stability tests were conducted to establish the shelflife and open-vial claims.

Shelf Life of the Cliniqa Beta HCG Control Level 1,2,3 is 3 years at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ Shelf Life of the Cliniqa Beta HCG Calibration Verification Controls, Levels 1, 2, 3 is 3 years at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Open-Vial Stability

Real-time testing was performed and the data support the package insert claim that the Cliniqa Beta HCG Control Level 1, 2, 3 is stable up 30 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ once opened.

Open-Vial Stability

Real-time testing was performed and the data support the package insert claim that the Cliniqa Beta HCG Calibration Verification Control Level 1, 2, 3 is stable up 30 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ once opened.

Shelf-Life Stability:

The accelerated stability testing performed at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ supports an initial shelf-life claim of 3.6 years at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { } ^ { \circ } C$ . For the Cliniqa Beta HCG Control Level 1, 2, 3 Real-time testing at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going to support a claim of 3 years.

The accelerated stability testing performed at $4 5 \%$ and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ supports an initial shelf-life claim of3.6 years at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ For the Cliniqa Beta HCG Calibration Verification Control Level 1, 2, 3 Real-time testing at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going to support a claim of 3 years.

Dear Ms. Gast:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
