# Device Name

# Predicate device

The Elecsys LH CalCheck 5 is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. We claim equivalency to the currently marketed Elecsys N-MID Osteocalcin CalCheck 5 (K112104).

# Device Description

The Elecsys LH CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of human luteinizing hormone (LH) in a human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Intended use

Comparison Table

The table below compares Elecsys LH CalCheck 5 with the predicate devices, Elecsys N-MID Osteocalcin CalCheck 5 (K112104).

# Performance Characteristics

The Elecsys LH CalCheck 5 was evaluated for value assignment and stability. See the following sections for details.

The Elecsys LH CalCheck 5 was standardized against the $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ International Standard (NIBSC) 80/552.

# Value Assignment

Value assignment testing was conducted and must pass pre-defined acceptance criteria. For each Elecsys LH CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are run in duplicate on at least three E170 analyzer measuring cells. The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzer measuring cells) of the respective CalCheck. The target value for each CalCheck is the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range is calculated as ±30% of the assigned value for levels 2 through 5. The % CV is 10% for levels 2 through 5, while level 1 is free of the analyte. The label states that each laboratory should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

To ensure the values assigned using the master platform are transferrable and valid for the other instrument platforms, the same value assignment procedure is performed on the Elecsys 2010, cobas e 411, cobas e 601, and cobas e 602 analyzers. The assigned values obtained on the additional analyzers are compared to those obtained on the MODULAR ANALYTICES E170. The median value obtained on the four additional analyzers must be within $10 \%$ EY of the master platform assigned value ( $10 \%$ for between analyzer platform tolerances). After this acceptance criterion is met, the assigned values from the master platform are deemed valid for the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, Elecsys 2010, cobas e 411, cobas e 601, and cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers.

Real-time and accelerated stability tests were conducted to establish the shelflife and open-vial claims.

Open-Vial Stability After Reconstitution:   
Real-time testing was performed and the data support the package insert claim that reconstituted Elecsys LH CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20- $2 5 \mathrm { \textdegree C }$ .

Shelf-Life Stability:

The accelerated stability testing performed at $3 5 \%$ supports an initial shelflife claim of 18 months at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } C$ Real-time testing at $2 { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going to support a claim of 36 months.

Dear Ms Adams:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please. contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796-5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (301) 796-5760. For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/Medical   
Devices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance..

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-5680 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm
