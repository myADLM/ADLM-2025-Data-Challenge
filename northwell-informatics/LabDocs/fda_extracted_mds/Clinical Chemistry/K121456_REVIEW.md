AUTION HYBRID Fully Automated Integrated Urine Analyzer (model AU- 4050)

# I. Device Description:

The AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 Fully Automated Integrated Urine Analyzer contains a test strip chemistry urine analyzer for the measurement of glucose, protein, bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrite, leukocytes, specific gravity, turbidity, and color using Uriflet 9HA test strips and a flow cytometry module that analyzes the following parameters: RBC, WBC, epithelial cells, casts, bacteria, and flags the presence of the following: pathologic cast, crystal, sperm, small round cell, yeast like cell and mucus.

# Urine Chemistry Module (CHM)

The CHM consists of an automated urine analyzer, sampler, and accessories. The sampler automatically feeds sample racks to the analyzer. The sampler contains a bar code reader for urine specimen identification. The analyzer uses reflectance spectroscopy for the measurement of the urine parameters: glucose, protein,

bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrite, leukocytes, specific gravity, turbidity, and color. Specific gravity is determined using the refractive index method, and turbidity is evaluated by measuring the transmission and scattering of light passing through the urine specimen. The CHM is designed to be used with Uriflet™ S 9HA multi-parameter test strips. The Uriflet™ S 9HA multi-parameter test strips contain reactive pads on a non-reactive plastic backing. The reactive pads are impregnated with reagents formulated to detect a specific urine analyte or characteristic. Each strip also contains a correction pad for urine color determination. The Uriflet™ S 9HA test strip (for use with the AU-4050) is identical to the AUTION Sticks 9EB test strip (for use with the AX-4030) which was cleared under k093098 with regard to specific urine analyte, reagent composition and performance. The only difference is the barcode on the bottom of the test strip which provides for exclusive use of the Uriflet™ S 9HA test strip on the AU-4050.

# Flow Cytometry Module (FCM)

The FCM consists of an automated urine particle analyzer for the analysis of microscopic formed elements in urine specimens. The FCM consists of three principal units: (1) Main Unit which aspirates, dilutes, mixes and analyzes urine samples; (2) Auto Sampler Unit supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information Processing Unit) which processes data from the Main Unit and provides the operator interface with the system. The IPU also contains a modular work area management (WAM) system for data processing and acts as an independent data manager system that interfaces with the AU-4050 and the LIS (Laboratory Information System). This data manager has the capability for patient demographics, test orders, and test results. The FCM is equipped with a Sampler that provides continuous automated sampling for up to 50 tubes. The FCM uses flow cytometry using a red semiconductor laser for analyzing organized elements of urine. Particle characterization and identification is based on detection of forward scatter, fluorescence and adaptive cluster analysis. Using its own reagents, the FCM automatically classifies organized elements of urine and carries out all processes automatically from aspiration of the sample to yielding the results.

# Test Strip Analysis (CHM) Methodology and Sample Flow

Specialized test strips are analyzed with the dual-wavelength reflectance method (one wavelength for BLD). Test strips set in the feeder are fed, one at a time, onto the test strip tray inside the instrument, and they are moved by the guide arms to the sample drop application position. After drop application, the test strip is moved to the light measurement area.

The test strip reacts within around 60 seconds of drop application, changing color, and its reflectivity is measured at that time. In the light measurement area, a 5-wavelength LED emits 2-wavelength light that shines onto the reagent pad. The light reflected from the pad is picked up by one sensor. Light from the color compensation pad of the test strip is also measured to compensate for variable factors such as the amount of reflected light and the coloration of the sample.

Specific gravity is measured by the transmission refractometry method. The turbidity/color hue measurement unit built into the instrument uses transmitted light to measure color hue. For color hue measurement, R $( 6 3 5 \mathrm { n m } )$ , G $5 2 5 \mathrm { n m } )$ and B (470 nm) light are shone onto the sample in the cylindrical cell, and the hue and shade of the sample are analyzed from the amounts of each color transmitted through the sample. The colors are YELLOW, ORANGE, BROWN, RED, VIOLET, BLUE, and GREEN, and these 7 colors each have LIGHT, normal, and DARK graduations. Additional color determinations are COLORLESS and OTHER, for a total of 23 colors. The turbidity/color hue measurement unit built into the instrument uses transmitted light and scattered light to measure turbidity.

# Flow Cytometry (FCM) Methodology and Sample Flow

This analyzer uses the flow cytometry method to analyze elements contained in urine. After the staining reaction, laser light is shone onto the sample flow within sheath flow in the flow cell, generating a forward scattered light signal, a laterally scattered light signal and a fluorescent light signal from each urine particle. These are converted into electrical signals, which are detected and used to identify each particle. The fully automated integrated urine analyzer AU-4050 uses Flow Cytometry (FCM) technology to obtain the parameters of forward scattered and forward fluorescent light of urine cells. After specific substances in the cells are given fluorescent staining and placed in suspension, they are then covered in sheath fluid and ejected through a nozzle in a single row. Here each urine cell is illuminated by a tightly focused laser beam. The individual cells fluoresce and scatter light to varying degrees. It is the analysis of these electrical signals which allows each urine cell to be discriminated by generating a one dimensional histogram, based on fluorescent intensity, and a two-dimensional scatter gram, based on fluorescent intensity and scattered light intensity.

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the urine chemistry (CHM) and the flow cytometry (FCM) portions of the AU-4050 were assessed by a 15- day precision study performed at 3 clinical laboratory sites. The CHM precision samples consisted of a highpositive control; a mid-positive control, and a negative control. Precision samples for the FCM portion of the instrument included a high and low control. Each precision sample was run in duplicate during 2 runs per day; each run was separated by at least 4 hours. Repeatability and reproducibility were calculated across 3 clinical sites, 3 users (1 per site), 3 instruments (1 per site), and 3 lots of reagents (1 per site). The data were analyzed according to CLSI EP5-A2 guidelines, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. The tables below present the combined Precision results for the urine chemistry analytes (CHM) and urine sediments/flow cytometry (FCM).

# Urine Chemistry Module (CHM)

The linear range of the AU-4050 chemistry module was evaluated by measuring negative urine and negative urine spiked with known concentrations covering the entire measuring range of each analyte present on the Uriflet S 9HA urine strip. Sample measurement was performed on 3 lots of reagent strips in replicates of 7 for a total of 21 measurements per sample tested. The spiked samples were also measured on the predicate device to confirm the results. A pH meter was used to confirm the pH results. Specific gravity samples were prepared by diluting sucrose in deionized water at 0.010 intervals from 1.000 to 1.060. Specific gravity measurements were tested in replicates of 20 on each of 3 AU-4050 analyzers. The specific gravity values were confirmed by a clinical, handheld refractometer. Color tone samples were designed and prepared in accordance with the International Commission of Illumination (CIE) XYZ color system. Color tone measurements were tested in singleton, performed over 3 separate runs on one AU-4050 analyzer for a total of 3 measurements per color tone sample. Turbidity samples were prepared at the negative, $1 +$ , and $^ { 2 + }$ ranks using a latex turbidity standard solution diluted with deionized water. Turbidity measurements were performed in replicates of 20 on one AU-4050 analyzer and one predicate analyzer. The linear range of the AU 4050 is summarized below:

# Flow Cytometry Module (FCM)

Linearity studies were performed to assess the performance of the Flow Cytometry Module (FCM) over a wide range of cell type concentrations. High and Low Pools were created by concentrating or diluting samples which spanned the full measuring range of RBC, WBC, Epithelial Cell, Cast and Bacteria parameters in accordance with CLSI EP6A approved guidelines. FCM dilution tubes were prepared by mixing low and high urine pools for each parameter to achieve a minimum of five dilution points that were evenly distributed across the measuring range for each parameter. Each tube was tested 2 to 5 times using manual mode for FCM analysis. Slope, intercept and Mean Replicate $\%$ differences were calculated for each FCM parameter. FCM Mean replicate percent difference values recovered within the maximum allowable $\%$ difference as shown below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability- Control Value Assignment

The control value assignment was performed using 3 analyzers and 3 bottles of each of the two levels of control solutions (L and H). To determine the target value of each control, for each cell type measured, a mean result was calculated from the 15 replicate results from each of the 3 analyzers. A grand mean of replicates from all three analyzers $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 4 5 )$ ) was then calculated. The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of each analyzer’s 15 replicates was calculated and checked for acceptability against the predetermined acceptance criteria for each cell type.

Stability AUTION Control Solution

Stability studies were performed to assess the open and closed bottle stability for the AU-4050 FCM controls, AUCTION Control Solutions L and H. The procedure used to evaluate open bottle stability was to assay three lots of AUCTION Control Solutions $\mathrm { L }$ and $\mathrm { H }$ stored at $1 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Testing occurred at predetermined time-points throughout the study. The procedure used to evaluate closed bottle stability was to assay a single lot of AUTION Control Solutions L and H stored at $1 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Testing occurred at pre-determined time-points throughout the study. The stability testing results demonstrated opened urine controls used on the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 are stable for 217 days.

Unopened controls used on the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 are stable for 1 year. The labeling states that the open vial stability is 30 days at $2 { \cdot } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Storage stability (closed vial) is until expiration date at $2 { \cdot } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Chemistry Module (CHM) Stability

Stability studies were performed to assess the open and closed bottle stability for the urine chemistry strips used on the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050. The procedure used to evaluate open bottle stability was to assay bi-level control materials using a single lot of ARKRAY urinalysis strips stored at room temperature in replicates of three and AUTION Check Strips in replicates of two at pre-determined time-points throughout the study. The procedure used to evaluate closed bottle stability was to assay spiked urine samples using three lots of ARKRAY urinalysis strips stored at room temperature in replicates of five at pre-determined time-points throughout the study. All testing was conducted in percent reflectance. The stability testing results revealed that opened ARKRAY urinalysis strips are stable for 31 days. Unopened ARKRAY urinalysis strips are stable for 2 years.

AU-4050 CHM Strip Sensitivity Evaluation

Study 1: Sensitivity Study 1 was done to determine the concentration at which each analyte on the Uriflet S 9HA strip changed from negative to the lowest positive color block. Samples were prepared by spiking the specified analyte into negative urine to obtain the target concentrations to determine the sensitivity between the negative color block and the next lowest color block for each analyte on the Uriflet S9HA urinalysis strip. Each analyte tested a target concentration of the analyte, plus a concentration on each side of the target in order to determine the sensitivity concentration. Each pool was spiked with the specified analyte concentration, and then analyzed in replicates of 5 on each of 3 strip lots, for a total of 30 replicates. The analytical sensitivity for each color block for each analyte is defined as the lowest concentration at which $5 5 0 \%$ of the test results are positive between the negative color block and the first positive color block. The results are summarized in the following table:

$$

Limit of Detection (LoD) Flow Cytometry Module (FCM)

The LoD for the AU-4050 was performed following CLSI EP17A. Three low concentration samples for each of the cell types measured by AU-4050 were prepared by diluting with normal saline to obtain the target concentrations. Each sample was measured 20 times on the AU-4050. Each sample was also measured 10 times on the predicate device to obtain a reference value. The

mean, SD, and LoD were calculated for each of the five cell types using the following equation: $\mathrm { L o D r 2 o B + ( 1 . 6 4 5 \times S D ) }$

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Flow Cytometry Module (FCM)

The LoQ study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP17A. The study was performed by preparing three low concentration samples for each cell type measured by the AU-4050. Each sample was measured 15 times on the AU4050 for a total of 45 replicates. A mean value was calculated for each sample. Each sample was also measured 5 times on the predicate device to obtain a reference value. The mean bias was calculated by averaging the individual sample bias. The LoQ was determined to be equal to the LoD for each of the 5 cell types measured by the FCM module of the AU-4050.

Each sample was measured on the AU-4050 in replicates of 5 and a mean result was calculated. The mean result from samples with no interfering substance was compared against the mean result of the sample spiked with the interfering substance at the stated concentrations. Interference was determined based on the acceptance criteria stated below. Negative Samples: If sample results are $1 +$ (75 for Leukocytes) or greater, interference is considered positive. $\mathsf { p H }$ results will be considered positive for interference when the results differ by greater than $+ / - 2$ ranks from the $\mathsf { p H }$ sample containing no interfering substance.

Positive Samples: If sample results differ by greater than $+ / - 1$ color block between samples containing the interfering substance and samples without it, interference will be considered positive.

# Carryover

Chemistry Module (CHM) Carryover

Carryover studies were performed to assess the amount of sample carried over by the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 CHM from one specimen reaction into subsequent specimen reactions. The procedure used to evaluate carryover was to create high and low concentrations of each analyte by spiking analytes into a negative urine pool. Testing consisted of two runs in the following order: Low 1, Low 2, High 1, High 2, Low 3, Low 4. Carryover $( \% )$ was calculated using the following formula: Carryover $\mathrm { ( \% ) } = [ \mathrm { ( L o w \ 3 ) } \cdot \mathrm { ( L o w \ 4 ) } ] / \left[ \mathrm { ( H i g h \ 1 ) } \cdot \mathrm { ( L o w \ 4 ) } \right] \times 1 0 0$ Results of the carryover testing for the urine chemistry analytes demonstrated zero carryover by the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050

Flow Cytometry Module (FCM) Carryover

Carryover studies were performed to assess the amount of sample over by the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 FCM from one specimen reaction into subsequent specimen reactions. The procedure used to evaluate carryover was to create high and low concentrations of each analyte by spiking analytes into a negative urine pool. Testing consisted of one run in the following order: High 1, High 2, High 3, Low 1, Low 2, Low 3. FCM Carryover $( \% )$ was calculated using the following formula: Carryover $\% = [ ( \mathrm { L o w ~ 1 - L o w ~ 3 } ) ] \mathrm { ~ / ~ } [ ( \mathrm { H i g h ~ 3 - L o w ~ 3 } ) ] \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 0$

Manufacturer acceptance criteria for FCM carryover are:

• Bacteria channel: $\leq 0 . 0 5 \%$ or L1 ${ \leq } 5 / \mu \mathrm { L }$ • Sediment Channel (WBC, RBC, EC, CAST): $\leq 0 . 1 \%$ or $\mathrm { L } 1 \le 5 / \mu \mathrm { L }$

Results of the FCM carryover testing meet the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria specifications.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 for the measurement of urine chemistry analytes (CHM) and urine sediment/flow cytometry (FCM) in human urine specimens. Results from the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 were compared to those from two commercially available systems, the ARKRAY AUTION MAX™ AX-4030 Automated Urine Chemistry Analyzer and the Sysmex UF- $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { { i } ^ { T M } }$ Automated Urine Particle Analyzer.

Testing was performed at three external clinical sites in the United States. Each clinical site tested approximately 640 urine samples. The urine samples for analysis in these method comparison studies were provided by the external clinical sites. Samples were collected within 2 hours of testing if maintained at room temperature or were stored for up to 8 hours prior to testing if maintained at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . In order to obtain the desired range of abnormal values, a pool of negative urine samples were spiked to elevated levels with the analytes to be evaluated. These spiked samples represent less than $1 5 \%$ of the total samples tested and are identified in the line data. A total of 1931urine samples (native urine samples $^ +$ spiked samples) were tested in parallel using the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 System, the AX-4030 and the UF-1000i. For each urine chemistry analyte and urine sediment type, the values obtained for the individual urine samples were referred to the respective cut-off values for each system to discriminate between the negative (normal) and positive (abnormal) findings, if applicable. Percent positive agreement (relative sensitivity) and percent negative agreement (relative specificity) were determined. The data are also presented in concordance charts showing percent exact agreement and percent agreement within 1 color block.

The tables below present the combined Method Comparison results for the urine chemistry analytes (CHM) and urine sediments/flow cytometry (FCM).

# N. Instrument Name:

AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 Fully Automated Integrated Urine Analyzer System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Single or continuous testing mode.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

3. Specimen Identification: Manual sample identification or Barcode reader

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

# Analysis of samples

Sampler analysis: Multiple samples are analyzed consecutively, using a sample rack. Using the Sampler Unit, sample racks can be transported automatically, and the samples analyzed sequentially. Up to ten samples can be set in one sample rack, and up to six racks (60 samples) can be set in one Sampler Unit at once. Analysis results are managed by sample number. Manual analysis (only compatible with FCM analysis parameters): Samples can be analyzed manually, without using sample racks, but only for FCM analysis. After inputting the information necessary for analysis into the IPU, the operator mixes one sample each and set the sample on the aspiration port of the Main Unit for analysis. Even when performing a sampler analysis, manual analysis can be performed by stopping the sampler analysis.

# 5. Calibration:

Automatic Background check

After the temperature has stabilized, the automatic rinsing/background check dialog box is displayed. A background check is performed. The analysis will be repeated a maximum of three times. The background analysis results will automatically be displayed in the automatic cleansing/background check dialog box. If the figure is below the allowable value, the dialog box will be closed and the Main Unit will enter stand-by status.

Specific gravity calibration

The instrument is calibrated using specific gravity standard solutions prepared by the customer (Low solution and High solution). The sponsor recommends performing specific gravity calibration once per month.

Check measurement

White Check Strips are provided by the manufacturer to verify calibration. The manufacture recommends to measure the check strips to verify that the CHM analyzer is working correctly any time CHM analysis results appear suspect.

6. Quality Control:

Recommendations for quality control are described in the labeling. Additionally, users should follow local, state and federal regulations.

CHM QC analysis

The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available controls intended for monitoring urine dipstick results for the following parameters: glucose, protein, bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrites, leukocytes, and specific gravity.

FCM QC analysis   
• AUTION Control Solution (AUTION Control Solution (H)/AUTION Control   
Solution (L))

The AU-4050 operator’s manual reads as follows:

Perform QC analysis daily at start-up according to individual laboratory standard procedures. Quality control analysis is performed to verify accuracy of instrument. For QC analysis of CHM analysis parameters, the sample racks provided can be used to analyze three types or three concentrations of control material at once. Use manual analysis for QC analysis of FCM analysis parameters. There are two levels of quality control for FCM analysis: With X-Bar control, the control material is analyzed twice in succession, and the average is used as the control data. With L-J control, the control material is analyzed once and the value is used as the control data.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above: none

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
