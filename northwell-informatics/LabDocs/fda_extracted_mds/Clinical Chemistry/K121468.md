# Device Description

Eurotrol GAS-ISE Metabolites and epoc Calibration Verification Fluids are assayed blood gas, electrolyte and metabolite reference materials, to verify the precision and accuracy of the epoc® Blood Analysis System. Eurotrol GAS-ISE Metabolites and epoc Calibration Verification Fluids are filled in 3 mL clear glass ampules.

Eurotrol GAS-ISE Metabolites provides three different physiologically relevant levels. epoc Calibration Verification Fluids provides five different physiologically relevant levels

10 ampules of the same level of Eurotrol GAS-ISE Metabolites are packed in a carton box. 5 ampules, 1 ampule per level, of epoc Calibration Verification Fluids are packed in a carton box. A product insert with Intended Use is inserted in each product box of GAS-ISE Metabolites and epoc Calibration Verification Fluids.

# Special Instruments Required

For an appropriate use of Eurotrol GAS-ISE Metabolites and epoc Calibration Verification Fluids the use of epoc® Blood Analysis System including BGE/BGEM test cards is required.

# Traceability

The different levels of Eurotrol GAS-ISE Metabolites and epoc Calibration Verification Fluids are traceable to the reference materials as shown in the table below.

# Value assignment

Multiple replicates of test samples are measured at the beginning and end of the production run on various analyzers for metabolites and on blood gas analyzers for blood gas and pH values.

Values are assigned on the epoc® system using BGEM cards for metabolites, blood gas and pH values. Values are determined by taking the mean of multiple determinations performed on randomly selected samples from each lot. Ranges are assigned using predetermined intervals. Value assignment is performed for each lot of Eurotrol GAS-ISE Metabolites and epoc Cafibration Verification Fluids.

# Stability

Real time stability was performed for the Eurotrol GAS-ISE metabolites or epoc Calibration Verification. The claimed stability is 12 months at $2 . 8 \%$ or 1 week at room temperature for unopened ampule and 30 seconds for open ampules.

Dear Ms. Kooijmans:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
