# Value Assignment:

Levels 1 and 2 are prepared so that Level 1 meets the clinically normal range of HbA1c, and Level 2 meets the clinically abnormal range of HbAlc on the manufacturer's instrument. Levels 1 and 2 are assayed in triplicate on the applicable instrument system. When the recovery falls within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the target concentration, the CONE-TROL Hemoglobin A1c Control Set is labeled and filled. QC testing for value assignment is performed for Levels 1 and 2 of control. Two vials are assayed in triplicate over a minimum of 2 days and maximum of 7 day period on the Immunoassay or HPLC test method for which the product is designed. A minimum of 6 data points for each level is required for value assignment. One instrument may be used if used on two different days or by two different operators. The mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variance is determined for each instrument for each level of control.

# CLOSED VIAL STABILITY

The shelf life for CONE-TROL HbA1c Control Set has been determined based upon accelerated stability studies to be confirmed by real time stability studies. The expiration for CONE-TROL HbA 1c Control Set is 2 years at $- 2 0 \sp { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ and for 180 days at $2 . 8 \%$ from the date of manufacture.

The product stability has been extrapolated from accelerated studies with elevated temperatures and will be confirmed by real time studies. Hemoglobin Alc concentrations were analyzed using the Tosoh G7 HPLC Analyzer. Vials were stored at $\bf { - 2 0 \% }$ and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ and values were obtained between 0 and 30 hours.

The Q Rule Table based on the Arrhenius Equation was used to estimate the shelf life during the accelerated stability study. The Q Rule states that a product's degradation rate decreases by a constant factor $( \mathbf { Q } \mathbf { = } 4 )$ every $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ decrease in temperature. For the test point to be valid the analyte activity must fall $\pm 1 0 \%$ from the initial value.

To date, real time stability studies confirm the accelerated stability studies through 210 days. Closed Vial real time stability will be monitored throughout the life of the product. Closed Vial stability data will be collected at six month intervals. For the test point to be valid the analyte activity must fall $\pm 1 0 \%$ from the initial value.

Based on the data given in Table VII-1, CONE-TROL Hemoglobin Alc Control Set will.   
be stable for 2 years when stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } C$ as specified in the product insert.

# OPEN VIAL STABILITY

The open vial, $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ stability of CONE-TROL Hemoglobin Alc Control Set has been determined from real time stability testing. HbA1c concentrations were determined using a Tosoh G7 HPLC Analyzer. CONE-TROL Hemoglobin A1c Control Set was stored as described in the package insert. Values for Hemoglobin Alc were collected through 210 days.
