# 5. INTENDED USE

The Randox Immunoassay Speciality Control (Il), Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 are intended for in vitro diagnostic use as assayed quality control material for Calcitonin, Gastrin, and Procalcitonin to monitor the precision of the laboratory testing systems listed in the package insert. This device is for prescription use only.

# 6. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

Randox Immunoassay Speciality Control (l) is manufactured at three levels, Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.

Each control is prepared from human serum with added constituents of human origin, chemicals, stabilizers and preservatives. They are supplied in lyophilised form in 5x1ml vials and require reconstitution with 1ml of distilled water.

The analyte concentrations in each of the three levels have been chosen to span a range that includes the chemically significant or medical decision level(s). The analyte concentrations have been reviewed by a panel of experts to ensure that the concentrations are clinically relevant for use in routine hospital laboratories.

# 8. SUMMARY OF STABILITY STUDIES

Opened: Store refrigerated $1 + 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ In reconstituted serum, Procalcitonin is stable for 1 day, Gastrin and Calcitonin are stable for 8 hours at $\yen 200$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } C$ if kept capped in original container and free from contamination. The control is stable of frozen once for 28 days at $\angle 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . Only the required amount of the product should be removed. After use, any residual product should not be returned to the original vial.

Unopened: Store refrigerated $( + 2 0 0$ to $+ 8 0 0 )$ . Stable to the expiration date printed on individual vials.

# 9. SUMMARY OF VALUE ASSIGNMENT

The value assignment for Calcitonin, Procalcitonin and Gastrin is performed at Randox Laboratories. The analysis is carried out on selected analysers. Two vials of sample are analyzed by running five replicates of each vial over the course of 2 days using the normal procedures for calibration on each day.

The mean value generated from the 20 replicates is used as the assigned value and ranges are set as $+ 1 - 2 5 \%$ of the assigned value.

The acceptance criteria for data is $\%$ coefficient of variation $\leq 1 5 \%$ .

Re: k121603 Trade/Device Name: Randox Immunoassay Speciality Control (Il) Levels 1, 2 and 3 Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660 Regulation Name: Quality control material Regulatory Class: Class I, reserved Product Code: JY Dated: October 11, 2012 Received: October 15, 2012

Dear Dr. Armstrong:

We have reviewed your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
