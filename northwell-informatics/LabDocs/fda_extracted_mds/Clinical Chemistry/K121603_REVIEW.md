# I. Device Description:

Randox Immunoassay Speciality Control (II) is manufactured at three levels, Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Each control is prepared from human serum with added constituents of human origin, chemicals, stabilizers and preservatives. They are supplied in lyophilized form in ${ 5 } \mathrm { x l m l }$ vials and require reconstitution with 1ml of distilled water.

Human source material from which this product has been derived and has been tested at the donor level for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV1 & HIV2) antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and were found to be non-reactive based on FDA approved methods.

# Stability

Shelf-life and open-vial stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. Closed vial (shelf-life) stability at the recommended storage temperature of (2 to $8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) was demonstrated based on accelerated stability. Closed vials are stable until the date printed on individual vials. Real-time closed vial stability studies are on-going. In reconstituted serum Procalcitonin is stable for 1 day, Gastrin and Calcitonin are stable for 8 hours at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ if kept capped in original container and free from contamination. The control is stable if frozen once for 28 days at - $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . All storage recommendations are provided in the labeling.

# Value Assignment

Value assignment was determined for each analyte contained in the Randox Speciality Immunoassay Control (II) Levels 1, 2 and 3 using multiple analyzer platforms.

Value assignment data were collated and an appropriate target value was assigned to each analyte based on the average of the observed values. Ranges were then assigned as $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the target. The labeling states that obtained values should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific value sheets and that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.
