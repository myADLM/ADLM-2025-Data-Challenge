# Device name

ACCU-CHEK Inform II Blood Glucose Monitoring System consisting of:

Meter: ACCU-CHEK Inform II Meter Test Strip: ACCU-CHEK Inform II Test Strip Controls: ACCU-CHEK Inform II Control Solutions Linearity Kit: ACCU-CHEK Inform II Linearity Test Kit

Common name: whole blood glucose test system   
Classification name: Glucose dehydrogenase, glucose (21 C.F.R. $\$ 862.1345)$ EPY   
Product Codes: LFR, Glucose Dehydrogenase JJX, Single (specified) analyte controls (assayed and unassayed)

# Predicate device

The ACCU-CHEK Inform System presented in k003846 is the predicate for the ACCU-CHEK Inform lI system.

The controls solutions presented in the ACCU-CHEK Aviva 510(k) submission (k043474) are the predicate for the ACCU-CHEK Inform II control solutions.

The Nova StatStrip Glucose Linearity Kit (receiving clearance in k060345) is the predicate for the ACCU-CHEK Inform II Linearity Kit.

The ACCU-CHEK Inform II System includes the following components and accessories: Meter, Code Key Reader, Base Unit (with power supply) test strips, and controls.

When an ACCU-CHEK Inform II test-strip is inserted into the ACCU-CHEK Inform II meter, a small alternating current (AC) is applied until the application of blood causes a spike in the conductivity to be observed at the measurement and sample-sufficiency electrodes - both are used to assure an adequate sample has been applied.

The instrument then applies a series of AC voltages at four frequencies and reads the AC responses. These carry information about the sample type and environmental temperature; they also allow the system to perform various internal quality checks.

After the AC measures are completed, a small (DC) voltage is applied and current is observed which is proportionate to the glucose. The AC and DC information are then combined to provide a hematocrit and temperature compensated glucose result.

ACCU-CHEK Inform II System is the first point-of-care glucose meter featuring wireless conncctivity functionality. Unlike the predicate device, ACCU-CHEK Inform II meter has the capability of direct data transfer right after each measurement, thus ensuring actual patient data to appear on the doctor's desk shortly after these data have been created at the bedside. It is understood that a transfer of data can only occur, when a stable communication with the Data Management System has been built up by the devices before transfer of data.

The glucose meter system has been designed in a way that its connectivity feature is virtually invisible to the opcrator. Only the appearance of an icon at the lower edge of the touch screen display indicates potential radio frequency activity to allow new information on control material or strip code files to be downloaded.

Even when there is no wireless WLAN available, the ACCU-CHEK Inform II meters work fine as long as the necessary information like operator list, strip code, and control lot is available. The device can store as many as 2000 measurement results in its memory which will be transferred as soon as there is a stable connection to the WLAN and no measurement operation pending.

# ACCU-CHEK Inform II System

The ACCU-CHEK Inform II Test strip are for use with the ACCU-CHEK Inform II meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in venous whole blood, arterial whole blood, neonatal heelstick, or fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of glucose control. The system is not for use in diagnosis or screening of diabetes mellitus, nor for testing neonate cord blood samples.

The ACCU-CHEK Inform II Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is intended for multiple-patient use in professional healthcare settings. This system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices.

The multiple-patient use ACCU-CHEK Inform II Blood Glucose Monitoring System will consist of:

√ Meter: ACCU-CHEK Inform II Meter . • Test Strip: ACCU-CHEK Inform II Test Strip √ Controls: ACCU-CHEK Inform II Control Solutions

The ACCU-CHEK Inform II Controls are intended for quality control performance checks on the ACCU-CHEK Inform II system with ACCU-CHEK Inform II test strips.

The ACCU-CHEK Inform II Linearity Test Kit is intended for use for periodic verification of linearity of the ACCU-CHEK Inform II system using ACCU-CHEK Inform 1I test strips.

6) Substantial equivalence

The ACCU-CHEK Inform II Test System is substantially equivalent to the ACCU-CHEK Inform Test System.
