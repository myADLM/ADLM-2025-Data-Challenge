# 8. SUMMARY OF STABILITY STUDIES

OPENED: Store refrigerated $( + 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } C ^ { \cdot }$ Microalbumin is stable for 28days if kept capped in the original container and free from contamination. Only the required amount of product should be removed.

UNOPENED: Store refrigerated $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ . Stable to the expiration date printed on the individual vials.

# 9. SUMMARY OF VALUE ASSIGNMENT

10 reps were run on the following analysers, Hitachi 717, Cobas Mira, RX Daytona and Dimension. One lot of previous control material was assessed to validate the run. A target was assigned based on the average of all the results from the various analysers and a range of $+ 1 - 2 0 \%$ was applied.

The $0 \%$ and $\%$ recovery error result should fall within the range shown below.
