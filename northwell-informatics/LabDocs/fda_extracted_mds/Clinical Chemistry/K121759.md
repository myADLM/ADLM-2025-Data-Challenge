# Value Assignment

CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control is value assigned on the Abaxis Piccolo Express Analyzer using Piccolo Xpress panels. Each panel is a self-contained plastic disc with reagents. Intelligent Quality Control and bar coded calibration are built in to each reagent disc. The panels used to value assign CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control include but are not limited to: Lipid Panel Plus, Cat. No. 400-0030; Hepatic Panel, Cat. No. 400-0026; General Chemistry 13, Cat. No. 400-0029; Renal Panel Plus, Cat. No. 400-0027; Basic Metabolic Panel Plus, Cat. No. 400-0031; Liver Panel Plus, Cat. No. 400-0003; Metlyte +CRP, Cat. No. 400-0034.

Endogenous analytes were value assigned on the Roche Cobas Mira Plus and Mindray BS-200 using Kamiya and Sekisui reagents.

Values are assigned by assaying 6 randomly selected vials from each manufacturing lot. Vials are measured in duplicate and across 2 or more instruments for each Abaxis Xpress panel listed above. Value assignument is performed within 30 days of manufacturing date. Vials used for value assignment are to be tested within 5 days after product is thawed.

# Performance Testing:

The closed vial stability of CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ has been determined from real time stability testing. CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control was stored closed vial at 2-8°C, as described in the package insert, for 33 days. Results indicate acceptable stability through 33 days.

The open vial stability of CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control at 2-8°C has been determined from real time stability testing. After opening, CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathbb { C }$ for 15 days. To simulate expected handling conditions, vials were removed from refrigerator daily (excluding weekends), opened, and returned to refrigerator. Results indicate acceptable stability through 15 days.

The shelf life of CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control at ${ < } . 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ has been determined from real time stability testing. CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control was stored closed vial at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } C ,$ , as described in the package insert, for 254 days. Results indicate acceptable stability through 254 days. Real time studies will be ongoing to support the shelf life of this product.

# Summary:

The information provided in this pre-market notification demonstrates that CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control is substantially equivalent to Liquid Assayed Multiqual Control (k0i 1867). Substantial equivalence was demonstrated through comparison of intended use and physical properties to the commercially available and analytical predicate device. The information supplied in this pre-market notification provides reasonable assurance that the CONE-TROL Liquid Chemistry Control is safe and effective for its stated intended use.

Dear Mr. Cone:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
