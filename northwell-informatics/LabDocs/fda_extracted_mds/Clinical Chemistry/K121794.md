# 4.0 Description of Device

Liquichek Urine Chemlstry Control is prepared from human urine with added constituents of human and animal origin, chemicals, preservatives and stabilizers. The control is provided in liquid form for convenlence

# 5.0 Value Assignment

The mean values and the corresponding $\pm 3 \mathrm { s o }$ ranges printed in the insert were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for thls lot of product. The tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of this lot of product. It is recommended that each laboratory establlsh its own acceptable ranges and use those provided only as guides. Laboratory established ranges may vary from those listed during the life of this control. Varlations over time and between laboratorles may be caused by differences in laboratory technique, instrumentation and reagents, or by manufacturer test method modifications.

# 6.0 Intended Use

Liquichek Urine Chemistry Control is intended for use as an assayed quality control urine to monitor the precislon of laboratory testing procedures for the analytes listed In the package insert.

# 7.0 Comparlson of the new device wlth the Predicate Device

Liquichek Urlne Chemistry Control claims substantial equivalence to the Liquichek Urine Chemistry Control currently in commercial distribution (Ko20817). Table 1 (below) contains comparlson information of similarities and differences between the new and predicate device to whlch substantial equivalence is clalmed.

# 8.0 Statement of Supporting Data

Stability studies have been performed for Liquichek Urine Chemistry control to determine the open vial and shelf life claims. Product claims are as follows:

Open Vial: 30 days at 2 to ${ \mathfrak { z } } { \circ } { \mathbf { \vec { C } } }$ . Shelf Life Stabillty 24 Months at $z ^ { \circ } C$ to ${ { \pmb 8 } ^ { \circ } } { \sf C }$

# 9.0 Conclusion

Liqulchek Urine Chemlstry control is intended to be used for the same purpose as the predicate device. It has the human urine matrix and performs similarly as the predicate device.

All supporting data is retained on file at Blo-Rad Laboratories.

Dear Suzanne Parsons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
