Predicate Device(s):

Ahlstrom 226 Specimen Collection Paper - K062932 Whatman 903 Specimen Collection Paper - pre-amendment device

# Device Description:

PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection Device is designed to provide a uniform surface for the collection of blood spots. A drop of blood is applied to the filter paper and allowed to soak through the paper. The sample is then air dried and sent to a laboratory for further analysis.

The PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection contains Ahlstrom 226 filter paper that is made from $100 \%$ pure cotton linters with no wet-strength additives added and conforms to the Recognized Standard CLSI LA4-A4. The Ahlstrom 226 filter paper has four performance characteristics that can be assessed with lysed or intact red blood cells; blood absorption time, blood spot diameter, serum absorption volume and homogeneity. Physical properties of the Ahlstrom 226 filter paper monitored during manufacturing are basis weight, $\mathfrak { p H }$ and ash content. Basis weight should be 110 lb $) \pm 5 \%$ per ream $( 1 7 9 \ \mathrm { g / m ^ { 2 } } \pm 5 \% )$ . A ream is defined as 500 sheets $2 4 ^ { \circ } \times 3 6 ^ { \circ }$ (ASTM D646-96). The pH should be 5.7 to 7.5 (Test method ISO 6599:1981). Ash percent limit is a maximum of 0.1% (Test method A of ASTM D586-97a). Ahlstrom (manufacturer of paper) name and lot number appears on the PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection Device along with a PerkinElmer specific lot identifier.

When used in newbom screening, the PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection Device demographic form should contain (at a minimum) the following information.

Infant's name [last (and first available)]   
• Mother's first and last name Gender Birth date (optional: include time of birth) Date of specimen collection Infant's age (indicate if less than 24 hours; optional: include address and phone number) Patient ID number (e.g., medical record number; optional: include address and phone number) Birth weight Submitter's ID and address (optional: include birth facility Physician's name (healthcare provider) and telephone number Name of newborn screening program and address Unique non-repeating serial number   
• Expiration date of specimen collection device Appropriate number of preprinted circles Manufacturer and lot number of the filter paper Manufacturer or printer of the Sample Collection Device

The Ahlstrom 226 filter paper component is supplied to PerkinElmer Health Sciences where production of the final device which involves printing on the filter paper, affixing the filter paper to the carrier device to provide rigidity and, if required, affixing a tear-apart form for the collection of demographic information is performed. Depending on the end uscrs requirements the final device may be only the printed filter paper with carrier device or printed filter paper with carrier device and demographic form which may be comprised of multiple sheets.

# Intended Use:

The PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection Devices are intended to be used as a medium to collect and transport whole blood specimen spots to a laboratory, in newborn screening. The device includes a tear-apart form for the collection of demographic information.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection Device is substantially equivalent to Ahlstrom 226 Specimen Collection Paper (K062932) device. The follow table provides a summary of device comparison.

# Performance Characteristics:

The FDA recognized consensus standard for the device is the CLSI LA4-A4: Blood Collection on Filter Paper for Newbom Screening Program; Approved Standard. The standard describes four physical properties of the filter paper and acceptance criteria for each. Additionally the CLSI LA4-A4 requires the printing ink and printing process must not interfere with the analytic test procedure. The PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection device meets the requirements specified in the CLSI standard.

# Physical Properties:

1. Absorption capacity as measured by serum retention volume of a 1.8 inch paper punch taken from a dried blood spot. A range of $1 . 3 7 - 1 . 7 1 \mu \mathrm { L }$ is considered acceptable.

Ahlstrom paper lot 1 (mean) 1.477 μL Ahlstrom paper lot 2 (mean) 1.443 μL

2.Homogeneity of the filter paper lot (spot-to-spot and sheet-to-sheet variability). To perform this test, blood samples tagged with $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { { I } }$ labelled T4 are applied to the filter paper. Samples (punches) of the filter paper are removed from pre-defined areas within the same lot and between lots. By measuring the amount of $^ { 1 2 5 } \Im$ labelled T4, the homogeneity of the lot is calculated using a hierarchical, nested analysis of variance technique. An F-test is used to test equivalence of the mean values of the lots of paper. A p value of greater than 0.05 is considered acceptable.

Ahlstrom paper lot 1 EMPY $\pmb { \mathrm { p } } \mathbf { = } \pmb { 0 } . 9 3 7$ Ahlstrom paper lot 2 E $\scriptstyle \mathtt { p } = 0 . 6 0 7$

3.Diameter of the circle for the dried blood aliquot. A range of 15-17 mm left to right and top to bottom is considered acceptable. .

Ahlstrom paper lot 1 (mean) 15.98 mm Ahlstrom paper lot 2 (mean) 16.75 mm

4Absorption time for a $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ blood aliquot. A range of 5 - 30 seconds is considered acceptable.

Ablstrom paper lot 1 (mean) 7.88 seconds Ahlstrom paper lot 2 (mean) 12.74 seconds

5. Printing ink and printing process: No clinically significant interference was observed with the analytic test procedure of four representative newborn screening assays incorporating immunometric, competitive and enzymatic methodologies.

# Assay Performance:

The population data $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { N } = 2 0 0 0 )$ (device type) provided by a U.S. newborn screening laboratory during the process of transitioning from the Whatman 903 Specimen Collection Paper to thc PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection Device was analyzed. The analysis showed a non-significant clinical difference in population median values of 2-

$10 \%$ for all 12 analytes tested. The products tested included NeoGram Amino Acids and Acylcarnitines Tandem Mass Spectrometry test system, AutoDELFIA 17OHP, IRT and T4 kits, Neonatal GALT kit, and Neonatal Biotinidase kit. Hemoglobinopathy data acquired with the Bio-Rad VARIANTnbs Newborn Screening System as showed similar frequency results within the same population.

Based on test results for the GSP Neonatal hTSH and 17OHP kits, the AutoDELFIA Neonatal T4 kit and the Neonatal Total Galactose kit with spiked samples; no interference from the printing ink or printing process was observed.

# Conclusion:

The information provided in this premarket notification demonstrates that the PerkinElmer Sample Collection Device is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices; and satisfies the requirements of CLSI LA4-A4.
