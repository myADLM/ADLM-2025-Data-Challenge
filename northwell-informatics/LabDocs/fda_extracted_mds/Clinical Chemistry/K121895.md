# Device Name

Proprietary name: (1) Elecsys HSV-2 IgG Immunoassay (2) Elecsys PreciControl HSV

Common name: (1) HSV-2 IgG () PreciControl HSV

Classification name: (1) Class 2, 21 CFR 866.3305, Herpes simplex virus serological assays (2) Class 1, 21 CFR 862.1660, Quality control material (assayed and unassayed)

Predicate Device: Focus HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Immunoblot IgG (K000238)

# Device Description

(1) Elecsys $\mathrm { H S V } { - } 2 \mathrm { I g G }$ is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles, biotinylated recombinant HSV-2-specific antigen labeled with a ruthenium complex and electrochemiluminescence detection. This assay is a qualitative test based on a cut-off formula dependent on the negative and positive calibrators. Cut-off index (COl) is based on the ratio of assay signal to cut-off signal (also abbreviated $\mathsf { s } / \mathsf { c o }$ . COI values greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered positive for the presence of anti-HSV-2 IgG antibody. Results are determined using a two-point calibration. The test system contains the human serum-based calibrators intended for use with the system.

(2) Elecsys PreciControl HSV contains lyophilized control serum based on human serum. The controls are used for monitoring the accuracy of the Elecsys HSV-2 IgG immunoassay.

Note: The reagent and calibrators are packaged together in the Elecsys HSV.   
$2 \ \mathrm { I g } \mathrm { G }$ assay, while the associated PreciControl is packaged separately.

# Intended Use/Indications for Use

# Elecsys HSV-2 IgG Immunoassay:

The Roche Elecsys HSV-2 IgG immunoassay is a test for the in vitro qualitative determination of IgG class antibodies to HSV-2 in human serum and lithium-heparin plasma, $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA plasma, and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma. The test is intended for sexually active individuals and expectant mothers as an aid in presumptive diagnosis of HSV-2 infection. The predictive value of positive or negative results depends on the population's prevalence and the pretest likelihood of HSV-2. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay "ECLIA" is intended for use on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

This test is not FDA cleared for screening blood or plasma donors.

The performance of this assay has not been established for use in a pediatric population, neonates and immunocompromised patients or for use at point of care facilities.

# Elecsys PreciControl HSV:

The Elecsys PreciControl HSV is used for quality control of the Elecsys HSV-2 IgG immunoassay on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

# 510(k) Summary, Continued

# Substantial Equivalence

The Elecsys HSV-2 IgG immunoassay test system is substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in the United States.

(1) Elecsys HSV-2 IgG Immunoassay is equivalent to HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Immunoblot, MRL/Focus Diagnostics (K000238).

(2) Elecsys PreciControl HSV is equivalent to the Elecsys PreciControl Anti-CCP (K081338).

Dear Ms. Adams:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed

predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http:/www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use

# Device Name: Elecsys HSV-2 IgG Immunoassay and PreciControl HSV

Indications for Use:

# Elecsys HSV-2 IgG Immunoassay

The Roche Elecsys HSV-2 IgG immunoassay is a test for the in vitro qualitative determination of $\mathrm { I g G }$ class antibodies to HSV-2 in human serum and lithium-heparin plasma, ${ \sf K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA plasma, and ${ \sf K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma. The test is intended for sexually active individuals and expectant mothers as an aid in presumptive diagnosis of HSV-2 infection. The predictive value of positive or negative results depends on the population's prevalence and the pretest likelihood of HSV-2. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay "ECLIA" is intended for use on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

This test is not FDA cleared for screening blood or plasma donors.

The performance of this assay has not been established for use in a pediatric population, neonates and immunocompromised patients or for use at point of care facilities.

# Indications for Use

# Elecsys PreciControl HSV

The Elecsys PreciControl HSV is used for quality control of the Elecsys HSV-2 IgG immunoassay on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
