The predicate device used to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the Dimension® Alkaline Phosphatase Calibrator (ALPI CAL) is the Dimension Vista® Alkaline Phosphatase Calibrator previously cleared under k061818.

# G. Device Description:

The ALPI method employs alkaline phosphatase that catalyzes the transphosphorylation of pnitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) to $\mathfrak { p }$ -nitrophenol (p-NP) in the presence of the transphosphorylating buffer, 2 amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). The reaction is enhanced through the use of magnesium and zinc ions. The change in absorbance at $4 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ due to the formation of p-NP is directly proportional to the ALP activity, since other reactants are present in non-rate limiting quantities and is measured using a bichromatic (405, 510 nm) rate technique.

# Analytical Specificity/Interferences

The ALPI method was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline  Second Edition. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference.
