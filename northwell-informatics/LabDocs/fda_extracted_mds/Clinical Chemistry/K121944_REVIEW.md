# I. Device Description:

LIAISON $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Direct Renin is an in vitro diagnostic device consisting of reagents provided in individual compartments within a plastic container called the Reagent Integral and reagents supplied ready to use in vials. The Reagent Integral includes: magnetic particles $( 2 . 3 \mathrm { m l } )$ and conjugate ( $[ 1 3 \mathrm { m l }$ ). The assay configuration allows performance of 100 tests. The components, provided in the unitized Reagent Integral include: PMP (paramagnetic particles) and conjugate. The two calibrators A and B are provided in the same box, but separate from the Reagent Integral. The calibrators are made from recombinant human renin, phosphate buffer, BSA, an inert yellow dye, preservatives and antibiotics. The calibrators are lyophilized and must be reconstituted using distilled water prior to use. L1AISON@ Control Direct Renin kit consisting of two levels of control materials are made from recombinant human rennin phosphate buffer, BSA, preservatives and antibiotics. Control level 1 is intended to provide an assay response characteristic of low level patient specimens (target value: $1 5 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ). Control level 2 is intended to provide an assay response characteristic of high level patient specimens (target value: $5 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ).

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None identified

# L. Test Principle:

The method for the quantitative determination of renin is a sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay that uses two anti-renin monoclonal antibodies. One specific mouse monoclonal antibody is coated on the magnetic particles (solid phase), that recognizes both renin and prorenin; another monoclonal antibody (specific for renin) is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminolantibody conjugate). During the incubation, renin bound to the solid phase and a sandwich is formed only in the presence of renin molecules that bridge both antibodies. The unbound material is removed with a wash cycle during post-incubation period. Finally a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced by a starter reagent and the light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) using LIAISON $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A twenty day reproducibility/precision study was performed to demonstrate the precision of the assay using six (6) EDTA plasma samples and two controls that were measured multiple times at three different locations. These studies were tested on two lots of L1AISON $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Direct Renin - 2 lots at each site in two replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 operating days. The overall results are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Panel ID#</td><td>N</td><td>mean pg/mL</td><td>within run SD</td><td>within run</td><td>Total/Across Lots/Across Sites</td><td>Total/Across Lots/Across Sites %CV</td></tr><tr><td>Level 1</td><td>480</td><td>14.4</td><td>0.94</td><td>%CV 6.6%</td><td>SD 1.44</td><td>10.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>480</td><td>55.3</td><td>0.75</td><td>1.4%</td><td>2.49</td><td>4.5%</td></tr><tr><td>POOL1</td><td>480</td><td>12.8</td><td>0.42</td><td>3.3%</td><td>1.22</td><td>9.5%</td></tr><tr><td>POOL2</td><td>480</td><td>31.7</td><td>0.87</td><td>2.7%</td><td>1.81</td><td>5.7%</td></tr><tr><td>POOL3</td><td>480</td><td>53.0</td><td>1.17</td><td>2.2%</td><td>2.50</td><td>4.7%</td></tr><tr><td>POOL4</td><td>480</td><td>78.8</td><td>0.91</td><td>1.2%</td><td>3.21</td><td>4.1%</td></tr><tr><td>POOL5</td><td>480</td><td>110.0</td><td>2.79</td><td>2.5%</td><td>5.66</td><td>5.1%</td></tr><tr><td>POOL6</td><td>480</td><td>166.0</td><td>2.32</td><td>1.4%</td><td>9.90</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>6.0%</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A total of 12 serial diluted concentrations were tested in replicates of four ranging between 2.0 to $3 0 9 . 1 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ to examine the linearity of the study.

A linear regression result is showed as Y (Obtained) $= 1 . 0 0 8 \mathrm { X }$ (Expected) $^ +$ 0.27, $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R = } 0 . 9 9 8$ between expected and observed concentration for all dilutions of each pool.

The data provided support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this assay is 2.1 to $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# c. Traceability:

The assigned renin values of the assays are traceable to the WHO reference materials (68/356).

# Stability Studies:

The stability of the calibrator and control are based on real-time stability study data. The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The shelf-life of calibrator and control are stable until expiration date (18 months) at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ .

# Open vial stability:

After reconstitution, calibrator is stable for 2 weeks at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ and control is stable for 8 weeks at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

The initial lot of calibrator materials is value assigned through an internal procedure. The value ranges of calibrator A and B are $5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 ~ { \mathrm { p g / m l } }$ and 85-125 $\mathrm { p g / m l }$ respectively. The calibrators will be tested using the assay and they must fall within above target ranges. Otherwise, the calibrators will be adjusted by dilution.

The value of control materials was assigned through an internal procedure. The procedure includes 1) Check of the bulk preparation 2) Check after lyophilization and value assignment using approved Reagent Integral lots to assign the target value 3) Check after labeling and packaging.

The target values of Control level 1 and 2 are $1 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and $5 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ respectively.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were calculated based on CLSI EP17-A.

Five aliquots of calibrator matrix (without renin) were tested in triplicates in four runs with two different kit lots on two different instruments (60 determinations per lot), and used to calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB) on each kit lot, as ${ \bar { 9 } } 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile. The overall assay’s LoB is the higher of the two kit lot LoBs.

$\mathrm { L o B } = \mathrm { M e a n } + 1 . 6 7 1 ^ { \ast } \mathrm { S D }$ where SD is the mean standard deviation. The LoB was calculated to be 0.1.

Then four samples at low renin level were tested in triplicates in four runs with two different kit lots and instruments. The results of two lots were used to calculate the Limit of Detection (LoD) (48 determinations per lot) of each assay lot. The overall assay’s LoD is the higher of the two kit lot LoDs.

$\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 8 ^ { * } \mathrm { S D }$ where SD is the mean standard deviation. The LoD was calculated to be 1.03.

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined as the mean concentration at which the mean $\% \mathrm { C V }$ exceeded $20 \%$ . It was calculated by testing six specimens at low renin doses and assayed in 72 determinations on two different kit lots and two different instruments. The mean, standard deviation, and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ was then determined for each sample. The LoQ was calculated to be 2.1.

The data provided support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this assay is 2.1 to $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

A n interference study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. No significant interference was observed when samples were spiked with the following potential interference substances. These testings were based on CLSI-EP07-A2 guideline. Non-significant interference was defined as difference from control (unspiked sample) within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Results of the interference study are summarized in the table below.

A hook effect study was performed using 3 high renin concentration samples, out-of-range (up to $6 0 9 . 7 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ). Samples were serially diluted in reninstripped plasma and Liaison $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Endocrinology Diluent. The neat sample and the dilutions were tested in triplicates using one kit lot on one Analyzer. For each sample the signal obtained were plotted versus the concentration and no hook effect were observed with Renin concentration up to $6 0 9 . 7 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .
