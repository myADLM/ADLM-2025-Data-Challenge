# L. Test Principle:

The LIAISON $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4 assay’s method for quantitative determination of FT4 is based on the Solid Phase Antigen Linked Technique (SPALT) principle. A T4-protein conjugate is coated on the magnetic particles (solid phase), and a monoclonal anti-T4 antibody is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the incubation, FT4 competes with the T4-protein-conjugate for the binding sites on the labeled antibody. After incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminolantibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely proportional to the FT4 concentration present in calibrators, patient samples or controls. All assay steps and incubations are performed automatically by the LIAISON $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision performance of the DiaSorin LIAISON FT4 assay was evaluated by a twenty day reproducibility/precision study performed at DiaSorin Inc. and 1 external site according to CLSI EP05-A2 using a panel of 4 frozen serum samples that contained 2 samples each at FT4 concentrations of medium (1.21 and $1 . 9 1 \ \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ and high (5.67 and $5 . 8 4 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ ). All samples were tested on one lot of reagent, in two replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicate results per sample. The LIAISON Control Thyroid Level 1, 2 and 3 (Kit Control) were also tested in the study.

The 20 day results for a typical site are summarized below.

The sponsor performed an additional 5 day study at DiaSorin and 1 external site to support the precision performance of this assay at FT4 concentrations that approximate the medical decision points.. Samples were assayed once per day in replicates of 12 for a total of 60 replicate results per sample.

The 5 day results for a typical site for one lot are summarized below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor provided a linearity study with one run using one lot of reagents with each sample tested in replicates of 4. Eleven diluted samples with FT4 concentrations evenly distributed were prepared by diluting a high FT4 sample. This yielded linearity samples with FT4 levels that spanned a range from 0.12 to $7 . 7 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The sponsor calculated linear regressions from mean observed values versus expected values using an unweighted regression model and observed maximum $\%$ difference from observed values versus linear fit of $10 \%$ .

The fitted linear model regression is:

Measured $\mathrm { F T 4 } = 1 . 0 2 5 \ : ( \mathrm { E x p e c t e d } \ : \mathrm { F T 4 } ) + 0 . 0 8 4 , \mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 8 .$

Based on this linearity study and the limits of detection study (below), the sponsor claimed that the measuring range of this device is $0 . 2 9 - 7 . 7 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

Currently there is no reference method for the FT4 assay. The LIAISON FT4 assay kit calibrators are traceable to concentrations of internal primary reference standards of a synthetic T4 antigen in T4-stripped human serum prepared by symmetric dialysis.

# Stability:

LIAISON FT4 assay kits are stable for two weeks, when stored either on board at $1 2 { - } 1 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or at refrigerated conditions of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . LIASON FT4 assay kits are stable for at least 12 month (shelf life) when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.

Value assignment of the calibrators and controls:

The kit calibrators (level 1 and 2) are manufactured by diluting a stock solution of T4 with a human serum based matrix. The kit calibrators are tested with a specific reagent lot against the master standards (10 points) to assess the FT4 concentration. The target ranges of the calibrators are: Calibrator 1 is between $0 . 4 5 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 0 . 5 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$   
Calibrator 2 is between $5 . 0 - 7 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

Controls for FT4:

The controls (level 1 and 2 and 3) are prepared from pooled human serum with added constituents of human serum, pure chemicals and therapeutic drugs. The controls are tested on 3 LIAISON analyzers, using two reagent lots for a minimum of 3 days to yield a minimum of 60 valid test results. FT4 mean values and standard deviations are calculated from the results. The target ranges are established using the mean values $\pm \nobreakspace 3 8 \mathrm { D }$ . The target values

of the controls are: Control 1 is targeted to $1 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ Control 2 is targeted to $3 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ Control 3 is targeted to $6 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor provided a detection limits study to determine the LoB, LoD, and LoQ for the FT4 assay.

# LoB Test Protocol

One blank sample was tested on 2 LIAISON® Analyzers with 2 reagent lots and 2 technicians over 4 runs (three replicates/sample/run) yielding 60 results.

# LoD Test Protocol

Four samples in the range of the LoB to 4 times the LoB were tested on 2 LIAISON® Analyzers with 2 reagent lots and 2 technicians over 4 runs (three replicates/ sample/run) yielding a minimum of 192 results.

LoQ Test protocol

Eight samples with FT4 concentrations ranging from the LoB to 4XLoB were tested using two analyzers by two technicians using 3 reagent lots over several days generating 40 results per sample. LoQ was defined as inter-assay precision of $< 2 0 \%$ CV. The sponsor claimed the following detection limits:

$\mathrm { L o B } = 0 . 0 6 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ $\mathrm { L o D } = 0 . 1 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ $\mathrm { L o Q } = 0 . 2 9 \mathrm { n g / d L } .$

The Liaison FT4 assay has a measuring range of 0.29 to $7 . 7 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

i. Interference from endogenous substances.

Interference testing was performed to determine whether the presence of endogenous substances such as hemoglobin, triglycerides, rheumatoid factor, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin may interfere with assay results. Two human serum samples were used with FT4 concentrations of $1 . 0 { - } 1 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ and $2 . 5 - 3 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . Each sample level was spiked with a single high concentration of interferent. The spiked results were used to calculate the $\%$ recovery (measured concentration compared to FT4 concentration with zero interferent). Non-significant interference is defined as within $\pm 1 0 \%$ recovery for the tested analyte concentrations when compared against the non-spiked sample. The non-significant interference substances with the highest

concentration tested are summarized in the table below.

# ii. Interference from cross-reactive substances.

The sponsor assessed the following substances for cross-reactivity according to their internal protocol: D-T4, 3-iodo-L-Tyrosine, 3,5-diiodo-L-Tyrosine, and $^ { 3 , 3 ^ { \circ } , 5 , 5 ^ { \circ } }$ -tetra-iodothyroacetic acid by triplicate measurement of spiked samples in T4-free zero sample and evaluating displacement versus a T4- spiked sample. Results are summarized in the table below.

# iii. Interference from common drugs

Ten human serum samples divided into two aliquots were used with FT4 concentrations ranging from 0.878 to $1 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . One aliquot was not spiked with any drugs and was used as the reference sample. The remaining samples were spiked with the respective amount of drug. Then the concentration of FT4 was determined using two kit lots compared to the reference aliquot. FT4 recovery was within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for the tested analyte concentrations. Nonsignificant interference is defined as within $\pm 1 0 \%$ recovery for the tested analyte concentrations when compared against the reference sample. Nonsignificant interference was found at therapeutic concentration of any of the following drugs: salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, phenylbutazone, diphenylhydantoin, amiodarone, 8-anilino-1-napthalene sulfonic acid ammonium salt, furosemide, iopanic acid, and DL-propranolol.
