# 4. Device Description(s):

# Method

The LOCl vitamin B12 method is a homogeneous, competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathsf { L O C l @ }$ technology. LOCl® reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and biotinylated intrinsic factor (IF). The first bead reagent (Chemibead) is coated with a B12 derivative and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibead) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The patient sample is pretreated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and dithioerythritol (DTE) to release the serum B12 from its carrier proteins. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is added to convert all the forms of B12 into a single, cyanocobalamin form, and dicyanocobinamide is added to keep the B12 from rebinding with the carrier proteins. After the sample pretreatment, the biotinylated IF and chemibead reagents are added sequentially to the reaction vessel. Vitamin B12 from the sample competes with the B12-chemibead for a limited amount of biotinylated IF. Sensibead reagent is then added and binds to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathsf { n m }$ EY generates singlet oxygen from the Sensibeads which diffuses to the Chemibeads triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the concentration of vitamin B12 in the sample.

# Calibrator

LOCI 4 CAL is a multi-analyte liquid, frozen, product containing Ferritin from human liver, Folate, and Vitamin B12. CAL A is a HEPES buffer solution whereas CAL B - E are prepared in a bovine serum albumin base.

The kit consists of ten vials, two each of five levels containing 2 mL per vial. Description of the manufacturing, value assignment and stability testing processes are provided.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

# Method

The VB12 method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of vitamin B12 in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista $\otimes$ System. Measurements of vitamin B12 are used in the diagnosis and treatment of anemias of gastrointestinal malabsorption.

# Calibrator

The LOCI 4 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the LOCI Ferritin (FERR), LOCI Folate (FOL) and LOCI Vitamin B12 (VB12) methods on the Dimension Vista System.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed:

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

# Method

The Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Dimension Vista® VB12 method and the predicate Roche Elecsys Vitamin B12 Assay are both in vitro diagnostic immunoassays intended for the measurement of vitamin B12 in serum and plasma.

Reproducibility testing was conducted for the Dimension Vista® VB12 method in accordance with the CLSl/NCCLS Approved Guideline for User Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices EP5-A2. For each test level, a single test from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day for 20 days. The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations were calculated by the analysis of variance method.

Typical precision observed for the Dimension Vista® VB12 method is summarized below:

A method comparison between the Dimension Vista® VB12 assay and the Vitamin B12 assay on the Roche Elecsys $\textcircled{8}$ System was performed with one hundred sixty-two (162) native serum samples across the proposed assay range. The samples ranged from 69 to $1 8 2 9 \ p g / m L$ on the Roche Elecsys, and 60 to $1 9 6 3 \ p g / m L$ on the Dimension Vista $\textcircled{8}$ and included thirty-two (32) samples with known Intrinsic Factor Binding Antibody (IFBA) titers ranging from 7 to 133.85 U/mL.

Passing-Bablok regression analysis of the results yielded the following:   

<table><tr><td colspan="4">Passing - Bablok Regression</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>Bias -7.64</td><td>-17.89</td><td>95% CI to -0.48</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>to 1.004</td></tr><tr><td>Proportional</td><td>0.985</td><td>0.965</td><td></td></tr></table>

The correlation coefficient, using least squares regression, for this data set (R) is 0.993

# Conclusion:

The Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Dimension Vista® VB12 method and the predicate Roche Elecsys Vitamin B12 Assay method (K060755) are substantially equivalent based on their intended use and performance characteristics as described above. The calibrator products, the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics modified Dimension Vista® LOCl 4 calibrator and the predicate Dimension Vista@ LOCl 4 (K071224) are also substantially equivalent in its design and intended use with their respective assay systems.
