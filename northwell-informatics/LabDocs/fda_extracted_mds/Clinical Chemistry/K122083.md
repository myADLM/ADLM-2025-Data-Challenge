# b. Linearity/assay reportable range

The linearity study of CK NAC SL. reagent was performed according to CLSI protocol EP6- A. From this study, a measuring range from 10 to $1 7 1 4 \downarrow 1 \downarrow$ has been determined. Manual dilution 1 to 10 allows an upper linearity of CK NAC SL reagent to 17140 U/L.

# c. Traceability

For calibration, a multi-parametric calibrator named ELITech Clinical Systems ELICAL 2 (manufactured by SEPPIM under product code CALI-0580) must be used. Its value is traceable to the iFCC method (Schumann, 2002), by manual measurement. The values of these control materials are traceable to the IFCC method (Schumann, 2002), by manual measurement.

# d. Stability

# Real-time stabilities:

On board stability for the ELITech Clinical Systems CK NAC SL was established by real time studies on the ELITech Clinical Systems Selectra ProM. The on-board stability of the reagent is 28 days. The shelf-life of CK NAC SL reagent has been followed in the real time

for 14 months on 3 different batches.

Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k041227). The following is claimed for stability: Before reconstitution, the shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol 1 and Elitrol 11 is 30 months at $2 . 8 \%$ After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when stored at $1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ , 5 days when stored at $2 . 8 \%$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { - } } 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $1 5 ^ { \circ } C$ .

Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k033501). The following is claimed for stability: Elical 2 is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored at $2 . 8 \%$ prior to reconstitution. After reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at $1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ ,2 days at $2 . 8 \%$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { \Omega } } ^ { 2 5 ^ { \circ } }$ and $. 1 5 \textdegree$ . The labeling stated that the Elical 2 should be stored tightly capped and protected from light when not in use.

# Value Assignment

Elitrol I and Il are value assigned using multiple Vital Scientific PRO M analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of Level I and Il are the median of the observed values range. After validation of the target value, a confidence range (high and low values) is then calculated.

Elical 2 is tested against predetermined values on multiple Vital Scientific PRO M using the CL NAC SL reagent and 2 levels of quality control material. The mean analyte value is calculated and a target value is assigned.

# e.Detection limit

Determined according to CLSl protocol EP17-A (Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantification; Approved Guideline).

Limit of Detection (LoD) of CK NAC SL obtained from 15 measurements of 4 samples with a low concentration of analyte (approximately 4 x LoB \~ 2.4 U/L) is 1 U/L.

Limit of Quantification (LoQ) of CK NAC SL obtained from 15 measurements of 4 samples at nominal concentration 5 U/L is 5 U/L.

# f. Interference/analytical specificity

Interferences due to unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, triglycerides, acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, acetylsalicylic acid were investigated following the recommended sample levels in CLSI EP7-A2 protocol (Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second Edition).

The results of testing interferences are the following:

Concentration up to 30.0 mg/dL unconjugated bilirubin, 29.5 mg/dL unconjugated bilirubin, and 3133 mg/dL triglycerides do not show any significant interference for each substance. Non-significant interference is defined as within ± $10 \%$ recovery. Likewise, concentrations up to 30 mg/dL acetaminophen, $2 0 . 0 \ : \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L }$ ascorbic acid and 200 mg/dL acetylsalicylic acid do not show any significant interference for each substance. Non-significant interference is defined as within ± $10 \%$ recovery.

The following statement will also be included in the labeling:

Other compounds may interfere. Users should refer to the two following literature

12. Performance Characteristics - Comparison Studies

# a. Method comparison
