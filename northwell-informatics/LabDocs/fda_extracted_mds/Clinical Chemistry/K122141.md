# Device Name

Proprietary name: IDS-iSYS IGF-I Calibration Verifier   
Common name: IGF-I Calibration Verifier   
Classification: 21CFR862.1660, Single (specific) analyte controls   
(assayed and unassayed),   
Regulatory Class: Class I, reserved   
Product Code: JJX

# Predicate Device

The IDS-iSYS IGF-I Calibration Verifier is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. We claim equivalency to the currently marketed Elecsys hGH CalCheck 5 (k103221)

# Device Description

The IDS-iSYS IGF-I calibration verifer matrix is composed of a buffer solution containing bovine serum albumin with sodium azide as a preservative. The IGF-I peptide is added to this matrix and the resulting solution is lyophilised.

# Intended Use

The IDS-iSYS IGF-I calibration verifier is a device intended for the verification of calibration of the IDS-iSYS IGF-I assay when performed on the IDS-iSYS multi-disciplined automated analyzer.

# Performance Characteristics

The ID-iSYS IGF-I Calibration Verifier was evaluated for value assignment and stability. See the following section for details.

# Traceability

The IDS-iSYS IGF-I calibration verifier is traceable to the NIBSC code: 02/254 international standard.

# Value Assignment

IDS-iSYS IGF-I Calibration Verifiers value assignment is performed as follows.

For each lot of the IDS-iSYS IS-3900 IGF-I assay kit available, a minimum of 15 assay runs is requested. Those runs must be performed using at least 3 independent iSYS machines. A minimum of 3 assay runs per iSYS machine is required.

Reagents, controls and samples are prepared according to the IDSiSYS IGF-I Assay Instructions for Use IS-3900 and the IDS-iSYS IGF-I Control Set Instructions for Use IS-3930.

# 510(k) Summary continued

Each run consists of one iSYS calibration using the IDS-iSYS IGF-I IS-3900 Assay Reagent Cartridge, IDS-iSYS IGF-I IS-3900 Calibrators and the IDS-iSYS IS-3930 Control Set followed by samples (Calibration verifiers to test) and controls. Samples and controls are tested in triplicate.

For each Calibration Verifier, the final result reported is the mean value of all valid runs.

The customer acceptance range is calculated from the mean value based on $8 \%$ (standard deviation) for all Calibration Verifier.

# Stability

IDS-SYS IGF-I Calibratin Verifs stabilityesting was/is performed on the IDS-iSYS automated analyzer.

Shelf-life stability The accelerated stability testing supports an initial shelf-life claim of 6 months at 2-8°C. Real time testing at 2-8°C is on-going.

Stability after reconstitution:

Real time testing was performed and supports the following claims: Reconstituted IDS-iSYS IGF-I calibration verifiers are stable for up to 2.5 hours on the board the IDS-iSYS. The IDS-iSYS IGF-I calibration verifiers are not stored on board the analyzer.

# Conclusion

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.

Dear Mr. Fenton:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosimetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling. and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIl (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse évents) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
