# I. Device Description:

# ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Total Protein Standard $\mathbf { 1 0 0 m g / d L }$ :

ELITech Clinical Systems URINE TOTAL PROTEIN Standard $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is an aqueous solution ready to use containing bovine albumin at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and sodium azide $( < 0 . 1 \% )$ .

# ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Control Bi-Level:

ELITEch Clinical Systems URINE CONTROL BI-LEVEL is a liquid solution prepared from human urine supplemented with constituents of human and animal origin, chemicals, preservatives and stabilizers for quality control of urine total protein. These controls are prepared exclusively from the human urine where each urine donation is tested individually and found to be negative for HbsAg and to antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/HIV-2 according to FDA-approved methods.

Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k020817) with no change to the content and the packaging except the labeling change.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None cited.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i. Traceability: The ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Total Protein Standard $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is traceable to NIST SRM 927.

ii. Stability: Accelerated and real-time testing (on-going) have been conducted using multiple lots of the ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Total Protein Standard $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . In addition, open vial stability has been evaluated. The claimed stability for closed vial shelf life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Total Protein Standard $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is 18 months when stored at $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open vial stability is 3 months when stored at $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stability study protocols and the sponsor defined acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable.

iii. Value assignment: Value assignment of the ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Total Protein Standard $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is obtained by assaying the new calibrator sets as unknowns, run in triplicate on one each of the Selectra Pro analyzers. The mean is calculated based upon comparison with an already approved calibrator lot and control materials. The newly assigned values are validated against reference materials, the previous lot of standard, and controls. The value assignment protocols and the sponsor defined acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Control Bi-Level

i. Stability: Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k020817) with no change to the content and the packaging except the labeling change. The sponsor claims the following stability determined by the provider is: Closed vial 24 months at $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , open vial—30 days at $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . ii. Value assignment: Value assignment was determined for urine total protein using multiple analyzer platforms. Value assignment data were collated and an appropriate target value was assigned to each analyte based on the average of the observed values. Ranges were then assigned as $+ / - 2 0 \%$ of the target. The labeling states that obtained values should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific value sheets and that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.
