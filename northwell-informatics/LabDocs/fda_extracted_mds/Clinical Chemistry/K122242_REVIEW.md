a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

There is no international standard available for CA 15-3. The Elecsys CA 15- 3 II CalCheck 5 was initially standardized against the Elecsys CA 15-3 assay. This in turn was standardized against CA 15-3 RIA by Fujirebio Diagnostics.

# Value assignment:

For each Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5 kit manufactured, value assignment for each level was tested once a day on Modular Analytics E170 analyzers (with two modules and two measuring cells) for a total of eight runs on two days. The MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 master calibration curve was used to calculate $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ from counts. The assigned target value of each CalCheck is the median of the observed values. The assigned range $1 \mathrm { { s } } \pm 2 1 \%$ of assigned value, in which $8 \%$ was allotted for between-analyzer platform tolerance, $8 \%$ for stability tolerance and $5 \%$ for precision of the assay. The representative summary data for the value assignment process for lot that used in the submission on E170 are shown below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Target Value[U/mL]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Median Value[U/mL]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Assigned Value[U/mL]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>AssignedRange</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.65</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤ 2.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤2.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>19.6  30.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>150</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>159</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>159</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>126-192</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>240</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>198-303</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Check 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>306</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>306</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>242  370</td></tr></table>

For Elecsys 2010, the same value assignment procedure was performed. The assigned values obtained on this analyzer were compared to those obtained on the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170. The acceptance criterion for analyzerto-analyzer variability is less than $10 \%$ . The results showed that the values assigned to the E170 (and cobas e 601, e 602) are valid for the Elecsys 2010 (and cobas e 411).

# Stability:

Stability studies were performed on cobas e 411 in order to verify the stability claims for the Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5. Because these studies are not analyzer-dependent, these results, in addition to real-time stability study results, can be applied to the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, cobas e 601 and cobas e 602.

Open vial (after reconstituted) stability:

The open-vial stability of Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5 was performed by testing the on-test and reference materials in duplicate. The on-test material was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (in an open vial). The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The recovery of test material was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The data support the claimed stability – reconstituted Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# On-Board stability:

The CalCheck products are not stored on-board the analyzer. No on-board stability claims are made.

# Closed vial stability:

The accelerated stability study was performed to verify the stability claims for the Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck. The on-test material was stored lyophilized at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks (stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The recovery of test material was calculated as a

percent of the reference value.

In addition, the real time stability is on-going. The test material is stored at 2- $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Sample at time-points 0, 10, 16, 19, 25, and 37 months will be tested in duplicate and the recovery value will be calculated by comparing to the unstressed reference value (stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ ).

The results from the accelerated stability and on-going real time stability support an initial shelf-life claim of 18 months when the Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5 is stored under normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Dilution Study:

A dilution study was performed to demonstrate that the values are within the assay’s measuring range of $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L } - 3 0 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ if CalCheck level 1 and 5 produce results that exceed the reportable measuring range of the assay, . Check 1&2 and Check 4&5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in duplicates. Results are summarized in the following table and both CalCheck dilution values are within the assay’s measuring range after dilution.
