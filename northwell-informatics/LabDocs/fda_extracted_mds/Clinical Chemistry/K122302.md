EGTA prevents calcium interference by preferentialchelation of calcium present in the sample. A surfactant system is included toremove protein interference.The ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System consists of two major components,the chemistry instrument and an integrated Panel PC. The instrument accepts thephysical patient samples, performs the appropriate optical or potentiometricmeasurements on those samples and communicates that data to an integral PanelPC. The Panel PC uses keyboard or touch screen input to manually enter a varietyof data, control and accept data from the instrument, manage and maintain systeminformation and generate reports relative to patient status and instrumentperformance. The Panel PC also allows remote download of patient requisitionsand upload of patient results via a standard interface.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Indications for Use:</td></tr><tr><td>Intended Use:</td><td>The ACE Magnesium Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of magnesium concentration in serum using the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System.

System throughput will be higher when the test workload includes ISE's. The instrument has a capacity of 40 reagent containers on board. A reagent cooling system maintains the reagents at 12°C during instrument operation. Reagent containers are identified by computer coded labels to simplify system operation. All reagents in the system must include an identification label on the container. Sample and reagent sensing notify the operator of a depleted condition during operation. The system performs analysis at a reaction temperature of 37°C. An electrolyte subsystem capable of measuring sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations is included. Primary draw tubes may be introduced one at a time into the system for closed tube sampling. Positive tube identification can be achieved with an</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>optional barcode scanner. An aliquot volume sufficient for all tests ordered is transferred and stored and the closed tube is returned to the user. Sample cups are introduced to the system one at a time or by sample ring segment. Disposable cuvettes are loaded in bulk and then automatically injected as needed by a cuvette hopper system. The ACE Axcel clinical chemistry optical system is capable of monitoring a maximum of 48 cuvettes at one time. The absorbance optical system is capable of absorbance measurements in a linear range of 0.0 to 2.0 absorbance units (at 0.67 cm pathlength). Sixteen wavelengths are measured simultaneously using a photodiode array.</td></tr><tr><td>Performance Data:</td><td>Performance data for the Alfa Wassermann ACE Reagents run on the Alfa Wassermann ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System included precision, accuracy, and detection limit data.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">5.8%. correlation coefficients of 0.9919 to 0.9959, standard error estimates of 0.09 to</td><td>ACE Magnesium Reagent Precision: In testing conducted at four magnesium levels for ≥21 days, the within- run CV ranged from 1.9 to 6.7%, and total CV ranged from 2.8 to 7.5%.

Dear Dr. Katz:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the-device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (S) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
