# 6. Predicate Devices:

The predicate device used to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the Dimension $\mathfrak { P }$ Alkaline Phosphatase (ALPI) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge is the ADVIA $\mathfrak { P }$ Chemistry Alkaline Phosphatase AMP Method previously cleared under k991576.

The predicate device used to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the Dimension Vista® Alkaline Phosphatase Calibrator (ALPI CAL) is the Dimension Vista Alkaline Phosphatase Calibrator previously cleared under k061818.

# 7. Device Description:

The ALPI method employs alkaline phosphatase that catalyzes the transphosphorylation of pnitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) to $\mathfrak { p }$ -nitrophenol (p-NP) in the presence of the transphosphorylating buffer, 2 amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). The reaction is enhanced through the use of magnesium and zinc ions. The change in absorbance at $4 0 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ due to the formation of $\mathfrak { p }$ -NP is directly proportional to the ALP activity, since other reactants are present in non-rate limiting quantities and is measured using a bichromatic (405, 510 nm) rate technique.

The ALPI CAL is a one (1) level, liquid calibrator. It is packaged as a kit of three vials of Calibrator A (Level 2) with $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial. The product matrix is a human serum albumin based product containing alkaline phosphatase from porcine kidney. Level lis a zero level (system water). Level 2 contains alkaline phosphatase at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ .

This product is sold separately from the Flex $\mathfrak { W }$ reagent cartridge. Values are assigned to new lots from a Masterpool that is from an International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference.

# 8Intended Use:

The ALPI method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of alkaline phosphatase in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista $\mathfrak { Q }$ System. Measurements of alkaline phosphatase or itsisenzymes are used n the diagnosis and treatment of liver, bone, parathyroid, and intestinal diseases.

ALPI CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of alkaline phosphatase (ALPI) method on the Dimension Vista® System.

9. Indication(s) for Use: Same as Intended Use

# Analytical Specificity/Interferences

The ALPI method was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline  Second Edition. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference.

Studies were also performed following CLSI EP7-A2 for Interference Testing of exogenous substances at an alkaline phosphatase concentration of 286 U/L and 799 U/L and were found not to interfere with the

ALPI method when present in serum and plasma. Inaccuracies (biases) were all less than $1 0 \%$ See Dimension Vista® ALPI Instructions for Use for a full list of substances tested.

Limit of Blank, Limit of Determination and Limit of Quantitation

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline. Studies were performed on the Dimension@ clinical chemistry analyzer with the following results:

# Calibrator Stability and Value Assignment:

For opened products, once the cap is removed, assigned values are stable for 7 days stored on the Dimension Vista® System.   
Once cap is removed, assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Do not use this vial on board the instrument.

The shelf life of the Dimension Vista $\mathfrak { P }$ Alkaline Phosphatase Calibrator (ALPI CAL) is 12 months. For unopened product, see the expiration date on the calibrator carton.

Calibrator value assignments for anchor pools were assigned by a reference laboratory using the IFCC reference method. Masterpools are assigned in-house from anchor pools and commercial lots are assigned from the Masterpools using Dimension Vista $\otimes$ System.

13. Conclusion: The Dimension Vista® Alkaline Phosphatase (ALPI) Flex $\otimes$ reagent cartridge with the associated Dimension Vista® Alkaline Phosphatase Calibrator (ALP CAL) are substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the ADVIA $\otimes$ Chemistry Alkaline Phosphatase AMP assay and Dimension Vista® Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) calibrator respectively.
