# L. Test Principle:

The Preferred Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses an electrochemical method. It is based on the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood using amperometric method, which detects the current produced from glucose oxidation. Glucose in the sample mixes with specific chemicals on the test strip producing a small amount of electrical current. The meter measures the current and displays the corresponding blood glucose level in the sample. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The repeatability study was performed by a single operator in one day using lithium heparin anti-coagulated venous whole blood at five different glucose concentrations. The final glucose concentrations for the blood sample were confirmed by YSI 2300. Each sample was tested ten times on ten meters using three lots of test strips (each meter tested with three test strips lots). Thirty measurements were obtained per meter and three test strip lots, and a glucose concentration $\scriptstyle ( 1 = 3 0 0$ per concentration level). The results are summarized below:

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.

Twenty four potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were evaluated by spiking lithium heparin anti-coagulated venous whole blood with three levels of glucose concentrations within the ranges 50 – 100, 200 - 275 and 400 -500 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ (measured by YSI). The blood samples were spiked with the potentially interfering compounds and tested on five meters using three test strip lots. Several concentrations of the interfering substances were tested. The interferent concentrations tested in this study were higher than the therapeutic and toxic levels. Bias was calculated as the individual percent difference in glucose reading between the test (individual measurements) and control (mean value) concentration groups. Significant interference is defined by the sponsor as a bias $\geq \pm 1 0 \%$ of the test samples from the control group.

The sponsor claims no significant interference $( < 1 0 \%$ difference) for the substances and concentrations shown in the table below for both the devices:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Accuracy study was performed by healthcare professional using capillary whole blood from the fingers, palm, forearm, upper arm, thigh and calf of 100 patients. The samples (concentration range tested from 52.9 to $3 8 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were tested in singlicate using two meters and one lot of test strips ${ \bf \dot { n } } = 2$ per sample). In addition, the sponsor tested ten altered venous samples to include five samples with glucose concentration between 40.0 to $4 8 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and another five samples with glucose concentration between 437 to $4 4 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Venous blood samples from each participant were collected in parallel to measure the plasma glucose concentration by YSI.

Hematocrit of each sample was determined. All capillary blood sample results were compared to YSI. The studies met ISO 15197:2003 accuracy criteria, e.g. $9 5 \%$ of glucose results $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and for samples $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ , $9 5 \%$ of results were within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the reference method.

Lay User Performance Study:

Lay user studies for fingerstick, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh were performed by 150 lay users and healthcare professional using fresh capillary blood samples. Labeling was provided only in English and users followed it to perform the testing. The lay user first performed the testing followed by the healthcare professional of the finger, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh. Then, immediately after the above tests were completed (within 5 minutes), venous whole blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes, plasma was separated, and tested on YSI. The samples were tested using two meters and one lot of test strips (out of 3 lots in use alternatively). All results were compared to the YSI. The studies met ISO 15197:2003 accuracy criteria, e.g. $9 5 \%$ of glucose results $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were within $\pm$ $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and for samples $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $9 5 \%$ of results were within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the reference method. Results are summarized below:

Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the control solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges. Low level control solution is provided with the complete kit. The meter only kit label states that control solutions are not included, and must be purchased separately.

# P. O therSupportiveInstrum entPerform anceCharacteristicsDataNotCovered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by recruiting 150 lay users (aged 25-75 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit containing labeling in English for the US market. Participants varied in age, education, country of origin, and both men (n $= 1 1 0$ ) and women $( \mathtt { n } = 4 0 )$ ) were included in the study. These lay users also completed a questionnaire to indicate whether the device is easy to use and the Instructions for use were written in a way that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded that the device is very easy to use.

2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the labeling (User Guide, test strip package insert, quick reference guide and control solution package insert) were written at grade levels ranging from $7 . 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $8 . 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade.

3. Customer service is available 24 hours, 7 days a week. The telephone number is 1-800- 243-2636 for customer support.

4. The effect of different hematocrit levels on the accuracy of the Prodigy Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using ten meters in duplicates using two lots of test strips. Blood samples (anticoagulant lithium heparin) at six hematocrit levels from $20 \%$ to $60 \%$ (15, 20, 30, 40, 60 and $6 5 \%$ ) were evaluated in five concentrations of glucose of approximately 42.8, 77.5, 127, 200 and $3 1 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (measured by YSI). Individual glucose measurements were compared to the reference method (YSI) and $40 \%$ HCT. The sponsor calculated individual %bias vs. YSI and $40 \%$ HCT. Results demonstrated that hematocrit levels between 20 to $60 \%$ do not significantly interfere with glucose measurements.

5. Minimum sample volume study was provided by testing a range of volumes between 0.5 to $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) of heparinized venous blood samples (at five glucose concentration levels – 40, 77, 112, 177 and $3 3 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , measured by YSI) using eight meters and two lots of test strips. Individual glucose measurements were compared to the reference method (YSI), and percent bias were calculated. Results demonstrated that the Prodigy Meter and Prodigy No Code Test Strips require a minimum sample volume of $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ for obtaining accurate results.

5. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures ranging from $5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ to $1 0 4 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F }$ ( $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $4 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ ) and relative humidity between 10 to $8 5 \%$ R.H. using three glucose concentration levels of heparinized venous blood (49, 150 and $3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , measured by YSI), seven meters and three lots of test stips. Individual glucose measurements were compared to the reference method (YSI), and percent bias were calculated. Results demonstrated that glucose measurements on the Preferred BGMS were not affected at temperatures ranging from $5 0 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } F }$ to $1 0 4 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F }$ ( $1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and relative humidity between 10 to $8 5 \%$ R.H.

6. The effect of altitude on the accuracy of the device was evaluated on the Prodigy Preferred Blood Glucose Monitoring System with three meters and three test strip lots. A range of altitudes (298, 2920, 4790, 6234, 8536 and 11161 feet) was tested using heparinized venous blood samples (at five glucose concentration levels – 49, 120, 152, 253 and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , measured by YSI). Individual glucose measurements were compared to the reference method (YSI), and percent bias were calculated. Results demonstrated that glucose measurements on the Preferred BGMS were not affected up to an altitude of 11,161 feet (3,402 meters).

7. The Preferred Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for home use by single person. Disinfection studies were performed on the Preferred meter to determine the robustness of the meter to the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Dispatch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towel with Bleach (EPA Reg. No. 56392-8) was validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the Preferred meter. The sponsor demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the Preferred meter after 5000 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate an estimated 31 cleaning and disinfection cycles per week over three years of use at home by a single person,. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions on the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

8. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by AUDIX Technology Corporation and a certificate of conformity was issued to Prodigy Diabetes Care LLC on December 25, 2012.
