The system also contains radio frequency (RF) functions for the transmitting of BGM results to compatible Medtronic Minimed insulin pumps. The RF function can also serve as a pass through for data being transmitted from Medtronic Minimed insulin pumps to Medtronic’s Minimed PC based data management software.

The Contour NEXT LINK Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the following components:

· ContouR NEXT LINK blood glucose meter · Contour NEXT blood glucose test strips · Contour NEXT control solution – Level 1 · Contour NEXT control solution – Level 2

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The Contour NEXT LINK wireless blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the strip. The blood sample is drawn into the tip of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and potassium ferricyanide. Electrons are generated, producing a current that is proportional to the glucose in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is displayed. No calculation is required.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The meter and test strips are identical to the predicate previously cleared in k110894. Therefore, the performance testing from the predicate submission is applicable to the Contour NEXT LINK Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
