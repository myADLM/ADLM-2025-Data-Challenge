3. Product Code: JIX - calibrator, multi-analyte mixture Panel: Clinical Chemistry

# F. Predicate Device:

The predicate device used to demonstrate substantial equivalence is the Dimension Vista® LOCI 7 Calibrator, Models: K6456 and KC605, cleared under k100344.

# G. Device Description:

The RAPIDPoint® 500 System consists of four (4) calibrators contained in the measurement cartridge and wash/waste cartridge that are used to calibrate the following analytes: pH, partial pressure of oxygen $( p 0 _ { 2 } )$ , partial pressure of carbon dioxide $( p \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 } )$ , Sodium $( N a ^ { + } )$ , Potassium $( K ^ { + } )$ ,ionized Calcium $( C a ^ { + + } )$ , Chloride (Cl), Glucose (Glu), total hemoglobin (tHb) and Lactate (Lac). There is no unique calibration measurement for Neonatal Bilirubin (nBili) as the tHb calibration is used.

The measurement cartridge contains the following calibrators: 200 Cal, Reagent C and Low Sulfite Zero Cal. The wash/waste cartridge contains the wash reagent.

# H. Intended Use:

The RAPIDPoint® 500 System measurement cartridge with calibrators is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the analytes on the RAPIDPoint® 500 System. The analytes measured are partial pressure of carbon dioxide $( p \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 } )$ , partial pressure of oxygen $( p 0 _ { 2 } )$ , pH, Sodium (Na\*), Potassium $\{ \kappa ^ { + } \}$ , ionized Calcium $( C a ^ { + + } )$ , Chloride (Cl), Glucose (Glu), total hemoglobin (tHb), Neonatal Bilirubin (nBili) and Lactate (Lac).

# K. Value Assignment:

Calibrator values are assigned by multiple measurements using multiple test systems such a flame photometry, mass spectrometry and others.

# L. Stability:

The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were included and testing data met predetermined acceptance criteria. The following table lists the stability/shelf life for each calibrator:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Calibrator</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Stability/Shelf Life</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>200 Cal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12 months at 2° to 8°C</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low Sulfite Zero Cal(LSZC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12 months at 2° to 8°C</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reagent C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15 months at 2° to 30°C</td></tr></table>
