D. Intended Use:

The Nova One Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose in venous, arterial and fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and forearm. It is intended for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is intended for multiple-patient use in a professional healthcare setting as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control program. This system should only be used with singleuse, auto-disabling lancets. The Nova One Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, and it is not intended for use on neonates. Alternative site testing on the forearm should be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

Nova One Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the Nova One Blood Glucose Monitors for quantitatively measuring glucose in venous, arterial and fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and forearm.

E. Limitation Statement:

Venous and arterial whole blood collected in heparin tubes or syringes may be used for testing. EDTA is not recommended for use with the Nova One. Mix blood thoroughly before testing.

F. Device Description:

# Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor

The monitor is a hand-held testing device that works in conjunction with Nova One glucose test strips to measure glucose in a whole blood sample. Monitor operation is self-prompting using three user interface buttons. In addition to measuring glucose, the monitor also stores patient test and quality control test data.

The self-prompting menu system is navigated by means of a three-button keypad. It offers audible feedback for user inputs, and audible and/or visual feedback for prompts and user alerts.

A "battery low" warning will alert the user to change the batteries.Battery charge state informaton is available on the "monitor status screen". The user can select the auto shutoff option to conserve power when the monitor is not in use.Test data and monitor setup information will be stored in a nonvolatile format to prevent data loss.

# Nova One Blood Glucose Test Strips

The test strips contain a reaction layer that contains a glucose-enzyme (greater than 1.0 lU) and ferricyanide as a mediator and wlutilize glucose dehydrogenase flavin-adenine dinucleotide (GDHAD) chemistry. The test strip is touched to a drop of blood to initiate the test process.The strip is designed such that when a drop of blood is touched to the end of the strip, the blood is drawn into the reaction space via capilary action. A simple one-step process provides a blood glucose result.Ten tet strips wll be provided with the meter kit and will also be available separately in vials of 5 strips. These test strips are manufactured by Nova Biomedical and identical to those cleared for market with the predicate Nova Max One Blood Glucose Monitor System (K1 12638).

# Control Solutions

The control solutions are aqueous assayed solutions, containing buffered D-Glucose, viscosityadjusting agent, preservatives and other non-reactive ingredients (dye).They contain no products of human origin.There are three levels of controls.One level of control (Level ) wll be supplied with the monitor kit and all three levels will be available for sale separately from the monitor. These controls are manufactured by Nova Biomedical and identical to those cleared for distribution with the predicate Nova Max One Blood Glucose Monitor System (K112638).

G. Summary of Technological Characteristics:

The Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor is the same device cleared in K112638 (Nova Max One Glucose Monitor System) and has the same fundamental scientific technology. The Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor is substantially equivalent to the Nova Max One Blood Glucose Monitor.

The Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor measures glucose electrochemically as described in K112638 (Nova Max One Glucose Monitor System). In the same manner, the magnitude of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample, providing a quantitative measure of glucose in whole blood and control solutions.

H. Predicate Device:

K112638 - Nova Max One Blood Glucose Monitor System . K080641 - Home Diagnostics Inc. TRUEresult Blood Glucose Monitor System

I. Comparison to Predicate Devices:

The Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor is identical to the previously cleared Nova Max One Blood Glucose Monitor (K112638). It has the same fundamental scientific technology. The indication for use has been expanded to include whole venous and arterial blood, as well as capillary blood.  No changes were made to any of the components of the system as compared to the cleared system (K112638). The Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor has the similar indications for use (whole venous and capillary blood) as the Home Diagnostics Inc. TRUEresult Blood Glucose Monitor System (K080641). The Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor is substantially equivalent to the Nova Max One Glucose Monitor System and the Home Diagnostics Inc. TRUEresult Blood Glucose Monitor System. Please see the table Comparison of Predicate and Proposed Devices below.

# J. Performance Studies:

The performance of the Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor was studied in the laboratory and in clinical settings by healthcare professionals and lay users. The studies demonstrated that medical professionals can obtain blood glucose results from venous/arterial blood that are substantially equivalent to the current methods for blood glucose measurements obtained from capillary blood and in the central laboratory..

# K. Conclusion:

Results of laboratory and clinical testing demonstrate that the Nova One Blood Glucose Monitor.produces results that are substantially equivalent to results obtained on the predicate device. The system performs as intended and raises no new safety or effectiveness issues.
