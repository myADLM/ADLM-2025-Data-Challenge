2. Guidance for Industry - Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators   
3. Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff – Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

# L. Test Principle:

The reagent material has no inherent test principle but is used to monitor the performance of a fluorescence immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of PSA in human serum.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

IMMULITE Third Generation PSA assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The Calibration Verification Material (CVM) is traceable to this standard.

Value assignment: The PSA concentration levels are value assigned using an approved reference lot manufactured with qualified materials and measurement procedures. The reagent PSA concentrations were tested using a total of 27 replicates per level; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run. 2 different kit lots and 9 different instruments were used to gain the 27 replicates per level of the reagent. The analyte values were calculated based on the recovered values for each run independently. The average analyte value recovered for each PSA concentration determined the assigned value (Target Mean) $\pm 2$ Standard Deviation (SD) units.

Expected Values: The expected values are provided in the IMMULITE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ /IMMULITE 1000 PSA Calibration verification Material lotspecific value sheet. The expected assay range is $0 . 0 1 5 - 2 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each laboratory should establish their limits for acceptability based on methodology, clinical significance and medical decision levels of the test analyte. The representative total precision, tabulated in the respective assay instructions for use, may be considered as one factor when establishing local, acceptable ranges. The values below can be considered as guidelines.

Stability: The calibration verification reagent is stable until the expiration date (at least 90 days) when stored frozen at ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ prior to opening. Discard after use.

The stability calibrators are run in duplicate (as a minimum) and the PSA concentration determined from reference calibrator curve. Real-time stability studies were performed for 3 lots of calibration verification material (CVM). The testing periods for one lot were 6 months and 12 months. The periods for a second lot were 1 day, 15 days, 30 days, and 120 days. The testing periods for the third lot were 1 day, 15 days, 30 days, and 90 days. The stability study shows acceptable results up to 90 days when stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Evaluation of matrix effects: To investigate potential matrix effects from using Chicken Serum, spiking recovery of PSA was determined. A stock solution of calibrator grade prostate specific antigen (PSA) was utilized to prepare the concentrations of three spiking solutions. Concentrations were determined gravimetrically, refer to Table 1.

Table 1 Spiking solution concentration values   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Value of spikesolution(ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Stock 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10.87</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Stock 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>46.25</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Stock 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>89.13</td></tr></table>

Each spiking solution was spiked into an evaluation lot and patient sample (1 part spiking solution to 19 parts matrix). The spiked samples were run in a PSA assay on one IMMULITE platform. The PSA values of the evaluation lot were compared to the patient sample lots. Each of the samples meets the acceptance criteria of mean recovery being within $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the target and the grand mean is within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of reference. Since there were no significant differences between the evaluation lot and patient sample lots, it was concluded that the spiking recovery has shown no matrix effects.
