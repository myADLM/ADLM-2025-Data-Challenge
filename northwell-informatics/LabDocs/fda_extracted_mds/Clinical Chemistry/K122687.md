Safety Blood Collection Set and/or Blood Collection Set $^ +$ Blood Culture Holder:

The SAFETY Blood Collection Set and/or Blood Collection Set $^ +$ Blood Culture Holder are used in routine venipuncture procedures. The winged needle of the SAFETY Blood Collection Set is designed with a safety shield, which can be activated to cover the needle immediately following blood collection to aid in the protection against accidental needlestick injury. The Blood Culture Holder is used to fll blood into blood culture bottles and tubes.

# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

The Blood Culture Holder is a single-use, non-sterile, plastic holder with threads which are compatible with male luer adapters. The holder can be used with all VACUETTE $\otimes$ Multiple Sample Luer Adapters and Safety Blood Collection Sets for routine venipuncture into various manufacturers' evacuated blood culture bottles and tubes. It is supplied alone or with the Greiner sterile Safety Blood Collection Set with Luer Adapter.

The Blood Culture Holder does not come into contact with the blood specimen. It is an external holder for the Safety Blood Collection Set and the VACUETTE $\otimes$ Multiple Sample Luer Adapter. The Safety Blood Collection Set consists of tubing with a blood collection needle at one end and a female luer at the other. The VACUETTE $\textcircled{8}$ Multiple Sample Luer Adapter consists of a male luer at one end and a cannula covered with a sheath. The luer adapter is threaded into the Blood Culture Holder, with the male luer end on the outside and the covered cannula on the inside of the holder barrel. The blood flows through the blood collection needle and tubing of the Safety Blood Collection Set, into the male luer of the VACUETTE $\textcircled{8}$ Multiple Sample Luer Adapter, through the luer into the cannula, and into the blood culture tube or holder when punctured by the cannula. The fluid path consists of the Safety Blood Collection Set and the VACUETTE $\textcircled{8}$ Multiple Sample Luer Adapter. The Blood Culture Holder never comes into contact with the blood specimen during conditions of use.

When the Blood Culture Holder is supplied attached to the Safety Blood Collection Set and the VACUETTE $\textcircled{8}$ Multiple Sample Luer Adapter, it undergoes sterilization as part of the entire system because the fluid path must be sterilized. However, when the Blood Culture Holder is provided alone, it is not sterilized and the user attaches their own sterile blood collection needle and luer adapter.

The Safety Blood Collection Set with Blood Culture Holder is non-pyrogenic and tested according to ISO-10993-11 rabbit pyrogen test. The devices also are below the limit for endotoxin and tested according to ISO-10993-11 LAL Turbidimetric Method.

Caution: Us Federal law restricts this device for sale by or on the order of a physician.

The Blood Culture Holder is substantially equivalent to the Smiths Medical ASD Inc. Saf-T Closed Blood Collection System® (K081229) in intended use and design. The similarities and differences are listed below.

# PRODUCT PERFORMANCE:

Simulated blood draw testing was performed on the Safety Blood Collection Set with Luer Adapter and the Blood Culture Holder using a variety of blood culture bottles and evacuated tubes representing the range of bottle and tube sizes. The devices used in the study were:

Blood collection devices: Greiner Safety Blood Collection Set with Luer Adapter; Blood Culture Holders;   
Blood culture bottles and vials (2 manufacturers);   
Blood collection tubes: VACUETTE® EDTA K2, 4 mL, 13x75mm (smallest. diameter cap and tube size) and VACUETTE® Z Serum

Separator and Clot Activator, 7 mL, 16x100mm (largest diameter cap and tube size).

Twenty Blood Culture Holders were connected to 20 Safety Blood Collection Sets with Luer Adapters. The sets were tested in simulated blood draws with blood culture bottles, blood culture vials, and the two tube types.

The results were evaluated for proper fit of the Blood Culture Holders to the Safety Blood Collection Sets, leakage and function of the blood culture containers, and leakage and function of the blood collection tubes. All Blood Culture Holders met the acceptance criteria for fit, leakage, and function when connected to the Safety Blood Collection Sets and when used for blood collection into blood culture bottles and tubes.

Conclusion: The Blood Culture Holder can be used with blood culture bottles, blood culture vials, and the range of blood collection tube sizes from 13x75mm to 16x100mm.
