# 2. Description of Device Modification

The ABL90 FLEX is a portable, automated system intended for in vitro testing of samples of whole blood for the parameters pH, pO2 , pCO2, potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride, glucose, lactate, and co-oximetry parameters (total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and the hemoalohin fractions FO2Hh. FCOHh. F MetHb. FHHb and FHbF).

Te labelling nd e tware as beenodi assure hat e Operator des t glucose results obtained from samples with a $P O _ { 2 }$ level below 25 mmHg.

# 3. Intended Use

The ABL90 FLEX analyzer is a portable, automated analyzer that measures pH, blood gases, electrolytes, glucose, lactate, and oximetry in heparinised whole blood. The ABL90 FLEX analyzer is intended for use by trained technologists, nurses, physicians and therapists. It is intended for use in a laboratory environment, near patient or point-of-care setting. These tests are only performed under a physician's order.

# 4. Indications for use

pH, $p { 0 } _ { 2 }$ and $P ^ { \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 } } \colon \mathsf { p H } .$ , $P C O _ { 2 }$ and $P O _ { 2 }$ measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.

Potassium $( c \mathsf { K } ^ { + } )$ : potassium measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.

Sodium $( C N a ^ { + } )$ : sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease, dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.

Calcium $( c \mathsf { C } \mathsf { a } ^ { 2 + } )$ : calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany.

Chloride (cCl"): chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such a cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.

Glucose (cGlu): glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus and idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.

Lactate (cLac): The lactate measurements measure the concentration of lactate in plasma. Lactate measurements are used to evaluate the acid-base status and are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of the blood.)

Total Hemoglobin (ctHb): total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure the hemoglobin content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.

$s \mathsf { O } _ { 2 }$ : oxygen saturation, more specifically the ratio between the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus reduced hemoglobin.

$F O _ { 2 } H b$ : oxyhemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.

FCOHb: carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the carboxyhemoglobin content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.

FMetHb: methemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.

FHHb: reduced hemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.

Fraction of Fetal Hemoglobin (FHbF): FHbF indicates the amount of fetal hemoglobin. FHbF is seldom used clinically.

# 6. Design Control Activities

The risk associated with a negative bias on glucose results obtained from samples with low $p { 0 } _ { 2 }$ level was assessed in a risk analysis. An interference study confirmed that this could lead to an unacceptable negative bias of more than $10 \%$ on glucose values in the upper reportable range.

Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to
