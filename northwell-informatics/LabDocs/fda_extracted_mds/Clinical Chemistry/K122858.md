Test Principle:

Enzymatic Method.   
Substrate $C N P \cdot G _ { 3 }$ is hydrolyzed by catalitic action of a-amylase to produce CNP (2- chloro-4-nitrophenol).

5 CNP. ${ \bf \cal G } _ { 3 }$ α-amylase

$\mathrm { C N P - } \mathrm { G } _ { 2 } = 2$ -Chloro-4-nitrophenyl- $\mathbf { \alpha } \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \alpha } ^ { \mathbf { \alpha } }$ -maltoside

The rate of increase in absorbance is measured at $4 0 5 \mathsf { n m }$ and is directly proportional to the activity $\propto$ -amylase in the sample.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility

The precision of the device was determined in accordance with Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline—Second Edition. CLSI (NCCLS) document EP5-A2, Vol 24, No. 25, August 2004.

Within-run and Total precision results were obtained by performing two runs per day, two measures per run, for 3 levels of samples on 2 instruments during twenty operating days according to CLSI EP5-A2 protocol. The results are presented in the table below:

# Linearity/assay reportable range

The linearity study of AMYLASE SL reagent was performed according to CLSI protocol EP6-A. From this study, a measuring range from 20 to $1 5 0 0 \text{‰}$ has been determined. Manual dilution 1 to 10 allows an upper linearity of AMYLASE SL reagent to 15000 U/L.

# c. Traceability

For calibration, a multi-parametric calibrator named ELITech Clinical Systems ELICAL 2 (manufactured by SEPPIM under product code CALI-0580) must be used. Its value is traceable to the IFCC method.

# d. Stability

# Real-time stabilities:

On board stability for the ELITech Clinical Systems AMYLASE SL was established by real time studies on the ELITech Clinical Systems Selectra ProM. The on-board stability of the reagent is 28 days. The shelf-life of AMYLASE SL reagent has been followed in the real time for 24 months on 3 different batches.

Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k041227). The following is claimed for stability: Before reconstitution, the shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol I and Elitrol II is 24 months at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } \complement$ . After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when stored at $1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ , 5 days when stored at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $\angle 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $\cdot 1 5 ^ { \circ } C$ .

Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under k033501). The following is claimed for stability: Before reconstitution, the shelf-life of ELITech Clinical Systems Elical 2 is stable 24 months at $2 . 8 \%$ After reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at $1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ ,2 days at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } C$ or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at $\cdot 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $- 1 5 \textdegree$ .The labeling stated that the Elical 2 should be stored tightly capped and protected from light when not in use.

# Value Assignment

Elitrol I and Il are value assigned using multiple Vital Scientific Pro M analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of Level I and Il are the median of the observed values range. After validation of the target value, a confidence range (high and low values) is then calculated.

Elical 2 is tested against predetermined values on multiple Vital Scientific Pro M using the AMYLASE SL reagent and 2 levels of quality control material. The mean analyte value is calculated and a target value is assigned.

# e.Detection limit

Determined according to CLSI protocol EP17-A (Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantification; Approved Guideline).

Limit of Detection (LoD) of AMYLASE SL obtained from 15 measurements of 4 samples with a low concentration of analyte (approximately 4 x LoB \~ 13 U/L) is 6 U/L.

Limit of Quantification (LoQ) of AMYLASE SL obtained from 15 measurements of 4 samples at nominal concentration 13 U/L is 13 U/L.

# f.Interference/analytical specificity

Interferences, due to unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, triglycerides, hemoglobin, acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, acetylsalicylic acid were investigated following the recommended sample levels in CLSI EP7-A2 protocol (Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second Edition).

The results of testing interferences are the following:

Concentration up to $3 0 . 0 \ m g / \mathrm { d L }$ unconjugated bilirubin, 29.5 mg/dL unconjugated bilirubin, $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L }$ triglycerides and 500 mg/dL hemoglobin do not show any significant interference for each substance.   
Likewise, concentrations up to $3 0 m g / d L$ acetaminophen, $2 0 . 0 \ m g / \mathrm { d L }$ ascorbic acid and $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ acetylsalicylic acid do not show any significant interference for each substance.

The following statement will also be included in the labeling:

Other compounds may interfere. Users should refer to the two following literature references:   
-Young, D. S., Effects of preanalytical variables on clinical laboratory tests, $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ Ed., AACC Press, (1997).   
-Young. D. S., Effects of drugs on clinical laboratory tests, $4 ^ { \mathfrak { h } }$ Ed., AACC Press, (1995). -Berth, M. & Delanghe, J. Protein precipitation as a possible important pitfall in the clinical chemistry analysis of blood samples containing monoclonal immunoglobulins: 2

# 12. Performance Characteristics - Comparison Studies

# a. Method comparison

A correlation study was performed between AMYLASE SL reagent on a Selectra ProM analyzer and Roche Diagnostics AMYL2 ( $\mathfrak { a }$ -Amylase EPS ver.) reagent on a cobas c111 analyzer according to CLSI EP9-A2 protocol (Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline - Second edition).

This study was performed using 100 serum patient samples from 21 to 1439 U/L over a span of 5 days.

Regression analysis of the results yielded the following:

$y = 0 . 9 7 6 \times - 1$ U/L   
$\mathfrak { r } = 0 . 9 9 9$   
$\mathsf { r } ^ { 2 } = \mathsf { 0 } . \mathsf { 9 9 9 }$   
Standard error of the estimate $\mathsf { S y } . \mathsf { x } = 1 0 \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { L }$ .

# b. Comparison study: Plasma comparison

48 paired plasma (in lithium heparin samples, ranging from 22 to 1491 U/L, were tested on Selectra ProM analyzer according to CLSI protocol EP9-A2 (Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline - Second edition).

Regression analysis of the results yielded the fol $y = 0 . 9 0 7 \ x + 1 \cup \Lambda$ .   
$\mathsf { r } = 1 . 0 0 0$   
$\Gamma ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 0 0$   
Standard error of the estimate S $y . x = 6 \cup \Lambda$ .

# c. Matrix comparison:

Matrix comparison studies were not performed. See serum and plasma method comparison data above (Section 12 a. & b.) We claim that lithium heparin plasma is an acceptable anticoagulant.

# d. Expected values/Reference Range

As indicated in the instructions for use for AMYLASE SL, each laboratory should establish and maintain its own reference values. The values given are used as guidelines only.

These values are from "Schumann, G., et al. IFCC Primary Reference Procedures for the Measurement of Catalytic Activity Concentrations of Enzymes at ${ 3 7 ^ { \circ } C }$ Clin Chem Lab Med, (2006), 44(9), 1146."
