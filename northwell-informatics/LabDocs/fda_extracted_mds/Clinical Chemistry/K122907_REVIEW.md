The Polymed Therapeutics’ FastepTM At-home Pregnancy Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the visual, qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine specimen to aid in the early detection of pregnancy.

Polymed Therapeutics’ FastepTM At-Home Pregnancy Test is intended to be distributed

for Over-the-Counter (OTC) use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Intended for OTC use.

4. Special instrument requirements: None, this device is a visually-read, single-use device.

# I. Device Description:

The FastepTM At-Home Pregnancy Test is designed to be tested in midstream and dipstick mode. The FastepTM At-Home Pregnancy Test consists of a single test strip encased in plastic device housing, with an absorbent tip. The result is generated by immersing the tip in the urine stream or urine cup for a sufficient amount of time to absorb an adequate sample volume. Each test reagent strip consists of a mouse monoclonal anti- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ -hCG antibody coated membrane and a dried chemical pad containing mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta$ -hCG anybody colloidal gold conjugate. The control antibodies are goat anti-mouse IgG.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor has submitted two studies to demonstrate performance in the hands of lay users:

In the first lay user study, 129 lay users self-tested using both midstream and dipstick mode, and 19 lay users tested urine samples in dipstick mode only. All lay users were instructed to read the proposed package insert (in English) to operate the device. Each lay user was also given a questionnaire to rate how well they understood the instructions. More than $9 7 \%$ of lay users agreed that the user instruction was written in a manner that was easy to use and understand.

Lay users’ results with the new test were compared to professionals’ results using the OTC predicate test (Teco Diagnostics One-Step Midstream Pregnancy Test k974059) and the results are summarized below:

1) Dipstick Mode comparison   

<table><tr><td rowspan=5 colspan=1>FastepTMAt-HomeTest(Dipstick)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=4>Teco Diagnostics</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>+</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>+</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>58</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>58</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4*</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>85</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>89</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>62</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>85</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>147**</td></tr></table>

\* Paired serum samples were also collected from each lay-user for quantitative hCG measurement (Abbott Architect i2000). The observed values from the serum results for these 4 samples were negative. .

\*\*One “invalid” result was obtained using predicate device; therefore, only 147 dipstick mode results were tabulated.

2) Midstream Mode comparison   

<table><tr><td rowspan=5 colspan=1>FastepTMAt-HomeTest(Midstream)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=4>Teco Diagnostics</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>+</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>+</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4*</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>72</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>76</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>72</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>127**</td></tr></table>

\* Paired serum samples were also collected from each lay-user for quantitative hCG measurement (Abbott Architect i2000). The observed values from the serum results for these 4 samples were negative.

\*\*One “invalid” result was obtained for midstream mode using predicate device and candidate device, respectively; therefore only 127 midstream mode results were tabulated.

In the second lay user study, 21 lay users were recruited to test masked, randomized urine samples in dipstick mode with hCG concentrations close to the cutoff level at 16.7, 25.3 and $3 8 . 7 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . Each lay user tested 3 blinded samples using package insert instructions only. The lay user study results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>hCG concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lay user results</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>16.7mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>21/21negative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25.3mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>21/21positive</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38.7 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>21/21positive</td></tr></table>
