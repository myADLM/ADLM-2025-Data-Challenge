Veri-Q self-testing MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System   
Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System   
Common Name: Blood Glucose Test System System, Test, Blood Glucose, Over The Counter   
Classification Name: Glucose Oxidase Single(specified) analyte controls   
Classification: Class II, 21 CFR 862.1345   
Classification Product Code: NBW

# 4. Predicate Device:

CareSens N(K083468) by i-SENS, Inc.

# 5. Description:

The proposed Veri-Q self-testing / plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a meter, test strips, control solutions (3 levels), a lancing device and sterile lancets. The blood glucose test system is an in vitro diagnostic device designed for measuring the concentration of glucose in whole blood sample by means of an electrical current produced in the test strip and sent to the meter for measurement. The Veri-Q self-testing / plus MGD-1001 meter is a no-code meter, so the responsibility of coding has been removed from the user. Each individual test strip contains technology that allows it to automatically calibrate and code the meter once it is inserted.

# 6. Indications for use:

6.1 Veri-Q self-testing MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

The Veri-Q self-testing MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from fingertips, palm, or forearm. The Veri-Q self-testing MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be shared. The Veri-Q self-testing MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The Veri-Q self-testing MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady-state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The Veri-Q self-testing MGS-01 test strips are for use with the Veri-Q self-testing MGD1001 meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from fingertips, palm, or forearm.

The Veri-Q self-testing Glucose Control Solutions are for use with the Veri-Q self-testing MGD-1001 meter and the Veri-Q self-testing MGS-01 test strips to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and providing accurate results.

6.2 Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

The Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood drawn from fingertips, palm, or forearm. The Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for multi-patient use in a professional healthcare setting, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. This system is only used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices. The Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady—state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The Veri-Q plus MGS-01 test strips are for use with the Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from fingertips, palm, or forearm.

The Veri-Q plus Glucose Control Solutions are for use with the Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 meter and the Veri-Q plus MGS-01 test strips to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and providing accurate results.

# 7. Technological Characteristics:

The Veri-Q self-testing / plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System has the same fundamental scientific technology as the predicate device. The indications for use, technology, design of glucose meter, and strips are almost the same. The major difference is that for the Veri-Q meter, non coding is required on user side but the predicate device employs autocoding method. There are also minor difference such as shelf life and memory capacity.

# 8. Performance Data:

The testing for the Veri-Q self-testing / plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed in accordance with ISO 15197:2003. Clinical evaluation included method comparison, user performance and alternative-site blood glucose measurement. Non-clinical performance evaluations were conducted to establish the performance, functionality and reliability characteristics of the Veri-Q self-testing / plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

# 9. Conclusions:

MiCoBioMed Co., Ltd. concludes that the Veri-Q self-testing / plus MGD-1001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is safe and effective also, substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Chung:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing-practice, labeling, and prohibitions.against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.
