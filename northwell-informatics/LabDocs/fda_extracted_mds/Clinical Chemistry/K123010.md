# Description:

The On Call" Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a quantitative assay for the detection of glucose in capillary whole blood sampled from the fingertip. The glucose measurement is achieved by using the amperometric detection method.

The test strip has a reagent system including glucose oxidase and a mediator that reacts with the meter, and after calculation by the meter, the blood glucose concentration reading is displayed on the meter display, calibrated to a plasma reference.

The quality control of the On Call Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is performed by testing the test strip on meter with glucose control solution to confirm that the test strip and meter are working together properly. The glucose control solution contains a known concentration of glucose with preservatives in an aqueous based mixture. The control solution test result should fall within the predetermined control solution range for the given strip lot to confirm the.accuracy of the On Call Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# Intended Use:

The On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an electrochemical enzymatic assay. It is used for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for multiple patient use by health care professionals in health care facilities as an aid to monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control programs. The system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices.

The On Call $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, nor intended for use on neonates.

The On Call $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the On Call Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Meter in the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary blood from the finger.

The On Call $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Control Solutions are for use with the On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Meter and Strips as a quality control check to verify the accuracy of blood glucose test results.

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

Clinical studies were conducted with lay persons and trained laboratory technicians using the On Call" Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The study data were presented evaluating the system accuracy of the On Cl Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared to the YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS (K913806) per the ACON Clinical Study Protocol for the Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Study results indicate that nonprofessional, inexperienced lay persons were able to obtain comparable blood glucose readings when using the On Call\* Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System as compared to the results obtained by the trained tecnicians. In addition, the participating lay persons were questioned and responded as satisfied with the ease of operation by following the Instructions for Use in the User's Manual and the overall performance of the On Call" Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# Conclusion:

The laboratory testing and clinical study results demonstrate that the On Call Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is safe, effective and easy-to-use. It also demonstrates that the On Call" Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System meets the accuracy requirements per EN ISO 15197 and as such is substantially equivalent to the One Touch Ultra Blood Glucose Monitoring System, currently sold on the U.S: market (K002134).
