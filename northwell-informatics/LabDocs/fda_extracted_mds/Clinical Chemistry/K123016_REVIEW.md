# L. Test Principle:

The Veri-Q and Veri-Q plus MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The systems quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The Veri-Q self-testing MGD-2001 and Veri-Q plus MGD-2001 meters are the same meters that use the same test strip; however the systems, meters, and test strips have separate names due to their different indications for use. Therefore, only one set of performance data is presented below.

# 1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed repeatability studies using venous whole blood samples spiked or glycolyzed to achieve five different glucose concentrations (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each glucose level was analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots and 10 meters, for a total of 300 tests per each glucose level, for each meter. Results are summarized below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using 12 venous blood samples ranging in glucose concentrations from 19.9 to $6 0 1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (19.9, 29.5, 45.2, 54.2, 66.0, 84.3, 92.5, 154.8, 244.9, 325.0, 397.2, 465.6, 569.5, $6 0 1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ as measured by the reference method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus). Each sample was tested in replicates of 5 on the Veri-Q MGD-2001 using 3 test strip lots. The values from the Veri-Q MGD-2001 meter were compared with those obtained from the reference method (YSI). The results from regression analysis are summarized below:

Lot #1: $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 0 6 4 \mathrm { x } { - } 0 . 7 5 3$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$   
Lot #2: y=1.009 x-1.277; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$   
Lot #3: y=1.0035x-0.8047; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The sponsor states that the Veri-Q MGD-2001 system is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed using the candidate device and YSI as the reference method (see Section 2.a.).

Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:

Value assignment: Three levels of aqueous control solutions are available for use with the Veri-Q MGD-2001 test system: Level 1 $( 3 0 { - } 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , Level 2 (94-144 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ and Level 3 $( 2 8 0 { - } 4 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Value assignment for use of the control solutions with the Veri Q MGD-2001 blood glucose test strips is based on replicate measurements using the YSI 2300. The values for each of the control solutions are assigned by repeat analysis using the Veri-Q MGD-2001 meter and Veri Q MGD-01 test strips and the mean used to establish the ranges for each control solution level which are provided on the test strip vial label.

Control Solution Stability: Stability was assessed using real-time and accelerated testing for each control solution level (Level 1, 2 and 3). Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the shelf life stability claim of 24 months and an open-vial stability claim of 3 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of $4 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 8 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Labeling instructs the user not to refrigerate the solutions.

Test Strip Stability: The sponsor provided a real-time and accelerated testing protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the closed- (shelf life) and open vial stability of the test strips. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a closed-vial (shelf life) of 20 months and open-vial stability of 3 months when stored at $4 6 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to refrigerate or freeze the test strips.

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range for the Veri-Q MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).

# e. Analytical specificity:

To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to three glucose concentration intervals of 30 to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 100 to 120 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $4 8 0 { - } 5 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool and each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations. Each sample was analyzed in replicates of 5. The $\%$ difference between the test sample and the control sample was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference $\mathsf { a s } \leq$ $\pm 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ difference relative to the control sample with glucose concentrations ${ < } 7 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ with glucose concentrations $\geq 7 5 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ .

# N. Instrument Name:

Veri-Q self-testing MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Meter Veri-Q plus MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Meter

# O. System Description:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?:

Yes or No X

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?:

Yes or No X

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No

The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and developed under good software life-cycle processes.

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

# 4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

# 5. Calibration:

The system is designed to be non-coding. The test strips are coded a test strip lot-specific code. When the test strip is inserted into the meter it provides the appropriate calibration code information to the meter, therefore, the user is not required to enter any coding information or verify the coding.

# 6. Quality Control:

Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution Level 2 is provided with the kit. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results when the $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ or $^ { \circ } C '$ buttons are pushed after the measurement. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1) Hematocrit study:

The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of $20 - 6 0 \%$ (20, 30, 40, 50, and $60 \%$ ) spiked with glucose to achieve target concentrations of 35, 92.3, 131, 245, and $3 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Three test strip lots were evaluated and 10 meters. Each sample was tested in replicates of 21 for each hematocrit level and glucose level tested. The $\%$ bias of the Veri-Q MGD meter results relative to YSI demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of $20 - 6 0 \%$ .

2) Altitude study:

To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Veri-Q MGD Blood Glucose Monitoring System a study was performed to simulate pressure and oxygen changes from altitude differences. Altered (spiked and glycolysed) venous blood samples from three donors were spiked to 3 glucose concentrations (65, 194 and $4 3 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The blood samples were tested using 3 test strip lots and 5 meters at the simulated altitude and the results compared to those obtained with the reference method (YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the Veri-Q MGD Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

3) Temperature and humidity studies:

The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples at target glucose concentrations of 42, 123, and $3 5 1 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ to evaluate temperatures ranging from $5 0 { - } 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and relative humidity from $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ . Four combinations of the claimed temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated (low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity). Meter results were compared to the reference method. The results support the claimed range of operating conditions: ${ 5 0 } { - } 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity.

4) Sample volume study:

The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum sample volume requirement for the Veri-Q MGD-2001 system using blood samples of $0 . 3 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , $0 . 8 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , $1 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , and $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ at five glucose concentrations (40, 78, 142, 285, 467 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ according to the reference method). The system displays an error code (Er 3) when insufficient sample is detected. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single- and multiple-patient use. CaviWipesXL (EPA registration $\# 4 6 7 8 1 - 8$ ) was validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) and the lancing device after 1,950 cycles to simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

6) Certificates of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing compliance were provided for the MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

7) Readability: Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results demonstrated that both User Manual versions, inserts for both test strip versions and the control solution package insert were written at or below the ${ 8 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade reading level.
