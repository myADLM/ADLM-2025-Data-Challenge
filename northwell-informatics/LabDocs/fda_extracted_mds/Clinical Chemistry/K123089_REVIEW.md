E. System Descriptions: 1. Device Description:

Freestyle Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0 is a software application that allows people with diabetes to upload data from Freestyle Insulinx, Precision Xtra™, Freestyle Freedom, Freestyle 5, Freestyle Flash, Freestyle Lite and Freestyle Freedom Lite Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems into FreeStyle Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0, where users may review blood glucose and other data in a number of different graphical presentations.

It is a stand-alone software program available for download to a home user’s computer via download from an Abbott Diabetes Care (ADC) website or if a previous version of Auto-Assist software is installed on the computer, through a notification from the ADC Informatics Upgrade Server. The software will also be available to users via a CD-ROM.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

Data Upload FreeStyle Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0 retrieves each blood glucose test result or ketone result, and the date and time of the measurement, from the memory of recognized, compatible meters. It retrieves the data through either a Serial or Serial/USB cable, a Strip Port /USB cable, or a Micro-USB/USB cable. These data are viewable through and used by FreeStyle Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0 to generate reports. Additionally these data may be exported to a text file (.txt) and saved.

Data Entry   
Through the FreeStyle Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0 user interface additional personal notes, such as insulin, meals, and exercise data may be added to the logged data collected from the meter. Data Access   
Data from the compatible meter can be displayed through the software or saved in text file format (.txt). Meter Settings Backup   
For compatible meters, the meter settings are retrieved from the meter. The meter settings can be saved to the computer by selecting the backup meter file option.

J. Performance Characteristics: The performance characteristics listed below as applicable, are presented in the specific glucose clearance under k111874

# 1. Analytical Performance:

The performance characteristics listed below as applicable, were presented in the specific glucose meter clearance under k111874

a. Accuracy: See above statement under section J(1).   
b. Precision/Reproducibility: See above statement under section J(1).   
c. Linearity: See above statement under section J(1).   
d. Carryover: See above statement under section J(1).   
e. Interfering Substances: See above statement under section J(1).

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

a. Human Factors Study. A total of 32 of 35 participants were fully evaluated. Subjects were of typical computer experience and ages (age range 18 to 66 years old) that would be expected to use diabetes data management software were enrolled in the Human Factors study conducted for FreeStyle Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0. All of the study participants had diabetes: 13 were Type 1 and 22 were Type 2.

As part of the study, users installed the software on their test computer desktop and launched the software. Task 1 required the subjects to install the software, Task 2 required subjects to upload meter data and create and print reports, and Task 3 required subjects to save previously generated reports.

Users were assessed on their ability to upload meter data, create and print reports, and save reports to their desktop. The Freestyle Freedom Lite meter and the Precision Xtra meter were chosen as meters best representing the line of compatible meter including the Freestyle Insulinx meter and were preloaded with data such as blood glucose or ketone results, based on the compatible meters, and users created reports and graphs using this stored data. Stored data was automatically uploaded from a compatible meter when it was connected to a computer running FreeStyle Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0.

Based on the study, subjects were able to successfully create and view reports, and the data in these reports matched the stored data in $100 \%$ of cases.

b. Ease of Use Evaluation. Ease-of-use ratings for the Auto-Assist 2.0 software were recorded upon task completion in the Human Factors study. Participants were asked to rate the ease of use for each task, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very difficult. At the end of the session, they were also asked to provide an overall rating of the software using the same scale.

The overall success of the majority of participants led to a positive experience with the software. On a 5-point scale where 1 represented very difficult and 5 represented very easy, participants rated all tasks as

relatively easy (Task 1: 4.3, Task 2: 4.1, and Task 3: 4.3). Even when participants struggled with a task or failures occurred, participants still thought that the software would benefit them by helping them better track their diabetes. The participants who struggled assumed they would not have difficulty if they were to use the software again. The benefits of tracking their disease and the assumption that the software was easy to learn gave participants an overall positive impression of the software, which is reflected in the overall ease of use rating of 4.2.

c. Bench Testing. Bench testing was conducted during design verification activities. The existing FreeStyle and Precision USB Data Cables were used to upload data from compatible meters to the Auto-Assist 2.0 application running on a Windows or Mac Computer. Auto-Assist 2.0 verification was performed on the following supported Operating Systems:

• Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) • Windows Vista (32-bit and 64-bit) • Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit) • Mac OS X Snow Leopard • Mac OS X Lion

Meter memory capacity and data rollover is a function of meter design and unchanged from those submitted in each meter pre-market application, and thus was not tested as part of FreeStyle Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0 Auto-Assist 2.0 software has been verified to be implemented according to its meter specific data upload requirements to meet $100 \%$ accuracy and data management requirements.

d. Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes.

e. The Auto-Assist Software Version 2.0 User’s Guide Readability Assessment was at a 6.4 grade level using the Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment.

# K. Proposed Labeling:
