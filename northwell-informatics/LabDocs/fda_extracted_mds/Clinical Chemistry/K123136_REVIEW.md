A. 510(k) Number: k123136

C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Genesis Health Technologies Genesis Health Record System

D. Type of Test or Tests performed: Diabetes data management system

# E. System Descriptions:

The Genesis Health Record System (GHRS), an internet browser-based software system, is an optional accessory to the Genesis Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Genesis BGMS) that aids in diabetes care and management. The GHRS receives test results from the Genesis Blood Glucose Meter (Genesis BGM) via secure cellular transmission over the Verizon wireless network, and stores these results in a secured database.

# Principles of Operation:

Once a patient’s glucose measurement is taken, the cellular module automatically searches for and connects to the Verizon cellular network and uploads the test result to the patient’s account. After the reading is successfully uploaded to the patient’s account of the upload is confirmed to the device and patient.

Once uploaded to the secured database, an individual patient's results can only be viewed by that patient and by additional person(s) authorized by that patient. The Genesis BGMS and GHRS are not intended to provide automated treatment guidance or decisions, nor are they to be used as a substitute for professional healthcare judgment.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

a) A human factors study was performed to assess usability of the GHRS system and data. Testing was conducted with 25 test patient users, 25 Genesis Health Technologies Blood Glucose Meter, Model TD-4123, and 4 healthcare professionals. Patients used the meter with control-solution only.

Another phase of testing was continued over a 3-week period in a simulated-use environment. Patients were asked to use the system as they typically would in a real-world scenario. Patients were asked to take “sample” readings (using control solution) three times per day. 20 of the patients tested over a five day period, and 5 of the patients tested over a 3-week period. Patients were asked to complete a set of tasks in the online MyGHR system similar to those performed in the initial test session. Patients were asked to provide feedback on the system and submit the feedback at the end of the testing period.

At the end of the study, the meters were collected from the test patients by MyGHR employees. At this point, the data history on the meters was compared with the data stored in the MyGHR system (using the GHR-Admin portal). A comparison of the data, including reading type, glucose value, and reading date/time was tabulated to ensure $100 \%$ accuracy of the data uploaded from each meter.

These studies confirm that adults with average education and computer skills and no prior knowledge of the system can safely and accurately use the GHT BGM Meter (GHT-BGM-TD-4123) and the GHRS online web-based portal without direct instruction or training. The testing also confirmed that the meters and patients can be managed by healthcare professionals to track and view patient glucose readings and reports, and perform account and profile management. The study confirmed that the system is $100 \%$ accurate with respect to data accuracy and integrity when used by patients in an intended use environment.

b) Bench Testing was performed using control solutions tested 20 times to automatically transmit data after each measurement on each of 2 Genesis Health Technologies Blood Glucose Meters, Model TD-4123 over the cellular network to 2 test account logins on the GHRS. All data fields, such as result, time, date, meter ID, including report and graphs were $100 \%$ accurate.

c) Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes.

d) Genesis Health Technologies Blood Glucose System owner’s manual cleared under k121224 was modified only to include information and instructions for the Genesis Health Record System. The sponsor provided the results of a Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment which indicated a Grade Level Score 6.6 of Genesis Health Technologies Blood Glucose System owner’s manual. The sponsor also provided the results of a Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment with Grade Level Score 9.4 obtained for the Genesis Health Record System owner’s manual.

e) The sponsor provided a statement of conformity to IEC 60601-1-2, Medical Electrical Equipment- Part 1-2 and provided testing laboratory certification to Emission Test Compliance to Electromagnetic Environment-Guidance.

# K. Proposed Labeling:
