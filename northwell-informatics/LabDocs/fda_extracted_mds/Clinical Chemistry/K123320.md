4. Proprietary and Established Names: Dimension® Ammonia Flex® reagent cartridge, (AMM)

5. Regulatory information:

Ammonia (AMM) Flex® reagent cartridge

Regulation section: 21 CFR 862.1065 Enzymatic Method, Ammonia   
Classification: Class I   
Product Code: JIF   
Panel: Clinical Chemistry

# Predicate Devices:

The predicate device used to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the Dimension® Ammonia (AMM) Flex® reagent cartridge is the Dimension® Ammonia (AMON) previously cleared under k863840.

# 7. Device Description:

The Dimension® Ammonia assay (AMM) is an enzymatic method that uses glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and a stabilized NADPH analog. Ammonia reacts with α-ketoglutarate and reduced cofactor to form L-glutamate and the cofactor. The reaction is catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. The decrease in absorbance due to the oxidation of the reduced cofactor is monitored at 340/700 nm and is proportional to the ammonia concentration.

α-ketoglutarate $+ N H 4 ^ { + } +$ reduced cofactor

L-glutamate $^ +$ cofactor $^ { + }$ H20

# Intended Use:

The AMM method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of ammonia in human plasma (heparin r A)n the Dimension clinical chemistry syste. Ammi

measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of severe liver disorders such as cirrhosis, hepatitis and Reye's syndrome.

# 9. Indication(s) for Use:

The AMM method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of ammonia in human plasma (heparin or EDTA) on the Dimension® clinical chemistry system. Ammonia measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of severe liver disorders such as cirrhosis, hepatitis and Reye's syndrome.

# 10. Substantial Equivalence Information:

Both the Dimension® Ammonia $F I e x ^ { \theta }$ reagent cartridge (AMM) assay and the predicate Dimension® Ammonia Flex® reagent cartridge (AMON) assay employ prepackaged reagents for use on automated clinical chemistry test systems. A comparison of the similarities and differences between the devices is provided in the following tables:

Note: Siemens has decided to offer our customers both conventional units and Systéme International d'Unités (Sl units) in the Instructions for Use (IFU). The predicate, Dimension® Ammonia (AMON) assay results are reported in Sl Units only. Al data supplied in Appendix C will include both conventional units and Sl Units for ease of review. Raw data was collected from the instruments in Sl units and the conventional units were calculated using the following equation: µg/dL $\mathbf { \nabla } \times 0 . 5 8 7 = [ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } ]$ .

# Reference Interval (Expected Values)

The predicate Dimension® Ammonia (AMON) therapeutic range of 19 - 54 µg/dL [11 - 32 umol/L] was validated for use with the Dimension® Ammonia (AMM) method by transference following CLSI C28-A3 Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory - Approved Guideline - Third Edition. The Dimension® AMM assay is based on the same intended use and measuring principle as the predicate, Dimension® AMON. The literature reference used was the Textbook of Clinical Chemistry by NW Tietz; WB Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA; pages 1487-1488.

Samples were collected from 30 healthy adults (17 men and 13 women) and analyzed with the Dimension® AMM method versus the predicate, Dimension® AMON method.

Expected Values: 11 - 32 µmol/L [19 - 54 µg/dL]

Precision

Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline - Second Edition. Samples consisted of three levels of Liquichek ™M Ethanol/Ammonia control. Testing was performed over 20 days, two separate runs with two test samples for each test material. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP5-A2. The data are summarized in the following Dimension® Ammonia (AMM) Summary Table:

<table><tr><td>Material</td><td>Mean μg/dL [umol/L]</td><td>Standard Deviation (%CV) Repeatability Within-Lab</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Liquichek ™ Ethanol/Ammonia control</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Level 1</td><td>40 [23]</td><td>2.1 [1.2] (5.2) 3.7 [2.2] (9.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>187 [110]</td><td>2.6 [1.5] (1.4) 3.7 [2.2] (2.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Level 3</td><td>565 [332]</td><td>3.3 [1.9] (0.6) 7.3 [4.4] (1.3)</td></tr></table>

# Linearity

The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP-6A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. Based on the results of this testing and the Limit of Detection testing, the analytical measurement range was determined to be 17 - 1277 µg/dL [10 - 750 µmol/L].

# Analytical Specificity/Interferences

The AMM method was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline  Second Edition. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference.

\*Lipemia (Intralipid®) at 400 mg/dL [4.52 mmol/L] and above tripped a test report message;   
interference could not be determined.

Studies were also performed following CLSI EP7-A2 for Interference Testing of exogenous substances at an ammonia concentration of 85 and $4 2 6 \mu g / \alpha L$ and were found not to interfere with the AMM method when present in plasma. Inaccuracies (biases) were alless than $10 \%$ . See Dimension® AMM Instructions for Use for a fullist of substances tested.

The AMM assay was evaluated for interference according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference. Testing was performed at two levels of analyte concentration.
