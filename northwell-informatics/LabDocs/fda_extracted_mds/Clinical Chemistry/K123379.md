# Attachment B (Continued) 510(k) Summary (Summary of Safety and Effectiveness)

# Intended Use of Device:

The ARCHITECT Free T4 (FT4) assay is a Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of free thyroxine (Free T4) in human serum and plasma. The ARCHITECT Free T4 assay is to be used as an aid in the assessment of thyroid status.

The ARCHITECT Free T4 Calibrators are for the calibration of the ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination of free thyroxine (Free T4) in human serum and plasma when using the ARCHITECT Free T4 Reagent Kit.

The ARCHITECT Free T4 Controls are for the verification of the accuracy and precision of the ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination of free thyroxine (Free T4) in human serum and plasma when using the ARCHITECT Free T4 Reagent Kit.

# Description of Device:

The ARCHITECT Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ assay is a two-step immunoassay to determine the presence of free thyroxine (Free T4) in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex.

In the first step, sample and anti- $\mathrm { \Delta T _ { 4 } }$ coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ (unbound) present in the sample binds to the anti- $\cdot \mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ coated microparticles. After washing, $\mathrm { T } _ { 3 }$ acridinium labeled conjugate is added in the second step. Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An inverse relationship exists between the amount of Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i optical system.

The calibrators are devices intended for medical purposes for use in the ARCHITECT Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ assay test system to establish points of reference that are used in the quantitative determination of values in the measurement of substances in human specimens. Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ measurements are used as an aid in the assessment of thyroid status.

# Modification of Device:

This Special 510(k) modification of the ARCHITECT Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ assay consisted of changing the calibration from a 2-point calibration to a 6-point calibration.

# Verification/Validation of Modification:

The nonclinical performance of the ARCHITECT Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ assay was demonstrated through the following studies:

Accuracy by Correlation   
− Accelerated Calibrator Stability Real Time Calibrator Stability  In-Use (Open Vial) Real Time Calibrator Stability  Intended Storage (Closed Vial)   
• Limits of Blank/Detection/Quantitation (LoB/LoD/LoQ)   
• Linearity   
− 20-Day Precision at the Limits of the Measuring Interval   
• 20-Day Precision to Verify the Product Requirements   
20-Day Precision for Native Samples

# Conclusion:

Substantial equivalence for the modified device, ARCHITECT Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ (LN 7K65-02; 6-point calibration), is claimed to the predicate device cleared in k983417, ARCHITECT Free $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ (LN 7K65-01; 2-point calibration). The modification to the calibrators, which consisted of changing the calibration from a 2-point calibration to a 6-point calibration, has not changed the intended use, as described in the labeling, nor has it altered the fundamental scientific technology of the device.

Dear Jacek Gorzowski:

We have reviewed your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
