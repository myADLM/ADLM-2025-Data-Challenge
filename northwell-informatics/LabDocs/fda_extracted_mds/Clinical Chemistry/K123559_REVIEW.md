2. Indication(s) for use:

# SOLUSmobile Blood Glucose Management System (Model 6134)

The SOLUSmobile Blood Glucose Management System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the forearm. It is intended for use by a single patient with diabetes mellitus at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of a diabetes control program, and should not be shared. The SOLUSmobile Blood Glucose Management System is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, nor for use in neonates. The alternative site testing (forearm) in this system can only be used during steady-state blood glucose conditions. This system contains an audible readout function that provides an audible message of test results for users. The SOLUSmobile B l o o d Glucose Management System uses cellular data transmission to send test results to a remote central data repository, TelemedGluconet.

# SOLUSmobile Blood Glucose Test Strips

The SOLUSmobile Blood Glucose Test Strips are to be used with the SOLUSmobile Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and the forearm. These test strips are intended for use by a single patient with diabetes mellitus at home and should not be shared. They are not indicated for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, nor for use in neonates. Forearm testing should be done only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

# SOLUSmobile Control Solutions

The SOLUSmobile Control Solutions are for use with the SOLUSMobile Blood Glucose Meter and SOLUSMobile Test Strips to check that the meters and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correction. A control test that falls within the acceptable range indicates the user technique is appropriate and the test strip and meter are functioning properly.

# N. Instrument Name:

SOLUSmobile Glucose Meter, Model 6134

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings. The labeling and user guide specify the lancet and the strip are for single use only and instruct the user to discard immediately after use.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,   
or mobile device?:   
Yes X or No   
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device   
using wireless transmission?:   
Yes X or No

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and the forearm (AST) which can be applied directly to the test strip.

5. Calibration:

No coding. The meter and test strip have the same reference number printed on the meter box and on the test strip box and vial.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor provides two levels of controls (Level I and Level III) with this glucose monitoring system. When the test strip is inserted into the meter, each control can be measured by following the instructions for “Running a Control Solution Test” provided in the User Manual for the meter. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is instructed to contact a customer assistance line during operational hours or a healthcare provider outside hours of operation if the control results fall outside these   
ranges. Controls values and value ranges are assigned as described in section M.1.c of this decision summary.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Infection Control:

The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the material comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg No: 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no a change in performance or external materials of the meter and lancing device after 11,000 cleaning and 11,000 disinfection cycles, using Clorox $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Bleach Germicidal Wipes to simulate 3 years of use by layusers. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 2. Readability:

A Flesch-Kincaid analysis was conducted and the resulting grade level at which the device labeling is written is as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</td></tr><tr><td>Labeling</td><td>Score</td></tr><tr><td>User&#x27;s Manual</td><td>7.8</td></tr><tr><td>Test Strip Inserts</td><td>7.6</td></tr></table>

# 3. EMC:

EMC testing was evaluated and certified by MET Laboratories, Inc. and Verification of Compliance certificates provided.

# 4. Usability Studies:

A cellular functions usability study was performed at three sites using 60 total participants. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate that the intended use population can easily use the new features of this meter (automatic wireless data transmission feature, addition of an airplane mode button, addition of a backlight, addition of an ear phone jack, and a rearrangement of control button). Each participant could read and understand English and the participant ages ranged from 21 to 63. Each participant completed the usability test utilizing only the User’s Guide and all participants indicated that the meter was easy to use.

An additional usability study was conducted using 20 participants, ages ranging from 22 – 54,. All of the participants had prior experiences with using a computer. The participants were given a user’s guide written in English and were allowed to ask customer service representatives if they had any questions. In this study, the voice level feature was evaluated, along with the earphone jack accessory in which the audible output was evaluated as well. Each user tested the airplane mode feature and at the end of the study each participant completed a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the SOLUSmobile meter. All participants indicated that the meter was easy to use.

# 5. Data Transmission:

The effectiveness and reliability of the data transmission (manual and automatic) functions were evaluated through memory storage and synchronization testing.

In the memory storage study, the accuracy of transmission of 500 glucose measurements (memory capacity of meter which includes day and time of glucose measurement) from the meter to the central data repository was evaluated on two separate occasions. The results of the memory storage study demonstrated accurate and reliable transmission of every glucose measurement from the meter to the central data repository.

In the synchronization study, the automatic transmission of glucose measurements was evaluated as a part of the cellular functions usability study. Each participant synchronized and transmitted glucose test results, in three replicates, from their meter to the central data repository. The results of the study demonstrated accurate and reliable transmission of every glucose measurement from the meter to the central data repository.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
