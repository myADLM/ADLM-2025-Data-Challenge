Traceability Value Assignment of Calibrators and Controls

Traceability: As there is no international standard, the calibrators and controls are calibrated gravimetrically using UVVis (264nm) verified stock standards and compared with NIST standards (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA), DEQAS (Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme, UK) quality assessment data and in-house quality control sera.

Calibrators and controls are traceable to concentrations determined by UV spectrophotometric analysis. An in-house stock solution is prepared gravimetrically; and the antigen concentration is spectrophotometrically calculated using the OD coefficient of 18.2 at 264 nm to calculate the concentration from the absorbance value. This is used to build an intermediate stock volumetrically by dilution into horse serum. The intermediate stock is used in the manufacturing of lot specific calibrators and controls volumetrically.

•The calibrator levels for each batch are confirmed by running a min. of 8 quality control sera covering the whole concentration range of the calibration curve measured in a minimum of 4 runs performed by 2 different technicians on 2 different days in duplicates. The quality control sera must fall within established target ranges. Initial values for the quality control sera are assigned using the predicate device in conjunction with liquid chromatography. Once confirmation of the calibrator values is established, the new calibrators are retested by a different person for final release.

25-OH Vitamin D controls prepared in human serum were tested with 7 different released EUROIMMUN 25-OH Vitamin D lots, obtained from 20 independent runs, performed by 4 different persons on 9 different days. The obtained mean values were assigned as control target values. The control target ranges were assigned as mean $\pm 3$ SD (ng/mL). Target values were confirmed using two predicate devices (k021163; k112725) and a HPLC method.

Calibrators and controls are supplied in liquid form and are horse serum based with active ingredients of $0 . 0 9 \%$ ProClin 950 and $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide. Avoid skin contact. Calibrators are 25-OH vitamin D3 spiked. No special treatment necessary for the use of the calibrators and controls except reagents must be mixed thoroughly before use either manually or by vortexing.

Caution: The serum contained in the calibrators and controls are of anmal origin (horse).Handle kit reagents as if capable of transmitting an infectious agent. Appropriate precautions and good laboratory practices must be used in the storage, handling and disposal of the kit reagents. Disposal of kit reagents should be in accordance with local regulations.

Value Assignments: Target ranges for control materials are: C1 (low): 15 ng/mL (10-25 ng/mL) and C2 (high): 40 ng/mL (25- 60 ng/mL). Testing and assignment of values involves a min. of 5 assays from a min. of 2 operators with 8 replicates, resulting in a min. of 40 determinations. The mean obtained values are assigned as control values. The controls are labeled with the assigned values as mean C1 $\pm50 \%$ and $C 2 \pm 3 0 \%$ .

Calibrator value assignments are based on an internal procedure; the initial value assignment for calibrators was performed using 2 predicate assays $( \mathsf { k 0 2 1 1 6 3 } ; \mathsf { k 1 1 2 7 2 5 } )$ and HPLC. The final values are verified $\&$ assigned by adjusting their initial values to meet the specified ranges when tested against the predicate assays. Once confirmation of the values is established, the new calibrators are tested again in bulk and final.

Device Description

EUROIMMUN 25-OH Vitamin D ELISA consists of a microwell ELISA plate coated with (sheep) monoclonal anti-25-OH vitamin D antibodies, 6 calibrators, 2 controls, Biotin, sample buffer, enzyme conjugate, wash buffer concentrate, TMB chromogen/substrate solution and stop solution.

This ELISA test kit is designed for the in vitro determination of 25-OH vitamin D in human serum or plasma samples. In the first analysis step, the calibrators and patient samples are diluted with biotin-labelled 25-OH vitamin D and added to microplate wells coated with (sheep) monoclonal anti-25-OH vitamin D antibodies. During the incubation an unknown amount of 25-OH vitamin D in the patient sample and a known amount of biotinlabelled 25-OH vitamin D compete for the antibody binding sites in the microplate wells plate. Unbound 25-OH vitamin D is removed by washing. For the detection of bound biotin-labelled 25-OH vitamin D, a second incubation is performed using peroxidase-labelled streptavidin. In a third incubation using the peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) the bound peroxidase promotes a colour reaction. The colour intensity is inversely proportional to the 25-OH vitamin D concentration in the sample. Results for the samples can be calculated directly using a standard curve.

Antibodies: sheep monoclonal antibodies which identify specifically 25-OH vitamin D3 and 25-OH vitamin D2.

Intended Usel Indications for Use

EUROIMMUN 25-OH Vitamin D ELISA is intended for the quantitative determination of 25-OH Vitamin D and other hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites in human serum and plasma (EDTA, Li-heparin).

Performance Characteristics

# Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the test was investigated following CLSI standard EP05-A2. Intra- and Inter-Assay coefficients of variation (CV) were determined using samples with values at different points on the calibration curve. All samples were natural serum samples collected freshly in-house from obvious healthy blood donors. After initial screening, 2 of 8 samples (No. 7 and 8) were spiked. All samples were then aliquoted and stored at - $\mathsf { 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ The intra-Assay CVs are based on 40 determinations and the Inter-Assay CVs on 40 determinations performed in 10 different runs on 5 different days (with 4 replicates per run) according to the package insert. Acceptance criterion was that the CV's show results below $12 \%$ for samples over $1 0 \ : \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m l }$ and results below $20 \%$ for concentrations below 10 ng/ml.

# Linearity/Assay Reportable Range:

The linearity of the test was investigated following CLSl standard EP6-A. Sets of 11 sample preparations were prepared by mixing a natural negative sample (0 ng/ml) and high positive samples. The sample preparations covered the concentration range of 2 to 129 ng/ml. Each set was run according to the package insert in the same run in double determinations per sample preparation, the mean of the two determinations for each sample was calculated and polynomial regression was performed of observed results vs expected results. Although visually the data demonstrated a linear relationship, the $\mathsf { p }$ values of the polynomial regression coefficients were significant $( < 0 . 0 5 )$ for two of the three sample sets. However, the amount of nonlinearity above the functional sensitivity of $4 . 0 \ n g / m !$ was found acceptable below $1 5 \%$ . The detailed results are shown below. Based on the results of the linearity study and limit of detection study, it can be concluded that the assay is sufficiently linear from 4.0 to $1 2 0 \ n g / m |$

Analytical Specificity

# Cross-Reactivity:

Cross reactivity was investigated following Abraham et al (Handbook of radioimmunoassay, 1977). A 25-OH Vitamin D free sample was aliquoted and spiked with potential cross reacting Vitamin D metabolites at the concentrations listed below. The following cross reactivities were observed. The study shows that the 25-OH Vitamin D ELISA detects both 25-OH Vitamin D3 and 25-OH Vitamin D2 as well as other hydroxylated Vitamin D metabolites as stated in the intended use. Expected concentrations of 1,25-OH Vitamin D3 and 1,25-OH Vitamin D2 in natural samples are below 100 pg/ml, so the obtained cross reactivity has no significant influence on results of 25-OH Vitamin D.

# Interference:

Interferences were investigated following CLSI standard EP07- A2. To investigate the influence from hemoglobin, triglycerides and bilirubin as well as from cholesterol, biotin and ascorbic acid, sera at different 25-OH Vitamin D concentrations were spiked with potential interfering substances and incubated with the test system according to the package insert. The recovery in relation to the unspiked sample without interferent was calculated. The individual recovery was within the accepted individual recovery of $9 0 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 1 0 \mathrm { ~ \% ~ }$ . No significant interference was observed for concentrations of up to 750 mg/dl for hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dl for triglycerides, 40 mg/dl for bilirubin and up to 400 mg/dl for cholesterol, 1000 mg/dl for biotin and 10.0 mg/ml for ascorbic acid.

Significant interference (above $10 \%$ deviation from unspiked sample) was seen with $1 0 0 0 \ m g / \mathsf { d } \mathsf { i }$ of hemoglobin.

# Method Comparison w/Predicate Device:

The method comparison against the predicate device was performed following CLSI standard EP09-A2. Both the predicate device and the subject device were performed exactly as described by their respective instructions for use.

Serum samples were obtained from different sources (141 prospective samples sent in for 25-OH-Vitamin D testing from a clinical laboratory, 28 samples from 25-OH-Vitamin D quality assessment programs (harvested from blood donated by patients undergoing therapeutic venesection for hemochromatosis or polycythemia), 5 samples from a 25-OHVitamin D quality control panel (untreated routine patient material) and 30 samples from normal blood donors). All patients have given their informed consent. These samples are native (natural) and not treated or adjusted in any way.

To ensure that the tested concentrations of 25-OH Vitamin D are distributed across the reportable measurement range, 36 samples $( 1 5 \% )$ in the set were spiked with 25-OH Vitamin D stock solution of 25-OH Vitamin D3. In total, 240 samples were collected, ranging from 4.1 to 119.1 ng/ml, and tested with the EUROIMMUN 25-OH Vitamin D ELISA and with a FDA-cleared reference assay. Results of linear regression analysis are shown in the table below.

Matrix Comparison

The usability of plasma was investigated using sample pairs each of serum and corresponding plasma (EDTA, Li-heparin) from donors. To ensure that the tested concentrations of 25-OH Vitamin D are distributed across the reportable dynamic range, 3 sample pairs in the set were spiked with 25-OH Vitamin D stock solution of 25-OH Vitamin D3. Passing-Bablok regression was calculated for the comparison of serum to plasma. The regression equation is near the ideal correlation (intercept O; slope 1.0) indicating equivalence of concentrations between serum and the corresponding plasma matrices. Coefficients of determination were found to be above 0.99 and %recovery compared to serum was in the range of 87 to $12 7 \%$ (serum $=$ $100 \%$

Expected Values/Reference Range

Reference intervals were established following CLSl standard C28-A3. The levels of 25-OH vitamin D were analyzed in a panel of 206 samples from healthy subjects (70 men and 136 women with an average age of 64 years; age range: 22 - 99 years) from a US commercial source. The samples are known to be from normal US blood donors from the US Midwest region and were drawn in early October 2010. The observed median, minimum and maximum values as well as the $2 . 5 \%$ and $9 7 . 5 \%$ percentiles were similar to those reported for other devices cleared in the US (e.g. K102432, K112725, K110619, K091849, K110586, K071480). The results are shown in the table below.

Conclusion

The data presented is complete and provides a reasonable assurance to support the basis of the claim for substantial equivalence. The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR $\$ 809.10$ .

The EUROIMMUN 25-OH Vitamin D ELISA assay (including calibrators and controls) is substantially equivalent to other products presently in commercial distribution intended for similar use; and has been demonstrated to be safe and effective. Most notably, the EUROIMMUN 25-OH Vitamin D ELISA is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed IDS Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd. OCTEIA 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D (K021163) for in vitro diagnostic use for the quantitative determination of 25-OH Vitamin D and other hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites in human serum and plasma (EDTA, Liheparin). The EUROIMMUN 25-OH Vitamin D ELISA assay is to be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory data in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency in adult populations.
