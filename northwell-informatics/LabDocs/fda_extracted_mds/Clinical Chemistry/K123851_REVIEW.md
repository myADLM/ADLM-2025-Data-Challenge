# I. Device Description:

Glucose Meter-Check Solution is a single-level, viscosity-adjusted, aqueous liquid glucose control solution. Glucose Meter-Check Solution is intended for use to verify the performance of the Roche ACCU-CHEK brand BGM Systems listed in the package insert at recover glucose values within the interval 2 recommended in ISO 15197:2003 In vitro diagnostic test systems – Requirements for blood glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus for most meter types (Aviva, SmartView, Advantage), and comparable to solutions currently marketed by Roche for others (Active, Compact). This mid-level glucose concentration will complement the current, low and high glucose concentrations available in quality control products distributed by Roche Diagnostics for these same BGM systems. The product is packaged in plastic bottles with dropper tips for application of the solution to test strips. The control has a red color to help users see the solution while dispensing onto a test strip.

Glucose Meter-Check Solution is a non-hazardous aqueous solution glucose control solution containing no ingredients of biological origin, or in concentrations qualifying as a controlled product under the Controlled Products Regulation.

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The Glucose Meter-Check Solution for Roche ACCU-CHEK is traceable to NIST SRM 917.

# Value Assignment:

Value assignment for each production lot of control solution is determined by analysis of glucose on commercial lots of glucose test strips qualified for proper measurement using manufacturer recommended control solution. Each meter and strip combination is considered to be operating correctly if all measurements of Roche ACCU-CHEK branded control solutions are recovered within the assay ranges provided on each carton of test strips. Value assignment range is determined as the mean value of all measurements $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the mean value.

# Stability:

Product stability has been established based on real time studies. The studies performed showed that the control materials remained within specification to support the sponsor’s claims of stability.

(1) Transport Stability (closed). Testing demonstrated less than $5 \%$ change in glucose concentration over a 10 day period, under extreme temperature conditions.

(2) Open-Vial Stability: Testing demonstrated less than $5 \%$ change in glucose concentration over the 90 day evaluation period.

(3) Closed-Vial Stability: Testing demonstrated less than $1 0 \%$ change in glucose concentration over 24 months at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

d. Matrix effect: Not applicable   
e. Detection limit: Not applicable

f. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

g. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies: Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

An expected range for each glucose monitoring system is printed in the labeling. When using this control material, users are to compare their control results to the range printed in the labeling for the system being used rather than the range printed on the test strip.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
