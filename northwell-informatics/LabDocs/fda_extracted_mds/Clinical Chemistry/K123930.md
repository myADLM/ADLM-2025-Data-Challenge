# 4 Predicate Devices

The VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared VITROS $\textcircled{1}$ Chemistry Products HCY Reagent (K061588).

The VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HCY 2 Performance Verifiers are substantially equivalent to the previously cleared VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HCY Performance Verifiers (K061588).

5. Device The VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HCY 2 Reagent is used in conjunction description with the VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 27 and VITROS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EY Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 2 (BSA/Saline) on VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems, VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 4600 Chemistry Systems, and the VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 5600 Integrated Systems to quantitatively measure total homocysteine concentration in human serum and plasma.

The VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HCY 2 Reagent consists of one dual chambered reagent pack containing two ready-to-use liquid reagents, one in each chamber. Disulfide linked homocysteine (oxidized forms) in the sample is reduced by Tris (2-Carboxyethyl) Phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) to form reduced homocysteine. Reduced homocysteine reacts with serine in the presence of cystathionine $\beta$ -synthase (CBS) to form L  
cystathionine. L-cystathionine is broken down by cystathionine $\beta$ -lyase (CBL) to produce homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia. Pyruvate is   
reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using NADH as   
coenzyme. The concentration of homocysteine is directly proportional to the amount of NADH converted to $\mathrm { \ N A D ^ { + } }$ and is measured   
spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 27 is prepared from an aqueous solution containing amino acids and inorganic acid. These standards are used to calibrate the VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems, VITROS $\mathfrak { Q }$ 4600 Chemistry Systems, and VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 5600 Integrated Systems for the quantitative measurement of homocysteine.

The VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HCY 2 Performance Verifiers I, II and III are prepared from processed human serum to which amino acid and preservative have been added. These are assayed controls used to monitor performance of VITROS $\textcircled{8}$ Chemistry Products HCY and VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HCY 2 Reagents on VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Systems.

The VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 2 (Saline/BSA) is a common reagent that is used by multiple assays on VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Systems. This is a dual chambered package containing two ready-to-use liquid diluents. Diluent I is prepared from processed water to which inorganic salt has been added. Diluent 2 is prepared from processed water to which bovine serum albumin, inorganic salts and preservatives have been added.

Dear Mr. Byrne:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please go to http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDRH/CDRHOffices/ucm115809.htm for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH's) Office of Compliance. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.
