# L. Test Principle:

The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay utilizes a chemical reaction in which disulfide linked homocysteine (oxidized forms) in the sample is reduced by Tris (2- Carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) to form reduced homocysteine. Reduced homocysteine reacts with serine in the presence of cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) to form L-cystathionine. L-cystathionine is broken down by cystathionine blyase (CBL) to produce homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using NADH as coenzyme. The concentration of homocysteine is directly proportional to the amount of NADH converted to NAD+ and is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Once a calibration has been performed, the homocysteine concentration in each unknown sample can be determined using the stored calibration curve and the measured absorbance obtained in the assay of the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analyticalperformance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were conducted by the sponsor on the VITROS 5,1 FS, VITROS 4600 and the VITROS 5600 Chemistry Systems following CLSI guidance document EP05-A2. Three levels of homocysteine-spiked, human serum-based samples were run 2 times per run, 2 runs per day, for a total of at least 21 days $[ \mathrm { n } \geq 8 0$ measurements/sample level). Results are summarized below.

<table><tr><td>System</td><td>Mean Conc. (μmol/L)</td><td>Within- Day SD (μmol/L)</td><td>Within- Day %CV</td><td>Within- Lab SD</td><td>Within- Lab %CV</td></tr><tr><td>VITROS 5,1 FS</td><td>6.1 11.6 24.6</td><td>0.16 0.17 0.22</td><td>2.6 1.5 0.9</td><td>0.18 0.26 0.43</td><td>3.0 2.2 1.7</td></tr><tr><td>VITROS 4600</td><td>6.2 11.7 24.4</td><td>0.16 0.15 0.24</td><td>2.6 1.3 1.0</td><td>0.22 0.27</td><td>3.5 2.3</td></tr><tr><td>VITROS 5600</td><td>6.3 11.8 24.4</td><td>0.18 0.17 0.26</td><td>2.9 1.4 1.1</td><td>0.47 0.19 0.22 0.42</td><td>1.9 3.0 1.9 1.7</td></tr></table>

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed according to NCCLS EP6-A recommendations for evaluation of linearity. A series of 9 samples was prepared by combining various volumetric proportions of a spiked, high analyte human serum pool and a low analyte, human serum pool to produce samples with homocysteine values ranging from 0.3 to $7 4 . 9 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ . Three determinations of each of these samples were made on each of three different VITROS HCY 2 Reagent reagent lots on the VITROS 5,1 FS, VITROS 4600, and VITROS 5600 Chemistry Systems.

The linear regression correlation between the expected values and the measured values is summarized below for a representative lot:

<table><tr><td>VITROS System</td><td>Regression equation</td><td>Correlation coefficient</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">5,1 FS 4600</td><td>y = 1.05x + 0.075</td><td>0.9999</td></tr><tr><td>y = 1.05x + 0.025</td><td>0.9999</td></tr><tr><td>y = 1.05x + 0.028</td><td>0.9999</td></tr></table>

The linearity study provided by the sponsor supports a reportable range claim for the VITROS HCY 2 device of $2 - 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ homocysteine.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

The VITROS HCY 2 assay is traceable to NIST 1955 materials. The VITROS Chemistry Products calibrator kit 27 was cleared in k061588.

HCY 2 Calibration Stability

HCY 2 assay calibration stability was assessed on all 3 VITROS systems, and the sponsor claims that calibration is stable for 2 months. The protocol and acceptance criteria have been provided and found to be adequate to support the sponsor’s claims.

# HCY 2 Performance Verifier Value Assignment

The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 Performance Verifiers I, II, and II were value assigned on 2 VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems using 2 lots of VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 Reagent, 2 lots of VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Reagent, and 1 run of 8 replicates per instrument $\mathrm { N } { = } 1 6$ total replicates per assay).

Target values for HCY 2 Verifiers I, II and III are 7.0, 12.5, and $2 5 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ , respectively, and can be used for both HCY and HCY 2 tests. Lot specific target ranges are provided in the value assignment sheet.

# HCY 2 Performance Verifier Stability

The shelf life stability of the VITROS HCY 2 verifiers was tested on a VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System using a real time study extending at least one month beyond the selected expiration date. Testing is ongoing. The VITROS HCY 2 verifiers are stored refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , and are stable for at least 8 months when stored at this storage temperature.

The opened vial stability of the VITROS HCY 2 verifiers was tested on a VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System. Testing is ongoing. The verifiers are stable for at least 14 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Real-time stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been provided and found to be adequate to support the sponsor’s claims.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor performed a detection limit study for the VITROS HCY 2 assay on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System, the VITROS 4600 Chemistry System, and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System, according to CLSI guidance document EP17-A.

Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined for each of 3 reagent lots, based on One hundred (100) replicate homocysteine measurements of 1 blank sample (homocysteine stripped human serum) on each of the 3 VITROS chemistry systems. The limit of blank, as determined by adding the pooled blank standard deviation to the blank calculated concentration mean, was $0 . 3 9 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ .

Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for each of 3 reagent lots, based on One hundred (100) replicate homocysteine measurements of 5 low human serumbased samples on each of the 3 VITROS chemistry systems. The limits of detection were calculated using the determined LoB value and pooled SD values from LoD samples. The sponsor claimed that the LoD for serum samples on VITROS chemistry systems was $0 . 7 9 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) determination was based on interassay precision of $\leq 2 0 \%$ for 12 replicate measurements of 4 low serum samples, per day for 3 days, on each of the 3 VITROS chemistry systems. The LoQ was determined to be $2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ for the VITROS HCY 2 assay on each of the 3 VITROS chemistry systems.

The HCY 2 test has a measuring range of 2 to $5 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed according to CLSI guidance document EP-7A to determine the effects from potential interferents on the VITROS HCY 2 assay. Various concentrations of interferents were spiked into serum pools containing homocysteine at low ( ${ \sim } 6$ umol/L) and elevated $( { \sim } 2 5 \mathrm { u m o l / L } )$ concentrations. All samples were tested in triplicate on each of the 3 VITROS Chemistry Systems. The sponsor states that interference is considered to be non-significant if the bias between the tested and control samples are within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for HCY concentration of ${ \bf \mathit { \Sigma } } { > } 1 2 ~ \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ and within $1 . 7 9 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ for HCY concentration of ${ < } 1 2 \ \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ .

Below is a summary table of the highest concentration of interferent tested and found not to interfere based on the stated acceptance criteria.

Based on their interference study results, the sponsor made the following limitations in their labeling:

Patient samples containing cystathionine (reference interval: 0.065 to $0 . 3 0 1 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } \ 1 3$ ) show positive equimolar interference with the VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay. For example, a sample containing 10.0 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ homocysteine and $0 . 3 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ cystathionine will generate a VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay result of ${ \sim } 1 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ . Elevated cystathionine levels can be observed in patients with certain conditions, such as renal disease, folate deficiency, and cystathionine beta-lyase deficiency.   
Patient samples containing elevated levels of L-cysteine (normal range: 178 to $1 9 6 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L } \ 1 \div$ ) can show positive interference with the VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay. For example, a sample containing 6.2 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ homocysteine and an additional $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \textmu m o l / L }$ added L-cysteine could generate a VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay result of ${ \sim } 8 . 6$ $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ (bias of $+ 2 . 4 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ).   
For samples that generate a Sample Integrity Turbidity-index flag, dilute the sample and re-analyze (refer to the Sample Dilution section of the product insert).

An additional study analyzed 10 paired sets of serum and $2 \mathbf { x }$ Li-Heparin and 2x EDTA plasma samples to determine the impact of short draws on HCY2 assay performance. Due to observed negative bias, the sponsor recommends that short draws not be used.

The sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:

Whole blood samples should be centrifuged within 1 hour after collection or refrigerated for up to 8 hours prior to centrifugation. After blood is drawn, homocysteine is released from erythrocytes and the concentration will increase at a rate of approximately $1 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ per hour at room temperature.

Plasma specimens must be collected in plasma tubes that are at least half full.   
Smaller volumes can result in negative biases.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed on at least 110 human serum samples, 10 of which were spiked with homocysteine, on the VITROS 5,1 FS, VITROS 4600 and the VITROS 5600 Chemistry Systems, versus the predicate method, following CLSIEP9A2-IR. Three reagent lots were used for the testing. Samples were measured in singlicate and ranged in homocysteine concentration from 2.90 to 44.4 umol/L. Results are summarized below for the linear regression analyses resulting from a plot of homocysteine concentrations obtained on the subject (Y-axis) and predicate (Xaxis) devices, for a representative lot.

# b. Matrix comparison:

Matrix comparison studies were completed 40 paired serum and plasma samples (EDTA Plasma and Li-Heparin Plasma; 32 were native samples and 8 were spiked samples). Each sample was tested in duplicate on each of 3 lots of VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 Reagent on all 3 VITROS Chemistry Systems. Linear regression analysis using singlet set of data showed the following relationships between plasma and serum samples:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range of SampleConc.
