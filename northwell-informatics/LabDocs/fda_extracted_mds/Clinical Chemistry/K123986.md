This summary of 510(k) safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

The assigned 510(k) number is: K123986

The primary purpose of this 510(k) submission is to expand the intended use claims to support use of the Actim PROM test in pregnant women greater than or equal to $\left( \ge \right)$ 29 weeks gestational age and use of vaginal swab samples collected without the use of a speculum in addition to the current sample type, swabs collected with the use of a speculum.

To establish substantial equivalence to the predicate, the Actim PROM test was compared to the previously cleared version of the Actim PROM test (510(k) K061886).

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Actim PROM test is a rapid test to aid in diagnosis of premature rupture of fetal membranes in pregnant women who present with signs, symptoms or complaints suggestive of ROM. The test is based on lateral flow immunoassay. It utilizes two monoclonal antibodies to human IGFBP-1. One of the two antibodies is bound to blue latex particles (detecting antibody). The other antibody is immobilized as a test line on the membrane (catching antibody). The test strip (dipstick) is composed of the sample/conjugate pad, the membrane with test and control lines, and the absorbent pad assembled between plastic films. The upper film contains a test window. When the sample area of the dipstick is placed in an extracted sample, the dipstick absorbs liquid, which starts to flow up the dipstick. If the sample contains IGFBP-1 it binds to the antibody labeled with latex particles. The particles are carried by the liquid flow, and if IGFBP-1 is bound to them, they bind to the catching antibody. A blue line (test line) will appear in the result area if the concentration of IGFBP-1 in the sample exceeds the detection limit of the test. A second blue line, the control line, confirms correct operator performance of the test.

# INTENDED USE

The Actim PROM test is a visually interpreted, qualitative immunoassay rapid test for the detection of amniotic fluid in cervicovaginal secretions during pregnancy. The Actim PROM test detects IGFBP-1, a major protein in amniotic fluid and a marker of the presence of amniotic fluid in a vaginal sample. The test is intended for prescription use in point of care and clinical laboratory settings to help diagnose the rupture of fetal membranes (ROM) in pregnant women ${ \geq } 2 9$ weeks gestation who present with signs, symptoms or complaints suggestive of ROM.

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The Actim PROM test is a qualitative, lateral flow immunoassay intended to aid in the detection of ruptured fetal membranes in pregnant women. Detection of results is by visual inspection. The Actim PROM test is intended for use in the point-of-care and clinical laboratory setting.

There have been no changes made to the Actim PROM test. The device is physically the same as the current, 510(k) cleared Actim PROM test. The purpose of this submission is to expand the indication for use claims to include use of the device in pregnant women ${ \tt \ge } 2 9 $ weeks gestational age and to allow use of the device with vaginal swabs collected without use of a speculum.

# PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

# CLINICAL STUDY

The clinical performance of the Actim PROM test was established in a multi-center, prospective clinical study conducted at six US clinical sites over an 18 month period. A total of 222 pregnant women presenting with signs/symptoms suggestive of ROM were evaluated using the Actim PROM test and compared to results obtained from conventional clinical criteria. Subjects were considered clinically positive for PRoM if amniotic fluid was seen leaking from the cervical os upon diagnostic speculum examination, or if two of the three following clinical signs were positive:visual pooling of fluid in the posterior fornix, positive nitrazine test or microscopic evidence of ferning. Actim PROM test performance was established relative to clinical diagnosis as determined by the conventional clinical criteria identified above.

Actim PROM test performance by sample type and gestational age versus clinical diagnosis, including $9 5 \%$ Confidence Intervals (Cl), is presented below.

# ANALYTICAL STUDIES

# REPEATABILITY

A panel of specimens consisting of samples of different IGFBP-1 concentration levels was evaluated for intra-assay precision. The samples were tested with 10 replicates during the same day using three different lots of the Actim PROM test. Repeatable results were obtained.

# REPRODUCIBILITY

A study of the Actim PROM test was conducted at three separate sites using panels of blind coded specimens containing negative $\left( 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \right|$ of IGFBP-1), high negative $\tau \mu \mathrm { g } / \mu$ of IGFBP-1), moderate negative $( 1 2 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g } / 1$ of IGFBP-1), low positive $( 2 0 \mu \ g / \updownarrow$ of IGFBP-1), moderate positive $ { \mathrm { ( 2 5 \mu \mathrm { g } / l } }$ of IGFBP-1), and high positive (30, 50, and $1 0 0 \mu \ g / \updownarrow$ of IGFBP-1) specimens. Test operators $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 9 )$ tested each level multiple times over a period of five days. A total of 360 tests were performed (120 per site) with a total of 45 tests per sample. The overall reproducibility of the Actim PROM test is $9 7 \%$ (350/360) with no significant differences within runs (replicates tested by one operator), between runs (five different days), between sites (three sites) or between operators (nine operators).

# ANALYTICAL SENSITIVITY

The analytical sensitivity (detection limit) of the Actim PROM test was identified by evaluating different concentrations of IGFBP-1 in extracted sample on three different lots of the Actim PROM test. Two different operators each interpreted ten devices run at each concentration under various lighting conditions for a total of 60 determinations per level. The Actim PROM test limit of detection $1 0 0 \%$ positive) is approximately $2 5 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L }$ of IGFBP-1 in extracted sample. The measuring range of the Actim PROM test is approximately $2 5 { \cdot } 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / L } }$ in extracted sample. It should be noted that positive results could be observed for extracted samples with IGFBP-1 at $< 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { u g / L } }$ .

# ANALYTICAL SPECIFICITY

Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was tested with human IGFBP proteins at concentrations ranging from 10-5,000 μg/L of each protein in extracted sample were tested. No cross-reactivity was seen using human IGFBP-2, -3, -4, -5 and -6 proteins. The Actim PROM test is specific to human IGFBP-1.

Supplied as high concentration from the University of Turku, Finland

Semen and pregnancy urine were tested with the Actim PROM test. No interference of these substances was observed with the performance of the Actim PROM test. Whole blood with concentrations corresponding to typical pregnancy levels of IGFBP-1 was tested and did not affect Actim PROM test performance.

Samples with different pH levels (pH levels from 3.5-8.5) were tested with the Actim PROM test and were found not to affect Actim PROM test performance.
