# Device Description:

Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Control is a human serum based product containing constituents of purified biochemicals (tissue extracts of human and animal origin), chemicals, therapeutic drugs, preservatives and stabilizers. Two levels of Control are provided in a lyophilized form. Each level is packaged into a glass amber bottle containing 5mL of product. The product is packaged in single level boxes $1 2 \times 5 m L )$ or multiple level boxes $( 6 \times 2 \times$ 5mL) and stored at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } C$ .

All human source material was tested and found negative by FDA approved methods for HBsAg, HCV, and HIV-1/2.

# Value Assignment:

Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Control value assignment is lot specific. Lot to lot variation is determined by testing new lot vs. previous lot normalized to either a serum standard made with corresponding analyte NiST or Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The target values are obtained by testing 16 replicates, 4 replicates each over a period of 4 days. The average of these 16 data points is the mean. The range is then determined by multiplying the mean by $\pm 2 0 \%$ , creating the upper and lower range. All testing is performed alongside (OEM) Original Equipment Manufacturer material to verify values before accepting new ranges.
