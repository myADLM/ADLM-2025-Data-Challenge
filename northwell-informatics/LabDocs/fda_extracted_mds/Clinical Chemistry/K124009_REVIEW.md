# I. Device Description:

Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Control is a human serum-based product containing constituents of purified biochemicals (tissue extracts of human and animal origin), chemicals, therapeutic drugs, preservatives, and stabilizers. Two levels of control per analyte are provided in a lyophilized form. Each level is packaged into a glass amber bottle containing $5 \mathrm { m L }$ of product. The product is packaged in single level boxes ( $1 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5 \mathrm { ~ m L }$ ) or multiple level boxes $( 6 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5 \mathrm { m L }$ ) and stored at $2 - 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

All human source material was tested and found negative by FDA approved methods for HBsAg, HCV and HIV-1/2.

Alpha-1 Anti-Trypsin and Haptoglobin are endogenously sourced from the base matrix comprised of human serum.

# Stability:

Shelf-Life and Reconstitution Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate.

Shelf-Life Stability – Accelerated stability testing supports a shelf-life stability claim of 2 years at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Controls. Real-Time stability study is on-going.

Reconstitution Stability – Real time testing was performed and supports the following claims: reconstituted Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Controls are stable for up to 7 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 20 days at ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ .

# Value Assignment:

Olympus AU 600 and Abbott AxSYM were used for value assignment. Sixteen replicates of each analyte were tested over 4 days with 4 replicates tested each day. The 16 data points were compiled and the mean was used as the target concentration. Value assignment ranges were established at $\pm 2 0 \%$ around the target concentration. The target mean and range for each analyte are provided in tabular form in the value assignment sheets.
