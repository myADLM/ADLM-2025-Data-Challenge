# L. Test Principle:

The Precision Xceed Pro Blood Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose biosensor is capable of determining glucose oxidized by the enzyme (Glucose dehydrogenase, GDH-NAD) catalyzed reaction with Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left( \mathrm { N A D + } \right)$ cofactor. The reduced form of $\mathrm { N A D + ( N A D H ) }$ is re-oxidized by reaction with the electrochemical mediator, 1,10-phenanthroline quinone (1,10-PQ). The reduced mediator is re-oxidized via electron transfer at the electrode surface. This current is translated into a number by the monitor, after applying lot specific calibration information and after a 5 second countdown, a concentration value is presented to the user. In this same manner, the biosensor electrode utilizes the enzyme hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), which reacts with the beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-ketone) concentration in the sample. This reaction is transferred to the monitor through an electrical current generated proportional to the level of beta-ketone in the sample. This current is translated into a number by the monitor, after applying lot specific calibration information and after a 10 second countdown, a concentration value is presented to the user.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The meter and strips of the $\beta$ -ketone assay are identical to the predicate device. While the $\beta$ - ketone test strip has been previously cleared on the candidate meter, the glucose test strip has not. For this reason, performance characteristics for the only glucose assay in the candidate device are described below. Performance characteristics for the $\beta \mathrm { . }$ -ketone assay of this device are described in the predicate device submission (k080960).

# b. Linearity:

$\beta$ -ketone linearity was established in its predicate k080960. The measuring range for $\beta$ -ketone is $0 . 0 1 { - } 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

Glucose linearity: In the linearity study, three blood donor samples were spiked with dextrose to include glucose concentrations of 23, 47, 78, 130, 197, 262, 336, 406, 482 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by the YSI-2300. At each glucose level, 9 meters, and 10 replicates of each of 3 strip lots were tested. Values from the 9 meters were compared with those obtained from YSI. The results from regression analysis are summarized

below:

Strip Lot $1 \colon \mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 6 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 5 4 4$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 5$ Strip Lot 2: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 7 \mathrm { x } - 4 . 5 0 8 $ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 6$ Strip Lot 3: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 7 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 5 9 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 7$

The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 20-500 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for glucose.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability, stability and value assignment –

Test strips:

$\beta$ -Ketone test strip:

The $\beta$ -ketone test strips were cleared under k080960 under the name Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips. The ketone test strip remains unchanged, however the brand name of the ketone strip has been updated to Freestyle Precision Pro $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strip. The stability of the test strips has been established under k080960.

Glucose test strip:

The Freestyle Precision Pro Glucose Test Strips are sealed in individual foil packets. Stability information was presented for the Freestyle Precision Pro Glucose Test Strip to support an 18 month shelf life when stored at $4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Control Solutions:

The control solutions were previously cleared and stability and value assignment was previously established in k983504.

d. Detection limit:

See the linearity study in section M. 1. b. above.

e. Analytical specificity:

The analytical specificity for $\beta$ -ketone measurement was established in $\mathrm { k 0 8 0 9 6 0 }$ . Interference studies were performed for the glucose measurement function by evaluating 25 potential interfering substances spiked into venous blood at two different glucose levels, $5 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 5 0 { - } 3 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Substances were spiked into blood samples at a normal/therapeutic and a high concentration. The control samples were not spiked with the substances. Bias from YSI was compared between the samples with and without spiked substances to determine whether a particular substance interferes with glucose measurement. The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant interference was detected:

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

$\beta$ -ketone accuracy was established in k080960.

Glucose accuracy:

To assess system accuracy, a total of 150 capillary blood samples with glucose values ranging from 32.5 to $4 9 4 { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ were evaluated on each of 3 strip lots run with the FreeStyle Precision Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips and were verified using YSI reference results. To obtain low or high end glucose values, capillary blood samples were glycolyzed or spiked. Although 150 subjects were recruited for the study, 7 were excluded for protocol deviations due to early withdrawal or incomplete sampling. Therefore, only 143 samples were available for analysis for the lay user test. An additional 20 samples were manipulated samples to meet the glucose distribution across the range.

Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

Scanning the bar code label on each glucose and ketone test strip foil packet prior to use automatically calibrates the monitor and checks the expiration date.

6. Quality Control:

Glucose and ketone control solutions at three concentrations should be tested with this device. Acceptable ranges for each control level are printed on the respective test strip vials. The user is instructed to contact the Customer Help line if control results fall outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Software documentation: The following documentations related to the software were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm provided documentation to support the device was designed, developed and is under good software lifecycle processes.

2. Data transmission: Bench testing has been performed on two meters to verify that the meters meet the requirements of transmitting full data memory and memory rollover via wireless signal and data cable. The results showed that all data was transmitted accurately at $100 \%$ with no data corruption.

3. Hematocrit Study:

a. Ketone: Hematocrit study for the ketone strip was previously established. The sponsor’s claim is that hematocrit in the range of $30 \%$ does not significantly interfere with ketone results.

b. Glucose: The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with three lot of test strips. Blood samples at five concentrations (40-50, 100-120, 210-230, 330-350, 400- $4 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were analyzed. The glucose samples were prepared from venous blood at seven different hematocrit levels 15, 20, 30, 43, 50, 60, and $65 \%$ . Glucose results for each concentration and hematocrit level were compared to samples tested on the YSI reference method. The data supports the sponsor’s claim that hematocrit in the range of $30 \%$ does not significantly interfere with glucose measurements.

4. Altitude Study:

a. Ketone: Altitude study for the ketone strip was previously established in k983850 it says altitude up to 7200 feet does not affect results.

b. Glucose: An altitude study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude up to 10,152 feet on performance of the blood glucose monitoring system. Venous whole blood samples at three glucose concentrations 40, 100, $4 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested on one lot of test strips. Each sample was also evaluated by the YSI method. At altitudes of 10,152 feet, there was no significant effect on the tested values verified by YSI.

5. Test System operating conditions:

a. Ketone: Test System operating condition for the ketone strip was previously established.

b. Glucose: Studies were performed using three lots of test strips, with glucose concentrations of 40-50, 90-110 and $3 8 0 { - } 4 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Testing was performed at five combined temperature and humidity conditions $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 1 0 \%$ RH, $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 9 0 ^ { \circ } / 0 \mathrm { R H } .$ , $2 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 5 0 \% \mathrm { R H }$ , $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 1 0 \% \mathrm { R H }$ and $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 9 0 \% \mathrm { R H } )$ and results compared to the reference YSI. There were no significant differences relative to YSI in glucose concentrations across the temperature and humidity ranges tested. Results demonstrated that the test system can be used at temperatures from ${ 5 9 } { - } 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ ( $1 5 { - } 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and at a relative humidity from $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ .

6. User performance study:

During the lay user study described above in Section M.3.c, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that they could successfully perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.

7. Readability Assessment:

The readability of the labeling (user guide and test strip insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis were found to be written at the 8th grade level.

8. EMC Testing:

The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed.

9. Infection Control:

Freestyle Precision Pro Blood Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System is intended for multiple–patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing lab demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach (EPA Reg. No: 56392-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles, using Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach, to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
