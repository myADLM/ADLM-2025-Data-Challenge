) Device name:

Trade name: Contour $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter Common name: Blood Glucose Meter Classification name: Blood Glucose Test System, Overthe-Counter, 75 NBW (21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1345)

)Predicate device:

Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter (Reference: Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K111268))

Device description:

The Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter consists of a small handheld blood glucose meter that utilizes dry reagent test strips for the measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes. Liquid control solution is used to check the performance of the system. The meter, together with the test strips and control solutions, is referred to as the Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

The chemical principle utilized for both the predicate and modified devices is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose in the blood with chemicals on the reagent strip. The blood sample is drawn into the tip of the reagent strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) enzyme on the reagent strip. The electrons generated by this reaction are shuttled to an electrode by a mediator chemical, producing a current that

# Bayer HealthCare

is proportional to the glucose in the sample. After a fixed reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is calculated and displayed.

5) Intended Use:

The Contour Next EZ blood glucose monitoring system is an over the counter (OTC) device utilized for self-testing by persons with diabetes at home for the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood, is for singlepatient use only, and should not be shared. The Contour Next EZ blood glucose monitoring system is indicated for use with fresh fingertip capillary whole blood samples. The clinical utility of this device is to aid in monitoring the effectiveness of your diabetes control program. The Contour Next EZ blood glucose monitoring system is not intended for use for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus and is not intended for use on neonates. The Contour Next test strips are intended for self-testing by persons with diabetes for the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood samples from 20 to 600 mg/dL.

# Data demonstrating substantial equivalence

The Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter consists of a small handheld blood glucose meter that is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K111268). The modified device uses dry reagent test strips for the measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes and liquid controls to check the performance of the system. The same Contour Next test strips and control solutions are used by both the modified and predicate device.

A detailed comparison of the characteristics featured between the modified.and predicate devices is provided in the tables below:

# Linearity

A linearity study was performed to demonstrate the analytical range of the Contour Plus assay $( 1 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m g / d L } )$ . Note: the claimed range for the Contour Next EZ meter will be $2 0 { \cdot } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The blood glucose samples that were tested ranged from 0.1 mg/dL to $6 9 2 m g / d L$ .

The internal acceptance criteria for accuracy was results within $\pm$ 10mg/dL for glucose values $<$ 100mg/dL and results within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for glucose values $\geq$ EPY 100mg/dL. $100 \%$ of results met the acceptance critieria For the samples tested at 0.1 and 692 mg/dL, $100 \%$ of the tests yielded "LO" and "HI" messages as expected since those values are outside of the claimed range.

# Intermediate Precision

300 control tests were performed using three lots of Contour Plus test strips and three levels of Contour Plus control solution. The internal acceptance criteria was Cp values $\ge 0 . 6 5$ .All results generated Cp values $>$ 1.0, so the acceptance criteria was met.

# EMC and Electrical Safety

The Contour Plus meter was evaluated and found to be compliant with applicable sections of IEC 62316-2-6:2005, IEC 61010-1:2001 and IEC 61010-2-101:2002

# Clinical Trial

The accuracy of the Contour Plus System was evaluated in the hands of intended users according to 1S0 15197:2003 using three lots of Contour Plus test strips. A total of 220 persons with diabetes were enrolled as subjects in the trial, which was conducted at two sites. The subjects ranged in age from 26 to 86 with a mean age of 60.

# Blood Sample Re-application (Second Chance Sampling)

During the clinical trial, there were instances where users did not apply a sufficient blood sample to the Contour Plus test strip and were prompted by the Contour Plus meter to add more blood. In some cases, the attempt to apply more blood did not yield a blood glucose result and an expected E2 error was received. In the other cases, a blood glucose result was received after the additional blood sample was applied within the time allowed.

# Hematocrit and Temperature Combination Study

Testing was performed using the current CONTOUR®NEXT EZ meter (K111268) and the modified Contour Next EZ meter. Three glucose concentrations and four hematocrit levels were tested at temperatures of 5, 10, 22, 35, 40 and $4 5 \%$ . Acceptance criteria was met using both software versions (Bias from YSl should be less than 10 mg/dL at glucose levels below 100 mg/dL and less than $10 \%$ at higher glucose levels) However, the range of bias obtained at different hematocrits at 5 and $10 ^ { \circ } C$ was narrower with the modified CONTOUR®NEXT EZ meter than with the current CONTOUR®NEXT EZ meter.

# Hematocrit Dependency Study

Additional testing was performed using the modified Contour Next EZ meter. Four glucose concentrations and five hematocrit levels were tested. The acceptance criteria, that bias from YSl should be less than 10 mg/dL at glucose levels below 100 mg/dL and less than $10 \%$ at higher glucose levels, was met.

# Temperature Dependency Study

Testing was performed using the modified Contour Next EZ meter. Three glucose concentrations were tested at temperatures of 5, 10, 15 and $2 2 ^ { \circ } C$ . The acceptance criteria, that bias from the YSl should be less than $1 0 \ m g / \mathrm { d L }$ at

# Bayer HealthCare

glucose levels below 100 mg/dL and less than $10 \%$ at higher glucose levels, was met.

# Temperature and Humidity Combination Study

The following conditions were tested using the modified Contour Next EZ meter at glucose reference levels of 20, 80, 120, 350 and 550 mg/dL:

E $5 \%$ $10 \%$ RH (corner) . EY $5 \%$ , 93%RH (corner) • EP $2 5 \%$ , 50%RH (center) • $45 \%$ $10 \%$ RH (corner) EY $45 \%$ $93 \%$ RH (corner)

The results met the acceptance criteria of ± 10 mg/dL or ± 10 % of the reference method

# Blood Sample Re-application (or Second Chance Sampling)

Re-application study conducted by lab personnel:

The improved ability of the modified Contour Next EZ meter to detect under-filled test strips was tested using the current Contour Next EZ meter (K111268) and the modified meter (K130265). The Contour Next test strips were inoculated with blood to simulate severely under-filled and moderately under-filled conditions. After the initial inoculation, additional sample was applied to the test strips. The acceptance criteria was that $9 5 \%$ of results fall within $\pm 1 5$ mg/dL (for glucose results $< 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ or within $15 \%$ (for glucose results $\geq 1 0 0 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } } )$ of the reference assay when the test strips were partially filled.

When the test strips were severely under-filled, the results generated by both versions of the Contour Next EZ meter met the acceptance criteria. When the test strips were moderately under-flled, the current Contour Next EZ meter generated an E2 error code $100 \%$ of the time, while the modified meter generated accurate results that met the acceptance criteria.

# Re-application study done by lay users:

A study was conducted with lay users to investigate the feasibility of a proposed protocol that would increase the likelihood that patients would obtain an underfilled test strip during testing. Lay users were trained to underfil the test strips in order to generate the sample re-application prompt. The results after the sample re-application met the IS0 15197:2013 accuracy criteria with $100 \%$ of the results falling within $15 \%$ of the YSl reference glucose, indicating the method is feasible.

# Bayer HealthCare

# Lay User Re-application Data:

Data was collected from five R&D lay user studies. In these studies, there were 58 instances of under-filled test strips. The IS0 15197:2013 accuracy criteria were met with $98 \%$ of the data falling within the ±15mg/dL or $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the YSI reference glucose.

# Error Detection of Moisture Damaged Test Strips

Contour Next test strips were stressed by leaving the bottles open for 23 days inside a $30 \text{‰}$ RH environmental chamber. This evaluation simulated severe mishandling of the test strips. After 23 days, the test strips from the open bottles (and closed bottles as a control) were tested at three glucose levels using current Contour Next EZ meters (K111268) and the modified Contour Next EZ meters (K130265). The modified Contour Next EZ meters were capable of detecting damaged test strips more frequently than the current Contour Next EZ meter and generated an E11 error code.

# Conclusions from Nonclinical and Clinical Evaluations

The Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter is substantially equivalent in its intended use, performance, safety and effectiveness to the predicate Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter (K111268) based on the performance of the Contour Plus and Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems.
