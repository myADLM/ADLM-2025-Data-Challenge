# L. Test Principle:

CONTOUR NEXT EZ blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of the glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the strip. The blood sample is drawn into the tip of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and the mediator. Electrons are generated, producing a current that is proportional to the glucose in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is displayed. No calculation is required.
