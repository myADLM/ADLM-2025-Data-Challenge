# I. Device Description:

The Dimension EXL with LM system is a floor model, fully automated, microprocessorcontrolled, integrated instrument which used prepackaged Siemens Dimension Flex reagent cartridges to measure a variety of analytes in human body fluids. The system can process samples in random access, batch or STAT modes. The instrument has a heterogeneous module (HM) for processing chromium-based heterogeneous immunoassays and a LOCI module (LM) for chemiluminescent immunoassays.

The test system remains the same except for the PMT. The PMT was modified by changing the supplier and the format of the multiplier channel was changed from multiple dynodes to enhanced glass single surface tube used to count the signal for the chemiluminescent methods.

The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ regent cartridge consists of prepackaged liquid reagents containing two synthetic beads, and a biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody in a plastic eight-well cartridge

# L. Test Principle:

The Dimension EXL with LM system is a floor model, fully automated, microprocessor controlled, integrated instrument which uses prepackaged Siemens Dimension Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges to measure a variety of analytes in human body fluids. The system can process samples in random access, batch or STAT modes. The instrument has a heterogeneous module (HM) for processing chromium-based heterogeneous immunoassays and a $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ module for chemiluminescent immunoassays. The instrument can also perform photometric, turbidimetric and affinity column mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) tests.

The FT4L method is a homogeneous, sequential, chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring, weaker binding analog of T4, and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a fraction of the biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free thyroxine (FT4) concentration. In a second step, T3 Chemibeads are added and form bead/biotinylated antibody immunocomplexes with the non-saturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the FT4 concentration in the sample.

Testing was performed over twenty (20) days, one (1) run per day for each test material on the Dimension EXL with LM systems with both the new and the current PMT.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range was determined using the Level 5 Thyroid Calibrator and the calibrator base matrix with the new PMT in accordance with CLSI Evaluation of Linearity of Quantitative Measure Procedures (EP06-A). Intermediate levels were prepared by proportional mixing of the high and low calibrator materials to produce concentrations evenly distributed across the assay range. Eleven concentration levels (ranging 0.1 to $8 . 3 2 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ were assayed three times. The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The quadratic terms of the second and third order polynomial fit were statistically insignificant (p value ${ \tt > } 0 . 0 5$ ), supporting linearity across the measuring range of 0.1 to $8 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The least squares linear regression analyses were: slope $= 1 . 0 4$ , y-intercept= $\mathrm { : - 0 . 0 1 }$ , and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . \dot { 0 } 0$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Calibrator Traceability:

USP-grade thyroxine is spiked into stripped human serum at different concentrations.   
This becomes the “Anchor Pool”. The “Anchor Pool” values are validated in-house.

A Master Pool is developed from stripped bovine albumin to which different concentrations of thyroxine have been added. Values for the Master Pool are derived by multiple analyses against the Anchor Pool calibration curve. $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ Thyroid Calibrator value assignment is established by measurement against the Master Pool calibration.

Calibrators have been previously cleared in k073604.

# d. Detection limit:

To verify the limit of blank (LoB), twenty (20) replicates of the calibrator matrix material $( 0 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ were processed in a single batch run in accordance with CLSI EP17-A with the new PMT. None of the replicate measurements exceeded the LoB claim of $0 . 0 3 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The LoB claim was verified and established as $0 . 0 3 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ the reference concentration for LoD verification.

To verify the limit of detection (LoD), two samples were prepared at concentrations approximately equal to the LoD claim $( 0 . 0 6 { \mathrm { n g / d L } } )$ . The samples were processed in replicates of five for three testing days yielding a total of fifteen test measurements per sample. All replicate measurements exceeded the LoB claim. The LoD was determined to be $0 . 0 6 { \mathrm { n g / d L } }$ .
