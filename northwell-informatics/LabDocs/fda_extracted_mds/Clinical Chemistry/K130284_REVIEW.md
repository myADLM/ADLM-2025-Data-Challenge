# L. Test Principle:

The On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an amperometric method that uses flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry and a mediator that reacts with glucose in the whole blood sample to produce an electrical current. This current is measured by the meter, and after calculation by the meter, the blood glucose concentration reading is displayed, calibrated to plasma reference.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within run precision was performed using five venous blood samples spiked with glucose to achieve higher glucose concentrations and allowed to equilibrate for at least 2 hours before use). The samples tested ranged from 39 to $3 2 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was tested 10 times on three test strip lots, using 10 meters per test strip lot for $\mathtt { n } = 1 0 0$ per test strip lot. The mean values, standard deviations and coefficients of variation were calculated for each sample and are summarized below.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed using eleven different levels (10, 25, 50, 80, 110, 170, 220, 330, 450, 550, and $6 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) of venous whole blood samples supplemented with a glucose stock solution to cover the claimed measuring range from 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Four measurements were taken from each glucose level and measured using 3 lots of test strips on a minimum of 2 meters. Linear regression analysis resulted in the equation $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 4 0 9 \mathrm { x } - 5 . 2 6 9 7$ with an $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 0 3$ . The claimed measuring range is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ based on the linearity data.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The glucose control standards are traceable to a NIST $\operatorname { S R M } 9 1 7 \mathbf { b } ^ { \mathrm { a } }$ glucose standard and are prepared at three target concentrations (Level $0 = 5 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Level $1 = 1 2 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Level $2 = 3 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). The reference instrument used is the YSI 2300 Glucose analyzer.

# Stability

Accelerated stability study was conducted to assess the shelf-life stability of the control solutions and test strips. Real-time stability studies are still on-going. Stability studies protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be adequate.

Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life and are stable for 1 month after first use when stored at $5 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $3 5 . 6 \cdot 8 6 ~ \mathrm { ^ { o } F ) }$ .

Unopened test strips have a 24 month shelf-life and are stable for 1 month after first use when stored at $5 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 3 5 . 6 - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ at a $\% \mathrm { R H }$ of $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ .

# Expected values

The controls are prepared at three target concentrations gravimetrically. The solution is then compared to the NIST standard and then the glucose concentrations are verified with the YSI reference method. The expected values are verified for each new lot of strips.

d. Detection limit:

See linearity study above in section 1.b.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. 35 common endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were evaluated by spiking venous blood to three levels of glucose concentrations (50, 100, $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). The glucose samples were then spiked with the potentially interfering compounds (2 concentration including normal or therapeutic levels and high or toxic levels). Two meters were used for this study with 4 strips for each meter. Three lots of test strips were tested for a total of 1152 test strips. Bias was calculated as the mean percent difference in glucose reading between the test and control concentration groups. The sponsor claims no significant interference if bias between the tested and the control sample is ${ < } 1 0 \%$ difference. A summary of the concentrations of the potential interfering substances tested is summarized in the table below:

Based on the study data, all the substances and levels tested above have ${ < } 1 0 \%$ bias except for ascorbic acid $> 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (above therapeutic levels) and xylose $> 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Ascorbic acid levels $> 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and xylose $> 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ will interfere with the glucose reading; therefore, the sponsor has the following limitation in their labeling:

“Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (when occurring in blood at normal or at high therapeutic concentration) do not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high concentration $( > 3 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ in blood may cause inaccurately high results."

“Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing. Xylose $( > 4 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ in the blood will cause interference”

Sodium Fluoride interferes with blood glucose testing in the On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The sponsor has included the following warning “Never test blood that has been placed in test tubes containing fluoride or other anticoagulants. This will cause falsely low results.”

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

# Lay user studies

One hundred and three (103) lay users participated in the study. Three (3) strip lots were tested on 36 meters. Instructions for use were given to each study subject to let the subject learn and understand how to run testing for the studied system. After reading the instructions, each study subject performed fingerstick testing on the studied system by themselves. A trained technician also ran the same testing with the same subject’s fingerstick blood. The same procedure for fingerstick testing was then repeated for palm and forearm alternative sites. Both layperson and technician

performed the testing for each subject sample for the user study. For each study subject, additional fingerstick capillary blood was also collected into microtainer tubes (w/ heparin anticoagulant) for the YSI reference instrument testing and hematocrit level testing. The tested glucose concentration range was from 58 to 392 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A questionnaire was given to each study subject for their feedback on the ACON On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the ACON On Call Sharp BGMS was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 65 and $70 \%$ and spiked with glucose to achieve 5 concentrations ranging from 50 to $5 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (50, 100, 275 and $5 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each sample was then tested 4 times on three different test strip lots and the values were compared with those obtained from YSI reference analyzer. The $\%$ biases relative to YSI were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 25 to $70 \%$ .

2. Altitude study: Fingerstick capillary blood samples from fifteen subjects were tested on 6 test strips (3 strip lots) on 6 On Call Sharp meters. The sample range tested was 33 to 491 $\mathrm { m g / d l }$ for sea level and at 8, 516 ft. Blood glucose target concentrations were then verified by the reference YSI glucose analyzer. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 8, 516 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

3. Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the minimum test strip sample volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood samples were tested at six sample volumes (0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and $1 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) and values obtained were compared to YSI values. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the error code for insufficient sample volume.

4. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples in vacutainer tubes with heparin anticoagulant to evaluate temperatures of 10, 21 and $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and relative humidity of $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ . Meter results were compared to YSI reference analyzer. Six temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average temperature/low humidity, average temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. No significant effect (relative to YSI reference analyzer) was observed with the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 10 to $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ with relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ .

5. Infection Control Studies: The On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use. DisCide Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes with EPA registration number 10492-4 were validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 3,285 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of meter use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

6. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by TUV Rheinland (Shanghai) Co., LTD and Verification of Compliance reports are provided.

7. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results demonstrated that the User Manual, test strip package insert, control solution package insert and Quick Reference Guide Insert were written at the 7.4 grade level, 7.5 grade level, 7.0 grade level and 7.2 grade level respectively.
