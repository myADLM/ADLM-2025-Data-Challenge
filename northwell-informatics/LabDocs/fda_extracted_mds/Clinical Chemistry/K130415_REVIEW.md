# Stability

Shelf life study was conducted on one lot of High Metabolite QUALICHECK at temperatures: $3 2 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 12 days followed by $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for a total of 25 months. Six replicates at each test point (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 25 months) were tested by measurements on an ABL725. To prevent carryover, an additional rinse was performed between each measurement. Real-time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be adequate. The data indicated that the control solutions are stable for 2 years at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . There is no open-vial (inuse) stability claim since the control can be used only once. The contents should be used immediately after opening.

# Expected Values/Value assignment

The sponsor provided assigned values and control ranges for each analyte on each of

6 different analyzers. To determine the assigned values and control ranges for the High Metabolite QUALICHECK, six (6) trays of 1000 ampoules are sampled randomly from the High Metabolite QUALICHECK batch. Twelve ampoules are sampled from each of the trays and 72 ampoules are sampled from each batch. The samples were conditioned and shaken at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ in a water bath for 6 hours. Measurements are performed on a minimum of 3 validated ABL7xx devices with data collection. Measurement of each parameter is performed alternately on the reference ampoule and the sample ampoule and repeated 12 times on each ABL- $7 \mathrm { x x }$ for a total of 144 measurements. Target ranges are calculated based on the mean $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable
