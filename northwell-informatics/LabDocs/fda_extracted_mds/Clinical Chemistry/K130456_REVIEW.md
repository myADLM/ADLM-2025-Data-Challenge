# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The Wunder Pregnancy test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay which utilizes a combination of antibodies (described in the Device Description Section above) to selectively detect elevated levels of hCG. The assay is conducted by adding the urine specimen to the cassette test strip. The specimen migrates via capillary action along the membrane to react with the colored conjugate. A negative specimen produces no line in the test zone (T), and one colored line in the control zone (C). A positive specimen produces distinct colored lines in both the test zone (T) and the control zone (C). An invalid specimen produces either no lines or one line in the test zone (T) and no line in the control zone (C).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed a precision study using negative urine samples spiked to 0, 5, 12.5, 20, 25, 37.5, 50 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ of hCG with commercially available recombinant hCG traceable to the WHO $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ international standard. The samples were tested at three point-of-care (POC) sites using 420 devices from 3 different lots. Samples were masked and randomized. Testing at each POC site took place over 5 days. Testing was performed by 3 healthcare professionals at each POC site. Results were similar across the 3 sites. Results are tabulated below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.

A high dose hook effect study was performed by spiking high levels of hCG into negative urine samples. Concentrations ranged from 125,000-2,500,000 mIU/m and evaluating the test result lines. Results were correct at hCG concentrations up to $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m l }$ . Higher values produced a false negative result. This is noted in the labeling.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability

The Wunder Pregnancy Test is calibrated against reference materials traceable to the WHO $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ International Standard.

# Stability

The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf life were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a 24-month shelf life for the test when stored at room temperature $6 4 - 8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 1 8 { - } 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

d. Detection limit:

Refer to the precision data in 1.a, above for performance near the detection limit.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed by adding known amounts of potentially interfering substances to hCG-negative urine samples, as well as hCG positive samples with concentrations near the cutoff of $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . The following substances at the stated concentrations did not interfere with the assay.

To evaluate cross-reactivity, hormones including lutenizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were spiked into negative and positive hCG urine samples. The results of these studies showed that there is no interference at concentrations up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH and $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ TSH.

A study was performed to evaluate the effects of $\mathsf { p H }$ on the device. The device was challenged with negative, and positive near cutoff hCG samples at pH values of 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. No effect of pH was observed on results of the test.

A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine specific gravity on the device. The device was challenged with negative, and positive near-cutoff hCG samples with specific gravities of 1.000, 1.010, 1.020 and 1.030. Results were correct for all urine samples with specific gravity concentrations between 1.000 and 1.030.

Interference testing was performed to evaluate whether high levels of beta core fragment interfere with the device. Urine samples positive for hCG (12500 and $2 5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ ) were spiked with hCG beta core fragment at concentrations ranging between 62,500 and $1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . Concentrations of hCG beta core fragment up to $2 5 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ yielded correct results. Higher concentrations caused false negative results. The sponsor included the following limitation in the labeling:

In pregnancy, the hCG found in urine is comprised of intact hCG as well as a number of other variants including free beta subunits and beta core fragment. A false negative result can occur when hCG beta core fragment is present at concentrations in excess of 250,000 pmol/L, which may occur later in pregnancy

f. Assay cut-off:

See Section M.1.a above for performance around the cutoff.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Urine samples were collected from 100 women presenting at three different POC sites to test for pregnancy. Approximately half of the women were less than 5 weeks pregnant (based on last menstrual period). The women’s ages ranged from 18 to 45 years. The unaltered urine samples were masked, and randomized prior to testing. Testing included three lots of the candidate device. Testing was performed by 3 healthcare professionals at each of the 3 POC sites. The results of the method comparison study are summarized below:
