CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING:

The CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING kit is designed for the detection and characterization of monoclonal proteins (immunotyping) in human urine and serum with the CAPILLARYS, the CAPILLARYS 2 and the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEXPIERCING, SEBIA, for capillary electrophoresis. It is used in conjunction with the SEBIA CAPILLARYS PROTEIN(E) 6 kit, designed for protein separation into 6 major fractions in alkaline buffer $\mathrm { ( p H 1 0 . 0 ) }$ .

The CAPILLARYS, CAPILLARYS 2 and the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING perform all procedural sequences automatically to obtain a protein profile for qualitative analysis. Each urine or serum sample is mixed with individual antisera that are specific against gamma $( \mathrm { I g ~ G } )$ , alpha (Ig A) and mu (Ig M) heavy chains, and kappa (free and bound) light chains and lambda (free and bound) light chains, respectively. The proteins, separated in silica capillaries, are directly detected by their absorbance at $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The electrophoregrams are evaluated visually to detect the presence of specific reactions with the suspect monoclonal proteins.

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

# IT / IF CONTROL:

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The CAPILLARYS System uses the principle of capillary electrophoresis in free solution. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their electrophoretic mobility in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation also occurs according to the electrolyte pH and electroosmotic flow.

CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING is performed with specific antibodies to identify abnormal proteins in the beta globulin and gamma globulin fraction zones of the serum protein electrophoregrams. Abnormal serum fractions in these zones are always suspect of being monoclonal proteins (M-proteins, paraproteins, monoclonal immunoglobulins) and therefore, an indication of monoclonal gammopathies.

The CAPILLARYS System has 8 capillaries functioning in parallel. In this system, a sample dilution is prepared and injected simultaneously by aspiration at the anodic end of six capillaries (capillaries No. 7 and 8 are not used). The reference (ELP) pattern is obtained by injection of the sample mixed with ELP solution in capillary No. 1 providing a complete electrophoretic pattern of the sample’s proteins. The antisera patterns are obtained by injection in capillaries No. 2 to 6 of the previously diluted samples mixed with specific antisera against gamma (IgG), alpha (IgA), mu (IgM) heavy chains, and against free and bound Kappa and Lambda light chains.

A high voltage protein separation is then performed and direct detection of the proteins is made at $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ at the cathodic end of the capillary. The capillaries are immediately washed with a Wash Solution and prepared for the next analysis with buffer.

In CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING, proteins are detected in the following order from cathode to anode: gamma globulins, beta-2 globulins, beta-1 globulins, alpha-2 globulins, alpha-1 globulins and albumin with each zone containing one or more proteins. The antigen-antibody complex (between the sample immunoglobulins and the specific antiserum) has a very anodic mobility (between alpha-1 zone and albumin or more anodic than albumin).

The superimposition of the antisera patterns with the reference pattern (ELP) permits to visualize the disappearance and/or the decrease of a monoclonal fraction on the antiserum pattern and to indicate a gammopathy.

The immunotyping is performed in three automated steps:

1. The sample dilution is prepared with specific diluent which is preloaded in the antisera segment. This dilution is selected by the user of the CAPILLARYS system according to the sample's immunoglobulin concentrations. « HYPERGAMMA » if total immunoglobulins level is $> 2 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ (hypergammaglobulinemia), « HYPOGAMMA » if total immunoglobulins level is $< 0 . 8 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (hypogammaglobulinemia), « STANDARD » if total immunoglobulin level is comprised between 0.8 and $2 \ { \mathrm { g / d L } }$ (dilution program by default).   
2. The diluted serum sample is then mixed with individual specific antisera. The antigen-antibody complex is formed rapidly in the liquid medium. The sample that has been mixed with the specific antisera in the segment is injected simultaneously by aspiration into 6 capillaries at the anodic end. The proteins are separated by electrophoresis at high voltage. The separated proteins are detected at $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ at the cathodic end of the capillary.   
3. The reference pattern (ELP) is automatically overlayed with the antisera patterns $( \mathrm { I g G } , \mathrm { I g A }$ , IgM, Kappa and Lambda) allowing visualization of the disappearance or decrease of the suspected monoclonal component.
