# Predicate Device:

BGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring System, iBGStar Diabetes Manager Application, 510(k) K103544

# Device Description:

The iBGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) consists of:

• iBGStar Blood Glucose Meter • BGStar Test Strips BGStar Control Solution

The iBGStar Diabetes Manager Application (DMA) is an optional software accessory for the iBGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring System. It is a digital logbook and diabetes tool designed to operate using an iPhone or iPod touch. An individual can manually enter blood glucose readings or can download readings directly to the DMA installed on an iPhone or iPod touch from the iBGStar meter.

# Labeling and Intended Use:

The iBGStar BGMS Owner's guide has been edited to include instructions on how to connect the meter to a device with the Lightning adapter. The iBGStar BGMS carton has been updated to include a statement that the meter will work with the iPhone 5 and iPod touch $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ generation when using the Lightning adapter.

# Intended Use

The iBGStar™M Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of blood glucose levels in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from thefingertip, palms at the base o the thumb), or forearms. It is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be shared. The iBGStar™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The iBGstar Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not for the diagnosis of, or screening for diabetes, and is not intended for use with neonates.

The iGStar Diabetes Manager pplication isntndedorus n hehoe wih the capabiliy  s glucose readings through email to an individual's healthcare professional in the review, analysis and evaluation of glucose test results to support an effective diabetesmanagement program. It is an optional data management software accessory for use with the iBGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# Technological Characteristics:

There were no changes to the fundamental scientific technology.

# Comparison to Predicate:

# Blood Glucose Monitoring System (meter, strips, controls)

There have been no modifications to the iBGStar BGMS to allow it to operate with the iPhone 5 and iPod touch $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ generation. The Meter, Test Strips and Control Solution are identical to the previously cleared system. The iBGStar BGMS has the all the same technological and performance characteristics as the predicate. There were minor modifications to the labeling for the iBGStar BGMS to clarify the use of the meter with the iPhone 5 and iPod touch $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ generation. The table below illustrates the same intended use and characteristics between the predicate device and the candidate device (no differences between predicate and candidate).

# Diabetes Manager Application

The iBGStar DMA has the same intended use as the previously cleared system. The iBGStar DMA has the all the same technological and performance characteristics as the predicate.There is no modification to the labeling for the iBGStar DMA. To transfer glucose readings from the iBGStar meter to the iBGStar DMA which has been downloaded on Apple's new iPhone 5 and/or iPod touch $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ generation, an Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter or the Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter $( 0 . 2 \mathrm { m } )$ is required The table below lists the similarities and differences between candidate and predicate device.

# Assessment of Performance:

Disinfection Study:

Per pre-submission Q120016 (See Attachment 2 of original submission), FDA recommended that disinfection and robustness testing be performed on the new components.

Disinfection testing on the surface materials of the iPhone 5, iPod touch 5, Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter, and Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter $( 0 . 2 \mathfrak { m } )$ cable was performed by an outside lab. The results with $\mathrm { P D } \{ \mathfrak { R } \}$ Super Sani-Cloth $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Germicidal Disposable Wipes with EPA number 9480-4 demonstrated complete inactivation of live virus (see Attachments 3 and 4 of original submission).

Robustness testing was performed with the iPhone 5, iPod touch $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ generation, Lightning to 30-pin Adapter, and Lightning to 30-pin Adapter $( 0 . 2 \mathsf { m } )$ cable using the $\mathrm { P D } \mathrm { I @ }$ Super Sani-Cloth $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Germicidal Disposable Wipes with EPA number 9480-4. The results demonstrate there was no change in performance or material of the tested devices at the conclusion of the disinfection and robustness testing which consisted of 260 cleaning/disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of use (see Attachments 5,6 and 7 of original submission).

# Verification and Validation:

Verification and validation protocols were successfully executed to validate the use of the Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter and the Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter $( 0 . 2 \mathsf { m } )$ cable with the iBGStar DMA. Results demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate system.

# Human Factors Study:

A human factors study (see Attachments 8 and 9 of original submission) was conducted to evaluate the ability of users to connect and transfer readings from the iBGStar meter to the iBGStar DMA via the new Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter and the Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter $( 0 . 2 \mathsf { m } )$ cable. Results demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate system.

# Conclusion:

The results of the disinfection and robustness testing and the performance assessments demonstrated that the candidate iBGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the iBGStar Diabetes Manager Application using the Lightning to 30-pin Adapter or 30-pin Adapter $( 0 . 2 m )$ cable performs in a substantially equivalent manner to that of the predicate.We conclude that the iBGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring system and the iBGStar Diabetes Manager Application are substantially equivalent the predicate devices.
