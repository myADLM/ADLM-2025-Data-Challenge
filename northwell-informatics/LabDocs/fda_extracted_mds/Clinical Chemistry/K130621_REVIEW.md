BroadMaster HealthCare System was verified to meet data upload accuracy $( 1 0 0 \% )$ and data management requirements.

B. Human Factors Study

36 subjects with typical computer experience and ages (age range 48 to 88 years old) were enrolled in the Human Factors study conducted for the BroadMaster HealthCare System. Participants were accessed on: installation of the software on their test computer syncing the meter date and time, data transmission, viewing data, generating and exporting reports. The data in participant created reports

matched the stored meter data in $100 \%$ of cases.

The ease-of-use study consisted of 36 lay-users with varying demographics (age, sex, and education level) were included in a usability study for installing, uploading data from glucose meters, and using features of the software. The participants were provided the user manual and no further instruction. Following the study the participants also completed a questionnaire in response to whether the data transmission feature is easy to use.

Study Feedback: The proportions of neutral-or-better responses (ranked 1-5) for all 14 items on the Survey Questionnaire for Usability meet the acceptance criterion of average response rate of ${ > } 3$ (average 3.86).

B. Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes. The following documentation related to the software was reviewed and found to be acceptable: level of concern, software description, device hazard analysis, software requirements specifications, software design specification, software development environment description, and verification and validation testing.
