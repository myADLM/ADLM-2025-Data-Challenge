# L. Test Principle:

The glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The meter and test strips for the CareSens N LINK and CareSens N LINK Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are the same components. The two Systems only differ in name and intended use (single- versus multiple-patient use). Therefore, one set of data are presented for both test systems. This submission, changes the shape of the meter’s housing, makes changes to software (test result average range and memory), and changes the battery type for previously cleared CareSens N Glucose meters.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes __ X __ or No

As established in K100937.

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes __ __ or No X

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and forearm, palm, thigh, and calf. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

5. Calibration:

The meter is autocoded, therefore no coding is required by the user. The coding circuit printed on the test strip is consistent with the code in the meter and the meter detects the code of the strip.

# 6. Quality Control:

Control A, and Control B are available for use with this system (sold separately). The meter has a control solution test mode. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results when the measurements are performed in the control solution mode. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling and what the user should do if the control result falls outside these ranges.
