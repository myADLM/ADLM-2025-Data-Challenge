# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Deseription

The Hitachi Clinical Analyzer is an automatic, bench-top, wet chemistry system intended for use in clinical laboratories or physician office laboratories. The instrument consists of a desktop analyzer unit, an operations screen that prompts the user for operation input and Page 1 of 6 displays data, a printer, and a unit cover. The analyzer unit includes a single probe, an incubation rotor, carousels for sample cups and reagent cartridges, and a multi-wavelength photometer. The single-use reagent cartridges may be placed in any configuration on the carousel, allowing the user to develop any test panel where the reagent cartridges are available.

The S TEST reagent cartridges are made of plastic and include two small reservoirs capable of holding two separate reagents (R1 and R2), separated by a reaction cell/photometric cuvette. The cartridges also include a dot code label that contains all chemistry parameters, calibration factors, and other production-related information, e.g., expiration dating. The dimensions of the reagent cartridges are: $1 3 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m } \ \mathrm { ( W ) } \times 2 8 . \mathrm { m m } \ \mathrm { ( D ) } \times 2 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ (H).

System operation: After the sample cup is placed into the carousel, the analyzer pipettes the sample, pipettes the reagent, and mixes (stirs) the sample and reagent together. After the sample and reagent react in the incubator bath, the analyzer measures the absorbance of the sample, and based on the absorbance of the reactions, it calculates the concentration of analyte in the sample. The test system can measure analytes in serum or plasma and results are available in approximately 15 minutes per test. This submission is for Reagent Cartridge Calcium.

Chemistry reactions: Calcium in the sample combines with o-cresolphthalein complexone to form a purple-red complex. The concentration of calcium can be determined by measuring the absorbance of the resulting purple-red color. (With this method, the influence of magnesium is excluded by the addition of 8-hydroxyquinoline.)

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use

The S TEST Reagent Cartridge Calcium (CA) is intended for the quantitative determination of calcium in serum, lithium heparinized plasma, and sodium citrate plasma using the HITACHI Clinical Analyzer E40. The S TEST Reagent Cartridge Calcium is intended for use in clinical laboratories or physician office laboratories. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

Calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany (intermittent muscular contractions or spasms).

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Nonclinical Data

A series of studies were performed that evaluated the following nonclinical performance characteristics for each analyte: analytical sensitivity (limits of detection), linearity, 20-day in-house precision, interference testing, in-house method comparisons, and matrices comparison between serum and various plasma types.

Analytical Sensitivity (Limits of Detection)- CA   
The study followed CLSI EP17-A, and the limit of detection was found to be $0 . 1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The quantitation limit was found to be $0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ EY Linearity- CA   
The study followed CLSI EP-6A, and the range of linearity was 0.4 to $1 7 . 1 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .The reportable range is 0.5 to $1 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .   
20-day In-house Precision- CA   
The studies followed CLSI EP5-A2, where three levels of samples were each tested in two   
runs, twice a day, for 20 days. The results were as follows:

Interference Testing (per CLSI EP7-A2)

The data demonstrated that the calcium test system was not affected by high levels of the following substances at the levels noted:

Unconjugated bilirubin: no interference up to $5 0 m g / \mathrm { d L }$ Lipemia; no interference up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Ascorbic acid: no interference up to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Hemoglobin: no interference up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ EY

Lack of interference was defined as recoveries between $90 \%$ and $1 1 0 \%$ of the neat value, and assay performance claims were established on the HITACHI Clinical Analyzer by testing twc serum pools containing approximately 4 and 1 1 mg/dL calcium.

# Method Comparison

A total of 97 clinical specimens spanning the dynamic range (1.2 to $1 4 . 8 \mathrm { \ m g / d L } )$ , were assayed in singleton and in a blinded fashion by both the Hitachi E40 system and a standard laboratory system. The comparative data were analyzed by linear regression and are shown below. $\mathrm { C I } =$ confidence interval)

A study was performed to validate the use of two plasma types as an alternative to serum for the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with S TEST Reagent Cartridge Calcium. The plasma types were sodium citrate and lithium heparin. Forty-four (44) matched serum/plasma samples that spanned the dynamic range (0.9 to $1 4 . 7 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ were assayed in singleton and the results were compared using linear regression (plasma $=$ y-axis, each type).

# 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Clinical Data

Studies for precision and method comparison (accuracy) were performed at three external POL-type sites to evaluate the Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer with S TEST Reagent Cartridge Calcium in one of its targeted intended use environments, the physician's office laboratory.

For the external site precision study, each site received three blinded serum samples (the Precision Panel, labeled A, $\mathbf { B } ,$ and C) that were chosen to represent low, middle, and high concentrations of calcium. Each sample was assayed six times per day for five days, reporting 30 results per level. Precision estimates for total precision were as follows:
