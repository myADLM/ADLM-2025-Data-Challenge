# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

IEC 60601: Medical electrical equipment-Part 1-2: general requirements for safety- collateral standard: Electromagnetic compatibility – Requirements and tests.

EN55011: Limits and methods of measurement of radio disturbance characteristics of industrial, scientific, and medical RF equipment.

IEC 61010-1: Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use – Part 1: General Requirements.

# L. Test Principle:

The FOCUS Blood Glucose Monitor and FOCUS PRO Blood Glucose Monitor measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose biosensor is capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by virtue of the glucose specificity of the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) present on the glucose test strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are transferred via a co-factor and mediator (FAD) to the meter where they are read as a small electrical current. The current is integrated over the analysis time to generate charge which is directly proportional to the level of the glucose in the applied sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

This submission is seeking clearance for modifications to a previously cleared device to include an optional ketone test alert and auto control detection. The sponsor uses the same analytical claim for the current test system and refers to the predicate 510(k) for the respective studies.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

FOCUS Blood Glucose Monitor is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, which is directly applied to the test strip.

FOCUS PRO Blood Glucose Monitor is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and forearm, as well as venous and arterial whole blood collected in sodium or lithium heparin tubes. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

5. Calibration:

The meter is a non-coding meter, therefore no coding is required by the user.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor has three levels of control solutions (level 1 control solution is included with the kits). When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each control can be measured by following the instructions for “Running Control Solution” provided in the user’s manual. Auto Control Detection automatically detects control solution when used in testing. The ionic strength of the control solution provides a current flow unique to just control solution. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the test results fall outside the range printed on the test strip vial, the user is instructed to contact Customer Service (available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week).

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Infection control Infection Control Studies: The device systems are intended for single-patient use (FOCUS Blood Glucose Monitoring System) or multiple-patient use (FOCUS Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System). Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, PDI Super Sani-Cloth Wipes (EPA Registration # 9480-4).
