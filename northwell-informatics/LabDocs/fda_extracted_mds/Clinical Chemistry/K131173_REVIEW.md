FIA Blood Glucose Meter (G2)

# I. Device Description:

The FIA Blood Glucose Monitoring System (G2) comprises an electrochemical biosensor glucose reagent test strip, a handheld meter, control solutions (Levels I and II; previously cleared under k032985, but renamed as FIA Glucose Control Solutions in this submission), and a check strip. The meter will automatically turn on when a test strip is inserted. A small drop of blood contacts front end aperture which will cause the chamber to fill up on the front end of a test strip. When a beep sound is heard, the chamber is full and test reaction starts. When the test is done, the glucose result will appear on the meter's LCD screen. Data will automatically be stored in memory.

# L. Test Principle:

The device is comprised of two main parts: a bio-active electrode (test strip) which contains the reagent enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), and the meter. The blood sample is drawn from fingertip onto the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose dehydrogenase and potassium ferricyanide in the test strip producing potassium ferrocyanide which is the product proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. During potassium ferrocyanide's oxidation, an electrical current is produced then converted by the meter. The result (glucose level) will be displayed on the monitor.

# N. Instrument Name:

The FIA Blood Glucose Meter (G2)

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device? Yes X or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission: Yes X or No

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

3. Specimen Identification:

Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected. Samples are time and date stamped upon measurement by the glucose meter.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The meter is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since the sample is applied immediately and directly to the test strip there are no sample handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

The meter is a non-coding meter. No coding is required by the user.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor recommends two levels of control glucose solution. Level I and Level II. Both are included in the meter kit. An acceptable range is printed on each the glucose test strip vial label. The meter uses an algorithm to automatically recognize the control solution matrix and to prevent the result from being stored as a patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. If the control values fall outside the range, the user is referred to the user manual and customer support for troubleshooting and more information.

F. The purpose of the study is to establish whether lay users can use the meter to accurately transfer glucose data to the iGlucose System’s web-based database. A usability test was conducted with twenty (20) lay users. Each user was provided with a FIA Blood Glucose meter (G2) and the instructions for use. The participants were given instructions to use a control solution to obtain a measurement; the glucose value would then automatically be uploaded to www.iglucose.net. Users were asked to complete a survey about the ease of use of the device and software. $9 5 \%$ of the lay users indicated a $7 5 \%$ satisfaction level with each question, indicating that there are no areas of concern about the usability of the device by the intended users.

G. Bench testing was performed to demonstrate that the meter could accurately transmit data to a database. The study used a simulated test strip to generate 999 values (full memory) and automatically transmit data after each measurement on three FIA Blood Glucose meters (G2) over the cellular network to a web-based server at www.iglucose.net All data fields, such as meter serial number, glucose result, time, date, and event mark were $100 \%$ accurate.

H. Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes.

I. FIA Blood Glucose Monitoring System (G2) Owner’s Manual cleared under k120064 was modified only to include information and instructions for data transfer to a data management system and name change from PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System. A readability assessment was provided to demonstrate that the User Manual, test strip package insert and control solution package insert were each written at the 8th grade level.

J. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed. The sponsor provided a certificate of conformity to IEC 60601-1-2, Medical Electrical Equipment- Part 1-2 and ISO 61326-1-6: Electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use. EMC requirements. Particular requirements. In vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical equipment
