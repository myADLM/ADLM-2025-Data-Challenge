# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

· ISO 15197:2003(E)- In vitro diagnostic test systems- Requirements for In Vitro Whole Blood glucose · CLSI-EP6-A- Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures:

# A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline CLSI EP7-A2- Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline

# L. Test Principle:

The OneTouch® Verio® Blood Glucose Monitoring System employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzymatic assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an amperometric measurement device using the current generated from the redox reaction as the measurable response.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

New performance data was not necessary as the modifications made to the meter would not affect device performance. Therefore, device performance is as established in k110637.

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision was established in k110637.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Linearity was established in k110637. The claimed range of measurement for this glucose device is $2 0 { - } 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b reference material. The method comparison study was performed using the candidate device and YSI as the reference method.

# Test strip stability:

Stability was previously established in k120708. Control solution stability: Control solution stability was previously in k120708.

# Value Assignment:

Value assignment for the controls was previously established in k120708.

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring system is $2 0 { - } 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ based on linearity studies established in k110637.

e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical specificity established in k110637.

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:

“Tolazamide at concentrations greater than $1 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may cause falsely low results.”

“Uric acid at concentrations greater than $8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may cause falsely low results.”

“The OneTouch Verio Family of Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems should not be used for patients within 24 hours of receiving D-xylose absorption test as it may cause inaccurately high results.”

# System Accuracy Study

The sponsor performed a system accuracy evaluation comparing the OneTouch Verio BGMS to YSI 2300 (reference method). The study was performed at three clinical sites. Capillary fingerstick samples collected from 100 subjects over 25 days with glucose concentrations ranging from 31.6 to $4 9 2 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were analyzed with the candidate device and with YSI. Two of the samples tested were adjusted ${ < } 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and four samples were adjusted ${ \scriptstyle > 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ glucose concentration ranges. The OneTouch Verio was tested in duplicate with each of three different strip lots providing a total of 6 meter results per participant. The results for a singlet set of data relative to the reference method are summarized in the tables below:

Lay-User Study/User Performance Study:

The Lay user study was conducted following the ISO Standard 15197. To assess the performance of the OneTouch Verio BGMS in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed a study with 189 $5 3 . 4 \%$ female and $4 6 . 6 \%$ male) untrained lay user participants. The study was performed at four clinical sites and was conducted in 2 site visits. Each subject was asked to review the instructions for use and meter and perform testing on a fingertip. Each subject produced a blood drop large enough for two meter tests, one on an OneTouch Verio meter and Verio Test strip and the other for the healthcare professional to immediately perform a blood glucose test on another OneTouch Verio meter and Verio test strip from the same test strip lot. The HCP also collected blood for two YSI 2300 tests and for hematocrit testing. The range of glucose values for the samples as measured by the reference method was 31.8 to $4 9 5 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Results are summarized below:

The minimal sample volume is $0 . 4 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes X or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes or No X

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No

The sponsor states there are no unresolved anomalies for the OneTouch Verio software release OX0102_001.

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

5. Calibration:

The meter is a non-coding device; therefore no coding is required by the user.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor manufactures two levels of glucose control solutions (OneTouch Verio Level 3 Control Solution and OneTouch Verio Level 4 Control Solution) that can be run with this device but are available separately from the system. The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize when a control solution is being analyzed. The words “Control Solution” appears on screen and the meter automatically marks the result as a control solution test. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to the user manual and customer support for more information.
