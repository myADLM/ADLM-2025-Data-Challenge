# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert System is indicated as an aid in the treatment of insulinrequiring diabetes. The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert System consists of the ACCUCHEK Aviva Expert Meter, ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus test strips, ACCU-CHEK Aviva control solutions, and ACCU-CHEK Bolus Advisor. The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert System is intended to facilitate the optimization of glycemic control in patients who are trained in multiple daily insulin injection therapy and are under the supervision of healthcare professionals experienced in managing insulin treated patients.

The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert blood glucose monitoring system is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert blood glucose monitoring system is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes. The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert blood glucose monitoring system is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared. The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert blood glucose monitoring system should not be used for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should NOT be used with the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert blood glucose monitoring system. The ACCUCHEK Aviva Expert System is intended for prescription use only.

The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert meter is also indicated for the calculation of an insulin dose or carbohydrate intake based on user-entered data. The ACCU-CHEK Bolus Advisor, as a component of the ACCU-Chek Aviva Expert meter, is intended for use in providing insulin dose recommendations in response to blood glucose, health events, and carbohydrate input. The ACCUCHEK Bolus Advisor is intended to provide direction for insulin adjustment within the scope of a preplanned treatment program from a healthcare professional. Before its use, a physician or healthcare professional must prescribe the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert System and provide the patient-specific target blood glucose, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and insulin sensitivity parameters to be programmed into the ACCU-CHEK Bolus Advisor. Once programmed, a patient must consult with his/her physician or healthcare professional before making any changes to these ACCU-CHEK Bolus Advisor settings.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For in vitro diagnostic use only   
· Capillary fingerstick blood only   
· Not for testing on neonates   
· Do not use for diagnosis or screening of diabetes mellitus Inaccurate results may occur in severe dehydration as a result of diabetic ketoacidosis or due to hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome, hypotension, shock, decompensated heart failure NYHA Class IV, or peripheral arterial occlusive disease.   
· Not to be used for patients who are critically ill   
· For single-patient use only   
· Not to be used with patients taking Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) or any other intermediate-acting insulin. For prescription use only Patient-specific target blood glucose, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and insulin sensitivity parameters should be provided by a physician or healthcare professional. Consultation with a physician or healthcare professional should occur before making any changes to the ACCU-CHEK Bolus Advisor settings.

# 4. Special instrument requirements: ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert Meter

# I. Device Description:

The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the following:

· ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert meter   
· ACCU-CHEK Bolus Advisor (a component of the Aviva Expert meter)   
· ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus test strips (k101299) ACCU-CHEK Aviva control solutions (k043474) ACCU-CHEK FastClix lancing device

The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert system is a blood glucose monitoring system that makes use of the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus test strips (cleared under k101299; mutant GDH-PQQ) and the ACCU-CHEK Aviva 2 level control solutions (cleared under k043474). The ACCUCHEK Aviva Expert meter is nearly identical to that of the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Combo meter (cleared under k111353); however, the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert meter does not have Bluetooth capabilities to connect wirelessly to an insulin pump.

The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert system provides the user with the ability to measure capillary blood glucose levels when a sample of capillary blood is applied to the test strip. The meter also provides an optional insulin bolus calculator (the ACCU-CHEK Bolus Advisor) designed for use by individuals with diabetes who require multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) therapy. The insulin bolus calculation function is optional in that a user can simply obtain a blood glucose value through capillary blood testing and does not need to use the insulin bolus calculator portion of the system if it is not desired. The insulin bolus calculator algorithm is identical to the bolus calculator algorithm that was cleared during the Aviva Combo 510(k) submission (k111353). In order to calculate the appropriate bolus of insulin, the ACCU-CHEK Bolus Advisor takes into account the measured blood glucose, the target blood glucose, the carbohydrate intake, the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, the insulin sensitivity, health events (such as exercise), the time of day, and the active insulin. Before using the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert system, a physician or healthcare professional must provide the patient-specific target blood glucose, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and insulin sensitivity parameters.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 14971: 2007, Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical devices FDA Guidance: 2005: Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices.

# L. Test Principle:

When an ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus test strip is inserted into the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Expert meter, a small alternating current (AC) is applied until the application of blood causes a spike in the conductivity to be observed at the measurement and sample sufficiency electrodes – both are used to assure an adequate sample has been applied. The instrument then applies a series of AC voltages at four frequencies and reads the AC responses. These carry information about the sample type and environmental temperature; they also allow the system to perform various internal quality checks. After the AC measures are completed, a small (DC) voltage is applied and current is observed which is proportionate to the glucose. The AC and DC information are then combined to provide a hematocrit and temperature compensated glucose result.
