# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CEN 13640 Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff – Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The IMMULITE 2000 PSA assay and IMMULITE $\textcircled{8}$ PSA CVMs are traceable to WHO NIBSC $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ International Standard 96/670. The CVMs are manufactured using approved reference lot manufactured with qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

The levels of IMMULITE $\textcircled{8}$ CVMs are value assigned using approved reference lot manufactured with qualified materials and measurement procedures. The assigned reference calibrators are prepared using PSA antigen stock and are traceable to WHO $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ International Standard 96/670. Each level of CVMs was tested for 9 runs, 3 replicates per run for a total of 27 replicates using 5 different kit lots on 6 instruments. The values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The average analyte recovered for each CVM level determines the value assigned to the Target Mean. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm 2$ Standard Deviation (SD).

The target range for each level of CVMs is shown in the following table:

\* LPTCVM4 is used for dilution to ensure the target value for the dilution is within $+ l O \%$ of the top of the reportable range of the assay

Value assignment is lot specific. For each lot of CVMs, quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples, normal male samples and controls using the assigned values. The controls must fall within their target range.

# Stability:

The stability studies were conducted to validate shelf life claim for the IMMULITE $\textcircled{8}$ 2000 CVM.

For Real time stability study, three lots of the CVMs were tested for stability when stored at - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Each calibrator was run in duplicate and the PSA concentration determined from reference calibrator curve. The reported testing periods for one lot were 182 days (6 months), and 365 days (12 months). The reported test periods for a second lot were 1 day, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days and 150 days. The reported test periods for the third lot were 1 day, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days and 150 days. The real-time stability study is ongoing.

For accelerated stability study, three lots of the CMVs were stored at room temperature (RT) for 7 days, $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 3 days and with 3 times Freeze/Thaw (F/T). Each calibrator was run in duplicate. The results are directly compared to the samples stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The stability study shows acceptable results up to 60 days when stored frozen at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior

to opening. Each CVM is for single use only.

# Matrix effect:

To investigate potential matrix effects from using processed $\mathrm { \bf { p H } }$ -treated) Chicken Serum, spiking recovery of PSA was determined. A stock solution of calibrator grade PSA was used to prepare the spiking solutions for studying matrix effects. Three spiking solutions were prepared from the stock solution. Each spiking solutions was spiked into the matrix (chicken serum) and patient sample (1 part spiking solution to 19 parts matrix or sample) to generate two sets of spiked samples (concentrations at $4 . 8 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 8 . 9 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $3 7 . 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ . All spiked samples were run in assay on the IMMUNLITE 2000 platform. The $\%$ recovery of PSA in the spiked matrix was compared to the $\%$ recovery in the spiked patient sample. Each of the tested samples met the acceptance criteria: the grand mean of the recoveries must be within $1 0 0 \% \pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected value with no mean recovery being more than $1 0 0 \% \pm 1 5 \%$ . The results from the spiking recovery study have shown no matrix effects.
