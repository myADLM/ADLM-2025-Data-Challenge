# 8. SUMMARY OF STABILTY STUDIES

Opened: Store refrigerated ( $+ 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \mathrm { o } } C$ Reconstituted Aldolase is stable for 5 days at $+ 2 " C$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } C$ if kept capped in the original container and free from contamination. Only the required amount of product should be removed. After use, any residual product should not be returned to the original vial

The reconstituted stability of Aldolase was determined by reconstituting vials of Aldolase Controls and storing them at $+ 2 \%$ to $+ 8 \%$ for 5 days.

Unopened: Store refrigerated $( + 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } C )$ . Stable to the expiration date printed on individual vials.The Aldolase Controls have been assigned a shelf life of 24 months. This has been tested using real time studies, three batches of the Aldolase controls have been stored at $\div 2 \%$ to $+ 8 \%$ for a period of at least 24 months and all three batches have passed real time stability testing.

# 9. SUMMARY OF VALUE ASSIGNMENT

An assigned value is calculated for each new batch of Randox Aldolase Controls by nest testing. Nest testing involves assessment of the new lot of controls against a master lot of controls or calibrators. Ten replicates of the test controls are assessed on two or more systems and the mean and CV calculated. The recovery of the master lot is also measured. In the instructions for use there are system specific values quoted and a consensus mean. A range is also provided by taking $+ 1 - 2 5 \%$ of the assigned system speciic values and the consensus mean.The acceptance criteria states the precision measured by the CV should be less than or equal to $3 \%$ , unless the concentration of aldolase in ${ < } 1 0 \%$ then precision should be less than or equal to $6 \%$ .

Dear Ms. Armstrong:

We have reviewed your Section ${ \mathfrak { s l } } 0 ( { \mathbf k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.
