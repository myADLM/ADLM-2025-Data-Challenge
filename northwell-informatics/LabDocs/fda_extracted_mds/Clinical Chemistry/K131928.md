# Indications for Use:

510(k) Number: K131928

Device Name: FRENDTM TSH

Indications for Use:

FREND™ TSH is designed for in vitro DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY for the quantitative measurement of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (thyrotropin or TSH) in human serum and lithium heparin plasma using the FREND ™M system.

FREND ™m TSH is indicated for use in clinical laboratories upon prescription by the attending physician as an aid to clinicians in the diagnosis of thyroid disease.

# Technological Characteristics:

There are no technological characteristics of FREND ™m TSH that are different or with which the agency is unfamiliar. FREND™M TSH, performed using the FREND ™ system, is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of TSH in serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. The FREND ™TSH is performed completely within the single-use plastic cartridge once serum or plasma has been placed in the sample well and is for use upon prescription by the attending physician in clinical laboratories with qualified technologists. FREND™M TSH on the FREND™ system has been shown to yield TSH results that are equivalent to those obtained with other previously cleared FDA in vitro diagnostic devices measuring TSH quantitatively in serum and/or plasma.

The FREND™ System is a bench top fluorescence reader containing a simple computerized touchscreen user interface, easily manipulated to order tests, display results and operate the mechanical functions of the instrument. The specimen is added with a transfer pipette to the sample inlet of a single use cartridge by the operator, allowing the appropriate volume of sample $( 3 5 ~ \mu L )$ to be delivered into the FREND™ TSH cartridge. The cartridge is then placed into the FREND™ system, which is programmed to begin analysis once the sample has reacted with the reagents. All reactions occur in the self-contained plastic cartridge and the reading is done in the cartridge as well. The FREND™m system has a slot that accepts the FREND ™ TSH test cartridge containing the reagents and sample, and is programmed to analyze the test when the sample has fully reacted with the on-board in-cartridge reagents. Cartridges are loaded manually one by one by the operator. The reaction and analysis time is approximately 5 minutes. TSH quantitation is based on the ratio of fluorescence detected by the FREND™M System at the FREND™M TSH test and reference windows in the plastic cartridge compared to a standard curve stored in the TSH Code Chip that is included with each box of the device. A higher ratio of fluorescence is indicative of a higher TSH concentration. In other words, the magnitude of the fluorescent ratio is directly proportional to the amount of TSH in the sample. A high-level schematic and process diagram of the FREND™m system are included in the User Manual. Results of the test are displayed on the screen and can be printed on an optional printer.

# Expected Values

As with every clinical diagnostic test, a reference interval corresponding to the characteristics of the population being tested should be determined by each laboratory. Historically, it has been shown that there are neither racial differences nor gender differences in the reference interval for TSH so creating a single adult reference interval is reasonable and justified per literature.

During a clinical study run to support the FREND™ TSH substantial equivalence to a marketed product with the same indication, TSH measurements were performed on the serum of 385 apparently healthy ambulatory adults (195 males and 191 females ages 18 - 71) who stated they had no known thyroid conditions. All samples were assayed in singlicate on the FREND™ TSH and the predicate device. A single value, determined as an outlier in both the test and the predicate devices, was removed from the data set after which a non-parametric reference interval encompassing the central $9 5 \%$ of the results was determined. Male and female results were separately analyzed with no significant difference found in the calculated reference intervals. Therefore, a single reference interval has been determined.

FREND TM TSH Reference Interval: 0.49 \~ 3.82 mlU/L

With $90 \%$ confidence limits the following ranges were estimated:

Lower Reference Interval Range $0 . 4 2 \sim ~ 0 . 5 9 \mathrm { \ m } | \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ Upper Reference Interval Range 3.24 \~ 4.30 mIU/L

As in all in vitro diagnostic testing, a TSH result generated using the FREND ™M TSH on the FREND ™ system should be interpreted in the light of other clinical findings and diagnostic procedures. Any TSH results not correlating with the clinical condition should be repeated and other testing performed to clarify the situation.

# Performance Characteristics

Performance characteristics were evaluated for FREND ™M TSH as follows:

# Accuracy

1a)Dilution Linearity - Specimens from a high TSH concentration pool were diluted with a TSH depleted serum pool according to the CLSI EPO6-A document. Linearity was demonstrated from $< 0 . 0 6$ mlU/L to $2 5 . 5 4 \ m 1 \downarrow / \downarrow$ $( { \mathsf { S l o p e } } = 0 . 9 7 7$ y-Intercept $=$ 0.17, $\ S _ { y / x } = 0 . 2 8$ , $\mathsf { r } = \mathsf { 0 } . \mathsf { 9 9 9 } \}$ . Correlation with the expected linearity was excellent showing less than the allowable non-linearity. Performance requirement was verified over the measurement interval.

FREND TM TSH is linear from 0.06 \~ 25.0 mlU/L

Non-linearity is less than allowable non-linearity: $20 \%$ up to 1 mIU/L then $10 \%$ .

1b) Comparative Analysis - 438 serum samples obtained from subjects both apparently normal and with thyroid conditions as well as other undisclosed diseases and conditions and stored at $\yen 70 °$ under monitored conditions for less than one year, were analyzed using both the FREND™ TSH and another commercially available TSH fluorescent immunoassay. Results generated using the FREND  TSH on the FREND™ System (y) were compared to those obtained using a previously FDA cleared TSH assay $( { \dot { \bf x } } )$ . Results of this study are shown bbelow:

Slope: 0.951 $( 9 5 \%$ CI: 0.940; 0.962)

Number of Samples: 438   
Measuring Range: $0 . 0 9 \sim 2 4 . 9 6 \ : \mathrm { m } | \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { L }$

Comparability using CLSI guideline EP09-A2-IR, Section 7, shows that the difference in concentration between that measured by the test device and that expected (predicate device) is less than the allowable difference and that the two methods compare favorably.

Precision was determined as described in the CLSl protocol EP05-A2. Four clinical samples were assayed in replicates of two at two separate times per day for twenty days using a single lot of FREND™M TSH cartridge. The findings follow showing repeatability, between-run, between-day and withinlaboratory precision data.

# ) Specificity

The $\pmb { \mathrm { q } } -$ subunits of luteinizing hormone (LH), folicle stimulating hormone (FSH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are all very similar though their $\beta -$ subunits are not. Because of the structural similarities, the specificity of the FREND™M TSH must be examined in the presence of large amounts of these possible cross-reactants. The following substances were evaluated for potential cross-reactivity with the FREND™ TSH at the concentrations indicated below in Figure 4. Testing was done according to the CLSI protocol EP07-A. No significant cross-reactivity was found.

# 4) Analytical Sensitivity

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the FREND TM TSH was measured using the CLSI EP17-A protocol. The analytical sensitivity of the FREND ™ TSH was determined to be 0.06 mIU/L.

# 5)Interference

Interference is defined in this instance as recovery outside of $10 \%$ of the known specimen mean concentration. In other words, recovery from $90 \%$ to $1 1 0 \%$ of the expected TSH is considered acceptable performance. The interference studies were performed using the recommendations in the CLSI EP07-A protocol. Results were:

# Endogenous Interferents

Added hemoglobin (up to $5 0 0 m g / d L )$ does not interfere with the assay. Average TSH recovery was $9 8 . 8 \%$ .   
Added conjugated bilirubin (up to 20 mg/dL) does not interfere with the assay. Average recovery was $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ .   
Added total protein up to $1 2 . 0 \ g / \mathrm { d L }$ does not interfere with the assay. Average recovery was $100 . 4 \%$ .   
Added triglyceride up to 3 g/dL does not interfere with this assay. Average recovery was $101 . 6 \%$ .

Added HAMA to 52.5 ng/mL did not interfere with the assay. Average recovery was $9 3 . 3 \%$ . Higher concentrations of HAMA exhibited interference> $10 \%$ .

RF at 53.8 IU/mL did not interfere with the assay. Average recovery was $91 . 4 \%$ . Higher concentration of RF did show interference $> 1 0 \%$ .

# Pharmaceutical Interferents

The following common medications were tested for interference with the FREND™M TSH. The testing showed no significant interference $( < 1 0 \% )$ from the tested drugs at the listed concentration that would affect the interpretation of a TSH result as assayed on the FREND ™ TSH:

# 6) High Dose Hook Effect Testing (Prozone Detection)

No High Dose Hook effect was seen in samples with a TSH concentration as high as 2500 mIU/L.

# 7) Reagent Stability Studies

Reagent stability studies based on procedures and criteria in the NanoEnTek quality system showed that the cartridges for FREND™m TSH are good for at least one year from the date of manufacturer if stored refrigerated appropriately as directed. Stability of the cartridges at room temperature $( 2 2 - 2 8 ^ { \circ } C )$ was found to be six months.

# Matrix Study

TSH concentrations in 40 sample pairs, each with serum and lithium heparin plasma aliquots, were measured using the FREND ™M TSH. Linear regression analysis of serum results $( X )$ compared to lithium heparin plasma results (y) yielded the following equation $l r = 0 . 9 9 2$ $r ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 5 )$ , indicating FREND TSH can be measured equally well in serum and lithium heparin plasma:

$$
\mathsf { y } = 0 . 9 9 5 \mathsf { x } - 0 . 3 2 0
$$

# CLIA '88 - Complexity Categorization.

NanoEnTek has a previous reagent cartridge assay cleared by $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ in the US and this has been assigned a moderate complexity classification. The predicate TSH device is also marketed as a MODERATE complexity device. The logical assumption is that the FREND ™M TSH does not require a high complexity classification and there is a valid argument because of the ease of use for assigning the FREND™M TSH a MODERATE COMPLEXITY categorization.

# Substantial Equivalence

NanoEnTek has developed the FREND ™ TSH for the FREND ™ system and completed the necessary analytical and clinical validation studies to demonstrate the performance characteristics of the test for use as supporting data for this 510(k) premarket notification and for its claim of substantial equivalence.

In conclusion, the performance study results summarized below support the claim of substantial equivalence of the FREND ™M TSH to the Predicate Device. Detailed data is filed in the 510(k) documentation.

# Overall Conclusions from the Document

The information and data in this $5 1 0 ( k )$ document demonstrate that the FREND ™M TSH is an accurate, reliable test that correlates well with current cleared methods for the quantitation of serum and lithium heparin plasma

TSH. The contents of this submission demonstrate that the FREND TM TSH on the FREND ™m system is substantially equivalent to its predicate device and, therefore, safe and effective for its intended use, measuring quantitatively TSH in human serum and lithium heparin plasma.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusions

The FREND ™M TSH is as safe and effective as the "Predicate Device", the TOSOH ST AIA-PACK™M TSH asSay. FREND™M TSH has a similar Intended Use and Indications for Use: the quantitative measurement of TSH in serum and heparinized plasma, similar technological and performance characteristics, and principles of operation as its predicate device. The differences between the FRENDTM TSH and its predicate device raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Performance data, analytical and clinical, demonstrate that the FREND ™M TSH is as safe and effective as the "Predicate Device". Thus, the FREND™m TSH must be found to be substantially equivalent to the TOSOH ST AIA-PACK TSH.
