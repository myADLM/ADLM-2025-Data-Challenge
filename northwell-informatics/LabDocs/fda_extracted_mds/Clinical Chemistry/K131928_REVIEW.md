# L. Test Principle:

The FREND™ TSH test cartridge is a rapid quantitative “sandwich” immunoassay utilizing fluorescent nanoparticles in microfluidic flow to capture and quantify TSH in serum and heparinized plasma.

The FREND™ TSH uses single-use transparent plastic cartridges in which all required reagents are stored within the cartridge itself. The FREND™ System performs all sample and reagent handling operations automatically within the cartridge once the sample has been manually loaded to the sample inlet in the cartridge and the cartridge placed into the FREND™ System.

A $3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ drop of patient serum or lithium heparin plasma is placed in the FREND™ TSH cartridge inlet port, where the sample interacts with a proprietary mix of dry-loaded reagents. One of these reagents includes antibody-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles, forming immune complexes with TSH in the patient sample. Capillary action moves the sample to the detection region, where capture antibodies grab the TSH-nanoparticle. The concentration of TSH is calculated by the FREND™ System when the ratio of Test/Reference fluorescence in an unknown is compared to that same ratio for standards of known concentration. Total TSH concentration in a sample analyzed with the FREND™ TSH on the FREND™ System correlates directly with the fluorescence intensity - the higher the TSH concentration, the greater the fluorescence ratio. The TSH result is calculated using information stored on the lot specific FREND™ TSH Code Chip and then is displayed on the FREND™ System screen.

There is no calibration needed by the user because each cartridge is coded with the calibration information generated by the manufacturer.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

An internal precision study was performed according to CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Four patient serum samples were analyzed using one lot of FREND TSH cartridge. Samples were analyzed in replicates of two at two separate times per day for twenty days. Results of the precision study are as follows:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A high TSH concentration pool $2 5 . 5 \mathrm { m U / L } )$ was diluted with a low TSH concentration pool (0.017 mIU/L) based on the CLSI EP06-A guideline, resulting in eleven equally-spaced TSH concentrations samples which spanned the assay’s measuring range. All samples were run in triplicates using one FREND system. The observed results were plotted against the expected results and the linear regression analysis yielded the following regression equation: $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 7 7 + 0 . 1 7$ , ${ \bf r } = 0 . 9 9 9$ .

The sponsor states the measuring range of the assay is $0 . 0 6 \mathrm { m U / L }$ to $2 5 . 0 \mathrm { m U / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

The FREND TSH assay is traceable to the WHO standard 81/565. Each lot of cartridges has a calibrator code chip which is traceable to WHO International Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, human for Immunoassay, NIBSC code: 81/565. For the end user, there is no need for calibration as the calibration information is coded in the individual cartridge.

# Stability

Real time stability studies at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and room temperature are ongoing. Real time stability studies were conducted and the shelf life for the FREND™ TSH are good for at least one year from date of manufacturer if stored refrigerated appropriately as directed at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Stability study protocol have been provided and found to be adequate.

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limits, (LoB, LoD and LoQ) for the FREND™ TSH were evaluated based on the CLSI EP17-A protocol. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was evaluated by analyzing three lots of TSH-free charcoal-stripped serum samples measured over a period of six days for a total of $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = 6 0 }$ observations. The LoD was evaluated by analyzing three low level TSH human serum samples over a period of three days and three different lot cartridges to arrive at a total of $\mathrm { n } { = } 7 2$ measurements. The LoQ was evaluated by analyzing three low level TSH human serum samples over a period of three days and three different lot cartridges to arrive at a total of $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = 6 0 }$ measurements. LoQ is defined as the concentration that generated less than $2 0 \% \mathrm { C V }$ . Results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.03 mIU/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06 mIU/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06 mIU/L</td></tr></table>

The measuring range of this assay is 0.06 to $2 5 . 0 \mathrm { m U / L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference Studies

An interference study was performed according to CLSI-EP07 to determine whether the presence of bilirubin, triglycerides, hemoglobin, or total protein may interfere with the FREND TSH assay. Human serum pools were used with two different concentrations (low [approx. $0 . 3 - 0 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / L ] }$ and high [approx. 5-10 mIU/L]) of TSH. Each sample level was spiked with the interferent and then compared to a

sample which contained no interferent. The sponsor considers significant interference as greater than $+ / - 1 0 \%$ . The results of the highest concentration tested without significant interference are summarized below.

An interference study was conducted to determine whether the presence of common drugs interfere with the FREND TSH assay. Human serum pools were spiked with a known amount of drug interferent and then compared to the control pools containing no interferent. For each interferent, a single concentration was tested with low (0.3-0.5 mIU/L) and high $( 1 0 \mathrm { m U U / L } )$ ) TSH concentrations. The sponsor considers significant interference as $+ / .$ $10 \%$ . The results of the concentration tested without significant interference are summarized below.

Interference studies of HAMA (3.5, 52.5 and $7 0 \mathrm { n g / m l } )$ and RF (53.8, 161.3, and 215 $\mathrm { I U / m l } )$ ) were performed on TSH Low $( 1 . 0 \mathrm { m U / L } )$ and TSH High $( 7 . 2 0 \ : \mathrm { m I U / L ) }$ serum. The sponsor considers significant interference as greater than $+ / - 1 0 \%$ . No significant interference was observed for concentrations at or below $5 2 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ HAMA and 53.8 IU/ml RF.

Hook Effect: TSH was spiked into a human serum sample which had been depleted of TSH. A TSH standard was spiked into the sample to achieve concentrations ranging from $0 . 3 1 { - } 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / L }$ was analyzed. No hook effect was observed at TSH concentrations up to $2 5 0 0 \mathrm { m U / L }$ .

Ambient temperature interference study was conducted and provided. Study demonstrated that ambient temperature between $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ does not significantly interfere with the TSH assay.

# Cross-Reactivity

Human serum samples were spiked with potential cross-reactants FSH, LH and hCG and compared to a control pool containing no cross-reactant. Testing was done according to the instructions recommended in CLSI EP07-A guideline. Percent crossreactivity with various cross-reactants is summarized in the table below.
