· For prescription use only   
· For point-of-care use   
· Slit-lamp biomicroscopy is required to eliminate patients with active intraocular inflammation.   
· InflammaDry requires a visual readout. Do not interpret the test result if you have color-impaired vision.   
· The Dacron material used in the Sampling Fleece may cause allergic reactions for some people. InflammaDry should be performed prior to instilling ocular anesthetic, topical dyes, or performing Schrimer testing. Certain medications may cause erroneous results if used immediately before taking a sample. If ocular anesthetic or any other topical medication has been applied to the eye, wait at least 2 hrs prior to collecting a sample.

4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device

# I. Device Description:

InflammaDry™ consists of three (3) parts: a sterile sample collector, an immunoassay test strip in a plastic test cassette housing, and buffer in a vial. The separately packaged and sterile sample collector has a contoured end with a dacron fleece to collect the tear sample from the inside of the lower eyelid. The plastic housing of the test cassette body protects the strip from unintended physical influence. Additionally, the housing guarantees correct sample transfer onto the lateral flow assay strip. The buffer vial contains a buffered salt solution containing: $2 0 0 \mathrm { m M }$ Tris, $10 \%$ Fish 81 (sea block), $0 . 8 \%$ Tergitol, $1 0 0 \mathrm { m M N a C l } .$ , $0 . 1 \%$ Sodium Azide, $0 . 0 1 2 6 \%$ Gentamycin and $\mathsf { p H } 9 . 5 \pm 0 . 0 5$ . The buffer functions as the solution that initiates the test, carries antigen through a microfiltration process to remove unwanted cellular debris, and transports the immune complex and the control conjugate to the “Test” and “Control” lines on the test strip membrane.

The InflammaDry external controls are supplies as lyophilized powder in small glass vials with screw caps. A soft and pliable plastic dropper bottle filled with DI water diluent is provided with each set of external controls to reconstitute the lyophilized control materials.

# L. Test Principle:

The InflammaDry test is based on the principle of lateral flow immunoassay using direct sampling micro-filtration technology. Matrix Metalloproteinase -9 (MMP-9) present in the tear fluid is captured between two highly specific anti-MMP-9 antibodies: a monoclonal mouse anti-MMP-9 antibody and a polyclonal goat antihuman antibody. This antigenantibody complex is captured by NeutrAvidin immobilized as the test line. The formation of a blue color line at the control zone line with a red color line at the test zone line is considered as a positive result, a blue color line at the control zone only is considered as a negative result, if a blue color line in the control zone does not appear the test is considered invalid.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed at three point-of-care sites using stabilizing buffer spiked to the following concentrations: negative (zero), cutoff, $+ / - 2 5 \%$ , and $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , of the cutoff. The samples were aliquoted, randomized and blinded, then given to each site. A total of 120 determinations were made at each concentration. Testing was performed in duplicate twice a day over 5 days by 6 intended use operators (2/site). The intended users performed the testing by following the instructions for use. Sample concentrations were confirmed by LC/MS/MS.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

InflammaDry has built-in procedural controls. The appearance of the control line indicates the correct application of sample volume

InflammaDry External Controls consists of 2 levels (a positive and a negative) of QC materials: Positive controls are prepared by spiking MMP-9 in stabilizing buffer solution with known concentration of MMP-9 antigen which are traceable to a MMP

9 monomer form of progelatinase B from human blood. The positive control concentrations are confirmed by LC/MS/MS. Negative control is recombinant MMP9 in stabilizing buffer solution containing no drug.

External controls solutions are not supplied with this device but can be purchased separately from Rapid Screening Diagnostic Inc. Users are advised to follow federal, state and local guidelines for QC testing requirements.

Stability:

Accelerated and Real time studies have been conducted for the control material. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims that when stored un-opened at room temperature, the product is stable until expiration date which is 24 months. Open vial stability the controls should be used on the same day they are reconstituted.

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable, this is a qualitative assay.

e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity of the test with various microorganisms and cytokines was assessed by adding $1 5 \mu 1$ of potential cross-reactant to a sample collector fleece then running the test as per the directions. Microorganism concentrations ranged from 500,000 and 1,500,000 microorganisms (virus, bacteria) per ml of supernatant and cytokines were tested at $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . All isolates were cultured from human specimen. There were no positive tests observed for the following:

Microorganism (virus, bacteria) and ocular enzymes:   
Adenovirus, IgE, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus epidermis, Streptococcus pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeroginosa.

Cytokines:

Matrix metalloproteinase: 1, 2 and 3   
Tissue Inhibitor of MMP: MMP-1, MMP-2

Interference study:

The effect of different eye drops on the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the InflammaDry ™ tests was determined. The eye drops were evaluated with two different MMP-9 antigen concentrations, $C _ { 5 }$ $( \mathrm { C } _ { 5 0 } - 2 5 \% )$ and $\mathrm { C _ { 9 5 } }$ $( \mathrm { C } _ { 5 0 } + 2 5 \% )$ in duplicate. Influence of the relevant proteins on sensitivity and specificity is also examined. Any positive or negative interfering substance identified by this testing was re-tested using $C _ { 5 0 } - 5 0 \%$ , and $C _ { 5 0 } + 5 0 \%$ .

The following eye medications were tested for interference in human tears at the cutoff level and the respective medication. The following medications did not show any interferences:

Alcaine Alcon, "Azopt"-Alcon, Econopred Alcon, "Nevanac"-Alcon, "Pataday"- Alcon, Systaine"-Alcon, Tobra Dex, "Travatan"-Alcon, Alcon, Vigamox Alcon, "Acular LS"-Allergan, Alphagan Allergan, "Combigan"-Allergan, Elastat Allergan, "FML"-Allergan Lastacaft –Allergan, Lumigan Allergan, Optive"-Allergan, Pred Forte"-Allergan, Refresh Liquigel, Refreash Tears Allergan, Zymar Allergan, "Blink Tears"-Amo, Thera Tears AVS, Alrex B&L, Lotemax B&L, “Zylet"- Bausch&Lomb, Gentamycin Sulfate-Falcon, Polymyxin B sulfate Falcon, "Timolol"-Falcon, "AzaSite"-Inspire, Bepreve-Ista, "Xibrom"-Ista, Optivar MedPDEnte, Truspot Merck, GenTeal"-Novartis, "Voltaren"-Novartis, "Zaditor"- Novartis, Visine Pfizer, Xalatan Pharmacia, human IgA $\mathrm { { ( 1 \ m g / m l ) } }$ , Sigma-Aldrich, human lactoferrin $\mathrm { 1 ~ m g / m l } )$ , Sigma-Aldrich, Transferrin $\mathrm { { ( 1 \ m g / m l ) } }$ , Betimol Vistakon

However, the following medications show false positive or false negative results: Vistakon, Iquix; Vistakon, Quixin; Wilson, Proparacaine; and Trusopt.

Therefore, sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:

Patients should not be tested with InflammaDry if the following medications were administrated into the eyes within 2 hours of the testing of the ImflammaDry. Interferences medications: Vistakon, Iquix; Vistakon, Quixin; Wilson, Proparacaine; and Trusopt.

Certain medications such as systemic immunodulators, topical or oral steroids, cyclosporine, tetracycline and topical azithromycin are known to inhibit metalloproteinase activity. Use of these medications may lead to false negative results.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

The InflammaDry Test underwent a clinical evaluation to determine the negative and positive agreement of the InflammaDry with clinical assessment of dry eye. The study design was a prospective, sequential, masked, clinical trial. Those patients who were clinically determined by an ophthalmic clinician to meet enrollment criteria were included in the study. The study enrolled 237 patients consisting of 164 females and 73 males between the ages of 18 and 94 years old with an average age of 53 years. Patients presented from both private practices and academic centers from various regions across the country. Although 257 patients were recruited, seventeen (17) patients were excluded for a protocol deviation.

The protocol deviation involved patients receiving topical ocular anesthetic prior to the evaluation of the tear break up time (TBUT) and corneal staining, potentially accelerating the TBUT and inducing corneal staining.

Study testing was done on the subject’s more symptomatic eye (if no difference existed symptomatically between the two eyes, the right eye was tested). Each subject underwent the following sequence of testing: Each patient had the following tests performed: InflammaDry, tear break up time (TBUT), Schirmer tear testing, and corneal staining.

The InflammaDry was compared to the clinical assessment in the table below. Derived from the DEWS criteria, the clinical assessment was developed to represent a combination of symptoms and signs. The pivotal clinical trial used the same metrics for TBUT, Schirmer tear testing, and corneal staining as described in the DEWS criteria, however, conjunctival injection, conjunctival staining, and the presence of meibomian disease were not tested or used to characterize the severity of dry eye disease. In general, the worst severity for any sign tested determined the overall severity. Symptoms are known to be poorly correlated with signs with even the most severe dry eye patients often reporting little to no symptoms. Patients were categorized to the highest severity level at which all required criteria are satisfied. Patients who do not meet all the required clinical criteria for a given severity grade will be considered to be at the next lower grade.
