# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level.

The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility

# Within-run (Repeatability)

Venous blood was adjusted with glucose to five glucose levels (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, $2 5 1 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ across the claimed range and tested on three lots of test strips on 10 meters (10 strips per meter).

# Intermediate Precision

Intermediate precision was evaluated using three lots of test strips and ten meters. Glucose control solutions in three concentration ranges were used (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 or 50, 120, and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . For each test strip lot, each control solution was measured once per day on 10 meters in replicates of 10, with three test strip lots for 10 days, so that 100 individual measurements were generated (300 measurements per glucose level). Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using 3 lots of test strips, 2 meters, and 11 venous whole blood samples with glucose levels ranging from $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ (13.4, 22.0, 46.9, 83.0, 107.9, 179.0, 219.6, 328.6, 451.5, 575.5, $6 3 7 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , obtained by spiking pooled venous blood with a glucose solution. Each glucose level was tested with 4 test strips over 3 test strip lots. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot compared to the YSI resulted in:

The measuring range of the On Call Express Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 - $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The On Call Express Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b reference material. The method comparison study was performed using the candidate device and YSI as the reference method.

Value assignment:

The value assignment of the On Call Express Blood Glucose control solutions were determined by an in-house procedure. The 3 levels of control solutions (Levels 0, 1 and 2) are prepared by gravimetric addition of glucose to achieve target glucose values and are were confirmed by the YSI method. Verification of the control solutions are tested with 240 test strips and 2 On Call Express meters with each level and the values were within the target ranges.

Stability:

Accelerated stability studies were conducted to assess the shelf-life and open vial stability of the control solutions and test strips with on-going real-time stability studies . Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life and are stable for 4 months after first opening when stored at $4 1 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and $10 - 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. The sponsor claims that the test strips be stored at $4 1 { - } 8 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and

$10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity and and are stable for 5 months after first openingwhen stored at 41- ${ } ^ { . 8 6 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F }$ $( 5 \mathrm { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity . The study protocols were reviewed and found to be adequate.

d. Detection limit:

The reportable range is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ based on linearity studies above (section M.1.b.).

e. Analytical specificity:

To assess potential interference, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to three glucose concentration intervals of $5 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 100 - 120 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $3 0 0 { - } 3 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool and each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations. The $\%$ difference between the test sample and the control sample was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ difference relative to the control sample. Results are presented in the table below:

N. Instrument Name: On Call Express blood glucose meter

O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of $0 . 4 \mathrm { u L }$ .

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes _ or No _ _x

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ _ or No __x_

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes _ _x _ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, forearm and palm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

5. Calibration:

There is no calibration required for the On Call Express blood glucose meter by the user. The meter is automatically coded.

6. Quality Control:

Glucose control solutions at 3 different concentrations are available to be run with this device and only one control level is provided with the kit. The meter automatically distinguishes control solution from blood and marks control solution tests with a check mark and excludes them from average calculations. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling.

An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label and on the bottom of the test strip box. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

# 1. Sample volume study:

The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum sample volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the On Call Express blood glucose meter. Blood samples with 3 glucose concentrations were tested at five sample volumes (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and $0 . 6 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) and values obtained were compared to YSI values. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 4 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the error code for insufficient sample volume of $0 . 3 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

# 2. Altitude Study:

This study was conducted at a single site to evaluate the effect of altitude on the On Call Express Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The tested glucose range (obtained using YSI reference method) was from 45 to $4 8 0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at sea level and 31.7 to $5 4 1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at 8,516 ft above sea level. Fingerstick blood samples were collected and compared to the YSI analyzer reference value. These blood samples were evaluated using both the On Call Express BGMS and a YSI glucose analyzer. Each test strip glucose value was compared to the YSI method and then analyzed as a percent bias. The glucose values obtained using the On Call Express blood glucose meter had acceptable biases to support the altitude claim of 8,516 feet.

# 3. Hematocrit Study:

The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using 6 different hematocrit (30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and $5 5 \%$ ) levels across the glucose measuring range (target glucose concentrations $4 0 - 5 0 , 1 0 0 - 1 2 0 , 2 8 0 - 3 0 0 .$ , and $5 0 0 - 5 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . 3 test strip lots were evaluated and compared to the YSI method. The results support the sponsor’s claimed hematocrit range of $30 \%$ .

# 4. Test System operating conditions:

The effect of different temperature and humidity combinations on the performance of the system was assessed using three test strip lots tested at 7 combined temperature and relative humidity conditions 41 $\mathrm { F } ( 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ) / 1 0 \%$ RH, $6 9 . 8 \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 1 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ) /$ $10 \%$ RH, 113 F $( 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ) / 1 0 \%$ , 41 F $( 5 ~ \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C } ) / 9 0 \%$ RH, 69.8 F $( 2 1 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ / $90 \%$ RH, 113 F $( 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ) / 9 0 \% \mathrm { R H } .$ and $6 9 . 8 \ : \mathrm { F } ( 2 1 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ) / 4 5 \ ^ { \circ } / \circ \ : \mathrm { R H } )$ . Three blood samples were adjusted to the following glucose concentration levels: $4 0 { - } 6 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 100-120 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $5 0 0 { - } 5 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each sample was also compared to the YSI reference method. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in temperatures ranging from $5 \textrm { -- } 4 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and relative humidity conditions ranging from $10 - 9 0 \%$ .

# 5. Readability Assessment:

The readability of the labeling (user guides, test strip package insert and control solution package insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis and were found to be written at the 8th grade level.

6. EMC Testing: The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed.

# 7. Software documentation:

The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm provided documentation to support the device was designed, developed and is under good software lifecycle processes.

# 9. Infection Control Studies:

The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, (DisCide Ultra Wipes) Quaternary Ammonium/Isopropyl Alcohol disinfectant wipe (EPA Reg. No. 10492-4). This study was originally cleared in k112653. Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor using the On Call Express BGMS and demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meterafter 260 times of cleaning and disinfection cycles, using (DisCide Ultra Wipes) Quaternary Ammonium/Isopropyl Alcohol disinfectant wipes, to simulate 5 years of use by layusers. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
