# L. Test Principle:

The Nova StatStrip Hospital Meter System is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The system quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

This submission was for the expansion of the indications for use to add the use of venous and arterial blood samples (lithium heparin) in hospitalized patients. The expanded indications for use is supported by a clinical study (see section M below). The meter, test strips, and software were not modified from the predicate.

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: As established in k060345 b. Linearity/assay reportable range: As established in k063821.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability established in k060345.

Control Solutions: Value Assignment and Stability protocols for the 3 levels of control solutions were evaluated in k060345. The ranges for each control solution are provided on the test strip vial label.

Linearity Solutions: Value Assignment and Stability protocols for the 5 levels of linearity solutions were evaluated in k060345.

Test Strips: Stability protocols for the test strips were evaluated in k060345. The claimed closed-vial stability is 24 months at $3 3 – 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ RH. The claimed open-vial stability is 180 days when stored at the recommended storage temperatures $3 3 – 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ RH or until the expiration date printed on the label, whichever comes first. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.

c. Detection limit:

The reportable range for the Nova StatStrip Blood Glucose Hospital Meter is 10 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity established in k063821; section M.1.b.

# d. Analytical specificity:

Potential interference from some common endogenous and exogenous substances was established in k060345.

Additional interference testing was performed to support the additional intended use claims. To study the effects of commonly used drugs and endogenous substances on the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System, one lot of strips and three levels of blood glucose concentrations $( 2 0 - 8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 0 0 - 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $2 5 0 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ were used. Blood samples at each glucose concentration were spiked with a toxic concentration of one of each of 80 potential interferents and tested on five Nova StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meters. The results were compared to results from unspiked, control samples and the concentrations at which no significant interference was observed are listed in the table below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

The performance of the Nova StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System in hospitalized patients was established in this submission using venous (lithium heparin) and arterial samples (lithium heparin) obtained from 1698 patients at 5 different hospitals.

The study was comprised of patients throughout the hospital which included emergency rooms, operating rooms, oncology departments, intensive care units, medical intensive care units, surgical intensive care units, cardiovascular surgical intensive care units, pediatric intensive care units, transplant departments, cardiac departments, nursing, and surgical departments.

Samples from patients, ages 1 month – 94 years of age, were analyzed using 4 test strip lots at each study site. Results obtained by a point of care user on the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter were compared to results obtained on the comparator method (Roche COBAS Modular P800 Chemistry System at sites 1, 2, 4 and 5, and the Beckman Coulter Synchron UniCel DxC 800 at site 3). Glucose results, patient conditions (see Patient Conditions table below for details), physiological status (e.g., pH, pO2, pCO2, sO2, albumin, protein, red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), major histocompatibility complex (MHC), sodium, potassium, calcium, lactate, chloride, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), triglycerides, Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MOD) score), and medication information (see the Medications table below for details) were collected during the study. The glucose ranges, according to the reference method, and the number of samples obtained at each study site are summarized in the table below:

# CLIA WAIVER

The Nova StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System previously obtained CLIA WAIVER by application on February 28, 2008. The study performed to support CLIA waiver for this device was reanalyzed to evaluate whether the arterial and venous data would meet new and clinically appropriate Limits of Erroneous Results (LER) and Allowable Total Error (ATE) for the sponsor’s new intended use population (all hospitalized patients). The analysis demonstrates that the previous CLIA Waived studies in venous and arterial whole blood meet appropriate waiver standards for hospitalized patients. The percentage of arterial and venous data over the entire measurement range that falls within the ATE zone is $9 8 . 4 \%$ (363/369). None of the results were in the LER zone.

Therefore, the sponsor’s CLIA waived status is extended to cover the new intended use claims cleared in this current submission.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Normal (non-diabetic) adult fasting: Less than $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (5.55 mmol/L) and less than $1 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (7.77 mmol/L) 1-2 hours after meals

American Diabetes Association. Diabetes Care (2013), Volume 36, Supplement 1.

N. Instrument Name: Nova StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter

# O. System Description:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?:

Yes X or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?:

Yes or No X

2. Software:

As established in k060345 and k063821. No changes were made to the software in this submission.

3. Specimen Identification:

The Nova StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter memory will store 1000 patient tests, 200 QC tests, and 4000 operators.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary fingerstick whole blood, arterial, venous, neonatal heel stick and neonatal arterial. The blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

The meter stores patient test data, quality control test data, and other information relating to the patient, patient sample, operator, reagents, and meter. Meter setup options relating to authorized operators, reagent lots, QC preferences, and other operational settings are customizable. Data is transferred bi-directionally between the meter, data docking station, and separate data management system each time a meter is placed in to a data docking station.

5. Calibration:

As established in k060345, the meter does not require the user to input a test strip code.

6. Quality Control:

Three levels of aqueous ready to use glucose control solutions are available with this system (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution testing can be performed by pushing the QC key, entering (or scanning) the test strip lot number. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the vial label of the control being used.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1) Hematocrit study:

As established in k060345 and k063821 to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20- $65 \%$ .

) Altitude study: As established in k060345 to support the use of the device up to 15,000 ft.

3) Temperature and humidity studies:

As established in k060345 to support the claimed operating condition range of $5 9 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F }$ - $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity.

4) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for multiple-patient use. Clorox Germicidal Wipes, EPA registration # 67619-12 was validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

5) Certificates of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) as established in k060345.

6) Customer Care Service Center is available by calling 800-345-6682.
