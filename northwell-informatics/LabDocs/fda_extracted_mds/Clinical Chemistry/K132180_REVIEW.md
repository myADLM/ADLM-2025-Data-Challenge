# L. Test Principle:

IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM 0002 Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in whole blood. The glucose testing is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip. The meter measures the current, calculates the blood glucose level, and displays the result. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): All performance characteristics were conducted on the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager, Model GMM0002 with the IDEAL LIFE test strips model AGS-1112.

1. Analytical performance:

# 3. 2WKHU6XSSRUWLYH,QVWUXPHQW3HUIRUPDQFH&KDUDWHULVWLFV'DWD1RW&RYHUHG,Q7KH “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

# 1. Altitude Study

An altitude study was performed in three altitude simulation chambers set at sea level, 3,280ft $( 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m } )$ , 6,561ft $( 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m } )$ , and 10,744ft $( 3 2 7 5 \mathrm { m } )$ with 20 venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 56.5 to $4 3 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was tested with four meters and one test strip lot and the results were compared to YSI. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,744 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 Monitoring System.

# 2. Hematocrit Study

The effect of different hematocrit levels were evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of $20 \%$ (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, $60 \%$ ) spiked with five glucose concentrations (22.6, 76.5, 152, 256, 354, 453, 596mg/dL) distributed across the measuring range. The samples were tested with three meters and one lot of test strips. The results were compared to YSI and the normal $40 \%$ hematocrit. The percent bias of the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 meter results relative to YSI demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of $20 \%$ .

# 3. Sample volume

A minimum sample volume study was performed using seven venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from $4 6 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 5 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to evaluate effect of different sample volumes (0.5uL, 0.6uL, $0 . 7 \mathrm { u L }$ , 1.0uL, 2.0uL) on the performance of the device. Results at each sample volume were compared to the corresponding YSI values. Results from these studies support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 7 \mathrm { u L }$ .

# 4. Infection Control Studies

The IDEAL Life GlucoManager GMM0002 is intended for single patient use.

Disinfection efficacy was established in k110017. Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter and landing device after 11,000 pre-cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps with the Cavi WipesTM (EPA Registration # 46781-8). The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 5. Temperature and Humidity Studies

Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated using three GMM0002 meters and one lot of test strips with fresh venous whole blood samples at three glucose levels (low, normal, high) for temperatures ranging from $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ ( $1 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and relative humidity from $2 5 \%$ to $80 \%$ including extreme conditions of temperature and humidity, e.g. lowest humidity with lowest and highest temperature and highest humidity with lowest and highest temperature. Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The results supported the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F }$ to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and relative humidity range from $2 5 \% - 8 0 \%$ .

# 6. EMC testing

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed.

# 7. Readability Assessment

A SMOG reading level assessment was conducted of the GlucoManager GMM0002 instructions for use and the quick installation guide was assessed, giving a readability grade level of 7.5 and 7.8 respectively. Test strip and Control solution instruction for use were assessed with a readability level of 7.7 and 7.2 respectively.

# 8. Data Transmission

IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 Blood Glucose monitoring system has a Bluetooth function. The sponsor performed the following test scripts:

# Test scripts for Gateway Application and GlucoManager GMM0002

This test script is to ensure that the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 will be able to correctly send readings via the IDEAL Life Gateway Application to IDEAL LIFE Cloud. The acceptance criteria are that readings shall be saved on the Ideal Life DB with the correct values. Five tests were performed with the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 via IDEAL LIFE Gateway Application. All executed test cases have the status of PASS.

# No Data Lost between Gateway Application and Manager Device

This test script is to ensure that IDEAL LIFE Managers, including the GlucoManager, will be able to store reading data in their memory and there will be no data loss if Gateway Application fails to transmit readings to IDEAL LIFE Cloud. One test case for each Manager type was performed. All executed test cases have the status of PASS.

9. Software: The sponsor provided the results of the device software testing including a traceability analysis, validation and verification testing which were reviewed and found to be adequate.

# 10. Human Factors testing:

A usability test was conducted with twenty-two (22) users of varied computer skill between 18-80 years old. Each user was provided with an IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 and given instructions to upload the Gateway application according to the instructions for use, to measure glucose levels with control solutions and to upload data to the website. Users were asked to complete a survey about the ease of use of the device and software. The positive response to this user test indicates that there are no areas of concern about the usability of the device by the intended users.
