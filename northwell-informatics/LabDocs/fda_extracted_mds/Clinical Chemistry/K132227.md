# 4.0 Descrlptlon of Device

Liqulchek Immunoassay Premlum Control Is prepared from human serum with added constituents of human and animal origin, chemicals, therapeutic drugs, stablizers and preservatives. The control is provided in liquld form for convenience.

Each human donor unit used to manufacture this control was tested by FDA accepted methods and found non-reactive for Hepatitls 8 Surface Antlgen (HBsAg), antibody to Hepatitis C (HCV) and antibody to HIV-1/HIV-2. This product may also contain other human source material for which there are no approved tests.

# 5.0 Value Assignment

The mean values and the corresponding $\pm 3 \mathsf { S D }$ ranges printed In this Insert were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for this lot of product. Data from Unity™ Interlaboratory Program are included In the determination of some ranges. The tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of this lot of product. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own acceptable ranges and use those provided only as guides. Laboratory established ranges may vary from those listed during the life of this control. Variations over tlime and between laboratories may be caused by differences in laboratory technique, Instrumentation and reagents, or by manufacturer test method modifications.

# 6.0 Intended Use

Liquichek Immunoassay Premlum Control is Intended for use as an assayed quality control serum to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analytes listed in this package insert.
