# Traceability:

The IMMULITE® 2000 Anti-TG Ab CVMs are traceable to WHO Ist IRP 65/93. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE Anti-TG Ab (Anti-Thyroglobulin antibody) CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 8 level Anti-TG Ab calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Anti-TG Ab reagents and two point adjustors.

The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The assigned reference calibrators are prepared using Anti-TG antibody stock and are traceable to WHO $1 ^ { 5 t }$ IRP 65/93. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Two levels of commercially available controls, and 30 patient samples (10 spiked normal patients samples, two patient samples and 18 spiked samples) are used to validate CVM value assignments.

The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs were tested on 27 replicates in total comprised of nine runs and three replicates per run on seven IMMULITE 2000 systems and five different reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges

# Expected Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested for a total of 27 replicates; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run. 5 different reagent kit lots and 7 different instruments were used to gain 27 replicates. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm \nobreakspace 2 \nobreakspace$ Standard Deviation (SD).

# Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

The Acceptance Criteria for the IMMULITE 2000 Anti-TG Ab Calibration Verification Material (CVM) consists of 2 parts. Part 1 consists of the Guideline Acceptance Criteria which requires the dose value stability CVM to fall between $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Part 2 consists of the Review Limits Acceptance Criteria which requires the dose value of the controls to be within 2SD of the control target value generated from the stability calibrator curve. If the result is not within the acceptable dose range of $\pm 1 0 \%$ , then additional data review is performed using the part 2 acceptance criterion.

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE Thyroglobulin CVMs are traceable to Certified Reference Material from human thyroglobulin (BCR 457) in terms of the Institute of Reference Materials and Measurements of the European Commission (formerly the Community Bureau of Reference. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

Thyroglobulin CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 9 level Thyroglobulin calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Thyroglobulin reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE Thyroglobulin CVMs are traceable to Certified Reference Material from human thyroglobulin (BCR 457) in terms of the Institute of Reference Materials and Measurements of the European Commission (formerly the Community Bureau of Reference. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Three levels of commercially available controls, and 30 patient samples (5 normal patients samples and 25 spiked samples) are used to validate CVM value assignments.

The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs were tested on 27 replicates in total comprised of nine runs and three replicates per run on four IMMULITE 2000 systems and four different reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges

# Expected Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested for a total of 27 replicates; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run. 4 different reagent kit lots and 4 different instruments were used to gain 27 replicates. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm 2$ Standard Deviation (SD). The expected values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration verification Material lot-specific value card. The expected assay range is 02-300 $N G / \mathrm { m L }$ . The target values in Table 3 can be considered as guidelines.

# 9. Conclusion:

Thyroglobulin Calibration Verification Material is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Intact PTH Master Curve Material. The substantial equivalence of the device is supported by the non-clinical testing and was found to be comparable and supports the claims of substantial equivalence, product safety and effectiveness. Based on the testing completed and the comparisons with predicate device, ADVIA Centaur® Intact PTH Master Curve Material, The IMMULITE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Thyroglobulin Calibration Verification Material does not raise any new questions on safety and effectiveness and the results support a determination of substantial equivalence.
