Indications for Use:

For in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative measurement of albumin in human serum or plasma on ADVIA Chemistry systems. Albumin measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases primarily involving the liver or kidneys.

For invito diagnostic use in the calibration of the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Assay (ALBP) on ADVIA Chemistry systems.

# Device Description:

The Albumin BCP reagents are ready-to-use liquid reagents packaged for use on the automated ADVIA 1650 Chemistry systems. Reagents are supplied in two configurations: fill volume of $1 8 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ in a ${ 2 0 } ~ \mathrm { m L }$ wedge or $3 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ in a $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ wedge, 4 wedges/kit.

The calibrator is a multi-analyte human serum based product containing albumin derived from human serum. The kit consists of 3 vials of one-level calibrator which are lyophilized. The target concentration of this calibrator is $4 . 3 ~ \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { d L }$ . The volume per vial (after reconstitution with deionized water) is $2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ .

# 10. Test Principle:

The ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Assay is an adaptation of the bromocresol purple (BCP) dye-binding method reported by Carter and Louderback, et al. In the ADVIA Chemistry ALBP Assay, serum or plasma albumin quantitatively binds to BCP to form an albumin-BCP complex that is measured as an endpoint reaction at $5 9 6 / 6 9 4 \ : \mathrm { n m }$

# 2. Linearity/Assay reportable range

Linearity of the Assay on ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system was assessed by evaluating eleven dilutions across the measuring range.. All samples were tested on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry analyzer. Observed values were compared vs. expected values using linear regression analysis. The low end of the assay range is calculated based on the Limit of Quantitation. The high end of the assay range is based on the linearity calculations.

The linear/measuring range of the assay is 0.6 to ${ \bf 8 . 0 \ g / d L }$ .

3. Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection, Limit of Quantitation   
The estimations of the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of   
Quantitation (LoQ) were performed according to CLSI document EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures, Approved   
Guideline. The LoB for the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Assay on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system is ${ \bf 0 . 1 \ g / d L }$ . Limit of detection (LoD) is the smallest amount that this Assay can reliably detect to determine presence or absence of an analyte. The LoD for for the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Assay on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system is 0.6 g/dL. LoB and LoD values are determined with proportions of false positives ${ \bf ( \mathfrak { a } ) }$ less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (B) less than $5 \%$ , based on 720 determinations with 240 blank   
and 480 low-level sample replicates. . Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is ${ \bf 0 . 6 \ : g / d L }$ based on an inter-assay precision of ${ < } 1 0 \%$ CV.

# 4. Method comparison with predicate device

The performance of the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Assay (y) for serum samples on ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system was compared with the performance of the predicate device $( \mathbf { x } )$ Sixty-nine serum samples with albumin concentrations throughout the range of the assay were tested. The results calculated using least squares linear regression ( $1 ^ { \mathfrak { a } }$ replicate) are as follows:

ADVIA Chemistry Albumin $\mathsf { B C P } = 0 . 9 9$ (predicate device) + 0.01 g/dL Slope 95%CI: 0.98 - 1.00

# Intercept $9 5 \%$ CI: -0.03 - 0.05Sample range: $\mathbf { 0 . 9 - 7 . 9 \ g / d L }$ $\scriptstyle \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9$ EP

# 5. Matrix comparison

The performance of the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Assay (y) was compared on ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system for plasma samples (Lithium Heparin and Potassium EDTA) vs. serum samples $( \mathbf { x } )$ . Forty seven paired plasma/serum samples with albumin concentrations throughout the range of the assay were tested. The results calculated using linear regression ( $1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ replicate) are as follows:

ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Plasma (Lithium Heparin) $\mathbf { \omega } _ { 1 } = \mathbf { 1 . 0 1 }$ (ADVIA Chemistry   
Albumin BCP Serum) $+ 0 . 0 4$ g/dL Slope $9 5 \% 0$ : 0.99 - 1.03

$\scriptstyle \mathbf { r } = \mathbf { 0 } . 9 9 8$ EMPY   
ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Plasma (Potassium EDTA) $\mathbf { \varepsilon } = \mathbf { 0 . 9 9 }$ (ADVIA Chemistry   
Albumin BCP Serum) - 0.06 g/dL   
Slope $9 5 \% 0$ : 0.96 - 1.03   
Intercept $9 5 \%$ CI: -0.23 - 0.07   
Sample range: $\displaystyle 1 . 0 - 7 . 7 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$   
$\mathbf { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 3$ EMP

# 6. Analytical specificity

Interferences from icterus, lipemia, and hemolysis, factor were evaluated using a significance criterion of $> 1 0 \%$ bias. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference.

Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) tested up to $6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , lipemia up to $5 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and hemoglobin up to $7 5 0 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ were shown not to cause significant interference with this assay.

# 7. Reference Interval (Expected Values)

Expected values are within $3 . 4 - 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { g } \Lambda ^ { \ast }$ \*

Calibrator: for opened products, once the cap is removed, assigned values are stable for 8 hours when recapped immediately after use and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathbb { C }$ . The shelf life of the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Calibrator is 18 months at $2 { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .For unopened product, see the expiration date on the calibrator carton.

The calibrator which is used for the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP assay is the same calibrator (one level only) which was previously cleared as Siemens Dimension Clinical Chemistry System TP/ALB calibrator under k861 700 and is relabeled for ADVIA Chemistry use

# 9. Traceability

The ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Assay is traceable to ERM-DA470k Reference Material. Assigned values of the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Calibrator are traceable to this standardization

# 10. Value Assignment

The value assignment protocol for the ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP calibrator is the same as for the predicate device which was cleared under k861 700.

Target, g/dL 4.3   
Target Range, g/dL 4.1 to 4.5

# 14. Conclusions

The ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP Assay with associated calibrator on ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system is substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Dimension Albumin Assay reagent and Dimension TP/ALB calibrator respectively, cleared under k861700.
