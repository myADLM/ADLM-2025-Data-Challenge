1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision Studies were conducted utilizing the Carolina Liquid Chemistries HDL Cholesterol Reagent on the Carolina Liquid Chemistries CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP5-A2. A total of three serumbased control materials were analyzed 40 times for the within-run precision, and were analyzed in triplicate two times per day for 20 non-consecutive days for the total precision analysis. A single reagent lot and instrument was used for the analysis. The results are summarized below:

The sponsor performed the following additional precision studies on the Carolina Liquid Chemistries CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer following recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP5-A2. Two clinical sample pools were analyzed 20 times for the within-run precision, and were analyzed two times per day, for 30 non-consecutive days, for the total precision determination. A single reagent lot (different lot from above described study) and instrument (same as above study) was used for the analysis. The results are summarized below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were carried out using six commercially available HDL Linearity

standards. All samples were tested five times. The sample range tested was $8 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $1 6 5 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The sponsor demonstrated acceptable linearity from 8.6 to $1 6 5 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The claimed measuring range of the device is from 9 to $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor recommends the use of a commercially available calibrator (the JAS Diagnostics HDL Calibrator traceable to NIST SRM 911b) which was previously cleared in k021671.

Stability testing was performed by the manufacturer. The reagents are stable for 12 months when stored between $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

On board stability was performed on the CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer demonstrated that the reagents are stable for 30 days when stored on board the CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The reagent system has not been tested or certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN). The labeling contains language that the device has not been certified by the CRMLN.

# d. Detection limit:

A limit of detection study was conducted based on procedures described in CLSI EP17- A. The limit of the blank (LoB) of $0 . 1 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was calculated from data using a pooled serum sample diluted with $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride assayed 8 times and repeated for a total of ten individually calibrated runs to produce 80 results. The LoD of $0 . 5 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was calculated as the LoB plus the one-tailed $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the test results. The LoQ of $6 . 4 8 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ was determined with a performance goal of $\leq 2 0 \%$ CV and is lower than the lower limit of the measuring range which is set at $9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To determine the level of interference from substances normally present in human serum, the Carolina Liquid Chemistries HDL Cholesterol Reagent was tested with low level HDL serum samples containing about $3 2 { - } 3 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ HDL-C and high level HDL serum samples containing about $6 2 { - } 7 2 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ HDL-C. Both levels were spiked with various concentrations of potentially interfering substances following the recommendations in the

CLSI guideline EP7-A2 on the CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer. A total of four or six levels were tested for interferents and all samples were tested in six runs with eight replicates. The following substances normally present in serum produced less than $10 \%$ deviation when tested at levels equal to the following concentrations:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison studies were conducted following the recommendations in the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.

80 serum samples were assayed in parallel by singlicate runs on both the Carolina Liquid Chemistries HDL Cholesterol Reagent on the Carolina Liquid Chemistries CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer and a predicate method. The results were analyzed by using Deming regression. The range tested was $1 1 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $1 5 0 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Altered samples were included in the study $( 1 6 \% )$ .

The comparison by Deming regression resulted in a slope of 0.958 $( 9 5 \% C \mathrm { I } = 0 . 9 3 9$ to 0.977), an intercept of 1.06 $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I } = - 0 . 3 2$ to 2.45), correlation coefficient $= 0 . 9 9 6 1$ , and a standard error of 2.43.
