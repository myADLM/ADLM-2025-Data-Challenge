# Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

The Acceptance Criteria for the IMMULITE OM-MA Calibration Verification Material (CVM) are in 2 parts. Part 1 consists of the Guideline acceptance criteria which require dose value of stability CVM to fall between $\pm 1 0 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM levels 2 to 3 and $\pm 1 1 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM level 4. Part 2 review limits criteria which require dose value of the controls to be within 2SD of the control target value when generated from the stability calibrator curve. If the result is not within acceptable dose range of $\pm 1 0 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM levels 2 to 3 and $\pm 1 1 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM level, then additional data revie is conducted using part  citea.

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE OM-MA CVMs are traceable to internal assigned reference calibrators prepared using OM-MA antigen stock solution and are traceable to internal material which is gravimetrically prepared. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

OM-MA CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 9 level OM-MA calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of OM-MA reagents and two point adjustors. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Three levels of commercially available controls and 30 samples (5 normal patient samples and 25 normal patients spiked with high patient sample) were used to validate CVM value assignments

The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs were tested on 27 replicates in total comprised of nine runs and three replicates per run on nine systems and three different reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges

# Expected Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested for a total of 27 replicates; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run, 3 different reagent kit lots and 9 different instruments were used to gain 7 replicates. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm \nobreakspace 2 \nobreakspace$ Standard Deviation (SD). The expected values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration verification Material lot-specific value card. The expected assay range is $2 { \cdot } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

# Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

The Acceptance Criteria for the IMMULITE AFP Calibration Verification Material (CVM) are in 2 parts. Part I consists of the Guideline acceptance criteria which require dose value of stability CVM to fall between $\pm 1 5 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM levels 2 and $\pm 1 0 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM levels 3 and 4. Part 2 review limits criteria which require dose value of the controls to be within 2SD of the control target value when generated from the stability calibrator curve. If the result is not within acceptable dose range of $\pm 1 5 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM levels 2 and $\pm 1 0 \%$ of assigned dose for CVMs 3 and 4, then additional data review is conducted using part 2 criteria.

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE AFP CVMs are traceable to WHO 1st IS 72/25 and are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

IMMULITE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 AFP (Alpha-fetoprotein) Calibration Verification Materials are 4 level materials which are a subset of 9 level AFP calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of AFP reagents and two point adjustors. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Nine levels of commercially available controls and 61 samples including amniotic fluid samples, pregnancy trimester samples, normal patient samples and spiked AFP samples were used to validate CVM value assignments.

The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges

# Expected Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested for a total of 27 replicates; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run. 3 different reagent kit lots and 5 different instruments were used to gain 27 replicates. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm ~ 2$ Standard Deviation (SD). The expected values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration verification Material lot-specific value card. The expected assay range is 0.2 -300 $\mathrm { I U } h \mathrm { r }$ .The target values in Table 3 can be considered as guidelines.

Each laboratory should establish their limits for acceptability based on methodology, clinical significance and medical decision levels of the test analyte. The representative, total precision tabulated in the respective assay instructions for use may be considered as one factor when establishing local, acceptable ranges. The values provided above may be considered as guidelines. Value assignment is lot specific.

# Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10

# 9 Conclusion:

MULITE® 2000 AFP (Alpha-fetoprotein) Calibration Verification Material is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Third Generation PSA CVM. The substantial equivalence of the device is supported by the non-clinical testing and was found to be comparable and supports the claims of substantial equivalence, product safety and effectiveness. Based on the testing completed and the comparisons with predicate device, the IMMULITE $\mathfrak { W }$ 2000 AFP Calibration Verification Material does not raise any new questions on safety and effectiveness and the results support a determination of substantial equivalence.

Dear Mr. Mimaryan:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.
