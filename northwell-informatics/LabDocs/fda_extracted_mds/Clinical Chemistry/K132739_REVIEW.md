# ii. Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVMs, BR-MA CVMs and OM-MA CVMs are manufactured and value assigned using qualified materials and measurement procedures. Each laboratory should establish their limits for acceptability based on methodology, clinical significance and medical decision levels of the test analyte. Value assignment is lot specific.

IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVM: Each CVM level was tested for 9 runs and 3 replicates per run for a total of 27 replicates. Three different reagent kit lots and 5 different instruments were used to gain 27 replicates. The CVMs dose values were generated using a curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The analyte values were calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values were then averaged across all systems.

The IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVMs are stable up to 3.5 years when stored frozen at ${ \bf - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to opening. The IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVMs) are stable up to 4.5 years when stored frozen at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ prior to opening. The IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA CVMs are stable up to 9 years when stored refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to opening.

# iv. Matrix effect:

The Matrix Effects Studies were performed to describe any significant difference between the IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVM, IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVM and IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA CVM and typical patient samples in terms of conditions known to cause analytical error.

IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVM: A stock solution of AFP antigen was used to prepare the spiking solutions for studying matrix effects. Three spiking solutions were prepared from stock solution. Each spiking solution was spiked into matrix (Bovine Serum) and patient sample (1 part spiking solution to 19 parts matrix or sample) to generate three sets of spiked samples (concentrations at 9.91 IU/mL, 29.76 IU/mL and $6 7 . 8 1 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVM: A stock solution of BR-MA antigen (CA15.3) was used to prepare the spiking solutions for studying matrix effects. Three spiking solutions were prepared from stock solution. Each spiking solution was spiked into matrix (Bovine Serum) and patient sample (1 part spiking solution to 19 parts matrix or sample) to generate three sets of

spiked samples (concentrations at $2 8 2 \mathrm { U / m L }$ , 617 U/mL and $1 , 1 6 8 \ \mathrm { U / m L } )$ .

IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA CVM: A stock solution of OM-MA antigen (CA125) was used to prepare the spiking solutions for studying matrix effects. Three spiking solutions were prepared from stock solution. Each spiking solution was spiked into Bovine protein/buffer matrix and patient sample (1 part spiking solution to 19 parts matrix or sample) to generate three sets of spiked samples (concentrations at $6 2 7 \mathrm { U / m L }$ , $1 { , } 2 0 7 \mathrm { U / m L }$ and $2 { , } 4 0 8 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ ).

The spiked AFP, BR-MA and OM-MA samples were run in their respective assays on IMMULITE 2000 platform. The $\%$ recovery of antigen in the spiked matrix was compared to the $\%$ recovery in the spiked patient sample. Each of the tested samples met the acceptance criteria: the grand mean of the recoveries must be within $1 0 0 \% \pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected value with no mean recovery being more than $1 0 0 \% \pm 1 5 \%$ .
