Predicate Device: Device Name: Dimension Clinical Chemistry Triglycerides FLEX reagent cartridge Common Name: Dimension Clinical Chemistry Triglycerides reagent 510(k) Number: k010871 Panel: Clinical Chemistry Manufacturer Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc.

# Intended Use:

The ADVIA $\mathfrak { B }$ Chemistry Triglycerides_2 assay (TRIG_2) is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative measurement triglycerides in human serum and plasma on the ADVIA $\mathfrak { D }$ Chemistry systems. Measurements of triglycerides are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid metabolism, or various endocrine disorders.

8.Indications for Use: Same as Intended Use

# Device Description:

The Triglyceride_2 reagent is a ready-to-use liquid reagent packaged for use on the automated ADVIA 1800 Chemistry system. It is supplied as a 358 tests/wedge, 4 wedges/kit with a $3 8 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ fill in a $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ wedge size.

Existing Siemens Set-Point Chemistry calibrator (classified under CFR 862.1150 - calibrator, multi-analyte mixture, product code JlX), cleared under 510k k030169, is used to calibrate the assay on the ADVIA Chemistry systems.

# 10. Test Principle:

The Triglycerides method is based on the Fossati three-step enzymatic reaction with a Trinder endpoint. The single-reagent procedure measures the concentrations of the total triglycerides including mono and diglycerides and the free glycerol fractions. The triglycerides are converted to glycerol and free fatty acids by lipase. The glycerol is then converted to glycerol-3-phosphate by glycerol kinase followed by its conversion by glycerol3-phosphate-oxidase to hydrogen peroxide. A colored complex is formed from hydrogen peroxide, 4-aminophenazone and 4-chlorophenol under the catalytic influence of peroxidase. The absorbance of the complex is measured as an endpoint reaction at $5 0 5 / 6 9 4 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .

# 2. Linearity/assay reportable range

A linearity study across the entire assay measuring range was assessed on ADVIA 1800 Chemistry system using low and high serum pools. The low and high pools were mixed to make nine (9) intermediate levels and additional 3 levels at the low end of the assay. All samples were tested on the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry analyzer and the observed values were compared to the expected values. Linear/measuring range of the assay is 10 to $5 5 0 m \mathrm { g / d L }$ EMPY with a deviation from linearity of $\leq 5 \%$ The low end of the assay range is calculated based on the Limit of Quantitation. The high end of the assay range is based on the linearity calculations.

# 3. Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection, Limit of Quantitation

The estimations of the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were performed according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures. The LoB for the ADVIA Chemistry TRIG_2 assay on ADVIA 1 800 Chemistry system is $5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The Limit of Detection (LoD) is the smallest amount that this assay can reliably detect to determine presence or absence of an analyte. The LoD for ADVIA Chemistry TRIG_2 assay on ADVIA 1800 Chemistry system is $8 \ m g / \mathrm { d L }$ . LoB and LoD values are determined with proportions of false positives (a) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives () less than $5 \%$ , based on 320 determinations with 160 blank and 160 low-level sample replicates. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ EMP

# 4. Method comparison with predicate device

The performance of the ADVIA Chemistry Triglycerides_2 assay (y) for serum samples on ADVIA 1800 Chemistry system was compared with the performance of the predicate device. One hundred and one (101) serum samples with triglycerides concentrations throughout the. range of the assay were tested. The results calculated using least squares linear regression (1st replicate) are as follows:

# 6. Analytical specificity

Interferences from icterus, hemolysis, ascorbic acid were evaluated in the ADVIA Chemistry TRIG_2 assay on ADVIA Chemistry 1800 system using a significance criterion of $> 1 0 \%$ bias. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $1 0 \%$ is considered interference.
