# Traceability:

The IMMULITE Total T3 CVMs are traceable to internal assigned reference calibrators prepared using Total T3 antigen stock solution and are traceable to internal material which is gravimetrically prepared.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE Total T3 CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 6 level Total T3 calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Total T3 reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The assigned reference calibrators are prepared using Total T3 antigen stock and are traceable to internal material which has been gravimetrically prepared. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges. Two tri-level commercially available controls, and 25 patient samples (5 normal patients samples and 20 patient panel samples) are used to validate CVM value assignments.

# Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested for a total of 27 replicates; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run, 6 different reagent kit lots and 8 IMMULITE 2000 systems. The Guideline Range (95% confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and ± 2 Standard Deviation (SD). The target values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration verification Material lotspecific value card. The expected assay range is 40-600 ng/dL. The target values in Table 4 can be considered as guidelines.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE® 2000 TBG CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 7 level TBG calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of TBG reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. Two levels of commercially available controls, and 30 patient samples (5 spiked normal patients samples and 25 patient panel samples) are used to validate CVM value assignments. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples. spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges

# Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:

The TBG CVMs were tested on 15 replicates in total comprised of 5 runs and 3 replicates per run, 4 IMMULITE 2000 systems and 4 different reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values.
