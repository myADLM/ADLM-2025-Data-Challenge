# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The JM-105 Jaundice Meter is a non-invasive transcutaneous bilirubinometer. It measures yellowness of subcutaneous tissue in newborn infants. The unit provides a visual digital measurement that has been shown to correlate with serum bilirubin in newborn infants.

The JM-105 is a portable, hand held, battery powered device that includes a docking station with a built in reading checker. The JM-105 batteries can be charged using a battery charger or an optional USB cable.

The JM-105 is a modification of the JM-103 Jaundice Meter. The basic functionality including measurement of the JM-105 is equivalent to the JM-103. The display of the JM-105 has been improved (larger screen, touchscreen) and data storage and transmission functionality was added. The measuring probe, hardware, and software used to process the measurements are identical and therefore use the same measuring principle. Both JM103 and JM-105 determine the yellowness of subcutaneous tissue by using two optical paths to measure the optical density difference at two wavelengths.

The meter contains a “reading checker” to monitor sufficient light output.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The transcutaneous bilirubin absorbs blue and green light. The Jaundice Meter determines the yellowness of the subcutaneous tissue by measuring the difference in the optical densities for light in the blue $( 4 5 0 \mathrm { n m } )$ and green $( 5 5 0 \mathrm { n m } )$ wavelength regions. When the measuring probe is pressed against the sternum or forehead of the infant, the built-in xenon lamp flashes. The light from the xenon lamp passes through the glass fiber and illuminates the skin. The light scatters and is absorbed in the skin and subcutaneous tissue repeatedly, and then finally returns to the sensor side of the glass fiber. The denser the transcutaneous bilirubin, the weaker the reflected blue light. The reflected green light remains unchanged regardless of the density of the bilirubin.

Because the optical density difference shows a linear correlation with the total serum bilirubin concentration, it is converted to the bilirubin concentration and displayed digitally on the device screen.

Measurements must be taken only on the infant’s sternum (at hospital sites or physicians’ offices) or forehead (at hospital sites only) where a sufficient amount of blood is circulated. A possibility exists that the bilirubin in the subcutaneous tissue may measure low for areas with minimal blood flow or areas in which the subcutaneous tissue is subject to keratinization.

Although correlation with serum bilirubin was observed for both sternum and forehead measurements, the clinical studies performed with the Jaundice Meter show consistently better results with measurements taken at the sternum versus the forehead. There is a possibility that this difference may be more pronounced for infants that have been exposed to sunlight, such as infants seen at doctors’ offices. Only sternum measurements were evaluated during the studies conducted at doctors’ offices; correlation of forehead measurements with serum bilirubin has not been evaluated, and the device is not intended for forehead measurements at doctors’ offices.

3. Modes of Operation: Manual method- hand held device.

4. Specimen Identification: Sternum (in hospitals and physician offices) or forehead (in hospitals only) skin of infants $> 3 5$ weeks gestation and $< 1 4$ days of age.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Not applicable. This is a non-invasive test, a transcutaneous measurement with an optical probe.

6. Calibration: Factory calibrated.

7. Quality Control:

The meter contains a “Reading Checker” to monitor sufficient light output. The manufacturer recommends that this be used at least once per day.

# F. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 862.1113, Bilirubin (total and unbound) in the neonate test system

2. Classification: Class I, reserved

3 Product code: MQM

4. Panel: Clinical Chemistry (75)

# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

The Jaundice Meter (JM-105) is a non-invasive transcutaneous bilirubinometer. It measures yellowness of subcutaneous tissue in newborn infants. The unit provides a visual digital measurement that has been shown to correlate with serum bilirubin in newborn infants.

The device is intended for use in hospitals, clinics or doctor’s offices under a physician’s supervision / direction to assist clinicians in monitoring of newborn infants. The device is not intended as a standalone for diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia. It is to be used in conjunction with other clinical signs and laboratory measurements.

Newborn infants whose JM-105 Jaundice Meter test results are indicative of hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated by their physician(s) for appropriate patient management. Specific neonatal patient Bilirubin levels should be confirmed by other methods, such as serum bilirubin, prior to treatment determinations.

The JM 105 is a prescription medical device   
The JM 105 is not intended for home use.   
The JM 105 may only be used at the sternum measurement site for Physician’s office applications.

2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Use only on infants up to 14 days of age.

The Jaundice Meter is indicated for use in neonatal patients born ${ > } 3 5$ weeks gestation who have not undergone exchange transfusion or phototherapy treatment.

Users must be trained prior to using the device.

The device is indicated for forehead and sternum measurements in hospitals, and only sternum measurements in physician’s offices. Forehead measurements in physician’s offices were not tested and may be more prone to uncertainties.

For prescription use only.
