# L. Test Principle:

Medisign Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the glucose in the whole blood sample by using a small electrical current produced by a chemical reaction between the glucose in the blood and glucose oxidase (GOx) on the test strip. This current is proportionally converted to the amount of glucose in the blood sample to display as the blood glucose result. Glucose measurements are reported as plasma equivalents.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Medisign MM1100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and Medisign MM1100 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System are the same except in name and intended use (single- vs. multiple-patient use). Therefore, only one set of performance data is needed.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The repeatability evaluation was performed by adjusting venous blood to 5 glucose levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to 400). All samples were tested on 3 lots of test strips with ten Medisign MM3000 meters. All samples were also tested on the YSI 2300 analyzer to generate the expected values. Results are summarized below:

Within-run precision for glucose:

Between-day precision was evaluated using three levels of glucose control solutions(Level 1, 2, and 3). Each sample was measured in duplicate with three test strip lots and 10 Medisign MM3000 glucose meters. These tests were performed over 10 days, for a total of 300 tests per glucose level. Results are summarized below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using one test strip lot and 9 mixed pools of venous blood samples ranging in glucose concentrations (as measured by YSI) of 19, 45, 88, 168, 233, 345, 470, 535, $6 1 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each level was measured 20 times and the values from the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter were compared with those obtained from YSI 2300. Results from regression analysis:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 9 8 \mathbf { x } - 6 . 2 4 ; \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9
$$

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The Medisign MM3000 and Medisign MM3000 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are traceable to the NIST SRM #917c reference material. The method comparison study was performed using the YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer as the reference method (see Section 2.a. below).

# Test Strip Stability:

Test strip stability was assessed in real time studies. The stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims shelf life stability of 24 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended storage temperatures of $3 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } – 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ RH.

Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:

Value assignment: Three levels of aqueous control solutions (levels 1 to 3) are available for use with the Medisign MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Value assignment for use of the control solutions with the Medisign MM3000 glucose test strips is based on measurements using the YSI 2300. The values for each of the control solutions are assigned by repeat analysis using 25 Medisign test strips per lot of test strips and five Medisign MM3000 glucose meters. The mean, SD and CV are used to establish the acceptable ranges for the test strips. The range for each control solution is provided in the labels of the test strips.

Stability Testing: Stability was assessed using real-time testing for each control solution level. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the shelf life stability claim of 24 months and an open-vial stability claim of 3 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of $4 ^ { \circ } { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 3 9 - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ ).

d. Detection limit:

See linearity study in Section M.1.b above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood with three levels of glucose concentrations (70-100, 140 to 180 and 250 to $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each of these samples was divided into a test group and a control group and each of 19 potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was added to the test group. Each compound was tested at two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations.

Each sample was analyzed 5 times with the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter and the $\%$ difference between the interferent containing sample and the control sample calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as within $\pm 1 0 \%$ difference relative to the control sample. Results are presented in the table below:

The following limitations regarding potential interference are included in the Test Strip Insert:

Interferencecs: Acetaminophen, salicylates, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin c) and other interferent substances in blood at normal/therapeutic concentrations do not significantly affect results, however, abnormally high concentrations in blood may cause inaccurate results.

All test results using MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System showed $\%$ bias within $\pm 1 0 \%$ between the test and control groups for the toxic level of interference substance at two levels $\mathrm { ( 1 4 0 { \sim } 1 8 0 m g / d L }$ , $2 5 0 { \sim } 3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) of

glucose concentration.

# System Accuracy:

To assess system accuracy, results from the Medisign MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, YSI 2300. Capillary samples from 106 participants with glucose concentrations ranging from 36 to $4 3 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested using three test strip lots. To obtain extreme blood glucose concentrations 5 samples $\leq 4 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 5 samples $\geq$ $4 1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were altered. For the altered samples, capillary blood samples were collected with an anticoagulant and incubated to allow glucose to hydrolyse $( \leq 4 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ or the glucose was supplemented $( \geq 4 1 2 )$ . The results relative to YSI are summarized in the tables below:

# User Performance Study:

To assess the performance of the Medisign MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a study with 180 lay user participants, who collected samples at three study locations with three test strip lots. Study participants tested their finger, palm, and forearm. Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter obtained by the lay user against the YSI 2300 reference value. The unaltered capillary blood samples ranged from 54- $4 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by YSI. The results are summarized in the tables below:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ___X____ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes or No X

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No _

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

# 5. Calibration:

The meter identifies the test strip code automatically; therefore, no coding is required by the user. The labeling includes instructions for the user to try another test strip if the code numbers don’t match and to contact Customer Service if the problem persists.

# 6. Quality Control:

Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system. The glucose control solutions are sold separately. Control solution test mode is provided to separate the control solution test results from those produced by whole blood. Control solution test results are not included the calculation for the Days Average result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution results are not included in the averaging results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1) Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the Medisign MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels 30, 42, and $5 5 \%$ spiked with glucose to achieve 6 concentrations ranging from 38 to $5 0 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (38, 99, 190, 313, 396, and $5 0 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each sample was then tested 10 times using the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter and the values were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300 analyzer. The $\%$ biases relative to YSI were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 30 to $5 5 \%$ .

2) Altitude study: This study was performed with 5 venous blood samples ranging from 78 to $4 9 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (78, 127, 240, 395, and $4 9 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) using YSI plasma reference method. Testing was performed at altitudes of sea level and 11,480 feet using a chamber to simulate high altitude conditions. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3048 meters) have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter.

3) Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum sample volume requirement. Blood samples were tested at five sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0. 5, 0.6, and $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) and values obtained were compared to YSI values. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$

4) Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples at 3 glucose concentrations to evaluate temperatures ranging from $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and relative humidity from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ . Meter results were compared to YSI values. Six temperature and

humidity combinations were tested including $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at $10 \%$ and $90 \%$ RH, $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at $10 \%$ and $90 \%$ RH and $4 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ at $10 \%$ and $90 \%$ RH. No significant effect (relative to YSI) was observed with the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 39 to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (10 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) with relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ .

5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single-patient (MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System) andmultiple-patient (MM3000 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System) use. Disinfection efficacy testing on the surface materials of the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrated complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Disinfecting Towelettes with EPA number 46781-8. Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 11,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

6) EMC testing was evaluated and certified by ONETECH Corp. and Verification of Compliance certificates provided.

7) A readability assessment was provided to demonstrate that the User Manual, test strip package insert and control solution package insert were each written at the $8 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade level.

8) Customer service is available 24 hours a day/7 days a week/365 day a year by calling 1-888-885-6677.
