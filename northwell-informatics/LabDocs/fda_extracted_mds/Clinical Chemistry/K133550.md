VALIDATE® Chem 6:Calibration Verification/ Linearity Test Kit Maine Standards Company LLC, Cumberland Foreside, ME 04110. 510(k) Number. K013119

Candidate Device description. Each VALIDATE® FERRITIN Calibration Verification/ Linearity Test Kit contains purified chemicals in a human serum base Five liquid levels, 3.0mL each, ranging from 0.5 to 2000 ng/mL typical values, are provided to establish the relationship between theoretical and actual performance of the included analyte:ferritin. Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test kit was tested at the donor level using FDA approved methods and was found to be non-reactive for HBsAG and to antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2. 1:

Intened usVALIATE FERRITI Calibration Verification/ LineartyTes i solutions are intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of linearity; calibration verification and verification of reportable range for the following analyte, ferritin, on automated instrument systems. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays on the indicated analyzers specified in the labeling.

# Value Assignment

VALIDATE® FERRITIN Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kits are manufactured such that a equal relationship exists among Levels 1 through 5; Level 1 being the lowest concentration and Level:5 being the highest. Levels 1 and 5 are prepared inidependently by the addition of ferritin to a human serum base.Specific recovery targets for Levels and 5 are determined by the upper and lower detection limits for the intended analyzers. Intermediate Levels 2, 3 and 4 are subsequently prepared from Levels 1 and 5 by equal part dilutions following EP6-A guidelines. Typical value ranges are provided in the package insert. Typical value ranges for the each level of the linearity set on representative Roche Cobas 6000 and Beckman Access instruments are summarized in the table below.. L

The VALIDATE® FERRITIN Calibration Verification /Lnearity Test Kit is tested on an analyzer to confirm adequate recovery across all levels. Levels 1 through 5 must meet specified ferritin target ranges at ll stages of testing

The quantitative determination of linearity, calibration verification, and verfication of reportable range relies on the known relationship between each of the levels of the product (in this case equal deltas as outlined in the CLSi EP6A referenced standard) not n expeced vals such, e pouct s  t imited to particular instn sytmExpeed target values ay chan ependnn instrutio methodoloav and assay temnerature

This product is traceable to a reference standard based on the automated instrument platform it is used on. The traceability of our product will be established per the respective end user automated instrument calibrator traceability reference statement.

# Stability

Stability testing was performed using Beckman Coulter® Access II and Roche COBAS 6000 instrument systems. The study testing time points included date of manufacture DOM), followed by testing at specific intervals post manufacture. The last testing event is one month post-expiration. Acceptance criteria are defined as 90 to 110% of DOM value for product levels 2-5.

A freeze/thaw stability assessment was also conducted in support of the product package insert (IFU) four (4) freeze/thaw events claim. All product levels tested within the 90 to 110% of control acceptance criteria limits after 6 freeze/thaw events.

Shelf Life Claim Stability of the VALIDATE®FERRITIN Calibration Verification /Linearity Test Kit was set at 12 months based on real-time open vial studies as a worst case scenario. The recommended storage temperature is 10 to 25°C All supporting data is retained on file at Maine Standards Company LLC.

# Linearity

Linearity testing was carried out on DOM through Day 431 with the candidate device VALIDATE® FERRITIN.Calibration Verification / Lineanty Test Kits using a Roche® Cobas 6000 Chemistry Analyzer and Beckman-Coulter® Access Il Immunochemistry Analyzer (instrument of manufacture). Product lineanity performance was demonstrated for 431 days (14 monthis) for both automated systems. All supporting data is retained on file at Maine Standards Company LLC.

# G. Conclusion:

Based upon the purpose of the device, the descriptions and labeling of the predicate device, the VALIDATE® FERRITIN Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit behaves substantially equivalent to the predicate for the evaluation of calibration verification verification of reportable range. The product is substantialy equivalent to the predicate device k013119.
