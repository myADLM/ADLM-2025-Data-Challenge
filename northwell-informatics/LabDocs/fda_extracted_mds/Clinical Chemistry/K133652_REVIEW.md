# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The study was performed using three lots of the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit, three operators, and three GSP instruments in 54 runs on 21 operating days using 7 dried blood spot samples. The samples PS2-PS7 were prepared by spiking galactose and galactose-1-phosphate with equimolar concentrations into heparinized whole blood. In PS1 washed human red blood cell concentrate was used to minimize endogenous total galactose. The hematocrit value of the blood used in the sample preparation was adjusted to $40 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \ \%$ and dried blood spots were prepared. The precision of GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit were calculated with a full calibration curve in duplicate for each plate. Two plates were used with 4 replicates of each sample tested. Precision results are summarized in the tables below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The claimed measuring range for the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit is 1.15 – 50 mg/dL based on the Limit of Quantitation (see d. below) and Linearity studies.

The linearity was assessed in this study following the principles described in CLSI EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. The study used one kit lot and one GSP instrument. A full calibration curve in duplicate was included in the plate. Each sample and control were measured in four replicates, the samples were positioned in a random order on the plate.

The samples used were dried blood spot specimens prepared from heparinized whole blood. Blood drawn from one apparently healthy adult represented a “high activity” sample. The hematocrit value of the blood was adjusted to $40 \% - 5 5 \%$ to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates. This unspiked blood represented a “low concentration” sample. A part of the blood was separated and equimolar concentrations of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate were added to obtain a “high concentration” total galactose sample. Samples with intermediate concentrations were prepared by mixing the “low concentration” TGAL sample with the “high concentration” sample.

A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis.

The significance of the second and third order polynomials were evaluated by performing a t-test. The regression analysis results showed that the second order polynomial had statistically significant non-linear terms (β2). Thus, the second order model was compared with the linear model.

The measured TGAL concentrations are compared to the expected concentrations. A regression analysis was performed (measured vs. expected TGAL concentration), the fitted regression model is:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 6 \mathbf { x } - 1 . 1 1 \ ( \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 )
$$

where $\mathbf { y } =$ Measured TGAL concentration $\mathrm { ( m g / d L ) }$ and $\mathbf { X } =$ Expected TGAL concentration $\mathrm { ( m g / d L ) }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: There is no available internationally accepted reference material or a reference method for total galactose. The calibration of the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit has been traceable to the in-house reference calibrator series (primary calibrators). The reference calibrator series include six levels, A-F, as dried blood spots on filter paper. The reference calibrators have been manufactured using adult human blood (endogenous biotinidase activity in serum) and washed red blood cells as blood matrices.

Value assignment: The in-house reference materials of the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit include primary calibrators, secondary calibrators, level calibrators 1-4, QA controls Low and High “component” stage calibrators (Component Calibrators) and controls (Component QC) and, final “kit configuration” or combination assignment of the kit calibrators (Kit Cals) and kit controls (Kit QC). The primary calibrators are used to monitor the level of secondary calibrators and level calibrators. An initial primary calibrator lot is prepared adding gravimetrically determined amounts of Galactose to human red blood cell matrix (washed red blood cell concentrate in sucrose solution). The final concentrations of the manufactured GSP Neonatal Total Galactose primary calibrators are based on gravimetrically determined amounts of added galactose taking into account the endogenous level of the blood suspension. Kit calibrators and controls are value-assigned using an internal procedure, with testing using multiple replicates on multiple instruments

Kit calibrator contains 6 levels of calibrators: $\mathrm { A } - 0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $\mathrm { B } - 2 . 5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } ,$ , $\mathrm { C } - 5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $\mathrm { D - 1 0 . 0 \ m g / d L }$ , $\mathrm { E } - 2 0 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , and $\mathrm { F } - 5 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Kit control contains 2 levels of controls: Level $1 { = } 4 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Level $\scriptstyle 2 = 1 2 . 0 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ .

Stability: The results of the accelerated and real time stability studies support a shelf life of at least 12 months for all components of GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit, when stored at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Assay Reagent 1, Assay Reagent 2, Assay Buffer, Reconstitution Solution and Extraction Solution) or at $- 3 0$ to $- 1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (kit calibrators and controls). After opening, the Kit Calibrators and Controls should be stable at 2 to $8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 7 days. Neonatal Extraction Solution can be stored on-board in the reagent storage carousel of the GSP instrument for up to 14 days. Assay Reagent 1, Assay Reagent 2 and Assay Buffer can be stored on-board in the reagent storage carousel of the GSP instrument for up to 7 days. Microplates with punched calibrators and controls in wells can be stored on-board in the GSP instrument plate storage for 12 hours.

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for stability testing has been reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Sample stability: The objective of this sample stability study was to determine the short term stability of dried blood spot specimens spiked with galactose and/or galactose-1-phosphate. The test was performed using different storage conditions.

The sample stability study was performed using one GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit lot and two GSP instruments. At the zero time point each sample was analyzed in 16 replicates (4 replicates per plate) and in the other 5 time points (1, 5, 7, 9, and 14 days) each sample was analyzed in 8 replicates (4 replicates per plate).

The nine samples were dried blood spot specimens prepared from heparinized human whole blood spiked with either a.) galactose b.) galactose-1-phosphate or c.) equal molar concentrations of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate. The zero time point samples were analyzed immediately after the overnight drying while the samples for the other 5 time points were stored after the overnight drying in various storage conditions. The sample stability is better at 2 to $8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ than $2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , if samples are protected from moisture.

# d. Detection limit:

The objective of the study was to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit. The analysis of the LoB, LoD and LoQ were performed in accordance with CLSI document EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline.

The LoB study was performed using two lots, the LoQ / LoD study was performed using three lots of the GSP TGAL kit and three GSP instruments.

Limit of the Blank (LoB): The samples for LoB study were dried blood spots specimens prepared from washed red blood cells in sodium chloride-sucrose solution. The samples were subjected to short term stressful environmental conditions to

decrease the endogenous total galactose concentrations of the samples and stored long term in $- 1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The hematocrit value was adjusted to $40 \%$ and dried blood spots were prepared.

The samples were measured with two GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit lots using two GSP instruments. Each plate included a full calibration curve in duplicate and the results were analyzed using a plate specific calibration curve. LoB was calculated based on 150 repeated measurements of five blank samples per one kit lot. Specifically, repeated measurements $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } = 6 0 /$ sample) were carried out for the blank (analyte free) dried blood spot samples on filter paper. The Kit Controls Low and High, in quadruplicates $( \mathtt { n } = 4 )$ , were included in each plate and used for run acceptance. The five LoB samples were assayed with six replicates in ten separate runs performed over five operating days.

The LoB for total galactose is $0 . 3 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $1 9 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , defined as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of a distribution of blank samples.

Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The samples for the LoD/LoQ study were prepared from washed human red blood cells in sodium chloride-sucrose solution by spiking with equimolar galactose and galactose-1- phosphate. The hematocrit value was adjusted to $40 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \%$ to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates. The LoD/LoQ samples were spotted on to Whatman 903 filter paper $7 5 \mu \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { s p o t } )$ , dried overnight at room temperature in a fume hood and stored at $- 1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in sealed bags with desiccant. The LoD/LoQ samples were measured with three GSP Total Galactose kit lots using three GSP instruments. Repeated measurements $( \mathtt { n } = 2 1 6 )$ were carried out using four low level DBS. Each plate included a full calibration curve in duplicate and the results were analyzed using a plate-specific calibration curve and a calibration curve for the batch of two plates. The Kit Controls Low and High in quadruplicate $( \mathtt { n } = 4 )$ ) were included in each plate and used for run acceptance. Altogether 27 runs were assayed during 20 operating days using three GSP instruments and three GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit lots.

The LoQ is $1 . 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 6 4 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , defined as the lowest concentration with a total CV equal to or less than $20 \%$ .

The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of the device is $1 . 1 5 - 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of potential interfering substances in dried blood spot samples on the measurement of GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit. The interference study was performed in accordance with the principles described in CLSI Guideline EP7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline. The study used one kit lot and one GSP instrument.

The samples were dried blood spot specimens prepared from heparinized whole blood spiked with equimolar concentrations of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate. Three clinically relevant total galactose concentrations (5, 10 and $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were used. The hematocrit level was adjusted to $40 \%$ to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates. The control pools were prepared adding equal volume of solvent (without the interfering substances) to the base pool as was added to create the test pools. A paired-difference test was performed for the potential interfering substances. Both test and control pools were analyzed within one analytical run with 12 replicates for all substances. A bias exceeding $\pm 1 5 \%$ is considered a significant interference. The tested compounds are listed in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tested substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration with ≤15%interference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acetaminophen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.75 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ampicillin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>152 μmol/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ascorbate</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin (conjugated)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>16.6 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin (unconjugated)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>D-fructose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>D-glucose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1000 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>D-mannose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glutathione</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3 mmol/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HSA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30 mg/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>102 g/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intralipid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NADH</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100 μmol/L</td></tr></table>

The sponsor’s packages insert states:

Intralipid was found not to interfere up to added concentrations of $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at 5 and $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ total galactose; and up to $3 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ total galactose. When present above these amounts Intralipid may cause a false positive screening result for a specimen with measured total galactose concentration close to the cut-off value.

In addition, hemoglobin in combination with elevated bilirubin concentration of 15 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured total galactose concentration (see the table below). Therefore, hemoglobin level at $1 9 8 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ and above in combination with elevated bilirubin level may cause a false positive screening result for a specimen with measured total galactose concentration close to the cut-off value.

Hematocrit levels from $30 \%$ to $6 6 \%$ (Hemoglobin levels $1 0 2 { - } 2 3 0 \ \mathrm { g / L } \rangle$ ) were found not to interfere at total galactose concentrations of 5, 10 and $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate device (GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit) to the predicate device (Neonatal Total Galactose kit). A total of 141dried blood spot specimens, including newborn patient routine sample and adult whole blood dried specimens spiked with galactose and galactose-1- phosphate were used in the study analysis. The weighted Deming regression of the data yields the following equation:

$\mathrm { y } = 1 . 1 6 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 4 9$ ; $9 5 \%$ CI: slope (1.07; 1.26), intercept (-0.73; -0.25), $\mathrm { N } { = } 1 4 1$

The slope showed an approximate bias of $1 6 \%$ between the candidate device and the predicate device; however, the purpose of this device modification was adjust the calibration to better align with the CDC reference sample concentration target levels. Therefore, test results from the candidate device do not, and are not expected to, directly correlate with test results from the predicate device.

A clinical study (see Section M.3.c below) was conducted to evaluate the screening performance between the candidate device and the predicate device using their respective cut-offs values. The screening performance of both devices is similar (see tables below) and found to be acceptable. The clinical screening performance, not the method comparison results, was the basis of the substantial equivalence determination.

b. Matrix comparison:

Not applicable. This assay only uses neonatal dried blood spots on filter paper.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Screening study at state public health laboratory: A study to evaluate the screening performance of the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit compared to the predicate device was conducted at a U.S. state public health laboratory that routinely performs newborn screening. The sample results for six retrospective samples from newborns diagnosed with Galactosemia and 2159 leftover routine newborn samples were included in the study. Two GSP instruments and one kit lot of the new device were used.

All the assayed specimens, i.e. the routine specimens and retrospective confirmed galactosemia positive specimens, were classified as screen positive or screen negative based on the measured galactose concentrations. The classification was performed using $9 9 . 5 \%$ , $9 9 . 0 \%$ and $9 5 . 0 \%$ percentile based cutoffs (see values in the table below).
