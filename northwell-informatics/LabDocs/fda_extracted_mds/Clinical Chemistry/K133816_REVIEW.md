L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE Free PSA CVMs are traceable to the WHO NIBSC $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ International Standard 96/668 through internal reference calibrators.

# Value Assignment:

IMMULITE $\textcircled{8}$ CVMs are value assigned using approved reference calibrators lot manufactured with qualified materials and measurement procedures. Each level of CVM was tested in six runs, three replicates per run for a total of 18 replicates using two different kit lots on four instruments. The values are assigned using a curve of assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm 2$ Standard Deviation (SD). The values in the table below are example of the target range for each CVM level for the lot tested.

Value assignment is lot specific. Each lot of CVM quality control is tested for verification by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and normal male samples and controls using the assigned value. The controls must fall within their target ranges.

# Stability:

The stability studies were conducted to validate shelf life claim for the IMMULITE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Free PSA CVM on IMMULITE 2000 platforms. The CVMs are run as part of the calibrator stability testing. The CVMs are run in duplicates and the concentration value is determined from the reference internal material. One lot was tested for 42 months. Two additional lots were tested for six months. For all studies there is percent recovery of more than $90 \%$ . The claimed CVM stability is 6 months when stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ prior to opening, and for 8 hours at ambient temperature (room temperature) after opening. Each CVM is for single use only. Real time stability is ongoing.
