Lyphochek Specialty Immunoassay Control is intended for use as an assayed quality control serum to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analytes listed in this package insert.

# 5.0 Description of Device

Lyphochek Specialty Immunoassay Control is prepared from human serum with added chemicals, stabilizers, and preservatives. The control is provided in lyophilized form and contains the following analytes:

Erythropoietin (EPO)   
Procalcitonin   
Intact Parathyroid Hormone (Intact PTH)   
Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

# 6.0 Value Assignment

The mean values and the corresponding $\pm 3 5 0$ ranges indicated on the control value sheet provided for Lyphockek Specialty Control were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for each lot of product. The tests listed on the control value sheet were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of the lot of product. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own acceptable ranges and use those provided only as guides. Laboratory established ranges may vary from those listed during the life of this control. Variations over time and between laboratories may be caused by differences in laboratory technique, instrumentation and reagents, or by manufacturer test method modifications.

# 7.0 Comparison of the new device with the Predicate Device

Real time stability studies were performed to establish reconstituted/open vial stability and frozen aliquot stability. Accelerated stability studies were performed for establishing follows:

Reconstituted Vial Stability:

Intact Parathyroid Hormone (Intact PTH): 12 days at $2 \circ \circ$ to $8 \cdot C$ Procalcitonin: 3 days at $\curvearrowright$ to $8 \%$   
Erythropoietin (EPO), Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) and Vitamin D: 30 days at 2 to $8 \div C$

Frozen Aliquot Stability:

30 days at $\tt { - 2 0 \circ } \tt { C }$ to $\yen 70 °$

Shelf Life Stability:

36 Months at 2 to $8 \circ C$

# 9.0 Conclusion

Based on the performance characteristics indicated above, Lyphochek Specialty Immunoassay Control is substantially equivalent to the predicate device (k043108)?

Dear Ms. Parsons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.
