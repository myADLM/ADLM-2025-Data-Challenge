# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Value assignment: The mean values and the corresponding $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ ranges printed in this insert were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for this lot of

product. The tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of this lot of product. The sponsor recommends that each laboratory establish its own acceptable ranges and the values provided be used only as guides.

Stability: The sponsor’s unopened, lyophilized shelf-life and reconstituted open-vial stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Shelf-life stability studies: Accelerated stability studies: control materials were stored at three different elevated temperatures then periodically reconstituted and tested against vials stored under normal conditions $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Accelerated stability study model and data supports shelf life claim of 37 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage. Real time testing is ongoing.

Open-vial stability studies: the reconstituted controls were tested at periodic intervals at day 0, 3, 28 and 35. The results support the claim of 28 days open vial stability when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

# 5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
