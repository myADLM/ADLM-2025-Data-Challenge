# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

There is no international standard available for CA 125. The Elecsys CA 125 II assay has been standardized against the Boehringer Mannheim Enzymun Test CA 125 II method. This in turn was standardized against the CA 125 II RIA from Fujirebio Diagnostics.

# Value Assignment:

For each Elecsys CA 125 II CalSet II manufactured, the calibrators are run in duplicate on at least three (3) cobas e 411 analyzers and at least three (3) Modular Analytics E170 analyzers with all the CA 125 II assay reagent lots available at that time using the master calibrators as the reference values. The assigned value of each calibrator is defined as the median value obtained over at least six (6) runs on at least three (3) analyzers of the respective calibrator.

The target value and target range for CA 125 II CalSet II is shown in the following table:

Stability:

Stability studies were performed on cobas e 411 in order to verify the stability claims for the Elecsys CA 125 II CalSet II. For each study, both the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate and the acceptance criteria that the value for test material is within $9 3 - 1 0 7 \%$ of the reference value.

Open vial (after reconstitution) stability: Stability of the Elecsys CA 125 II CalSet II after reconstitution was evaluated. The test materials were reconstituted and kept in closed vials at storage condition: $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 15 weeks, and -15 to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 21 weeks (with or without freeze/thaw cycles). A freshly reconstituted CalSet was used as the reference material for the study. The results support the following stability claim for the reconstituted CA 125 II CalSet: 12 weeks at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 20 weeks at -15 to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with one freeze/thaw cycle.

Open vial/On-board stability: The test material was reconstituted and tested when stored at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for six hours in open vial. A freshly reconstituted set of CalSet II was used as reference. The results support the claimed stability: CA 125 II CalSet II is stable up to five hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

According to the sponsor, the reconstituted calibrators should only be left on the Elecsys 2012 and cobas e 411 analyzers during calibration at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After use, close the bottles as soon as possible and store upright at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . For MODULAR ANALYTICS, cobas e 601 and cobas e 602 analyzers, CA 125 II CalSet II should only be used once.

Closed vial stability: The stability for the CA 125 II CalSet II was evaluated with both the accelerated and an on-going real-time stability study. For the real time stability study, three lots of test materials are stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Samples at timepoints 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 19, 25, and 31 months are tested and the recovery value is calculated by comparing to the value from the reference material (stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). For the accelerated stability study, the on-test material was stored at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for three weeks; the value of testing material was evaluated by comparing to the value of the reference. The results generated from the on-going real-time stability studies support a claim of 12 months when the CA 125 II CalSet II is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
