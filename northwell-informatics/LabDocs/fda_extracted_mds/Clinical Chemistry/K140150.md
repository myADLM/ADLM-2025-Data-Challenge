Dear Axel Lin:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

# 4. Device Description

The device description of the GL GoodLife Series Blood Glucose Monitoring System is as follows.

GL GoodLife Series Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of:

(1) Glucose Meter (Model no.: AC-300, AC-301, AC-302, AC-303, AC-304, AC-305)

(2) Glucose Test Strips (Model no.: AC) prior 510(k) clearance K113307

GL GoodLife Series Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of:

(1) Glucose Meter (Model no.: AC-300, AC-301, AC-302, AC-303, AC-304, AC-305)

(2) Glucose Test Strips (Model no.: AC) prior 510(k) clearance K113307

(3) Two levels of glucose control solutions (L1 and L2) may be purchased separately. prior 510(k) clearance K113307

(4) Check Strip (5) Instruction for use

These models have the same intended use and technological characteristics except the housing of the meter. Although the different shapes of housing, the materials are the same.

[Test Principle]

GL GoodLife Series Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an electrochemical biosensor system that measures the amount of electric current produced then displays the result as a blood glucose level on the LCD monitor. When the blood is drawn into the blood reaction zone of the test strip, the glucose in the blood sample mixes with a special chemical in the test strip, which produces a small electric current. The reaction current is proportional to the amount of glucose in the blood. The result is displayed on the LCD monitor and automatically stored in the meter for future use.

[Control Solution]

The GL GoodLife Glucose control solution is intended for in vitro diagnostic use (i.e. for external use only) assessing the performance of the GL GoodLife Series Blood Glucose monitoring system and GoodLife Blood Glucose Test strips (AC). There are two levels of controls (L1 and L2).

[Check Strip]

The Check Strip can be used to check that the meter is operating properly. It is composed of PCB, resistor, top cover and bottom cover.

[Device Calibration]

The device is calibrated by implicit coding process. While inserting the test strip into strip slot to perform the blood glucose test, the coding procedure is complete. The meter will apply formula including this parameter of code to calculate the glucose value.
