# L. Test Principle:

The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM720 uses electrochemical methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an amperometric method. The system employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

All performance characteristics were conducted on Rightest Blood Glucose Meter GM720 using the Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strip GS720. Testing performed on the Rightest Blood Glucose Meter GM720 and the Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strip GS720 to characterize performance of both the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM720 and the Rightest Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM720 is adequate since both meters and the respective test strips are identical.

# Intermediate Precision

Intermediate precision was evaluated using three lots of test strips and ten meters. Glucose control solutions in three concentration ranges were used (low range: $4 6 . 5 { \sim } 5 1 . 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , mid-range: $9 5 { \sim } 1 0 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and high range: $2 8 5 { \sim } 3 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Each control solution was measured 10 times, on three test strip lots over 10 days, so that 100 individual measurements were generated (300 measurements per glucose level).

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using 15 venous blood glucose samples to cover the 20-600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ measuring range. Glucose concentrations according to the reference method were as follows: 0, 17.7, 23.7, 54.1, 116.5, 149.5, 215.0, 260.5, 318.5, 352.5, 410.0, 476.5, 506.5, 542.5, $6 1 7 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each glucose level was measured in triplicate on 3 lots. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot compared to the YSI resulted in:

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for this device. Data from bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a sample is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as LO and if a sample result exceeds $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as HI.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

1. Traceability

The system is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b, dry D-glucose, reference material.

# 2. Stability

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strips GS720 were previously reviewed in k110737. The manufacturer claims shelf life stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 4 months at the recommended storage temperatures of $3 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ with $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity.

Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:

Value assignment was established for the Rightest Control Solutions Level 1, 2 and 4 in k110737.

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were previously reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the shelf life stability claim of 16 months and an open-vial stability claim of 3 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of $3 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ .

d. Detection limit:

See linearity study in Section M1b above.

e. Analytical specificity:

To assess potential interference the sponsor used three test strip lots to evaluate two glucose concentration intervals (60-100 and $1 5 0 { - } 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ in order to analyze 19 substances tested at a therapeutic and a toxic level. . Glucose values measured with Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System at test conditions were compared with values measured at control condition (without interferent).

# User performance study

Fingerstick, palm, and forearm: The user performance study was performed to compare the lay user self-test results and the YSI method. Study was performed at multiple clinical sites with 165 subjects self-testing using the fingertip and palm and 164 subjects self-testing for the forearm. The study participants were provided with the User’s Manual in English, and performed fingerstick, palm, and forearm tests on their own. A technician collected capillary blood from each participant for measurement on YSI. The range of glucose values for the finger stick samples was $5 4 - 3 3 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ measured by YSI. Three test strip lots were tested in the study.

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and palm or forearm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action. The professional version of the meter is validated for venous, and arterial blood.

5. Calibration:

There is no calibration required for the blood glucose meter by the user. The meter is automatically coded.

6. Quality Control:

Glucose control solutions at 3 different concentrations can be run with this device. The meter automatically distinguishes control solution from blood and marks control solution tests with a check mark and excludes them from average calculations. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip bottle label and on the bottom of the test strip box. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

# 1. Sample volume study:

Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM720 was tested with venous blood at three glucose concentration intervals (40-60, 80-120, and $3 0 0 { - } 3 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) and nine specimen volumes. For each glucose interval, the specimen volumes were adjusted to 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, 2.00, and $3 . 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . Each sample was measured in three replicates for each of three test strip lots and same sample was also measured by YSI. The bias for the three replicates in each test strip lot was calculated. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of . $7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

# 2. Altitude Study:

To evaluate the effects of altitude, 3 test strip lots were tested on 3 meters using three whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 50-75, 80-120, and 270-330 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The samples were tested at 3281 ft, 6562 ft and 10,000 ft above sea level and at sea level (0 feet) as a control. Results obtained were compared with those obtained with the reference method (YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 ft have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the Rightest GM720 glucose meter.

# 3. Hematocrit Study:

The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM720 was tested with venous blood at six glucose concentrations (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330 and 360-440 $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . For each glucose concentration interval, the hematocrit levels were adjusted to 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 55, 60, 65 and $70 \%$ . Each sample was measured in replicates of five on three test strip lots. Results were compared to YSI. The $\%$ bias relative to YSI demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of $2 0 -$ $65 \%$ .

# 4. Test System operating conditions:

Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures ranging from $4 2 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 1 1 1 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and relative humidity from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ including extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, e.g. lowest humidity with lowest and highest temperature and highest humidity with lowest and highest temperature. Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The results supported the Sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from $4 2 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 1 1 1 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and relative humidity range from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ .

# 5. Readability Assessment:

The readability of the labeling (user guide, quick reference guide and test strip insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis were found to be written at the 8th grade level.

During the lay user study described above in Section M.3.c, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that they could successfully perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.

# 6. EMC Testing:

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed using IEC 60601-1-2; Medical electrical equipment- Part l2: General requirements for safety - Collateral standard : Electromagnetic compatibility - Requirements and tests.

# 7. Infection Control Studies:

The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen $\left( { \mathrm { H B s A g } } \right)$ with the chosen disinfectant, Discide $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ultra disinfecting towelettes, EPA Reg. # 10492-4. Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 12000 cleanings and 12000 disinfection steps with the 24000 wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
