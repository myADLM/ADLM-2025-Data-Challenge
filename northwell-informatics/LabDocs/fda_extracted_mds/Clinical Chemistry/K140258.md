# 7.2 Traceability:

The IMMULITE DHEA- $\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ CVMs are traceable to an internal material which has been gravimetrically prepared. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# 7.3 Value Assignment:

DHEA $\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subsct of 7 level DHEA- $S O _ { 4 }$ calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of DHEA-SO4 reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned refcrence calibrators. Thc assigncd reference calibrators are prepared using DHEA-SO4 antigen stock and are traceable to an internal material which has been gravimetrically prepared. Six lcvels of commercially available controls and 30 normal serum samples were used to validate calibrator/CvM value assignments.

The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The DHEA-SO4 CVMs were tested on 27 rcplicates in total comprised of 9 runs, 3 replicates per run, on 9 systems and 4 differcnt reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on cach instrument independently. CVM values are then averagcd across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges.

# 7.2 Traceability:

The IMMULITE Intact PTH CVMs are traceable to intermal material which has becn gravimetrically prepared. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# 7.3 Value Assignment:

Intact PTH CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 9 level Intact PTH calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Intact PTH reagents and two point adjustors.

The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The assigned reference calibrators are prepared synthetic Human Intact PTH (1-84) spiked in the buffered bovine protein matrix. Two levels of commercially available controls and 88 samples (32 EDTA plasma, 32 serum, 12 EDTA dialysis samples and serum dialysis samples) are used to validate calibrator/CVM value assignments.

The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs were tested on 27 replicates in total comprised of 9 runs, 7 systems and 3 different reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges.

# 7.4 Expected Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested on 27 replicates in total comprised of 9 runs, 7 systems and 3 different reagent kit lots. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm 2$ Standard Deviation (SD). The expected values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration Verification Material lotspecific package insert. The expected assay range is $1 { - } 2 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The target values in Table 4 can be considered as guidelines.
