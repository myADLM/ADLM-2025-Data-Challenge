# I. Device Description:

The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of galectin-3 in human serum or EDTA plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex.

In the first step, sample and M3/38 anti-galectin-3 coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. Galectin-3 present in the sample binds to the anti-galecin-3 coated microparticles. After washing, 87B5 anti-galectin-3 acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).

A direct relationship exists between the amount of galectin-3 in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics. The kit is composed of the following:

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Data were generated using the ARCHITECT $j$ 2000SR System with the STAT protocol.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Precision

The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay is designed to have an imprecision of $\leq 1 0 \%$ Total CV for samples with galectin-3 concentrations ranging from 4.0 to $1 1 4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

A study was performed based on guidance from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) document EP5-A2. Testing was conducted using one (1) lot of ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Reagents, Calibrators, and Controls, and one (1) ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \tt S R }$ instrument. Three (3) levels of controls and five (5) levels of human serum and plasma panels were assayed with a minimum of two (2) replicates at two (2) separate times per day for twenty (20) different days. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study.

The precision analyses determined that the total precision for one (1) lot individually is $\leq 5 . 8 \%$ for all samples in this study.

# System Reproducibility

A study was performed based on guidance from the NCCLS document EP5-A2. Testing was conducted using two (2) lots of ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Reagents, Calibrators, and Controls on two (2) different ARCHITECT i 2000SR instruments. Each reagent lot was matched with a different lot of calibrators and controls. Three (3) levels of controls and five (5) levels of human serum and plasma panels were assayed with a minimum of two (2) replicates at two (2) separate times per day for ten (10) different days for a total of forty (40) replicates for each lot. Each reagent lot used a single calibration curve throughout the study.

The precision analyses determined that the total reproducibility for two (2) lots is $\leq 4 . 7 \%$ for all samples in this study.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A study was performed based on guidance from the CLSI document EP6-A. Two (2) serum samples (one low and one high for galectin-3 levels) and two (2) plasma samples (one low and one high for galectin-3 levels) were used for this study.

The high serum and high plasma samples were diluted with their respective low sample. The neat and diluted panels were tested in replicates of three (3) using the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay on the ARCHITECT i2000SR System in STAT mode.

Based on a $+ / - 1 0 \%$ deviation from linearity $( \% \mathsf { D L } )$ , the data supports a linear range of 5.5 to $1 0 3 . 1 ~ \mathrm { \mathsf { n g / m L } }$ for the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Calibrators are for the calibration of the ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination of galectin-3 antigen in human serum and EDTA plasma. 6 Bottles $( 4 . 0 \ \mathsf { m L }$ each) are supplied for the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Calibrators. Calibrators A through F are prepared with artificial matrix. Calibrators B through F contain recombinant human galectin-3. Preservatives: EDTA and ProClin 950. The calibrators are at the following concentrations:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Calibrator</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration(ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CAL A</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CAL B</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CAL C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CAL D</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CALE</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>68.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CAL F</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>114.0</td></tr></table>

There is currently no known internationally recognized consensus reference method or reference material for standardization. Galectin-3 assay values are expressed as $\mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ . This value is related to a Fujirebio Diagnostics maintained reference preparation. The primary calibrators for the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay were manufactured gravimetrically and produced based on protein content.

The stability data supports the current shelf life assignment for the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Calibrators of 12 months.

The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Controls are for the verification of the accuracy and precision of the ARCHITECT $j$ System when used for the quantitative determination of galectin-3 in human serum and EDTA plasma. 3 Bottles (8.0 mL each) are supplied for the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Controls. The Low, Medium, and High Controls are prepared with artificial matrix and contain recombinant human galectin-3. Preservatives: EDTA and ProClin 950. The controls are at the following concentrations:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ConcentrationTarget(ng/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ConcentrationRange(ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.4-11.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MediumControl</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14.4-26.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>74.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51.9 -96.3</td></tr></table>

The stability data supports the current shelf life assignment for the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Controls of 12 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay is designed to have a Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of $\leq 4 . 0$ ng/mL. Based on guidance from the CLSI document EP17-A2, a study was performed by diluting 7 normal human serum samples in ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Calibrator A. Two (2) lots of ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Calibrator A (run as the zero-level panel) and Low Level Panel Set were run in replicates of five (5), twice per day over three (3) days on two (2) ARCHITECT i2000SR Systems in STAT mode with two (2) ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay reagent lots $( { \mathsf { N } } =$ $5 { \times } 2 { \times } 3 { \times } 2 { \times } 2 = 1 2 0 \rangle$ .

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) determined for the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay was 1.0 ng/mL, 1.1 ng/mL, and $2 . 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ respectively.

The LoQ met the predetermined acceptance criteria of $\mathsf { L o D } \leq 4 . 0 \ \mathsf { n g / m L }$ . These data support the performance claims of the assay.

# e. Analytical specificity:

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference from other recombinant human galectin and collagen proteins in the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay.

Four (4) serum and four (4) patient plasma samples were used for this study. Three (3) serum samples and two (2) plasma samples were augmented with human galectin-3 antigen targeting a ‘normal’ concentration of galectin-3 ( $1 0 { - } 1 3 ~ \mathrm { \mathsf { n g / m L } } )$ and an elevated concentration of galectin-3 $( { \approx } 2 6 \ \mathrm { \ n g / m L } )$ . The other 3 samples (One (1) serum and two (2) plasma) were at the target concentrations and did not require augmentation. The eight (8) samples were supplemented with the various cross reactants each prepared at a concentration of $1 0 \mu \ g / \mathrm { m L }$ in PBS.

The prepared samples were tested in replicates of three (3) using the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay on the ARCHITECT i2000SR System in STAT mode.

All individual patient samples supplemented with the various human recombinant galectin and collagen proteins resulted in a percent cross reactivity with the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay of $\leq 0 . 3 \%$ and support the performance claims of the assay (below $0 . 5 \%$ ).

A study was performed based on guidance from the CLSI document EP07-A2. Potentially interfering drugs were evaluated to determine whether galectin-3 concentrations were affected when using the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay.

Serum and plasma samples selected based on their endogenous galectin-3 values which fell within or near the galectin-3 target ranges were used in this study. The predetermined galectin3 targets were a ‘normal’ concentration of galectin-3 (10-13 ng/mL) and an elevated concentration near the upper end of the reference range for galectin-3 $( { \approx } 2 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ .

Each galectin-3 sample pool was split into 2 equal aliquots for each therapeutic tested. One aliquot was spiked with the therapeutic agent stock for use as the test sample. The samples were not diluted more than $5 \%$ by the agent.

A study was performed based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP07-A2. Potentially interfering substances were evaluated to determine whether galectin-3 concentrations were affected when using the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay.

Serum and plasma samples selected based on their endogenous galectin-3 values which fell within or near the galectin-3 target ranges were used in this study. The predetermined galectin3 targets were a ‘normal’ concentration of galectin-3 (10-13 ng/mL) and an elevated concentration near the upper end of the reference range for galectin-3 $( { \approx } 2 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ .

Each galectin-3 sample was split into two (2) aliquots for each endogenous substance tested. One (1) aliquot was spiked with an endogenous substance for use as the test sample. One (1) aliquot was spiked with an equal volume of ARCHITECT PBS (phosphate-buffered solution) for use as a control sample. The samples were not diluted more than $20 \%$ by the agent.

The clinical performance of the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay was evaluated in a clinical validation study with specimens from a multicenter cohort of outpatients with chronic heart failure (HF). A total of 405 serum specimens were obtained at time of study entry from patients with varying degrees of chronic HF, encompassing all New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification categories. The median follow-up time for the study population was approximately 652 days.

Of the 405 baseline samples, 143 $( 3 5 . 3 \% )$ were obtained from females and 262 $( 6 4 . 7 \% )$ were obtained from males. The mean subject age was 58 years. The specimens were tested using the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay and categorized based on galectin-3 value as high risk $( > 1 7 . 8 \mathsf { n g / m L } )$ or low risk $( \leq 1 7 . 8 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ ). A total of 226 subjects were in the high risk category and the remaining 179 subjects were in the low risk category. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the association of galectin-3 category with the primary endpoint of hospitalization due to worsening HF, ventricular assist device placement, cardiac transplantation, or all-cause mortality.

The multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was adjusted for the parameters of age, gender, NYHA class, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), diabetes status, and smoking status. The results of the regression model demonstrated a statistically significant higher risk for the occurrence of the primary endpoint in subjects with galectin-3 levels in the high risk category $\mathrm { ( > 1 7 . 8 \ n g / m L ) }$ , compared with galectin-3 levels in the low risk category (< $1 7 . 8 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ .

aadjusted for baseline risk factors: age, gender, NYHA functional classification, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes status, and smoking status. b Hazard ratio is relative to the galectin-3 low risk category $( \leq 1 7 . 8 \ \mathsf { n g / m L } )$

Elevated baseline levels of galectin-3 $( > 1 7 . 8 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ in chronic HF patients were shown to be significantly and independently associated with a higher risk of hospitalization due to worsening HF, ventricular assist device placement, cardiac transplantation, or all-cause mortality (first to occur).

# Interpretation

ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical evaluation as an aid in assessing the prognosis of patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure. In the clinical validation study, chronic heart failure patients with galectin-3 levels over 17.8 ng/mL were found to have a higher risk of adverse outcomes, defined as hospitalization for HF, placement of left ventricular assist device, cardiac transplantation and mortality, when compared to patients with levels below 17.8 ng/mL.

# Interpretation Relative to Natriuretic Peptides

Galectin-3 and natriuretic peptides, such as NT-proBNP and BNP, are measures of separate and distinct biological processes. Galectin-3 and natriuretic peptides provide independent and complementary information on the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.

Elevated baseline levels of both galectin-3 and a natriuretic peptide have been associated with poorer prognosis in chronic heart failure patients, when compared to patients with low baseline levels of both markers. Elevated levels of one or the other marker, but not both, have been associated with a poorer prognosis in chronic heart failure when compared to patients with low levels of both markers, and with a better prognosis when compared to patients with elevated baseline levels of both markers.

The table below illustrates this for N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the clinical validation study by evaluating primary endpoint event rates by categories of galectin-3 and NT-proBNP levels.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

An observational study was performed to determine the reference distribution for the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay. Galectin-3 levels were measured in 274 plasma samples from a population of apparently healthy subjects without known heart disease but that otherwise resemble the heart failure patient population by age and gender distribution.

Specimens were from women between the ages of 60 and 80 years $( \mathsf { n } = 1 3 3 )$ and men between the ages of 55 and 80 $( \mathsf { n } = 1 4 1 )$ ). The reference population consisted of the following race/ethnic groups:

55 African-American  189 Caucasian 12 Hispanic

9 Other  9 Asian

All subjects had detectable galectin-3 levels (minimum - maximum: $6 . 8 - 5 4 . 4 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ within the measuring interval of the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay. The $9 7 . 5 \%$ of the galectin-3 reference population was $2 7 . 5 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The data are summarized in the following table.

<table><tr><td>Percentile (%)</td><td>Galectin-3 Reference Population (ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>8.2</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>9.3</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>12.4</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>14.8</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>18.5</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td>22.4</td></tr><tr><td>95</td><td>25.7</td></tr><tr><td>97.5</td><td>27.5</td></tr></table>

# 6. Conclusion

The results of these analytical (nonclinical) and clinical studies demonstrate that the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay is substantially equivalent to the performance of the BG Medicine Galectin-3 assay.
