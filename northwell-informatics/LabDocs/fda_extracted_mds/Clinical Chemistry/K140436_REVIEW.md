# I. Device Description:

The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of galectin-3 in human serum or EDTA plasma using CMIA technology.

In the first step, galectin-3 in the sample is immunoprecipitated with anti-galectin-3 coated paramagnetic microparticles. After washing, anti-galectin-3 acridiniumlabeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of galectin-3 in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i$ System optics.

The kit is composed of the following:

ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Reagent Kit The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Reagent Kit consists of 100 tests. Each kit contains paramagnetic microparticles coated with the anti-galectin-3 rat monoclonal antibody, and an acridinium-labeled anti-galectin-3 mouse monoclonal antibody conjugate.

MICROPARTICLES Anti-galectin-3 coated microparticles in PBS buffer with protein stabilizers. Minimum concentration: $0 . 0 8 \%$ solids.

CONJUGATE Anti-galectin-3 acridinium-labeled conjugate in PBS buffer with protein stabilizers. Minimum concentration: $8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of galectin-3 in human serum or EDTA plasma using CMIA technology. In the first step, sample and anti-galectin-3 coated paramagnetic

microparticles are combined. Galectin-3 present in the sample binds to the antigalecin-3 coated microparticles. After washing, anti-galectin-3 acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of galectin-3 in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i$ System optics.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

All performance testing described herein was performed using the ARCHITECT i 2000 SR in STAT mode.

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision of the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay was evaluated using a 20 day precision study performed in-house according to CLSI EP05-A2 using a panel of pooled samples as follows: native human serum (targeting a low level concentration of galectin-3), native human EDTA plasma and native human serum each (targeting a galectin-3 concentration near $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ), human EDTA plasma and human serum spiked with HeLa cell lysate galectin-3 each (targeting a high concentration of galectin-3). The ARCHITECT galectin-3 controls were also tested. All samples were tested using 1 reagent kit lot, 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 measurements.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated in accordance with the CLSI EP-6A guideline using 1 reagent lot and 1 ARCHITECT i2000SR System in STAT mode for both serum and plasma types. Serum and EDTA plasma samples with high concentrations of galectin-3 were prepared by spiking each sample type with HeLa cell lysate galectin-3. Twelve samples spanning the linear range of the assay were prepared for serum and plasma each by intermixing. For serum, a low serum sample (treated to remove galectin-3) was intermixed with the spiked high serum sample. For plasma, a low plasma sample (prepared by dilution with CAL A) was intermixed with spiked high plasma sample. A total of 3 replicates were measured for each sample pool.

The cubic model was significant for all analyses based on unweighted regression models. For serum, the test results did not deviate from linearity by more than $9 . 2 \%$ . For plasma, the test results did not deviate from linearity by more than $2 . 5 \%$ .

High Dose Hook Effect: The sponsor demonstrated that there was no high dose hook effect from the concentration of the CAL F calibrator $( \approx 1 1 4$ $\mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ to $\approx 1 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The studies support the sponsor’s claimed linear range of $5 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ to 103.1 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The sponsor includes the following limitation in the labeling: Accuracy may be assessed using samples prepared by diluting the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Calibrator F with the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 Calibrator A.

The sponsor performed studies to support their recommendation that samples can be diluted 1:2.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ARCHITECT Calibrators and Controls are standardized to an internal gravimetric standard. Calibrators and controls are value assigned using primary reference curves and verified using quality control material and pooled panel samples that must meet specifications. The value assignment process was reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Calibrator and Control Stability: The calibrators and controls are stable for 12 months unopened at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The calibrators and controls are stable for 12 months once opened at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The calibrator and control stability protocols were reviewed and found acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies were performed using a protocol based on CLSI EP-17A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation and analyzed as described below.

# LoB Test Protocol

To estimate LoB, 5 blank samples were measured in replicates of 5 on 2 ARCHITECT i2000SR systems (STAT mode) for 2 runs per day over 3 days for each of 2 lots yielding 60 measurements per lot.

LoB was defined as the concentration at which there is a $9 5 \%$ probability that the sample is analyte-free and was calculated nonparametrically.

# LoD Test Protocol

To estimate LoD, 5 low level samples were measured in replicates of 5 on 2 ARCHITECT i2000SR systems (STAT mode) for 2 runs per day over 3 days for each of 2 lots yielding 60 measurements per lot.

LoD was defined based on a $\beta$ of 0.05 and was calculated nonparametrically.

# LoQ Test Protocol

To estimate LoQ, 5 low level samples were measured in replicates of 5 on 2 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { S R }$ systems (STAT mode) for 2 runs per day over 3 days for each of 2 lots yielding 60 measurements per lot.

The ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay exhibits a CV of $10 \%$ at the claimed LoQ.

$\mathrm { L o B } = 1 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $\mathrm { L o D } = 1 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $\mathrm { L o Q } = 2 . 8 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

The measuring range of the assay is $5 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $1 0 3 . 1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ based on the linear range of the assay (see section $\mathrm { ~ M ~ l . b ~ }$ above).

e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross Reactivity

To evaluate cross reactivity due to protein isoforms (enumerated in the following table), the proteins were added to the following pooled samples: 1 serum sample and 2 EDTA plasma samples with concentrations of native galectin-3 of $\scriptstyle 1 0 - 1 3 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and 1 serum sample spiked with recombinant

galectin-3 at a concentration of $\scriptstyle 1 0 - 1 3 \mathrm { ~ n g / m L }$ , and 2 plasma samples and 2 serum samples spiked with recombinant galectin-3 for a final concentration of ${ \approx } 2 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Control samples were tested in replicates of 6, and test samples were tested in replicates of 3. For each cross reactant tested, cross reactivity was analyzed by comparing the mean of the true value samples (no interferent added) to the test samples (interferent added) and calculated using the following formula: $\%$ cross reactivity $=$ [(mean of test sample – mean of true sample)/concentration of interferent] $\mathrm { ~ X ~ } 1 0 0$ .

# Endogenous Interferents

To evaluate potential interference due to endogenous substances (enumerated in the following table), the interferents were added to the pooled samples targeting galectin-3 at concentrations of $\scriptstyle 1 0 - 1 3 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and ${ \approx } 2 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for serum and EDTA plasma. The number and specimen type of pooled samples for each interferent is included in the table below. Control samples were tested in replicates of 3, and test samples were tested in replicates of 3. For each substance tested, interference was analyzed by comparing the mean of the true value samples (no interferent added) to the test samples (interferent added) and calculated according to the following formula: $\%$ interference $=$ [(mean of test sample – mean of true sample)/mean of true sample] $\mathrm { ~ X ~ l 0 0 ~ }$ .

# Exogenous Substances.

A study was performed based on guidance from the CLSI document EP7-A2. Potentially interfering drugs were evaluated to determine whether galectin-3 concentrations were affected when using the ARCHITECT Galectin-3 assay. The drugs listed below were spiked into serum and EDTA plasma samples with galectin-3 concentrations ranging from approximately 15 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and 60 to $9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The samples were assayed, and the galectin-3 concentrations of the spiked samples were compared to control samples. The data are summarized in the following table.

b. Clinical specificity:

See 3 (c) below.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

The clinical effectiveness at the $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff was evaluated using a set of banked serum samples from the Penn Heart Failure study (PHFS). The PHFS is a multi-center prospective cohort study of outpatients with chronic heart failure in the US. The PHFS study population is comprised of approximately 2000 chronic HF patients and includes systolic and diastolic HF patients classified as NYHA class I, II, III, and IV and baseline serum and plasma samples were collected from each subject at enrollment. The study endpoints were all-cause mortality, hospitalization for worsening heart failure, cardiac transplantation and ventricular assist device placement. A study cohort of 405 samples was used to validate the cutoff. The sponsor performed a sensitivity analysis that demonstrated that this study cohort was representative of the whole study. The $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff was analyzed using a Cox multi-variate regression model in these 405 patients using the composite of the 4 endpoints. Galectin-3 was significantly associated with increased risk after adjusting for the baseline risk factors of age, gender, NYHA functional classification, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes and smoking. The following figures and tables display Kaplan Meier survival curve for all-cause mortality and hazard ratios for the increased risk. The sponsor validated the sample stability of the banked samples.

Notation: The reference category for galectin-3 is the lowest galectin-3 $( \le 1 7 . 8 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). The reference group for gender is female; the reference group for smoker is non-smoker at baseline; the reference group for diabetes is no diabetes at baseline. LVEF and age are included as continuous variables. The reference group for NYHA class is NYHA class I.

The bar graph below depicts the cumulative probability of the primary endpoint (hospitalization due to worsening HF, ventricular assist device placement, cardiac transplantation, or all-cause mortality) by galectin-3 category, at selected time points.

# Clinical Interpretation in the context of Natriuretic Peptides

A comparative analysis of galectin-3 concentration, NT-proBNP concentration and event rate using the banked plasma samples from the PHFS was provided to provide additional interpretive information for the clinical use of galectin-3. NT-proBNP was measured at baseline in 361 samples of the 405 samples that validated the clinical cutoff and that were representative of those 405 samples as a whole. The analysis evaluated the event rate for the PHFS composite endpoint in comparison to the concentration of galectin-3 (above and below the cutoff $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) and the concentration of NTproBNP concentrations above and below the median $( 1 2 2 2 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ ) of the 361 samples that were tested. The sponsor validated the sample stability of the banked samples.
