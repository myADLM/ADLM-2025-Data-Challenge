B. Purpose for Submission: Clearance of BD Viper LT

C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Becton, Dickinson and Company BD Viper LT System

# D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

Nucleic acid amplification by strand displacement with fluorescence detection

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The BD Viper LT System is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use in clinical laboratories to perform automated extraction of nucleic acids from multiple specimen types, amplification of target nucleic acid sequences by Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA) and detection of amplified nucleic acid using a two color fluorescence detection system. The BD Viper LT is for use only with in vitro diagnostic tests labeled for use on the system.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The BD Viper LT system uses homogeneous Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA) as the amplification method and fluorescent energy transfer (ET) as the detection method to test for the presence of pathogens by their genetic content in clinical specimens. For both SDA and PCR assays, specimens are logged in and undergo a pre-warm step in the BD Prewarm heater. The pre-warm step disrupts cells and releases DNA. After cooling, the specimens are loaded onto the BD Viper LT instrument. The pre-warmed specimen is transferred to an extraction tube that contains FOX particles. High pH is used to lyse the bacterial cells and to liberate their DNA into solution. Acid is then added to lower the pH and induce a positive charge on the FOX particles, which in turn binds to the negatively charged DNA. The particles and bound DNA are then pulled to the sides of the extraction tube by magnets and the unbound material is aspirated to waste. The particles are washed and a high pH elution buffer is added to recover the purified DNA. Finally, a neutralization buffer is used to bring the $\mathsf { p H }$ of the extracted solution to optimum conditions for amplification of the target. The BD Viper LT instrument transfers extracted specimens and positive and negative assay controls to plates containing either SDA priming microwells. A warming step in each prime microwell ensures specific hybridization of SDA primers to target (if present) after which the reaction mixture is

transferred to a corresponding gray SDA amplification microwell. After the plate is sealed, the onboard reader door closes over the plate. Amplification and detection occur and results are reported automatically based on the algorithm identified in the assay specific package insert(s).

# 3. Modes of Operation:

The BD Viper LT Instrument has two modes, Walkaway and High Throughput. The user may enable or disable Walkaway mode through use of a check box on the screen. Walkaway mode enables the instrument to perform a complete run without pausing to allow the user to enter additional consumables prior to the prime to amplification plate transfer. In High Throughput mode, the instrument pauses prior to the prime to amplification transfer to allow the user to remove the tested amplification plates from the previous run and load new amplification plates for the next run. In High Throughput mode, the user must acknowledge a message before the instrument will perform the prime to amplification transfer. In either mode, the user may setup and begin a new run while the plates are being tested in the readers.

# Specimen Identification:

Two barcode scanners are located on the instrument deck: one at the specimen rack station and one at the extraction reagent trough. There is also a built-in barcode scanner on the Pre-warm heater that reads the specimen rack barcode. A separate hand-held scanner is provided to help automate specimen login and identification

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

See K140446 and K140448

6. Calibration:

The instrument is calibrated at the time of manufacturing. The thermal and optical systems are under closed loop feedback control therefore no user performed calibration is needed.
