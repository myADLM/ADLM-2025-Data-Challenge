# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification ODE Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)

To: THE FILE

RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K140496

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable (delete/add items as necessary) for the: Access Vitamin B12 Assay, Access Ferritin Assay, Access Folate Assay, Access HYPERsensitive hTSH Assay, Power Express Sample Processing System with Generic Connection Module and Access Immunoassay System Reagents.

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device. (For a preamendments device, a statement to this effect has been provided.) Power Processor Sample Processing System With Generic Connections Module and Access Immunoassay System Reagents ( K110413).

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

This change was for:

A. Change name from Power Processor to Power Express   
B. New process control software – from PrepLink to Cennexus   
C. Improvements to hardware and software: a. Sample Identification now performed using tube tracking performed by short range Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). b. Increased sample tube throughput and decreased turnaround time using additional transport and sample carrier RFID tags. Power Express System performs 1200 tubes per hour (with 4 centrifuges), and addition of 2 lanes/ track to manage more carriers at same track velocity. c. Touchscreen control on the console and each module GUI with LCD. d. Fault tolerant capability with dual modules for the critical hardware functions. e. Additional hardware, storage units and module capacity

4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices

demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
