# Open Vial Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

T criteria.

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE C-Peptide CVMs are traceable to WHO 1st IRP 84/510. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE C-Peptide CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 10 level Total CPeptide calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of C-Peptide reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged aross all systems. Qualiy control is performed by calculating the recovery o patint samples, piked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges. Six levels of commercially available controls and 59 normal patient samples were used to validate CVM value assignments.

# Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested for a total of 27 replicates; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run, 5 different reagent kit lots and 9 IMMULITE 2000 systems. The Guideline Range $( 9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and ± 2 Standard Deviation (SD). The target values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration verification Material lotspeciic value card. The expected assay range is $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ The target values n Table  n e considered as guidelines.

Performance testing has been carried out t demonstrate that this device meets the performance speifications o t intend us. The following test were perormed on the candidate device.

# Stability Summary:

The stability study was conducted to validate shelf life claim for the IMMULITE 2000 Total Testosterone CVM to ensure that it maintains optimal product performance on IMMULITE 2000 platforms throughout the established shelf life of the CVM. The Calibration Verification Materials are stable up to 26 months when stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to opening and stable for 6 hours at room (ambient) temperature $( 1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

# Shelf Life Stability Protocol Summary:

The CVM study protocols are run as part of the calibrator stability testing. As summarized in Table 2, the testing was run in duplicate (at the minimum) and contains time-points at which the testig was performed.

# Shelf Life Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

The Acceptance Criteria or the IMMULTE Total Testosterone criteria which require dose value of stability CVM to fall between $\pm 1 5 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM level $2 , \pm 1 0 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM level 3 and $\pm 9 \%$ o assigned dose for CVM level 4. Part 2 review limits criteria which require dose value of the controls to be within 2sD of the control target value when generated from the stability calibrator curve. If the result is not within acceptable dose range o $\pm 1 5 \%$ for level $2 , \pm 1 0 \%$ EPY for level 3 and ±9% for level 4 then additional data review is conducted using part 2 criteria.

# Open Vial Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

Tcetritor pe Stabiy  e me  hhetaby criteria.

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE Total Testosterone CVMs are traceable to an internal material which has been gravimetrically prepared. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE® 2000 Total Testosterone CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 9 level Total Testosterone calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Total Testosterone reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. Six levels of commercially available controls and 32 samples (23 spiked samples, 4 normal female and 5 normal male samples) were used to validate CVM value assignments. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fafl within their target ranges

# Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:

The Total Testosterone CVMs were tested on 27 replicates in total comprised of 9 runs and 3 replicates per run, 9 IMMULITE 2000 systems and 5 different reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The Guideline Range $( 9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm 2$ Standard Deviation (SD). The expected assay range is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ The target values in Table 4 can be considered as guidelines.
