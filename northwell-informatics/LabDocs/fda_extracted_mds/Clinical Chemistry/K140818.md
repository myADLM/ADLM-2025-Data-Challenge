# Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

The Acceptance Criteria for the IMMULITE Free T4 requires dose value of stability CVMs to fall between $\pm 1 0 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM level 2 and 3 and within $\pm 1 5 \%$ of assigned dose for level 4. Par 2 revw limits crit requies dose value he controls t be within  he control target value when generated from the stability calibrator curve. If the result is not within acceptable dose range of $\pm 1 0 \%$ for levels 2 and 3 and $1 5 \%$ for level  the nal d evi is c part 2 criteria.

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE Free T4 CVMs are traceable to an interal material which has been gravimetrically prepared. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE Free T4 CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 6 level Total Free T4 calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Free T4 reagents and two point adjustors.  The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. Six levels of commercially available controls and 30 normal samples were used to validate CVM value assignments.

# Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested for a total of 27 replicates; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run, 5 different reagent kit lots and 9 IMMULITE 2000 systems. The Guideline Range $( 9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm \nobreakspace 2 \nobreakspace$ Standard Deviation (SD). The taret values are provided in the IMULITE® 200 CVM Calibration verification Material lotspecific value card.

The Acceptance Criteria for the IMMULITE Prolactin requires dose value of stability CVM to fall between $\pm \nobreakspace 1 0 \%$ of assigned dose. Part 2 review limits criteria requires dose value of the controls to be within D o the control target value when generated rom the stability calibrator curve. I the reult is not within acceptable dose range of $\pm 1 0 \%$ for each level then additional data review is conducted using part 2 criteria.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE $^ { \textregistered }$ 2000 Prolactin CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 8 level Prolactin calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Prolactin reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. Six levels of commercially available controls and 30 samples (10 normal patients and 20 spiked normal patient samples) were used to validate CVM value assignments.

# Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:

The Prolactin CVMs were tested on 27 replicates in total comprised of 9 runs and 3 replicates per run, 8 IMMULITE 2000 systems and 4 different reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm \nobreakspace 2 \nobreakspace$ Standard Deviation (SD). The expected assay range is $0 . 5 - 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ The target values in Table 3 can be considered as guidelines.

# Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10

# 8. Conclusion:

The IMMULITE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Prolactin Calibration Verification Material is substantially equivalent to the predicate device intended for similar use. The substantial equivalence of the device is supported by the non-clinical testing and was found to be comparable and supports the claims of substantial equivalence, product safety and effectiveness. Based on the testing completed and the comparisons with predicate device, the IMMULITE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Prolactin Calibration Verification Material does not raise any new questions on safety and effectiveness and the results support a determination of substantial equivalence.

Dear Mr. Ernest Joseph:

We have reviewed your Section $5 | 0 ( \ r \ k )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28. 1976. the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendiments. or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarkct approval application (PMA). You may. therefore. market the device. subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of deviccs. good manufacturing practice. labeling. and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warrantics. We remind you. however. that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.
