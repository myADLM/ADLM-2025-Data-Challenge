# L. Test Principle:

Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TSHL Cartridge: The TSH method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCITM) technology. The LOCITM reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-TSH monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-TSH monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-TSH-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added to bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the TSH concentration in the sample.

Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L Cartridge: The FT4L method is a homogeneous, sequential, chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring, weaker binding analog of T4, and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a fraction of the biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free thyroxine (FT4) concentration. In a second step, T3 Chemibeads are added and form bead/biotinylated antibody immunocomplexes with the nonsaturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is an inverse function of the FT4 concentration in the sample.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TSHL Cartridge: Serum samples were collected at 8 US sites to be representative of the US population diversity. Data from a total of 407 patients (75 infants, 185 children, and 147 adolescents) on one Dimension EXL with Loci Module (LM) instrument and two lots of cartridges were analyzed to establish the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TSHL assay reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile were used as the pediatric reference ranges. The reference interval for the infant group was calculated by performing a log-transformation of the raw data followed by the application of the robust symmetric method to the transformed data. This approach was selected to be most appropriate for the smaller sample size as the data from this population was highly skewed to the right and a transformation was necessary to obtain a normal distribution. The sponsor has added language to their package insert explaining the uncertainty in the value for the upper limit of the reference range. A nonparametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents.

Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L Cartridge: Serum samples were collected at 8 US sites to be representative of the US population diversity. Data from a total of 411 patients (77 infants, 187 children, and 147 adolescents) one Dimension EXL instrument with LM and two lots of cartridges were analyzed to establish the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L assay reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile were used as the pediatric reference range.

The reference interval for the infant group was calculated using the robust symmetric method to accommodate the smaller sample size of this population. A non-parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents.
