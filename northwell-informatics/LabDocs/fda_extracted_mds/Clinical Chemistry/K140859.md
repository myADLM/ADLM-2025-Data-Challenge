Dear Frances Dillon:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

# 7. Pediatric Reference Intervals

Data from a total of 421 patients (82 infants, 191 children, 148 adolescents) were analyzed to establish the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FT4 and TSH assay reference intervals for the studied pediatric population. Testing was performed on a Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 1500 system. These pediatric reference intervals, as well as the previously-established euthyroid adult reference intervals and analytical measuring ranges, are presented below.

\* Information taken from existing Instructions for Use (Package Inserts)

A non-parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents where the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles of the distribution of values were calculated. Because fewer than 120 patient samples were included for the infant age group, the reference intervals were calculated by using a robust measure of location and spread, as developed by Horn and Pesce and recommended in CLSI EP28-A3c: Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals.

The robust symmetrical method was used for the Dimension Vista FT4 analysis because the data was normally distributed. The reference interval calculated from the actual data using the robust symmetrical method was confirmed with two simulated reference intervals (nonparametric and robust symmetric). Each simulated reference interval was estimated as the means of the $9 5 \%$ upper and lower bounds from 1000 data sets. In each case, a normal distribution was fitted to the actual results, with either $\mathtt { n } = 1 2 0$ for the non-parametric analysis, or $\mathtt { n } = 8 2$ for the robust symmetric analysis.

For the Dimension Vista TSH assay, the sample distribution for infant subjects was highly positively skewed. As permitted by CLSI EP28-A3, the actual results were natural log transformed to produce a well-fitted normal distribution. The infant reference intervals were then calculated using the robust symmetric method on the log transformed data. The reference interval was confirmed with two simulated reference intervals (nonparametric and robust symmetric). Each simulated reference interval was estimated as the means of the $9 5 \%$ upper and lower bounds from 1000 data sets. In each case, a normal distribution was fitted to the actual results, with either $\mathtt { n } = 1 2 0$ for the non-parametric analysis, or $\mathtt { n } = 8 2$ for the robust symmetric analysis.

The $90 \%$ confidence intervals for the Infant $9 5 \%$ Reference Intervals are listed below.

# 8. Performance Characteristics

The inclusion of pediatric reference intervals in the Instructions for Use (Package Inserts) does not necessitate the collection of additional analytical performance data as no changes were made to the reagents. Therefore, all analytical performance data previously reviewed for the Dimension Vista $\textcircled{8}$ FT4 and TSH assays continue to apply to these assays. All performance data is cross-referenced to the predicate 510(k) submissions for the FT4 and TSH assays (K053531 and K060090).

Specifically, the following studies are not needed for the purpose of this submission:

 Precision/Reproducibility   
 Linearity   
Calibrator/Assay Traceability   
 Calibrator/Assay Stability   
 Assay Cut-off Method Comparison   
Matrix Comparison Sensitivity (Detection Limits, LoB, LoD, LoQ) Analytical Specificity

# 9. Shelf-Life

The inclusion of pediatric reference intervals in the Instructions for Use (Package Inserts) does not necessitate the collection of additional stability data as no changes were made to the reagents. Therefore, all stability methods, acceptance criteria and data previously reviewed for the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FT4 and TSH assays continue to apply to these assays.

Specifically, the following stability studies are not needed for the purpose of this submission:

Shelf Life Stability Onboard Stability Open Vial Stability

# 10. Conclusions

The Dimension Vista $\textcircled{8}$ FT4 and TSH assays with pediatric reference intervals are substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Dimension Vista $\textcircled{8}$ FT4 and TSH assays.

No changes were made to the reagents. The inclusion of pediatric reference intervals in the Instructions for Use (Package Inserts) does not require a change in the device design or a change in the manufacturing process.

The addition of pediatric reference intervals for the Dimension Vista $\textcircled{8}$ FT4 and TSH assays is further supported by the following rationale:

1. Testing of pediatric patients is within the established indications for use (i.e. for use in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease), as described in 21 CFR §862.1695 and 21 CFR $\ S 8 6 2 . 1 6 9 0$ .   
2. The newly-established pediatric reference intervals are either within or are above the previously-established reference intervals for euthyroid (normal thyroid) adult populations and they are within the analytical measuring ranges of the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FT4 and TSH assays. Therefore, the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FT4 and TSH assays have appropriate analytical performance to test pediatric patients.
