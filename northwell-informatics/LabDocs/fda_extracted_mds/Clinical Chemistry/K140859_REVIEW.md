# L. Test Principle:

Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TSH Cartridge: The TSH method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-TSH monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti- TSH monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-TSH-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the TSH concentration in the sample.

Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4 Cartridge: The FT4 method is a homogeneous, sequential, chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring, weaker binding analog of T4, and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a fraction of the biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free T4 concentration. In a second step, T3 chemibeads are added and form bead/ biotinylated antibody immunocomplexes with the non-saturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the FT4 concentration in the sample.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Serum samples were collected at 8 US sites to be representative of the US population diversity. Data from a total of 421 patients (82 infants, 191 children, and 148 adolescents) were analyzed on one Dimension Vista 1500 instrument to establish the Dimension Vista FT4 and TSH assay reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Two lots of each cartridge type were used in these studies. Results from the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile were used as the pediatric reference range.

The TSH reference interval for the infant group was calculated by performing a logtransformation of the raw data followed by the application of the robust symmetric method to the transformed data. This approach was selected to be most appropriate for the smaller sample size as the data from this population was highly skewed to the right and a transformation was necessary to obtain a normal distribution. The sponsor has added language to their package insert explaining the uncertainty in the value for the upper limit of the reference range. A non-parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents.

The FT4 reference interval for the infant group was calculated using the robust symmetric method to accommodate the smaller sample size of this population. A nonparametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents.
