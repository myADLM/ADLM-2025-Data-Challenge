L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The analytes contained in the Randox Liquid Assayed Chemistry Controls Premium Plus Levels 1, 2, and 3 were obtained from commercially available sources. Control solutions are derived from gravimetrically prepared stock solutions and analyzed inhouse.

# Value Assignment:

Values are assigned through multiple analyses in-house on instrumentation calibrated with a master lot of calibrator. The mean and the CV ranges printed in the package insert were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for the lot. Assigned values of each batch of Liquid Assayed Chemistry Control Premium Plus are confirmed using several external laboratories with several different instrument families. Assigned control ranges are listed in the labeling by instrument family and analyte methods.

# Stability Studies:

Real Time stability studies were conducted for closed and open vials. The shelf life of the Liquid Chemistry Assayed Control Premium Plus Levels 1, 2, and 3 is 18 months from the date of manufacture when stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Open vial stability when stored refrigerated $( + 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { t } 0 + 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ : Thawed control is stable for 7 days at $+ 2 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $+ 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , with the following exceptions: Troponin T is stable for 3 days at $+ 2 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $+ 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

Real time studies are ongoing. Shelf life and open-vial stability studies protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
