# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification OIR Review Memorandum

RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K141220

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable (delete/add items as necessary):

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.

The Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument with SDS Software

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S):

The SDS software will be changed to support an additional OS (Windows 7 in addition to Windows XP).

Update camera driver for Win 7/64 bit compatibility. The camera driver used in the current 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR Software v1.4 is not compatible with Windows 7 OS. The camera driver will be updated to make the software compatible with Windows 7 OS.

An audit and e-Signature report print preview & print defect will be corrected. The current instrument software does not allow the user to preview and print the Audit and e-Signature reports. This anomaly will be fixed to allow the user to preview and print the Audit and e-Signature reports

The current version of the SDS Software does not allow the user to open a file from the network drive or print a file to a network printer when it’s running on a computer with the Window 7 OS. This function will be implemented to allow the user to open a file from a network drive and print to a network printer once the user logins in with their user name and password credentials.

A minor cosmetic change will be implemented by removing the “AB” button and “myScience” option from the software. These functions are no longer supported.

4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

5. Comparison Information (similarities and differences):

# 7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
