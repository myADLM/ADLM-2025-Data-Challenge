The TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 Strips and Teco Diagnostic’s URS-10 strips share the same characteristics including Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite and Leukocyte methodologies. The differences between the TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 Strips and Teco Diagnostic’s URS-10 strips could be the length of the strip, paper of reagent pad and black plastic pad. The TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips are $2 \mathrm { m m }$ longer in length and have a black plastic pad at the end which is meant only for alignment purpose in the TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer System. However these differences do not have any effect on the results or operations of the devices.

# 4.8) Test Principle:

Glucose: This test is based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. One enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the reaction in which glucose is oxidized to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. A second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with potassium iodide chromogen in which the chromogen is oxidized to different colors ranging from blue-green to greenishbrown through brown and dark brown.

Bilirubin: This test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with a diazotized dichioroaniline in a strongly acid medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce light tan to reddish brown color proportional to its concentration in urine.

Ketone: This test is based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid with sodium nitroprusside in a strongly basic medium. The colors range from beige or buff-pink color for a "Negative" reading to pink and pinkpurple for a "Positive" reading.

Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated polyelectrolytes in relation to the ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, the colors range from dark blue or blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green in urine of higher ionic concentration.

Blood: This test is based on the pseudoperoxidase action of hemoglobin and erythrocytes which catalyzes the reaction of $3 , 3 ^ { \circ } , 5 , 5 ^ { \prime }$ -tetramethyl-benzidine and buffered organic peroxide. The resulting colors range from orange to yellow-green and dark green. Very high blood concentration may cause the color development to continue to dark blue.

$\mathbf { p H }$ : This test is based on the well-known double $\mathrm { p H }$ indicator method, where bromothymol blue and methyl red give distinguishable colors over the $\mathrm { p H }$ range of 5-9. The colors range from red-orange to yellow and yellow-green to blue-green.

Protein: This test is based on the protein error-of-indicator principle. At a constant pH, the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow for a "Negative" reaction to yellow-green and green to blue-green for a "Positive" reaction.

Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction in which $\mathfrak { p }$ -diethylaminobenzaldehyde reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly acid medium. Colors range from light pink to bright magenta.

Nitrite: This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram-negative bacteria in the urine. The nitrite reacts with p-arsanilic acid to from a diazonium compound in an acid medium. The diazoniumn compound in turn couples with 1, 2, 3, 4- tetrahydrobenzo(h) quinolin to produce a pink color.

Leukocytes: This test is based on the action of esterase present in leukocytes, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative. The indoxyl ester liberated reacts with a diazoniumn salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color.

# 4.9) Analytical Performance Studies

# A) Precision Study Summary:

Within Run:

Repeatability (within run and day-to-day) precision of the TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer System was evaluated using commercially available urine control solutions at Level I (High analyte concentration), Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III (Negative). The package insert and certificate of analysis of these control solutions confirmed the specific target analyte concentration in each level. 20 replicate assays of each level (negative, low positive, and high positive) were analyzed on TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer with three lots of TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips by three operators. A total of 60 strips were used for each level control solution tested (20 strips $_ { \mathrm { ~ x ~ 1 ~ } }$ day $\texttt { X 3 }$ operators/strip lots $= 6 0$ tests per control). The results from the Within Run Precision study are summarized below:

# Run to Run:

TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer was evaluated by testing each control level (negative, low positive, and high positive) by three operators with three lots of TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips in two replicate assays for 2 non- consecutive runs/day over 5 days. Run 1 and Run 2 were separated by atleast 1 hour. A total of 60 strips were used for each level control solution tested (2 strips $\textbf { x } 2$ run $\texttt { X 5 }$ days x 3 operators/ strip lots $= 6 0$ tests per control). The results from the Run to Run Precision study are summarized below:

# B) Method Comparison Study Summary:

This comparison study testing was performed at Teco Diagnostics, Anaheim CA in United States. The urine samples for analysis in these method comparison studies were provided by external clinical sites. Samples were collected within 4 hours of testing if maintained at room temperature or were stored for up to 8 hours prior to testing if maintained at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . In order to obtain a desired range of abnormal values a pool of negative urine samples were spiked to elevated level with the analytes to be evaluated. These spiked samples represent $10 \%$ of the total samples tested. For each chemistry analyte, the values obtained for the individual urine samples were referred to the respective cut-off values for each system to discriminate between the negative (normal) and positive (abnormal) findings, if applicable. The data was represented in concordance charts showing percent exact match agreement and percent agreement within 1 color block.

# C) Sensitivity/ Cutoff Point Determination Study Summary

# Sensitivity Study

Sensitivity Study was performed to determine the cutoff point concentration at which each analyte on the TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strip changed from negative to the positive color blocks. Samples were prepared by spiking the specified analyte concentration into negative urine with a minimum of 4 levels across the measuring range for each color block. Each pool was then analyzed in replicates of 7 by 3 operators on each of the 3 individual strip lots (7 strips $_ { \mathrm { ~ X ~ 3 ~ } }$ operators/ strip lots), for a total of 21 data points for each level. The cutoff point determination study for each color block for each analyte is defined as the lowest concentration at which $5 5 5 \%$ of the test results are positive.

# D) Linearity Study/ Assay Reportable Range Study Summary:

The linear range of TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer was evaluated by measuring negative urine and negative urine spiked with known increasing and decreasing concentrations of analytes relative to each color block covering the entire measuring range of each analyte present on the TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strip. Sample measurement was performed in replicates of 7 by 3 operators on each of 3 individual strip lots (7 strips $_ { \mathrm { ~ X ~ 3 ~ } }$ operators/ strip lots), for a total of 21 measurements for every sample tested. A $\mathrm { p H }$ meter was used to confirm the $\mathrm { p H }$ results. The specific gravity values were confirmed by a clinical, handheld refractometer. A specific gravity reading of 1.000 was obtained from distilled water. Specific gravity measurements were performed in replicates of 7 by 3 operators on each of 3 individual strip lots (7 strips $_ { \textrm { X 3 } }$ operators/ strip lots), for a total of 21 measurements for every sample tested.

Each urine sample was tested with 3 replicates using TC-Thunderbolt Urine Analyzer System and a mean result was calculated. The mean result from samples with no interfering substance was compared against the mean result of the sample spiked with the interfering substance at the stated concentration. Interference was defined as a change in output of $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ color blocks between spiked and unspiked control sample. For $\mathrm { p H }$ , interference was defined as a change of $\pm \nobreakspace 2 \nobreakspace$ color blocks between the spiked and unspiked control sample.

A real time, temperature and humidity stability study is currently being performed on closed bottles of TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips to validate the claims stated in the Stress Stability Studies. This study involves testing the TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips using Urine Control Solutions Levels I, II and III for every six (6) months from the manufactured date, until 18 months. After the TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips has passed 18 months, test every three (3) months until the product fails or until 28 months. Three (3) lots of TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips used in the Real Time Shelf Life Study will have passed Quality Control inspection and are being kept at room temperature $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $20 { - } 3 0 \%$ humidity.

Acceptance Criteria: The product must pass Quality Control testing in real-time through its expiration date in the conditions that the product will be stored: closed bottle, room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$

# Result:

This study is currently on-going. The three lots of TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips have passed the 12 months Quality Control testing and we plan to continue testing until 28 months.

# C) Open-vial Stability Study Summary:

Open-vial Study was performed on opened bottles (broken seal) of TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips as a means of assessing the shelf-life of the opened bottle product once the seal is broken. This study involves testing the device once per week periodically, for the duration of the study using Urine Control Solutions Levels I, II and III. TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 bottles used in the Open-vial Study will have passed Quality Control inspection and are opened (seals broken) and stored at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $20 { - } 3 0 \%$ humidity.

# Acceptance Criteria:

The TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips must pass Quality Control testing for $\geq 9 0$ days to confirm the opened bottle shelf life of 3 months at room temperature $( 1 5 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with $20 { - } 3 0 \%$ humidity.

# Result:

Three lots of Open Vial TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips all passed Quality Control testing for 91 days at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The expected shelf life of the Open Vial TC-Thunderbolt URS-10 strips is 90 days based on the Open Vial Stability Study Test Results.

# 4.11) Conclusion:

The performance characteristics of the TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer System were verified by method comparison, precision, sensitivity and cutoff point determination, linearity/ assay reportable range, analytical specificity and interference, shelf life and stress studies. Testing results indicate that the TC-Thunderbolt Automated Urine Analyzer System perform satisfactorily when used appropriately, as outlined in the package insert.
