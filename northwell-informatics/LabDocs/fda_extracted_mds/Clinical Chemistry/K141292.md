# 8. Technology Characteristics:

Bromine's Rightest™M GM700/GM650 and GE200/GE300 GDH Strip with revised HCT range, is paired with electronic device that utilizes the electrical characteristic technology for measuring the glucose level in human blood. A relatively small drop of blood is placed on a disposable test strip coated with FAD-glucose Dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) which interacts with the software driven digital talking meter. Within five seconds, the level of blood glucose will be shown on the digital display screen.

Rightest™M GM700/GM650 and GE200/GE300 GDH BGMS Test Strip, with revised HCT range, requires only minimum of 0.75 microliter of blood for the testing, therefore it reduces the time and effort required for testing and improves the compliance of diabetic people to their testing regimens.

# 9. Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as follows:

Three meter models were used for testing: GM650/GE300, GM700, and GE200. GDH (GS700/GS650/GS750) test strip was used for testing. GS700, GS650, and GS750 test strips are identical to each other for Rightest brand, GE200 and GE300 test strips are identical to GS750 and GS650 with the exception of trade name.

Non-clinical tests were evaluated to establish the performance, functionality, safety and reliability of the Rightest™M GM700/GM650 and GE200/GE300 GDH Strip with revised HCT range. The performed evaluations include:

Linearity and sensitivity, readability assessment, safety test, precision, specimen volume, interference, hematocrit, and test strip stability (close vial and open vial), are summarized below:

# Linearity

To reevaluate linearity of HCT revised test strip, 3 lots of revised blood glucose test strips (GS650/GS700/GS750, HCT $2 0 \mathrm { - } 6 5 \%$ were used to evaluate detection range. Venous blood samples spiked to 14 levels of glucose concentrations were used, ranging from low to high level (0 to $6 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), and evaluated compared to reference method YSI 2300.

The tested glucose concentration ranged from 0 to $6 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and hematocrit value from $20 \%$ . Analysis of results indicated linear regression between device and reference method shows mean slopes above 1.00 and $\mathtt { R } ^ { 2 }$ values above 0.99. The results support the claim that glucose assay is linear from $2 0 { \cdot } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } -$ identical to prior $5 1 0 \mathrm { k }$ cleared claims.

# Precision:

Based on the requirements and standards of IS0 1597:2003 to reevaluate the precision of the Rightest and GE series Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (GM700/GM650/GE200/GE300), the precision study evaluates repeatability of betweenday testing, conducted over 10 days at 5 glucose concentrations." 10 meters (3 models) were evaluated for repeatability as well as intermediate precision. 3 lots of revised test strips (GS650/GS700/GS750, HCT range $2 0 \mathrm { - } 6 5 \%$ )were used; 500 test strips were used for within-day and 300 test strips were used for between-day testing. The venous blood sample results were compared against reference method YSI 2300 Analyzer.

The repeatability evaluation and intermediate precision evaluation results of Rightest and GE series Blood Glucose. Monitoring Systems (GM700/GM650/GE200/GE300) demonstrate that repeatability of within-day is evaluated at 5 glucose concentrations and falls within the acceptance criteria.

# Specimen Volume

The Specimen Volume Study reevaluated the specimen volume of Rightest and GE series Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems $( \mathrm { G M 7 0 0 / G M 6 5 0 / G E 2 0 0 / G E 3 0 0 } )$ , using 3 lots of revised test strips (GS650/GS700/GS750, HCT range $20 \%$ ), testing venous blood at 3 glucose concentration levels and at 9 specimen volumes ranging from 0.60 to $3 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The obtained study results support the existing claimed minimum blood specimen volumes of $0 . 7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , which is unaffected with the recent design change.

# Interference Study

The Interference Study was performed under CLSI: EP7-A2, using 2 glucose levels of venous blood samples and 19 interference substances to reevaluate the interference the Rightest and GE series Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (GM700/GM650/GE200/GE300). 3 lots of revised test strips (GS650/GS700/GS750, HCT range $2 0 \%$ )were used.

According to study results, xylose (20 and $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , ascorbic acid $( 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , dopamine $( 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and uric acid (20 and $2 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ indicate percentage of interference over $\pm 1 0 \%$ bias in normal glucose concentration, and xylose $( 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ over $\pm 1 0 \%$ bias in high glucose concentration. This may lead to inaccurate test results, and is stated in the limitations section of the test strip package insert. The remaining 15 interference substances are within the criteria for the 2 glucose concentrations.

# Altitude

The Altitude Effect Study was designed to evaluate the performance of Rightest and GE series Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (GM700/GM650/GE200/GE300) under environment factors at 3 different altitudes: 0, 1000, 2000 and 3000 meters (0, 3280, 61, and 9842 ft. above sea level.Test procedures were performed in 3 replicates using 3 lots of revised test strips (GS650/ GS700/GS750, HCT range $2 0 \mathrm { - } 6 5 \%$ with glucose control solutions at 3 levels  low, normal and high concentration. The results were compared against reference method YSI 2300 Analyzer.

T  ha various operated altitude were all within the criteria.

Operation Temperature and Humidity Study

The Operating Temperature and Humidity Study was designed to evaluate the performance of revised GDH test strip under environment factors of operated temperature and humidity. 6 various temperature and humidity conditions using three lots of revised test strips (GS650/GS700/GS750, HCT $2 0 \mathrm { - } 6 5 \% )$ with glucose control solutions at 3 levels  low, normal and high concentration, and each sample was tested in 5 replicates. The results were compared against reference method YSI 2300 Analyzer.

The obtained study results indicate that the stability of bias compared to the REF during various operated temperature and humidity were all within the criteria. The results demonstrated operation conditions at $4 3 - 1 1 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ humidity remain unaffected with the HCT specification change.

# Hematocrit Study

The Hematocrit Study was designed to evaluate the Hematocrit levels for revised GS650/GS700/GS750 GDH test strip with HCT range from $20 \%$ , 6 glucose concentration levels of venous blood samples were evaluated. Three lots of revised test strips (GS650/GS700/GS750) were used, and each sample was tested in 5 replicates. The results were compared against reference method YSI 2300 Analyzer.

The obtained study results indicate that the stability compared to the REF during various HCT ranges were all within the criteria. The acceptable HCT range of the revised test strips is $20 \%$

These studies and evaluations were either performed internally by professional personnel in Bionime or by third party, performed by qualified personnel, with proper calibrated/maintained equipment and under properly-controlled environmental conditions. All of the evaluated performances passed and meet the acceptance criteria set in the study protocol.

# 9. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:
