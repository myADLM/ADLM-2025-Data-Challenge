# 7.Non-Clinical Performance Testing

Performance testing has been carried out to demonstrate that this device meets the performance specifications for its intend use. The following tests were performed on the candidate device.

# Stability Summary:

The stability study was conducted to validate real-time shelf life and open component (in-use or open vial) claim for the IMMULITE 2000 Cortisol Calibration Verification Material (CVM) to ensure that it maintains optimal product performance on IMMULITE 2000 platforms throughout the established shelf life of the CVM. The Calibration Verification Materials are stable up to 14 months when stored at $- 2 0 \%$ prior to opening and stable for 8 hours at ambient or room temperature $( 1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ after opening.

# Stability Protocol Summary:

The CVM study protocols are run as part of the calibrator stability testing. The stability calibrators/CVMs are run in duplicate (as a minimum) at the time points shown in Table 2, and the dose value is determined from the reference calibrator curve.

Table 2: Stability Protocol Summary   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CVM Level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=4>Time-Points(Days)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LCOCVM1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>182</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>365</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>425</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LCOCVM2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>182</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>365</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>425</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LCOCVM3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>182</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>365</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>425</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LCOCVM4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>182</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>365</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>425</td></tr></table>

For Open Component testing, the results were determined from a 2-point adjustment. Using IMMULITE 2000 Cortisol (L2KCO) kit lot 362, lot 090 CVMs were tested at 2-hourly intervals for up to 9 hours at ambient or room temperature $( 1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ conditions.

# Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

The Acceptance Criteria for the Cortisol Calibration Verification Material (CVM) are in 2 parts. Part 1 consists of guideline acceptance criteria which require dose value of stability calibrators/CVM to fall between $\pm 2 0 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM level 2, $\pm 1 5 \%$ of assigned dose for level 3 and $\pm 1 9 \%$ of assigned dose for level 4. Part 2 review limits criteria which require dose value of the controls to be within 2 Standard Deviations (SD) of the control target value when generated from the stability calibrator curve. If the result is not within acceptable dose range of $\pm 2 0 \%$ for level 2, $\pm 1 5 \%$ of assigned dose for level 3 and within $\pm 1 9 \%$ of assigned dose for level 4, then additional data review is conducted using part 2 criteria.

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE Cortisol CVMs are traceable to an internal material which has been gravimetrically prepared. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE Cortisol CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 8 level Cortisol calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Cortisol reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. Six levels of commercially available controls and 25 patient serum samples, 3 spiked normal serum samples and 5 normal serum samples were used to validate calibrator/CVM value assignments.

# Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested for a total of 27 replicates; 9 runs and 3 replicates per run, $3 ^ { \circ }$ different reagent kit lots and 8 IMMULITE 2000 systems. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm \nobreakspace 2 \nobreakspace$ Standard Deviation (SD). The target values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration verification Material lotspecific value card. The expected assay range is 1 to $5 0 \mathrm { ~ \bf ~ g / d L }$ . The target values in Table 3 can be considered as guidelines.

The Calibration Verification Materials are stable up to 6 months when stor at $- 2 0 \%$ prior to opening and stable for 8 hours at room (ambient) temperature $( 1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ after reconstitution.

# Stability Protocol Summary:

The CVM study protocols are run as part of the calibrator stability testing. As summarized in Table 2, the testing was run in duplicate (at the minimum) and contains time-points at which the testing was performed.

For Open Component testing, the results were determined from a 2-point adjustment. Using IMMULITE 2000 Vitamin B12 (L2KVB) kit lot 467, lot 108 Vitamin B12 CVMs were tested at $2 -$ hourly intervals for up to 9 hours at ambient or room temperature $( 1 5 . 2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C } )$ conditions.

# Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

The Acceptance Criteria for the IMMULITE Vitamin B12 Calibration Verification Material (CVM) are in 2 parts. Part 1 consists of guideline acceptance criteria which require dose value of stability calibrator/CVM to fall between $\pm 1 0 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM level 2 and level 3 and within $\pm 2 1 \%$ of assigned dose for CVM level 4. Part 2 review limits criteria which require dose value of the controls to be within 2SD of the control target value when generated from the stability calibrator curve. If the result is not within acceptable dose range of $\pm 1 0 \%$ for level 2 and level 3 and $\pm 2 1 \%$ for level 4, then additional data review is conducted using part 2 criteria.

# Traceability:

The IMMULITE Vitamin B12 CVMs are traceable to an internal standard. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# Value Assignment:

The IMMULITE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Vitamin B12 CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 8 level Vitamin B12 calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of Vitamin B12 reagents and two point adjustors. The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. Eight levels of commercially available controls and 21 patient serum samples were used to validate CVM value assignments.

# Expected Values/Target Values/Reference Range:

The Vitamin B12 CVMs were tested on 24 replicates in total comprised of 12 runs and 2 replicates per run, 3 IMMULITE 2000 and 5 IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 systems and 4 different reagent kit lots. The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The Guideline Range $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm ~ 2$ Standard Deviation (SD). The expected assay range is 150 to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The target values in Table 3 can be considered as guidelines.
