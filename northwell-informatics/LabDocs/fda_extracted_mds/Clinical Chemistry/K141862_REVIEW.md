2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

1. A usability study was performed with 21 lay users with varying demographic characteristics (age, sex, and education level). The intent of the study was to verify software ease of use and label comprehension. Study participants also completed a questionnaire in response to whether the software, smart cable, and labeling are easy to use. The sponsor concluded that $100 \%$ of users were either satisfied or very satisfied with the software, cable, and user manual. The protocol and acceptance criteria of the usability studies were reviewed and found to be acceptable. During this study, data transmission accuracy of the devices was tested, with lay users transmitting data from blood glucose meters to the software. $100 \%$ of data was accurately transmitted. Meter memory rollover performance was also verified to be correct on each of the three compatible meters. The results from the usability study demonstrated that the product performs as intended in the hands of lay users and healthcare professionals. All test results fell within the pre-determined specification parameters.

2. The following documentation related to the software was reviewed and found to be acceptable: level of concern (Moderate), software requirements specifications, architecture design chart, software design specification, traceability analysis, software development environment description, verification and validation testing, device hazard analysis. The sponsor reports that no unresolved anomalies are known to exist in the release version of the software.

3. The results of a Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment were provided, indicating a Grade Level Score of 7.9 for the Health2Sync Application User Manual.

4. The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing had been evaluated and found to be compliant.

# K. Proposed Labeling:
