Dear Alex Hsu:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address

# 4. Predicate Device Information

The ADVIA Centaur TSH assay was originally cleared by the FDA on 04/30/1991 (k910981) as the ACS TSH Immunoassay.

# Description of Device Modifications

No changes were made to the ADVIA Centaur TSH assay reagents, calibrators or master curve value assignment in order to run on the ADVIA Centaur XPT.

Previously, the lower limit of detection was based on analytical sensitivity, whereas it is now based on Limit of Quantitation (LoQ). As result, the lower limit of detection has been revised from $0 . 0 1 ~ \mu \mu / \mu \mathrm { L }$ to $0 . 0 5 \mu \mu \mu / \mathrm { m L }$ . Accordingly, the analytical measuring range was also modified from $0 . 0 1 { - } 1 5 0 \mu \mathrm { | U / m L }$ to $0 . 0 5 { - } 1 5 0 \mu \mathrm { | U / m L }$ .

# 7. Summary of Design Control Activities

Design control activities, as outlined in 21CFR 820.30, were completed for the ADVIA Centaur XPT system.

A risk analysis (Failure Modes and Event Analysis) was undertaken to assess risks of using the device. This evaluation followed the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics procedure for risk analysis, which is based on ISO 14971:2007, Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical devices. The risk analysis concluded that all identified risks were properly mitigated and no unacceptable risks are present.

The performance of the ADVIA Centaur TSH assay using the ADVIA Centaur XPT system was verified to ensure equivalent performance when used on the predicate ADVIA Centaur XP system. All verification testing met pre-determined acceptance criteria. Therefore, the introduction of the ADVIA Centaur XPT system does not negatively impact the performance, safety or effectiveness of the ADVIA Centaur TSH assay.

# 8. Conclusions

The performance of the ADVIA Centaur TSH assay on the ADVIA Centaur XPT system is substantially equivalent to the ADVIA Centaur TSH assay running on the currently-marketed predicate ADVIA Centaur XP system.

The ADVIA Centaur XPT system has the same operating principles, assay performance characteristics and intended use as the predicate device, the ADVIA Centaur XP system. The results of performance testing and verification activities demonstrate that the design modifications to the ADVIA Centaur XPT do not impact its safety or effectiveness and do not alter its performance claims.

Furthermore, there have been no changes to the intended use of the ADVIA Centaur TSH assay, other than to include the ADVIA Centaur XPT, as described in the labeling, or the fundamental scientific technology of the device.
