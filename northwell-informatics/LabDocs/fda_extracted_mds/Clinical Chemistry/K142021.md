# Traceability

The Elecsys Estradiol III CalSet was standardized against ID-GC/MS (isotope dilution gas chromatography mass spectrometry).

# Evaluations Summary

The Elecsys Estradiol II CalSet was evaluated for value assignment, reconstitution and stability.

# CalSet Value Assignment

Value assignment testing was conducted and passed pre-defined acceptance criteria. The target values for the two levels of the Estradiol III CalSet kit are chosen to obtain the best fit with the Master Calibration Curve, together with the Rodbard curve parameters encoded in the reagent barcode. For each Elecsys Estradiol IIl CalSet lot manufactured, the calibrators are run in   
duplicate on at least three (3) Elecsys 2010/cobas e 41 1 analyzers and at least three (3) cobas e 601/MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers with all Estradiol III reagent lots available. The assigned value of each calibrator is defined as the mean value obtained over at least six (6) runs on at least three (3) analyzers) of the respective calibrator.   
Measurement values for PreciControl Universal (Level 1 & 2), a multi-analyte control recommended for use to monitor accuracy and precision of specified analytes, are read from the calibration curves generated. The pre-defined acceptance criteria for PreciControl Universal have to be met to release the Assigned Values for Estradiol III CalSet.

Three studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims for the Estradiol IIl CalSet. Stability studies after reconstitution and an accelerated stability study were completed on the cobas e 41 1. Additionally, a real-time stability study is planned.

# Study 1. Stability at $\underline { { 2 { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } C , \ { - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } C , } }$ in open vial and freeze/thaw cycles (after reconstitution):

The on-test materials were reconstituted and stored closed for 73 hours at 2 to ${ \pmb 8 } ^ { \circ } { \bf C }$ , and for 32 days at $\boldsymbol { \mathbf { \rho } } _ { \mathbf { - } 2 0 } \boldsymbol { \circ } _ { \mathbf { C } }$ and for 7 hours at 20 to $2 5 \%$ in open vial prior to testing. In addition, the stability of the Estradiol III CalSet for two (2) freeze/thaw cycles was evaluated.

The on-test and reference materials were tested in duplicate and the recovery was calculated as percent of the reference value.

The acceptance criterion was 95 to $105 \%$ signal recovery of the reference material value. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of Estradiol III CalSet.

# Study 2. Accelerated Stability:

The on-test material was stored lyophilized (as supplied to the user) at $3 5 \%$ for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of Estradiol III CalSet (stored at 2 to ${ 8 ^ { \circ } C }$ ). After 3 weeks, the on-test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The on-test recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference value. One Estradiol III CalSet lot was evaluated in duplicate.

The acceptance criterion was 95 to $105 \%$ recovery of the reference material value.

Stability Studies, continued

# Study 3. Real-Time Stability:

In addition, real-time stability is being evaluated as follows: In the on-going real-time stability study, the Estradiol III CalSet test material is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The CalSets are tested in duplicate at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device up to the planned shelf life plus one month (19 months).

Real-time stability is calculated based on the recovery of signal of stressed calibrator (stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ vs. unstressed calibrator (stored at $\mathbf { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . At the specified intervals over the shelf life, the mean value of the stressed calibrator was calculated as percent recovery of the unstressed value (each tested in duplicates at the same time point).

The acceptance criterion for Estradiol III Calibrator 1 and 2 is recovery of $9 5 - 1 0 5 \%$ of the reference value.

The testing will continue with this stability protocol until data to support a claim of 18 months are achieved.

# Conclusion

We trust that the information provided in this Premarket Notification (510(k)) will support a determination of substantial equivalence for the Elecsys Estradiol III CalSet.

Dear Ms. Kelli Turner:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of August 12, 2014. We have reviewed your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 89), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
