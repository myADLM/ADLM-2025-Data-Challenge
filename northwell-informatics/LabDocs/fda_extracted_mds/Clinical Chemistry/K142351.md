# Device Name

Proprietary names: 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { s } }$ EIA

Common names: Vitamin D test   
Classification: 21CFR862.1825 Vitamin D Test System   
Regulatory Class: II   
Product Code: MRG

Predicate Device Name: IDS, OCTEIA 25-OH Vitamin D EIA, (k021163)

# A. Test Principle:

The 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { s } }$ EIA is a manual assay test and does not require the use of an automated system. The whole assay is performed in a microtitre plate and requires a user to perform each step.

# The 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathbf { D } ^ { \mathrm { S } }$ EIA assay

The 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { s } }$ assay is an enzymeimmunoassay for the quantitation of $2 5 \mathrm { ( O H ) D }$ and other hydroxylated metabolites in serum or plasma. $2 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each calibrators, controls and samples are diluted with biotin labelled 25(OH)D. The diluted samples are incubated in microtitre wells which are coated with a highly specific sheep 25(OH)D at room temperature before aspiration and washing. Enzyme (horseradish peroxidase) labelled avidin, is added and binds selectively to complexed biotin and, following a further wash step, colour is developed using a chromogenic substrate (TMB).

The absorbance of the stopped reaction mixtures are read in a microtitre plate reader, colour intensity developed being inversely proportional to the concentration of 25(OH)D.

# B. Indications For Use:

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use

The 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { s } }$ EIA assay is intended for the quantitative determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and other hydroxylated metabolites in human serum or plasma. Results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory data to assist the clinician in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency in an adult population.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated based on a modified version of CLSI EP-6A, “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures”. Samples containing varying concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were assayed in replicate of four. The resulting mean concentrations were compared to predicted concentrations. Samples were prepared by diluting a high patient sample with a low patient sample prior to assay. The linear regression (weighted) of the Observed concentrations versus the expected concentrations is:

Observed $= 1 . 0 2 \mathrm { \Delta x }$ (Expected) + 0.23 ng/mL   
Observed $= 1 . 0 2 \mathrm { \Delta x }$ (Expected) $+ 0 . 5 8 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$   
Regression coefficient $\stackrel { \cdot } { \mathrm { R } } { } ^ { 2 } : = \stackrel { \cdot } { 1 } . 0 0$ Maximum deviation; $- 8 . 8 \%$ for samples $> 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 . 3 7 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ for samples $< 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

The reportable range of the assay is $6 . 5 - 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 1 6 . 3 - 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ . Any value that reads below $6 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ $\mathrm { 1 6 . 3 n m o l / L } )$ should be reported as $\mathrm { ^ { * } < 6 . 5 \ n g / m L }$ (16.3 nmol/L)”.

# Traceability:

The 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { s } }$ assay is traceable to the isotope dilution-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LCMS/MS) 25(OH) Vitamin D reference method procedure (RMP) which was used in assigning the target value for the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP single donor human serum panel.

The design criterion was that the slope must be 0.85 to 1.15 and the intercept $+ / - ~ 7$ $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $\Gamma \geq 0 . 9 0$ .

Serum separator tubes (SST), EDTA plasma, Sodium Heparin plasma, Lithium Heparin plasma and citrate plasma tube data do not present any new issues of safety or effectiveness for the 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { s } }$ EIA assay.

# 3. Expected values/Reference range:

An expected values study performed according to the non-parametric method in CLSI protocol C28-A2.

Samples from 280 apparently light skin and dark skin healthy male adults $( 7 1 . 1 \% )$ and female adults $( 2 8 . 9 \% )$ aged 21-77 years living in geographical diverse regions of the United States to represent a broad spectrum of UV light exposure in the intended population were assayed in the 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { s } }$ Assay. Samples were from individuals with normal values for intact PTH, calcium, phosphate, and TSH, and not taking any interfering medications. The following ranges were determined using the 25-Hydroxy Vitamin $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { s } }$ assay and are provided for information only. The $9 5 \ \%$ reference interval for apparently healthy adults, were calculated by a non-parametric method following guidance from CLSI C28-A3 “ Defining, Establishing and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory”.

Obtained normal adults range:12.3 to $4 9 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (30.7 to $1 2 2 . 5 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ ) $\mathrm { ( n { = } 2 8 0 }$

Observed sample ranges were:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">n</td><td rowspan="2">%</td><td rowspan="2">Observed Sample Range</td><td rowspan="2">Median (ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td>(ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td>Non-supplemented</td><td>219</td><td>78.2%</td><td>11.2 to 45.9</td><td>25.1</td></tr><tr><td>Northern US</td><td>116</td><td>41.4%</td><td>10.3 to 35.1</td><td>22.6</td></tr><tr><td>Southern US</td><td>103</td><td>36.8%</td><td>14.6 to 48.0</td><td>29.5</td></tr><tr><td>Supplemented</td><td>61</td><td>21.8%</td><td>15.4 to 86.8</td><td>30.2</td></tr><tr><td>Overall</td><td>280</td><td>100%</td><td>12.3 to 49.0</td><td>26.0</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">n</td><td rowspan="2">%</td><td rowspan="2">Observed Sample Range</td><td rowspan="2">Median (nmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td>(nmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td>Non-supplemented</td><td>219</td><td>78.2%</td><td>28.0 to 114.6</td><td>62.8</td></tr><tr><td>Northern US</td><td>116</td><td>41.4%</td><td>25.6 to 87.6</td><td>56.5</td></tr><tr><td>Southern US</td><td>103</td><td>36.8%</td><td>36.6 to 120.0</td><td>73.9</td></tr><tr><td>Supplemented</td><td>61</td><td>21.8%</td><td>38.5 to 217.1</td><td>75.5</td></tr><tr><td>Overall</td><td>280</td><td>100%</td><td>30.7 to 122.5</td><td>65.0</td></tr></table>

The above ranges should be considered as guidelines only; it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own expected range based for its own patient population.

The $9 5 \%$ reference interval was calculated by a non-parametric method following C28-A2. The following range was obtained:

Normal Adults 12.3 to $4 9 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( \mathtt { n } = 2 8 0 )$ ) $3 0 . 7 \mathrm { t o } 1 2 2 . 5 \mathrm { n m o l } / \mathrm { L } ( \mathrm { n } = 2 8 0 )$

The package insert states that there is no universal agreement on the optimal concentration of 25OHD. Ranges should be based on clinical decision values that apply to both sexes of all ages rather than population based reference ranges for 25OHD.

# E. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
