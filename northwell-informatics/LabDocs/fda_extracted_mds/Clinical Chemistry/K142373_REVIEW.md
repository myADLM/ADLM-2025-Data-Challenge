# L. Test Principle:

The Access 25(OH) Vitamin D total assay is a two-step competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay. In the initial incubation, sample is added to a reaction vessel with a DBP releasing agent and paramagnetic particles coated with sheep monoclonal anti-25(OH) vitamin D antibody. 25(OH) vitamin D is released from DBP and binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-25(OH) vitamin D on the solid phase. Subsequently a 25 (OH) vitamin D analogue-alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added which competes for binding to the immobilized monoclonal anti-25(OH) vitamin D. After a second incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A twenty day reproducibility/precision study based on CLSI EP5-A2 was performed at an internal site using three Access 2 analyzers and 3 reagent lots. Four patient serum samples with different concentrations were run in duplicates over 20 days (2 runs per day) for a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates per sample. The study was run at an internal site on three Access 2 instruments, using three reagent pack lots, one calibrator lot and one lot of reagent pack per instrument. The study results of one representative reagent lot are provided in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The calibrators are traceable to a Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) ‐ approved isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID‐LC‐MS/MS) reference method procedure (RMP) developed at Ghent University. This RMP is further traceable to the NIST SRM 2972.

This assay has been standardized in accordance with the Vitamin D Standardization

Program (VDSP). The VDSP is an international collaborative effort to standardize the laboratory measurement of serum 25-OH vitamin D. This collaboration involves the coordinated efforts of the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST), Ghent University, and other institutions. Please refer to http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the VDSP program.

In accordance with the recommendations of the program, the traceability of Access 25 (OH) Vitamin D Total Calibrators for the Access 2 analyzer was verified using a panel of forty serum samples from the Vitamin D Standardization-Certification Program that were assigned by the ID-LC-MS/MS RMP for Vitamin D from Ghent University. Standardization of total 25OHD in serum was verified through method comparison and bias estimation between the reference method and the Access 25(OH) Vitamin D Total assay. This value assignment has aligned the candidate device to the RMP.

The relationship between the Access 25 (OH) Vitamin D Total for use on the Access 2 analyzer and ID-LC/MS/MS 25-OH vitamin D RMP is described using Deming regression:

$\scriptstyle \mathrm { y = 1 . 0 1 x - 2 . 8 7 \ n g / m L , r = }$ $_ { \mathrm { r = 0 . 9 9 } }$

# Value Assignment:

Primary reference calibrators are prepared from 25(OH) Vitamin D and human serum. A stock is prepared by volumetrically mixing the 25(OH) Vitamin D to a known concentration based on the ID-LC-MS/MS reference method. The stock is diluted to designated (assigned) concentrations using a serum based matrix. Primary working calibrators are prepared at six calibrator levels; zero, and approximately 7, 18, 35, 74 and $1 6 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Product (commercial) calibrators are value assigned using the Primary reference calibrators on the Access 2 Immunoassay System through an internal procedure. Verification of these assigned values is performed in a statistical comparison of calibration curves generated by both the Primary reference and Product calibrators at concentrations spanning the measuring interval.

# Stability:

The sponsor claims the calibrators are stable until the expiration date indicated when stored unopened at $- 1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once opened, the sponsor claims the calibrators are stable for 56 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available controls for use with this assay in the labeling.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and the limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were determined following CLSI EP17-A2 guidelines.

The LoB was determined as the $9 5 \%$ non-parametric upper distribution limit of the result concentration. LoB was performed by analyzing 154 replicates of the S0 calibrator over 12 runs using three Access 2 Immunoassay Systems, three reagent lots and two calibrator lots.

The LoD determination was performed by analyzing 5 very low Vitamin D concentration serum samples between the anticipated LoB and 10 times the anticipated LoB in triplicate over 12 runs (180 replicates in total) using 3 reagent packs and three Access 2 Immunoassay Systems over 4 days.

The LoQ determination was performed by analyzing 3 replicates of 10 patient samples within 22 runs using multiple Access 2 Immunoassay Systems over multiple days. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration which met the design requirements of total imprecision of $\leq 2 0 \% \mathrm { C V }$ .

The LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.55 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0 ng/mL</td></tr></table>

The Access 25 (OH) Vitamin D assay has a measuring range of $7 . 0 { - } 1 2 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

An interference study was conducted per CLSI EP7-A2. Serum samples containing Vitamin D concentrations of approximately 20, 40 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ were used in the study. Potential interferents were spiked individually into each patient sample in up to four different concentrations. Results of the spiked patient samples were compared to results of the unspiked sample (control). Samples at Vitamin D concentration of ${ \sim } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were tested in replicates of 8 and samples at ${ \sim } 4 0$ and $\mathrm { \sim 1 5 0 n g / m L }$ were tested in replicates of five. The highest concentration at which no interference (defined by the sponsor as $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias relative to the control) was seen is shown in the table below.

A cross-reactivity study was conducted according to CLSI-EP7-A2 to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of the assay with other substances that are similar in structure to 25(OH) Vitamin D. The potential cross-reactants were added to the Vitamin D samples with an approximate 25(OH) vitamin D concentration of 20, 40 and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Results from these cross-reactant spiked serum samples were evaluated against that of matched unspiked serum samples. Samples at $2 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ were tested in replicates of eight. Samples at 40 and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were tested in replicates of five. The substances shown in the following table were spiked into samples containing 25(OH) vitamin D and analyzed on the Access 2 Immunoassay system. Values for percent were calculated using the equation below.

mean value spiked $\mathrm { ( n g / m L ) }$ ) – mean value unspiked $\mathrm { ( n g / m L ) }$ ) Cross-reactivity $=$ Concentration of cross-reactant added $\mathrm { ( n g / m L ) }$

Due to the insufficient spike recovery in Vitamin D immunoassays1 the $\%$ Cross Reactivity results obtained above were normalized. Without normalization, cross reactivity would appear artificially low therefore $\%$ cross reactants are normalized to the 25(OH) $\mathrm { D } _ { 3 }$ to reflect the endogenous cross-reactivity. This is achieved by dividing the observed $\%$ Cross reactivity (61, 56 and 45) of 25(OH) Vitamin D3 to obtain the final $\%$ Cross Reactivity values below:

The labeling contains the following limitations:

“Do not assay hemolyzed samples. Hemoglobin concentrations greater than $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may lead to falsely elevated results.

“Vitamin D Levels should not be tested in patients who have received Paricalcitol within 24 hours of obtaining the sample”

Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may produce antibodies, e.g. HAMA, that interfere with immunoassays. Additionally, other heterophile antibodies (e.g. human anti-sheep antibodies) may be present in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous results. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these antibodies.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed according to CLSI EP9-A3 to compare the 25-OH vitamin D concentrations of serum samples using the candidate device on the Access 2 analyzer and the University of Ghent ID-LC/MS/MS 25-OH vitamin D

Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP). 109 native independent patient samples with RMP assigned concentrations were tested in duplicates and the singlet set of results was used to compare against the candidate method. The linear regression was calculated using the first result obtained and the Passing-Bablok method. The results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept(ng/mL)[95%CI]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope (ng/mL)[95% CI]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample rangetested</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>109</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-3.57[-6.15 to- 1.30 ]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.02[0.95-1.12]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.95[0.92 to 0.96]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.0-109.4ng/mL</td></tr></table>

b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was conducted using 45 matched sets of serum and plasma (lithium-heparin) samples which spanned the reportable range of the assay (8.3 to $8 7 . 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). The samples (40 neat and 5 spiked) were analyzed on the Access 2 analyzer. The results of the study using Passing Bablok analysis are as follows:

Based on the study data, the sponsor claims that serum, serum with gel and lithium heparin (plasma) tubes are acceptable anti-coagulants for the vitamin D assay.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable, this is a quantitative assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A reference range study was conducted using serum samples from 367 apparently healthy adults between 21-89 years of age. The study population included male and female subjects from various geographically diverse regions of the US and reflected the overall US population in terms of gender, race and ethnicity. These samples were collected during the cold and warm weather. Samples included subjects with Vitamin D supplements ( $20 \%$ of the participants) and without Vitamin D supplements. Samples were only included in this study if the samples had normal Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, PTH and TSH values. The results of the study are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Method</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MedianConcentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% Reference Range (2.5-97.5)Percentile</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Access 25(0H)Vitamin D Total(ng/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>367</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24.9 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.9 ng/mL to 43.6 ng/mL</td></tr></table>

The sponsor stated in their labeling that it is important for each laboratory to establish its own reference range, representative of its typical population.
