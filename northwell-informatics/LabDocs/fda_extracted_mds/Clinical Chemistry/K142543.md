# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

Clinical studies were conducted using the Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer and Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strips. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strip read by Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer compared to the predicate: Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strip read by ACON U120 Urine Analyzer (K070929); and to observe if there is any problem/issue with operation of the Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strip / Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer when they are placed in the hands of the intended user.

Approximately 120 patient urine specimens were randomly collected from patients at each of 3 clinical sites, and tested by 3 intended users at each site (total of 9 users for al 3 sites) Each specimen was tested by Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strip read with Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzers and Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strip read with Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Urine Analyzers. Each intended user tested approximately the same number of specimens at each site. The study period at each site last over 3 months. In order to evaluate the performance with the analyte covering the measuring range, few contrived urine specimens were tested at each site following the study protocol.

Additional study was carried out at 2 sites in US; a POC site and a specialty care office for inclusion of positive samples for the Nitrite, Urobilinogen, Ketone and Bilirubin analytes. Below is the summary of the specimens tested at all sites combined:

# Precision Study:

The reproducibility of the Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer was evaluated using 3 levels of Control Solutions. The target concentration of the analyte in each control solution was confirmed with Siemens reagent strips read by Clinitek Status urine analyzer and Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent Strip read by ACON U120 urine analyzer. Each control solution was tested with one lot of strip in duplicates per run, 2 runs each day by one operator for 20 days. Second operator performed the test following the same protocol with second lot and second analyzer. A total of160 strips were used for each concentration tested (2 strips x 2 run $\textbf { x } 2 0$ days x 2 operators $= 1 6 0$ strips). The precision for each device was $100 \%$ exact agreement. The results are summarized as below.

# Voltage Flex Study:

The voltage flex study was performed using Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Liquid urine control, Level 1(normal) and Level 2 (abnormal) on analyzers supplied with the following voltages: 86V, 100V and 264V. 220V was also tested as the baseline control condition. Three analyzers were turned on using each of the voltage, and tested to see if the analyzer works properly. The analyzers were tested three times under each voltage. Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra urine analyzer can operate properly under 86V, 100V and 264V, and the test results are comparable to those of the 220V baseline control results. In conclusion, the range from 86V to 264V is suitable for operation of the Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra urine analyzer.

# pH Flex Study:

5 normal fresh urines were collected and mixed. The mixed urine was tested with Siemens Clinitek Status and ACON U120 urine analyzer to determine the concentrations in the pooled urine. The Leu, Nit, Uro, Pro, Blo, Ket, Bil, Glu and Asc in the pooled urine were negative with pH at 6.5 and SG at 1.010. The mixed urine samples were split into five aliquots $ { 1 5 0 }  { \mathrm { m l } } /$ each glass container). Adjust these five aliquots urine $\mathsf { p H }$ to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with 1M Hydrochloric acid aqueous and 1M Sodium hydroxide aqueous. Then spiked analytes to different concentration as control Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 listed in the table. The concentrations of each analyte in the control at $\mathrm { p H } \thinspace 6$ were confirmed with $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ cleared Siemens Clinitek Status and U120 urine analyzer, the results were used as expected values. Test these control solutions with Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strips by Mission U120 Ultra analyzer following the product inserts. 5 replicates were tested for each sample.

Sample pH from 5.0 to 9.0 does not affect the results of Urobilinogen, Ketone, Bilirubin, and Glucose tests. Sample $\mathrm { p H } { > } 8$ would generate false high results on Protein test. Sample $\mathsf { p H } { \mathsf { > } } 9$ would generate false high results on Leukocyte and Specific Gravity test, and false low results on Nitrite, Blood, Ascorbic acid test.

# Urine Controls Validation:

# Value Assignment

Control value assignment for the Mission Liquid Urine Control and Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control was done by testing Level 1 and Level 2 using the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips tested on the Mission U120 Ultra Urine analyzer. Three lots of strips and three analyzers were tested for three consecutive days by three operators. All results for level 1 were negative except for SG and $\mathsf { p H }$ which should be $+ / - 2$ color blocks of target results and all results for level 2 showed positive results except for ascorbic acid.

# Stability Studies

Accelerated, Real Time and Open Stability studies were performed to test the shelf life of Mission Liquid Urine Control and Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control under different conditions. Accelerated stability study confirmed that the product is stable at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 24 months when stored properly in unopened bottles. Real Time Stability study confirmed the shelf life of the controls is 24 month. Open Canister Stability study confirmed that the controls remain stable for up to 30 days at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 24months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after being opened.

# Conclusion:

The laboratory testing results and clinical studies demonstrate that the Mission $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer is safe, effective and easy-to-use and such is substantially equivalent to the ACON U120 Urine Analyzer (K070929), currently sold on the U.S. market for professional (point-of-care) testing.
