# L. Test Principle:

The Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer is a reflectance photometer that analyzes the intensity and color of light reflected from the reagent areas of a urinalysis reagent strip. Using a light emitting diode (LED) as the light source and a CMOS image sensor as a light sensor, the optical system reads the color change in the urine test strips after a sample is applied.

The Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer is used in conjunction with the Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent Strips and can detect qualitatively and/or semi-quantitatively the following analytes in urine: glucose, bilirubin, ketone (acetoacetic acid), specific gravity, pH, blood, protein, urobilinogen, leukocytes and ascorbic acid as well as the qualitative detection of nitrite. The chemical reactions between the analytes in the urine and each test pad on the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips that causes a change in color are described below:

Ascorbic acid: This test involves decolorization of Tillmann’s reagent. The presence of ascorbic acid causes the color of the test field to change from blue-green to orange.

Glucose: This test is based on the enzymatic reaction that occurs between glucose oxidase, peroxidase and chromogen. Glucose is first oxidized to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of glucose oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with potassium iodide chromogen in the presence of peroxidase. The extent to which the chromogen is oxidized determines the color which is produced, ranging from green to brown.

Bilirubin: This test is based on azo-coupling reaction of bilirubin with diazotized dichloroaniline in a strongly acidic medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce a pinkishtan color proportional to its concentration in urine.

Ketone: This test is based on ketones reacting with nitroprusside and acetoacetic acid to produce a color change ranging from light pink for negative results to a darker pink or purple color for positive results.

Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated polyelectrolytes in relation to ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, colors range from deep blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green in urine of increasing ionic concentration.

Blood: This test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin which catalyzes the reaction of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and $3 , 3 ^ { \prime } , 5 , 5 ^ { \prime }$ -tetramethylbenzidine. The resulting color ranges from light orange to dark green.

pH: This test is based on a double indicator system which gives a broad range of colors covering the entire urinary pH range. Colors range from orange to yellow and green to blue.

Protein: This reaction is based on the phenomenon known as the "protein error” of pH indicators where an indicator that is highly buffered will change color in the presence of proteins (anions) as the indicator releases hydrogen ions to the protein. At a constant pH, the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow to yellow-green for negative results and green to green-blue for positive results.

Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction between pdiethylaminobenzaldehyde and urobilinogen in strongly acidic medium to produce a pink color. Urobilinogen is one of the major compounds produced in heme synthesis and is a normal substance in urine.

Nitrite: This test depends upon the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram negative bacteria in the urine. In an acidic medium, nitrite in the urine reacts with p-arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1N-(1- naphthyl) ethylenediamine to produce a pink color.

Leukocytes: This test reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases. The esterases cleave a derivatized pyrazole amino acid ester to liberate derivatized hydroxyl pyrazole. This pyrazole then reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

In-house Precision Study:

The precision of the Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer used with the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips was evaluated using control solutions at level 1 (negative), level 2 (low analyte concentration) and level 3 (high analyte concentration). The target concentration of the analytes in each control solution was confirmed using previously cleared methods. The total precision of the Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer was evaluated by testing each control solution was tested by two operators with two lots of strip in duplicate per run, two runs each day for 20 days on two Mission U120 Ultra Urine analyzers. A total of 160 strips were used for each level control solution tested (2 strips x 2 run x 20 days x 2 operators/analyzers/strip lots $=$ 160 tests per control). The repeatability of the Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer was evaluated by testing each level control solution by three operators on three analyzers in replicates of 20 per run per day with three lots of strip for one day. A total of 180 strips were used for each level control solution tested (20 strips x 3 strip lots x 1 day x 3 operators/analyzers $= 1 8 0$ tests per control). The results from the inhouse precision evaluation are summarized below:

Point-of-Care (POC) Precision Study:

The precision of the Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer at point-of-care (POC) sites was evaluated using control solutions at level 1 (negative), level 2 (low) and level 3 (high). Control solutions were prepared by spiking each analyte in negative urine pool to the target concentrations shown in the table below. The concentrations of the analytes were confirmed using previously cleared methods. The three level control solutions were dispensed in to different containers and were labeled randomly with coded numbers. Three set of coded samples were sent to three POC sites (in U.S.) for testing by three POC operators at each site. Each sample was tested once per run, two runs per day for 20 days $\mathrm { N } = 4 0$ testing per sample). The results from the point-of-care precision study are summarized below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A study to evaluate the reportable range (percent recovery) for each analyte color block on the Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent Strips was performed by measuring negative urine and negative urine spiked with known concentrations corresponding to the color blocks for each analyte on the test strip. The negative or expected value of each sample was confirmed using the previously cleared methods. Each sample was tested using three lots of strip, three strips per lot on three analyzers/operators for three days. A total of 81 strips were used for each analyte concentration tested (3 strips x 3 strip lots x 3 operators / analyzers $\mathrm { \Delta _ { X } 3 \ d a y s = 8 1 }$ strips per sample). The percentages of exact block match of reported results at each analyte concentration were calculated and recorded.

The percent recovery for each analyte at each concentration block $\scriptstyle \mathrm { N } = 8 1$ per sample) is shown in the table below:

Stability of the Mission Liquid Urine Control and the Mission Liquid Diptube Urine Control (level $I$ and 2) – The real time stability study protocol for the open vial storage stability and shelf-life, and the acceptance criteria for the two controls was reviewed and cleared under $\mathrm { k } 1 0 3 3 8 7$ . The two controls have a claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open control vials are stable for 30 days when stored at 15 to $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and for 24 months when stored at 2 to $8 ~ \%$ .

Stability of the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips – The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria for the reagent strips was reviewed and found acceptable. Based on the accelerated and real time studies, the claimed shelf life is 24 months when stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or at room temperature $( 3 0 \pm 3 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Open canister strips (opened 100 times) are stable for 98 days when stored at room temperature and 50 to $80 \%$ relative humidity conditions.

# d. Detection limit:

The cutoff of the assay at each color block was validated by spiking or diluting a pooled urine sample with the stock solution of an analyte to achieve several concentration levels. Each sample was tested with three test strips on three analyzer by three operators, using three test strip lots for three days (3 strips x 3 operators/analyzers x 3 strip lots $\mathrm { \Delta _ { X } 3 \ d a y s = 8 1 }$ tests). The cutoffs for each color block are defined as the lowest and highest concentrations of analyte tested at which over $50 \%$ of the results are positive for each color block.

# e. Analytical specificity:

To evaluate interferences, known amounts of potential interfering substances commonly found in human urine were added to pooled urine samples and tested using the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and the Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzers. Ten normal fresh urines were pooled and confirmed to be negative for the eleven analytes. The pooled urine was spiked with the eleven analytes at the target concentrations listed in the table below.

The three level urine controls were spiked with the interfering substances. Three levels of each analyte and at least two (or more when needed) levels of interfering substance per analyte were evaluated in the study as per the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Each urine sample was tested with one strip per lot and one analyzer. A total of three strip lots and three analyzers $\mathrm { N } = 9$ testing per sample) were used for the study. Interference is defined when the testing result with spiked interfering substance is not the same color block as the expected result with the control solution with no interfering substance. No interference is defined when the testing result with spiked interfering substance is the same color block as the expected result with the control solution with no interfering substance.

pH Interference:

The sponsor performed an additional study to evaluate the effect of sample $\mathrm { p H }$ on the test results for the ten analytes in human urine. The study result shows that sample $\mathsf { p H }$ from 5.0 to 9.0 does not affect the test results for urobilinogen, ketone, bilirubin and glucose. Samples with $\mathsf { p H }$ greater than 8.0 affected the protein test resulting in a false high result, and the blood test resulting in a false low result. Samples with $\mathrm { p H }$ greater than 9.0 affected leukocyte and specific gravity tests giving falsely high results and affected nitrite and ascorbic acid tests giving falsely low results.

# Specific Gravity Interference:

The sponsor performed an additional study to evaluate the effect of sample specific gravity on the test results for the ten analytes in human urine. The study result shows that sample specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.040 does not affect the test results for urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketone, bilirubin and ascorbic acid. Samples with specific gravity higher than 1.025 affected nitrite, protein and glucose tests giving false low results. Samples with specific gravity higher than 1.020 affected leukocyte test giving false low result.

The sponsor has included the effects from above interfering substances in the

labeling as limitations of the device.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Comparison studies were performed at five different POC sites to evaluate the performance of the Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strip read by the Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer compared to the performance of the predicate method, Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Urinalysis Reagent strip read by ACON U120 Urine Analyzer. A total of 120 patient urine specimens were randomly collected from patients at each of the three POC sites (combined total of 360 clinical specimens), and tested by three POC users at each site (total of nine users for all sites). In order to evaluate the performance of the candidate device over the entire measuring range of each analyte, additional samples, including contrived urine samples, were tested at two additional POC sites resulting in up to 468 samples evaluated at all sites. Results of the comparison study for the combined sites are shown in the tables below.

N. Instrument Name: Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer.

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Single Test Mode: 55 tests/hour. Continuous Test Mode: 120 tests/hour.

Semi-automatic reading of Mission reagent strips on Mission U120 Ultra urine analyzer. Each reagent strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings. The labeling and user guide specify that the strips are for single use.

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes __X_ _ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

The Patient ID is entered either manually using the keyboard or scanned using the barcode reader (Barcode ID).

# 4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

It is recommended that collection of the urine is in a clean and dry container and testing is completed as soon as possible. The use of urine preservatives is not recommended. If testing cannot be done within an hour after voiding, the specimen should be refrigerated. The refrigerated specimen should be brought to room temperature before testing.

The labeling also warns as “Prolonged storage of unpreserved urine at room temperature may result in microbial proliferation with resultant changes in pH. A shift to alkaline pH may cause false positive results with the protein test area. Urine containing glucose may decrease in $\mathsf { p H }$ as organisms metabolize the glucose. Contamination of the urine specimen with skin cleansers containing chlorhexidine may affect protein (and to a lesser extent, specific gravity and bilirubin) test results.”

# 5. Calibration:

The Mission $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer performs an automatic calibration each time a test is run.

6. Quality Control:

Recommendations for quality control are described in the labeling. Additionally, the users should follow local, state and federal regulations.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

A study to validate the pH versus specific gravity correction function (pH compensation) of the Mission U120 Ultra Urine analyzer. pH compensation corrects the effect of sample pH on the test results of specific gravity. The study evaluated the effect of sample pH (4.0, 4.5,

Above summary results show that the agreement versus expected value on the same block is increased by $5 5 . 6 8 \%$ and agreement versus expected value within $\pm$ one block is increased by $6 . 5 9 \%$ after $\mathrm { p H }$ compensation is activated on the Mission U120 Ultra Urine Analyzer. The interference from the sample $\mathrm { p H }$ on the sample specific gravity test results is decreased with application of pH compensation on the analyzer.
