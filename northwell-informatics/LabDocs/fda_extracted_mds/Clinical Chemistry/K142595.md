# 4. Device Description

The determination of $\%$ glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products HbA1c Reagent Kit in conjunction with the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 31 on the VITROS 5,1 FS and VITROS 4600 Chemistry Systems and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System. The VITROS Chemistry Products HbA1c Reagents are two dual chambered packages containing ready-to-use liquid reagents. Whole blood samples are hemolyzed on the VITROS 5,1 FS and VITROS 4600 Chemistry Systems and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System. The concentration of HbA1c and total Hb are measured in the hemolyzed samples, controls and calibrators.

# Hemoglobin A1c and Hemoglobin

Whole blood samples are hemolyzed on the VITROS 5,1 FS and VITROS 4600 Chemistry Systems and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System. Calibrators, controls and hemolyzed whole blood samples are mixed with Reagent 1 containing anti-HbA1c antibody to form a soluble antigen-antibody complex. Hemoglobin in the hemolyzed whole blood is converted with Reagent 1 to a hematin derivative that is measured bichromatically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Unbound anti-HbA1c antibody reacts with polyhapten (hexapeptide-glycan, A1c Reagent 2) to form an insoluble antibodypolyhapten immune complex, which is measured turbidimetrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . After a calibration has been performed for each reagent lot, the hemoglobin A1c and Hb

concentrations in each unknown sample can be determined using the stored calibration curves and the measured absorbance obtained in the assay of the hemolyzed sample.

# %A1c

$\% \mathrm { A l c }$ is a derived test calculated from the quantitative measurements of hemoglobin and hemoglobin A1c.

# 7. Performance Data:

Analytical Performance a. Method comparison with NGSP device:

A Method Comparison Study (Accuracy) was performed comparing the VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HbA1c assay with testing in a secondary reference laboratory of the NGSP. The testing followed CLSI Protocol $\operatorname { E P } 9 ^ { 1 2 }$ and was performed on each of the VITROS systems.

A total of 357 samples which were within the claimed measuring range of both assays were measured in both the VITROS Chemistry Products HbA1c assay and the secondary reference laboratory assay. The samples were distributed across the range of the assay. The relationship between the two methods was as follows:

VITROS Chemistry Products HbA1c assay $= 1 . 0 0 \mathbf { x }$ secondary reference laboratory method-0.06 ( $\%$ NGSP) with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.996.

On all lots and on all VITROS systems the VITROS HbA1c assay has met the requirements of the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program and is traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Reference Method.

Bias and $\%$ Bias versus the reference method on each VITROS System were calculated at 5.0, 6.5, 8.0 and $12 \%$ NGSP and are presented in the following tables along with the calculated $\%$ Total Error.

Special Controls require Total Error to be $6 \%$ . Total error was assessed on each VITROS system.

Deming regression analysis was performed for each of the 3 analyzer types. Total Error values at the requested decision levels are shown.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HbA1c assay was evaluated on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System, VITROS 4600 Chemistry System and VITROS 5600 Integrated System following CLSI EP05-A213. The evaluation was conducted on three of each VITROS systems. Three reagent lots were evaluated on each analyzer system. Data were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Test samples were targeted at 5.0, 6.5, 8.0, and 12.0 $\%$ A1c. Precision was evaluated with quality control materials (hemolysate and whole blood-based) for 20-days. An intermediate precision study using whole blood patient samples spanned 4-days. All acceptance criteria for precision were met.

Within Lab precision (Total) was determined using a three lots of reagents on three analyzers on each platform, using a single calibration per lot. Data is shown in both NGSP units and SI units. Results are summarized in the following tables.

c. Linearity/assay measuring range:

Evaluation of the linearity of the VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HbA1c assay was performed based on CLSI EP06-A14. For each assay component (Hb, HbA1c, $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ ), a low pool and a high pool were prepared with the assay component near the extremes of the calibration range. The low and high concentration pools were mixed to give 16 further pools of intermediate concentrations. The VITROS HbA1c assay was tested using each VITROS System. The VITROS HbA1c assay is linear through the following ranges:

Linear range for Hb: $4 . 9 7 2 - 3 0 . 3 1 8 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (component) Linear range for HbA1c: $0 . 0 8 0 - 2 . 5 3 0 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (component) Linear range for $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ : $3 . 0 3 4 - 1 5 . 4 4 4 \%$ (NGSP derived test) Linear range for HbA1c: $9 . 6 { - } 1 4 5 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / m o l }$ (SI derived test)

For each test component, the linearity passes the Acceptance Criteria and presents acceptable performance.

The linearity results support a measuring range of the VITROS HbA1c assay from $4 \%$ to $14 \%$ (alternate units: $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 3 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l e / m o l ) }$ .

d. Detection limit: Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection, Limit of Quantitation

Limits of Detection and Quantitation were evaluated following CLSI document $\mathrm { E P l } 7 { \bf - A } 2 ^ { 1 5 }$ . The VITROS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Products HbA1c assay was tested using eachVITROS System. Separate evaluations were performed for Hb, HbA1c and the derived test $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ .

The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limits of Quantitation were conservatively selected as the Lot/Analyzer yielding the highest values and are summarized in the following tables.

e. Dilution Study:

On-Analyzer dilution is not supported.

f. Traceability Traceability of the Calibration: The values assigned to the VITROS® Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 31 for $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ are traceable to the IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine) Reference Method1 . The derived result $( \% \mathrm { A l c } )$ is calculated from the individual quantitative results for hemoglobin $\left( \mathrm { H b } \right)$ and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). NGSP results are derived from the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) HbA1c

2.152.

g. Analytical specificity:

The effect of potential interferents on the performance of the VITROS Chemistry Products HbA1c assay was assessed using methods based on the guidelines from CLSI EP7-A216. Potential interferents were evaluated on each of the VITROS Systems.

For each substance tested the control pool and the test substance pool replicates were tested with the VITROS HbA1c assay and results compared.

For HbA0, HbA1a, HbA1b, HbC, HbD, HbE, HbF and HbS, patient samples were tested with the VITROS HbA1c assay. The patient samples were also analyzed by a reference method.

# Specificity

# Substances That Do Not Interfere

Samples containing hemoglobin variants HbS up to $41 \%$ , HbC up to $3 8 \%$ , HbD up to $3 8 \%$ and HbE up to $2 6 \%$ of the total hemoglobin concentration do not interfere.   
The anti-HbA1c antibodies used in this kit do not cross-react with HbA0 up to $90 \%$ , HbA1a up to $1 . 5 \%$ , HbA1b up to $4 \%$ of the total hemoglobin   
concentration.   
This method is unaffected by the presence of acetylated hemoglobin,   
carbamylated hemoglobin, and labile glycated hemoglobin when samples were treated with $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Acetaldehyde, $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Urea, and $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Glucose for four hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , respectively.   
The substances listed in this table were tested with the VITROS Chemistry Products HbA1c assay at $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ values of approximately $6 . 5 \%$ and $8 . 5 \%$ (48 and 69 HbA1c $\mathrm { ( m m o l / m o l ) }$ ), using protocols based on CLSI Protocol EP716 and found not to interfere, bias $\leq 0 . 5 \ \% \mathrm { A l c }$ and $\leq 0 . 6 \ \% \mathrm { A l c }$ $\leq 5$ and $\leq 7$ HbA1c $\mathrm { ( m m o l / m o l ) }$ ), at the concentration shown.

The hemoglobin variants HbA0, HbA1a, HbA1b, C, D, E and S tested over the variant concentration ranges shown do not interfere in this assay.

# Known Interferenents:

Glycated HbF is not detected as it does not contain the glycated $\beta$ -chain that characterizes $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ . However, HbF is measured in the total Hb assay and as a consequence, specimens containing high amounts of HbF $( > 7 \% )$ may result in lower than expected mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ values (NGSP).

h. Reference interval

The expected normal HbA1c range in adults is $4 . 0 { - } 6 . 0 \%$ (NGSP) or 20-42 mmol/mol (IFCC units) 1 . Each laboratory should confirm the validity of these intervals for the population it serves. The Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes - 2015 recommend to diagnose diabetes using a HbA1c method that is NGSPcertified and standardized to the DCCT assay and a cut point of $\mathrm { H b A l c } \geq 6 . 5 \% .$ .2,3

i. Antigen Excess.

The potential effect of antigen excess was assessed using fluids that were created from a commercial hemolysate fluid with concentrations through and beyond the assay measuring range for the Hb and the HbA1c components. Samples of each fluid were measured on each VITROS System. No effect from antigen excess was observed for the Hb component for concentrations up to $3 1 3 . 3 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ or for the HbA1c component for concentrations up to $2 1 . 8 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# j. NGSP Certification

In accordance with the Special Controls, NGSP certification was received for the VITROS HbA1c assay on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System, VITROS 4600 Chemistry System and the VITROS 5600 Integrated System.
