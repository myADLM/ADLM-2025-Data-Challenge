# 4. Device Description

Both Surearly™ Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test are in vitro diagnostic medical devices, which use the qualitative assay for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in the early determination of pregnancy. The assays are based on a lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay.

Surearly™ Pregnancy Test Strip is a strip coated with reagents. One end of the strip is a sample pad for urine dipping, and the control and test regions are located in the middle of the strip. Users immerse the sample pad of the strip into the collected urine and see the test results from the colored lines appeared on the strip. The test results are interpreted by users according to the instructions for use.

Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test is a digital test reader with a LCD display, combining with an absorbent tip covered by a plastic cap. The absorbent tip that protrudes from the end of the test reader absorbs and delivers urine to reagents on a RAPID type test strip which is located inside a plastic housing of the device. The test reader is automatically switched on, by removing the power film located at the grip. The absorbent tip is placed in urine stream directly or alternatively immersed into the collected urine. The test reader detects the colored lines and shows the digital test result on the display.

# 8. Comparison / Lay-user Studies including menopausal study

8.1 Comparison Study

Comparison studies between the candidate devices (Surearly™ Pregnancy Test Strip

and Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test) and comparative method were conducted by lab

professionals using total 456 urine samples obtained from 18 to 48 years old women collected from 306 women who were clinically confirmed to be pregnant and another 150 women who were randomly chosen from non-pregnant women.

Among the positive samples, 156 were collected from women who were suspected of being pregnant or pregnant women in their first trimester. The results of the candidate devices demonstrated $100 \%$ agreement with comparative method.

# 8.2 Lay-user (OTC) Study

Total 198 lay users aged 18 to 45 years participated in the lay user study. 100 were nonpregnant women and 98 were pregnant women. The pregnant women were recruited from who might be pregnant or have been confirmed to be pregnant.

For the digital test, both urine midstream and dip procedures were tested as claimed to demonstrate the equivalency of both testing procedures. 100 users tested the digital device using the stream procedure and another 98 users tested it using the dip procedure.

All lay users tested their own urine by themselves with Surearly™ Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test according to the instructions for use in English. The lay users' same urine samples were also tested by professionals.

After the test, lay users were also asked the questions, e.g. whether the test was easy to run, the instructions for use was easy to understand and the test results were easy to read. The results demonstrated that the instructions for use of Surearly™ Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test were understandable and clear enough for lay users, and devices were easy to operate by following the instructions.

# 8.3 Menopausal Study

Menopausal study was performed with total 510 samples from non-pregnant women to demonstrate to what degree the test devices might have false positive results from women who are not pregnant. (170 samples in pre-menopausal age of 18-40 years old, 170 samples in peri-menopausal age of 41-55 years old, and 170 samples in postmenopausal age over 55 years old).

No false positive result was found and all test results were negative.

# 9. Other Information about Performance Characteristics and Safety

Further laboratory studies have been carried out for sensitivity/cut-off (including lay user cut-off study), specificity, interference (including pH effect, ethanol and specific gravity ranges), high dose hook effect, precision/reproducibility, and stability to verify the performances of Surearly™ Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test.

These results have demonstrated that Surearly™ Pregnancy Test Strip and Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test perform satisfactorily when used according to the instructions for use.

As the product, Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test includes software and electrical components, additional verification and validation activities were also performed. Software validation was performed specifically to ensure the performance of Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test electronic read-out result.

The electrical safety including EMC for the test reader was evaluated according to the IEC standards, IEC61010-1:2001 (Second edition), IEC 61010-2-101: 2002 (First edition) IEC 61326-1: 2005, and IEC 61326-2-6:2005. The test reader meets all the requirements of the standards.

# 10. Conclusions

The overall performance data in this submission supports that Surearly™ Pregnancy

Test Strip and Surearly™ Digital Pregnancy Test are safe, effective and substantially equivalent to the predicate, Clearblue Easy Digital Pregnancy test (K060128) which currently marketed in the United States.
