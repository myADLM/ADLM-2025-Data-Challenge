Trade Name: Common Name: Classification Name: Classification: Product Code:

PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube   
Blood Collection Device   
Blood Specimen Collection Device (21 CFR 862.1675)   
Class II   
PJE

# Predicate Device

Trade Name:

BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PPT™ Plasma Preparation Tube

# Device Description

The PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube is a sterile, single use, plastic, evacuated blood collection tube with a BD Hemogard™ closure assembly and a measured quantity of $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ additive. The additive quantity dispensed into each tube is designed to match the nominal blood draw volume of $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ . The tube is made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic which functions to maintain vacuum within the tube, allowing for accurate and consistent blood draw for the duration of the shelf life of the tube. A predetermined vacuum is drawn inside the tube that is sealed with a BD Hemogard™ closure which consists of a rubber stopper plus BD Hemogard™ shield.

The tube is intended to be placed inside a tube holder or an adaptor that contains a needle designed to pierce the tube closure and allow blood to flow into the tube. Once the vein has been penetrated (using either a standard blood collection needle or a blood collection set), the tube is pushed into the holder, and the blood enters the tube. Once a tube has drawn the appropriate amount of blood, it is disengaged from the holder and inverted the recommended number of times (8–10) to mix the additive with the blood.

The DNA in whole blood collected in the PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube has been shown to be suitable for molecular diagnostic testing for 14 days at room temperature $( 1 8 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , 28 days refrigerated $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , 3 days at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , up to 52 weeks frozen $( - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , or when subjected to up to three freeze-thaw cycles. The PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube is robust with respect to mishandling including reduced inversions and partial blood draw. The product shelf life is one year from the date of manufacture including limited storage temperature excursions which simulate shipping conditions from $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $4 5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

The PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube is available as a $1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 7 5 \mathrm { ~ m m }$ tube with a 2.5 mL nominal blood draw. The referenced first dimension represents the diameter of the tube and the second dimension represents the length of the tube.

# Intended Use/Indications for Use

The PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube is intended to collect, anticoagulate, stabilize, transport, and store a venous whole blood sample for preparation of human DNA for use with molecular diagnostic test methods that require DNA.

The performance characteristics of this device have not been established for molecular diagnostic assays in general. Users must validate use of product for their specific molecular diagnostic assay.

# Technological Characteristics

The technological characteristics of the subject device, the PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube, are equivalent to that of the predicate device, the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PPT™ Plasma Preparation Tube with respect to device design and operating principle. The PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube utilizes identical component materials to the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PPT™ Plasma Preparation Tube. Aside from intended use/indications for use, the only changes are with the amount of $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ present in the tube and lack of gel barrier material. These differences do not raise any new questions of safety or effectiveness.

\* In addition to the two-field concordance presented in the table, probe hit patterns were analyzed and a total of 7 probes out of 14,400 (200 comparisons $\times 7 2$ probes) were found to be discordant. The overall probe concordance was $9 9 . 9 5 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI lower bound of $9 9 . 9 \%$ .   
† CF Assay, after retest, includes 1 sample from Site B showing a result of “No Call” that was not retested. Three previous runs at Site B included up to 38 samples showing a result of “No Call” due to a degraded enzyme in the CF Assay Kit. Run 4 used a new enzyme to perform the test at Site B. The results exclude 3 subjects from Site B where the assay was not repeated for 3 evaluation tubes.   
‡ HLA Assay 1, after retest, includes 4 samples from Site C that were re-extracted and retested due to a labeling error.

\* In addition to the two-field concordance presented in the table, probe hit patterns were analyzed and a total of 7 probes out of 14,400 (200 comparisons $\times 7 2$ probes) were found to be discordant. The overall probe concordance was $9 9 . 9 5 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI lower bound of $9 9 . 9 \%$ .

CF Assay, after retest, includes 1 sample from Site B showing a result of “No Call” that was not retested. Three previous runs at Site B included up to 38 samples showing a result of “No Call” due to a degraded enzyme in the CF Assay Kit. Run 4 used a new enzyme to perform the test at Site B. The results exclude 3 subjects from Site B where the assay was not repeated for 3 evaluation tubes.

‡ HLA Assay 1, after retest, includes 4 samples from Site C that were re-extracted and retested due to a labeling error.

§ HLA Assay 2, after retest, includes 2 repeat testing samples due to labeling errors and removes 12 samples (3 concordant with previous results, 9 discordant with previous results due to labeling errors) that could not be retested.

# 3. Reproducibility

Two reproducibility studies were performed.

1. The site-to-site reproducibility study was conducted at three sites. Three tubes from one lot were collected from each of 20 donors and sent to 3 different sites for DNA extraction and testing. DNA was extracted using a commercially available, automated silica membrane based DNA extraction kit, followed by determination of DNA concentration and purity for all samples. All samples were tested using the CF Assay and HLA Assay 1 for concordance. All samples gave $100 \%$ concordant results.

2. The lot-to-lot device reproducibility study was conducted at three sites. One tube from each of 3 lots was collected from each of 20 donors and sent to one site for DNA extraction and testing. DNA was extracted using a commercially available, automated silica membrane based DNA extraction kit, followed by determination of DNA concentration and purity for all samples. All samples were tested using the CF Assay and HLA Assay 1 for concordance. All samples gave $100 \%$ concordant results.

# 4. Product stability – Shelf Life Study

Product shelf life was evaluated by storing unused devices at room temperature for up to 13 months, with and without temperature cycling for 10 days at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 5 days at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to simulate temperature extremes in transport. DNA was purified using a commercially available, automated magnetic bead based DNA extraction kit and samples were tested for DNA yield, concentration and purity, as well as HLA Assay 2 concordance with a control EDTA tube.

The data supports a product shelf life of up to 12 months at room temperature.

The following handling conditions were tested:

# Substantial Equivalence

Based on a comparison of the device design, operational use, and the intended use and performance for venous whole blood specimen collection, anticoagulation, stabilization, transportation and storage for the preparation of human DNA, the PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube is as safe, as effective and performs as well as the commercially available predicate device, the BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PPT™ Plasma Preparation Tube. For the specific intended use, the PAXgene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood DNA Tube is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
