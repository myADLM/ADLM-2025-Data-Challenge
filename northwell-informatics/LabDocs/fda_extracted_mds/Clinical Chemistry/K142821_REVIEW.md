# L. Test Principle:

The PAXgene Blood DNA Tube is intended to be placed inside a tube holder or an adaptor that contains a needle designed to pierce the tube closure and allow blood to flow into the tube. Once the vein has been penetrated (using a standard blood collection needle or a blood collection set), the tube is pushed into the holder, and the blood enters the tube. Once a tube has drawn the appropriate amount of blood, it is disengaged from the holder and inverted 8- 10 times to mix the additive with the blood.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility:

A multi-site study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the PAXgene Blood DNA Tube. DNA was isolated and purified from whole blood aliquots using commercially available, automated, silica membrane based DNA isolation kits. 126 subjects were enrolled in the study at the collection site to provide samples for one or more of the assays below. Of the 126 subjects enrolled, 6 were withdrawn due to incomplete or no blood draw. Three lots of candidate tubes were used in this study.

All subjects participating in the study were tested with a commercially available, FDA cleared Cystic Fibrosis assay and a commercially available, FDA cleared SSO HLA Typing assay. Subjects with viable blood draws numbered 41 through 120 were additionally tested with a commercially available, FDA cleared Thrombophilia Risk assay.

Site-to-Site Reproducibility:

Data from 20 subjects with three candidate tubes from the same lot per subject were evaluated for site-to-site reproducibility across three sites (1 candidate tube for each site). For each assay, either a Cystic Fibrosis assay or a SSO HLA assay, if one subject had the same genetic markers detected with tubes tested at all three sites the subject was designated concordant. Otherwise, the subject was designated discordant. The results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sites</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Assay</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SamplesTested</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Correctcalls</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Incorrectcalls</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No-calls</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%Correct</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% CIlowerbound</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>A,B,C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CFAssay</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N/A</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>A,B,C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SSO*HLAAssay</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N/A</td></tr></table>

\*For all SSO HLA assay results across all reproducibility studies, in addition to the two-field concordance presented in the 3 tables, probe hit patterns were analyzed and a total of 7 probes out of 14,400 (200 comparisons $\times 7 2$ probes) were found to be discordant. The overall probe concordance was $9 9 . 9 5 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI lower bound of $9 9 . 9 \%$ .

# Lot-to-Lot Variation:

Data from 20 subjects with three candidate tubes per subject (1 tube from each lot) were evaluated for lot-to-lot variation at one site. For each assay, Cystic Fibrosis Assay or SSO HLA assay and for each subject, if the same genotyping results were obtained from specimens collected in candidate tubes from all 3 lots, the subject was designated as concordant. Otherwise, the subject was designated discordant.

# Sample Stability Summary:

The results of the studies support the sponsor’s claim that the PAXgene Blood DNA tubes are suitable for storage of whole blood for 14 days at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 28 days at 2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 days at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , 12 months at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ or when subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles prior to DNA extraction.

Samples stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or subjected to freeze thaw cycles yielded sufficient DNA to perform the SSP HLA assay in each study, however, overall the DNA recovery for specimens stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or subjected to freeze thaw cycles was decreased compared to samples that were never frozen. The following limitation was added to product labeling:

“DNA concentrations in eluates extracted from blood specimens which have undergone 1 freeze-thaw cycle have been shown to fall by more than $2 5 \%$ , which subsequent freeze-thaw cycles not seen to further reduce DNA yield. For highest yield, DNA should be extracted from blood collected in the PAXgene Blood DNA Tube prior to freezing. Up to 3 freeze-thaw cycles does not negatively affect DNA quality or performance in molecular diagnostic test methods.”

Real time stability studies for PAXgene Blood DNA tubes: Shelf-life stability study:

Shelf-life stability testing of the proposed tube was evaluated for 13 months at room temperature. The sponsor tested specimens from 15 subjects using tubes and assessed the following endpoints: For the 6 month, and 7 month timepoint, DNA eluates were evaluated for DNA concentration and purity. For the 12 month and 13 month timepoint, DNA eluates were evaluated for DNA concentration and purity and were tested using a SSP HLA typing assay compared to DNA from duplicate control tubes. Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. Current real-time data supports a shelf-life of 12 months at ambient temperature.

Transport simulation study: Transport stability was assessed using temperature cycling for short durations between high $( 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ) and low $( - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) durations after 6 or 12 months at the recommended storage conditions. Specimens from 15 subjects were evaluated at each time point. Using the cycling profile below:

Specimens from control tubes were processed immediately after collection, and candidate tubes were processed after temperature cycling. The resulting eluates were evaluated for DNA concentration, purity and SSP HLA genotype assay compared to paired specimens collected in control tubes. Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.

Current real-time data supports the claimed transport conditions of up to 7 days at $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

DNA eluates were assessed for DNA concentration and DNA purity. The results are summarized below:

DNA purity: All 192 DNA eluates extracted from the candidate tube yielded an A260/A280 ratio range of 1.7-1.9.

DNA concentration: All DNA eluates extracted from the candidate tube yielded elutes with DNA concentration of $\ge 1 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / u L }$ .

The following limitation is provided by the sponsor in the device labeling to clarify that this tube has not been validated with manual extraction methodologies:

“The PAXgene Blood DNA Tube has not been validated with DNA extraction methods involving manual precipitation. “

Additional studies in support of the tubes:

Incomplete tube inversion:

Venous whole blood was analyzed in replicate tubes from each of 10 subjects drawn into 8 control tubes and 8 candidate tubes. DNA from each specimen was extracted on two instruments by two operators using a commercially available, automated, magnetic bead based DNA isolation kit. Per subject, duplicate control and duplicate candidate tubes were not inverted after blood collection , while the three other sets of duplicate control and duplicate candidate tubes were inverted 1, 5, and 8 times. After inversion, tubes were incubated at room temperature $( 1 8 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 1 day, followed by processing on the first day after blood collection. DNA purity, concentration and SSP HLA genotype were assessed. The results are summarized below:

Genotyping: All HLA results generated from the samples collected in the candidate tube which had been inverted 1x and 8x were concordant with the results obtained from the samples obtained using the control tube which had been inverted $8 \mathbf { x }$ .

DNA purity: All DNA eluates extracted from the candidate tube yielded an A260/A280 ratio range of 1.7-1.9.

DNA concentration: All DNA eluates extracted from the candidate tube yielded DNA concentrations of $\dot { \geq } 1 5 ~ \mathrm { \ n g / u L }$ .
