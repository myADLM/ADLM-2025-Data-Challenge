Dear Mr. Paul Liu:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

Device Name

FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indications for Use (Describe)

The FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and alternative sites (palm, forearm and upper arm). This blood glucose monitoring system is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared. Alternative site testing (AST) should only be done during steady-state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. This system should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, nor for use on neonates.

The FORA GD43 Test Strips are for use with the FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Meters to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and alternative sites (palm, forearm and upper arm).

# 4. Intended Use

The FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and alternative sites (palm, forearm and upper arm). This blood glucose monitoring system is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

This system should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes, nor for use on neonates.

The FORA GD43 Test Strips are for use with the FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Meters to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and alternative sites (palm, forearm and upper arm).

# 5. Device Description:

The system consists of blood glucose meter and test strips. These products have been designed, tested, and proven to work together as a system to produce accurate blood glucose test results. Use only FORA GD43 test strips with the FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# 6. Comparison to the Predicate:

The modified FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System has the following similarities to the predicate device:

Same operating principle. C Same functions and physical appearance. Same fundamental scientific technology. Same user interface.

The modifications:

The material of test strip electrode is changed The sample volume required is changed

7. Test Principle:

The blood glucose is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip. The meter utilizes the current signal to calculate the blood glucose level.

# 8. Performance Characteristics:

Clinical and non-clinical studies were conducted to tested, verified and validated with respect to the predicate device to establish the performance of the FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. More than $9 5 \%$ of the individual glucose results fall within $1 5 ~ \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ at glucose concentrations $< ~ 7 5 ~ \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 1 5 \ \%$ at glucose concentrations $\begin{array} { r l } {  { \geq } } & { { } 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } } \end{array}$ . The CV $( \% )$ is less than $5 \%$ both in intermediate precision and repeatability. The data demonstrates that the FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

9. Traceability:

FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is compared to the YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer in the clinical and non-clinical studies. The YSI is calibrated with NIST (SRM) 917A reference material.

10. Conclusion:

Based on the information provided in this submission, the FORA GD43 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the predicate FORA GD40 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
