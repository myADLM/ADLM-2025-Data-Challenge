Dear Ms. Gartland,

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of January 23, 2015.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

# 7. Non-Clinical Performance Testing

Performance testing has been carried out to demonstrate that this device meets the performance specifications for its intended use. The following tests were performed on the candidate device.

7.1 Stability Summary:

The stability study was conducted to validate real-time shelf life and open component (in-use or open vial) claim for the IMMULITE 2000 CEA Calibration Verification Material (CVM) to ensure that it maintains optimal product performance on IMMULITE 2000 platforms throughout the established shelf life of the CVM before and after reconstitution.

The IMMULITE® 2000 CEA Calibration Verification Materials are stable up to 6 years when stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ prior to opening and for 8 hours at ambient or room temperature $( 1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ after reconstitution.

# 7.1.1 Stability Protocol Summary:

The CVM study protocols are run as part of the calibrator stability testing. Three lots of stability CVMs and reference CVMs are run in duplicate (as a minimum) at the time points shown in Tables 2a, 2b and 2c and the dose value determined from the reference calibrator curve.

For Open Component testing, the results are determined from a 2-point adjustment. Using IMMULITE 2000 CEA kit lot 290, CEA CVM lot 090 was tested at 2-hourly intervals for up to 9 hours at ambient or room temperature $( 1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ conditions and compared to the determinations at time zero.

# 7.1.2 Stability Acceptance Criteria Summary:

The guideline criteria for samples stored over time at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is outlined in Table 3.

The Acceptance Criteria for the IMMULITE CEA CVM real time and open component stability testing is applied to dose compared to dose at time point zero. The result is required to fall between $\pm 1 0 \%$ difference for CVM levels 2 and 3 and $\pm 1 5 \%$ for CVM level 4.

If the guideline criteria fail, then the stability is assessed on analyte drift as described below:

x If the slope is not significant $( \mathtt { p } \ge 0 . 0 5 )$ , the stability estimate is the study duration less one time unit.   
x If the slope is significant $( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ , the stability claim estimate is taken as the time at which the one-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line intersects with the allowable drift limit for the specific sample.   
x The minimum stability estimate across all samples is taken as the stability estimate for that lot.   
x The final stability claim for the product is taken as the minimum estimate across all lots from the trend analysis results.

The acceptance criterion is summarized in Table 3.

# 7.2 Traceability:

The IMMULITE CEA CVMs are traceable to an internal standard. The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

# 7.3 Value Assignment:

IMMULITE CEA CVMs are 4 level materials which are a subset of 7 level CEA calibrators. Calibrators are not commercialized but are used internally during manufacture and release testing of CEA reagents and two point adjustors.

The IMMULITE calibrators and therefore CVMs are value assigned using assigned reference calibrators. The assigned reference calibrators are prepared using CEA antigen stock and are traceable to an internal standard which have been gravimetrically prepared. Nine levels of commercially available controls and 21 samples (5 normal and 21 spiked samples) were used to validate calibrator/CVM value assignments.

The CVMs are manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. The IMMULITE CEA calibrators/CVMs were tested on 27 replicates in total, comprised of 9 runs, 3 replicates per run, 9 IMMULITE 2000 systems and 5 different reagent kit lots.The CVMs dose values are generated using curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of patient samples and controls using the assigned CVM values. The controls must fall within their target ranges.

# 7.4 Expected Values/Reference Range:

Each CVM level was tested on tested on 27 replicates in total, comprised of 9 runs, 3 replicates per run, 9 IMMULITE 2000 systems and 5 different reagent kit lots. The Guideline Range $( 9 5 \%$ confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and $\pm ~ 2$ Standard Deviation (SD). The expected values are provided in the IMMULITE® 2000 CVM Calibration Verification Material lot-specific package insert.

The expected assay range is up to $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The target values in Table 4 can be considered as guidelines.

Each laboratory should establish their limits for acceptability based on methodology, clinical significance and medical decision levels of the test analyte. The representative, total precision tabulated in the respective assay instructions for use may be considered as one factor when establishing local, acceptable ranges. The values provided above may be considered as guidelines. Value assignment is lot specific.

# 8. Conclusion:

The IMMULITE® 2000 CEA Calibration Verification Material is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the FDA cleared IMMULITE® 2000 DHEA-SO4 Calibration Verification Material. The substantial equivalence of the device is supported by the non-clinical testing and was found to be comparable and supports the claims of substantial equivalence, product safety and effectiveness. Based on the testing completed and the comparisons with predicate device, the IMMULITE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 CEA Calibration Verification Material does not raise any new questions on safety and effectiveness and the results support a determination of substantial equivalence.
