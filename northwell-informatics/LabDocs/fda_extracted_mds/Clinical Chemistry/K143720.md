# 4. Device Description:

# Dimension Vista® MMB Assay:

The MMB method is a homogeneous sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on ${ \mathsf { L O C l } } ^ { \otimes }$ technology. $\mathsf { L O C l } ^ { \otimes }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated antimass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a beadmass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme-biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme concentration in the sample.

# The Dimension Vista® 1500 System:

The Dimension Vista® 1500 System is a floor model, fully automated, microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument system that uses prepackaged Flex reagent test cartridges to measure a variety of analytes in human body fluids. The system is a multi-functional analytical tool that processes chemical and immunochemical methodologies, utilizing photometric, turbidimetric, chemiluminescence, nephelometric, and integrated ion selective multisensor detection technologies for clinical use. The Dimension Vista® 1500 System can analyze up to 1500 tests/hour (typical, depending on the method mix) using a variety of analytical detection capabilities. Dimension Vista® 1500 System detection technologies are: Photometric, Turbidimetric, Chemiluminescent, Nephelometric, Multisensor, ion selective technology

# 7. Performance Characteristics

# Method Comparison:

A split sample method comparison between the Dimension Vista® MMB assay (K970343) on the modified Dimension Vista® 1500 System with the new PMT and the predicate Dimension Vista® 1500 Integrated System (K051087), was performed with 111 native de-identified human serum and plasma samples across the assay range (1.0 to $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } ,$ .

# Precision:

Reproducibility testing was conducted in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for User Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices EP5-A2. For each test level, a single test from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day for 20 days. The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations were calculated by the analysis of variance method.

Typical precision observed on the modified Dimension Vista® 1500 System is summarized below:

# Linearity

Linearity across the assay range (1.0 to $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) was confirmed according to CLSI EP6-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement, by testing a sample with a high concentration of MMB. This sample was serially diluted with a low concentration sample producing ten test samples ranging from 0 to 313.5 ng/mL. Each dilution was assayed in replicates of five. Data were analyzed using linear regression analysis [x-axis: theoretical concentration versus y-axis: measured concentration]. $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ - and $3 ^ { \mathsf { r d } }$ -order polynomial regressions of the mean observed analyte values vs. expected concentrations were generated. A summary of the linearity data is presented below.

# LoB, LoD and LoQ

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was calculated to be 0.4 ng/mL $[ 0 . 4 \mu \ g / \mathsf { L } ]$ . LoD is the lowest concentration of analyte that can be detected reliably, while LoB is the highest concentration that is likely to be observed for a blank sample. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined to be $0 . 8 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $[ 0 . 8 \mu \ g / \mathsf { L } ]$ . The proportions of false positives (α) was less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ , based on 260 determinations, with 60 blank replicates and 200 low level replicates.

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) corresponds to a within-laboratory imprecision coefficient of variation (CV) of $\leq 2 0 \%$ at a mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme concentration $\leq 1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $1 . 0 \mu \ g / \mathsf { L } ]$ . Refer to Attachment 1 and 2 for a copy of the LOB, LOD and LOQ protocol and line data respectively.

# Spe cificity

Specificity studies were not performed, because specificity is antibody dependent and there were no changes to the MMB assay antibody or concentration of the antibody conjugates. In addition, the Dimension Vista® 1500 System new photomultiplier tube, which is used to count the signal, would not impact assay specificity. Refer to the original 510(k) clearance, k970343 for the specificity data.

# 8. Conclusion:

The proposed modified Dimension Vista® MMB test system for use on the Dimension Vista® 1500 System is substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed device based on intended use, principle and the performance characteristics above.
