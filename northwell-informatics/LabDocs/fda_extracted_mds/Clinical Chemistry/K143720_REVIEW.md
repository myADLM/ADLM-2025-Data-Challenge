# L. Test Principle:

The MMB method is a homogeneous sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI technology. LOCI reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated antimass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The samplessamplesare incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a beadmass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme-biotinylated antibody sandwich. The sensibeadsssensibeadss are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads,

triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing was conducted in accordance with the CLSI Guideline EP5- A2. Testing included three levels of commercially available quality control material at normal, cut-off, and abnormal CK-MB concentrations and two patient plasma pools spiked with method calibrator to normal and abnormal CK-MB concentrations. For each test level, a single test from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day for 20 days with 1 reagent lot and 3 instruments.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity across the assay range (1 to $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) was confirmed according to CLSI Guideline EP6-A. A sample containing a high concentration of MMB was serially diluted with the zero level calibrator to produce 10 test samples ranging from 0 to $3 1 3 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each dilution was assayed in replicates of 5. Data were analyzed using linear regression analysis. A summary of the linearity data is presented below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Dimension Vista MMB Calibrators (liquid, bovine serum albumin based products containing human heart CK-MB isoenzyme) were previously cleared in k970336.

d. Detection limit:

Detection limit studies were carried out according to CLSI EP17-A2.

For the limit of blank (LOB), 4 zero level calibrator samples were tested over 3 days on 2 reagent lots at 5 replicates per day for a total of 60 measurements per lot.

The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were determined using a patient serum sample pool diluted to 5 levels targeted to fall between 0.5 and 3.6 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . 8 replicates per day were run over 5 days with 2 lots for a total of 40 measurements per lot. The LOD and the LOQ were calculated based on withinlaboratory precision profiles according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LOQ corresponds to a within-laboratory imprecision coefficient of variation of $\leq 2 0 \%$ at a MMB concentration of $\leq 1 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Results are shown below:

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { \operatorname { L O B } = 0 . 4 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } } \\ { \ } \\ { \operatorname { L O D } = 0 . 8 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } } \\ { \ } \\ { \operatorname { L O Q } = 1 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } } \end{array}
$$

These studies support a low end for the assay measuring range of $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } -$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Specificity studies were performed as described in k970343. None of the substances tested showed significant interference with the MMB assay. Since there were no changes to the MMB assay antibody or concentration of the antibody conjugates, specificity testing was not repeated.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The Dimension MMB assay was evaluated on the proposed Dimension Vista 1500 System with new PMT and compared to the Dimension MMB assay on the predicate Dimension Vista 1500 Integrated System with the current photomultiplier tube. One hundred eleven (111) de-identified, natural human serum and plasma samples were assayed in duplicate across the assay range; however, only the first result was used in each analysis.
