Device Name Wondfo One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test Strip Wondfo One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test Cassette

Wondfo One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test Strip is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as five (5) days before the expected period, i.e., as early as six (6) days before the day of the missed period.

Some pregnant women will not be able to detect hCG in their urine 5 days before the expected period. If you test negative before your missed period, but think you may still be pregnant, you should test again a few days after your missed period.

Important note regarding positive results:

ecause this test detects low levels of hCG, it is possible that this test may give positive results even if you are not regnant. If you test positive, but think you may not be pregnant, you should check with your doctor.

ll results should be confirmed by your healthcare provider, especially when making decisions about future medical care.

# 9. Standard/Guidance Document Reference (if applicable)

None

# 10. Test Principle

It is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. When the absorbent end is immersed into a sample, the sample is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate (mouse anti-beta HCG monoclonal antibody), flowing across the pre-coated (Goat anti HCG polyclonal antibody) membrane. During the test procedures, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate and forms a complex. The complex migrates along the membrane to the $\mathfrak { a }$ -hCG antibody line (T), and remains captured in the T line. As a result a red colored band develops in the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine, there is no red band in the test zone, indicating a negative result. The Control line should develop in the control zone regardless of the test result.

11. Performance Characteristics

A. Analytical performance a. Sensitivity/ Cut-Off Value

Urine standards containing intact hCG at concentrations of 0, 5, 7.5,8, 9, 10, 15, 20 mIU /ml were prepared in negative urine pool and calibrated against the WHO $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ IS for hCG. Each standard was tested by twelve operators. Each operator tests only one lot one format of the devices of the Wondfo One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test.

b. Stability

Stable at $4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 months based on the accelerated stability study at $5 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and real time stability determination at both $4 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

c. Specificity and cross reactivity High Dose Effect

Negative urine samples were spiked with varying high hCG concentrations ranging from 6,250 to $2 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . The spiked samples were tested by 3 different lots and 3 different operators. No hook effect was observed at these concentrations.

# Effects of hCG $\beta$ -core fragment

Negative and positive samples (0 and $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG in urine) were spiked with various concentrations of $\beta$ -core fragment hCG (63,000, 125,000, 250,000 and $5 0 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L ) }$ . These samples were tested by 3 different lots and 3 different operators. No difference was observed for different lots and different operators. No interference was observed for urine samples with $0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG and $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG for the device except that false negative was observed at the $5 0 0 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ of $\beta$ -core fragment hCG.

Effects of glycoprotein LH, FSH and TSH

Negative and positive samples (0 and $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG in urine) were spiked with various concentrations of other glycoprotein hormones such as LH, FSH, and TSH. Samples were tested using three different lots by three operators. No interference was observed for urine samples with $0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG and $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG for the device at LH concentrations up to $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , FSH concentrations up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , and TSH concentrations up to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu I U / m L }$

# d. Interfering substance

To evaluate potential interference from certain exogenous compounds, each interferent was made at 100X concentrate bulk and spiked in both hCG free and hCG positive (10 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ) samples. Each spiked urine sample was mixed for 5 minutes to ensure a homogeneous solution before testing. Each sample was tested using 3 different lots of the testing kit.

# e. Effect of Urine Specified Gravity and Urine pH

Negative and positive urine samples containing 0, 10 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG were tested at $\mathsf { p H }$ values from 4 to 9 or at density values ranging from 1.000 to1.035 using 3 different lots by 3 different operators. Data show that there is no interference from pH ranging from 4 to 9 and specific gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 of tested urine samples

f. Precision

A precision study was performed using negative human urine samples spiked with varying hCG (commercially available and traceable to the $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } } \mathrm { W H O }$ international standard) concentrations. The spiked urine samples were measured in 10 replicates per day using 3 different lots for each format. Tests were performed for 5 consecutive days by three different operators at each of 3 point-of-care (POC) sites for a total of 9 POC operators. Different set of operators tested each format. Results are shown in the following tables.

# B. Comparison study

Method comparison with predicate device

A method comparison study was performed, comparing the results obtained from the Wondfo One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test to the results from predicate devices. 100 urine samples were collected for each format from 100 women (about half of them were pregnant, early stage at less than 5 weeks) for a total of 300 samples. Samples were randomly collected at various times throughout the day. Ages ranged from 20 to 45 years. The samples were blind labeled. Samples were tested by three different health professionals at each of the 3 POC sites for a total of 9 POC operatorswith the proposed and the predicate devices. Each person could only perform tests for one device format. For example, a person who tested the strips could not test the cassettes or the midstream. Each person tested three different lots of the device and one predicate device at the same time, but not sequentially. Summary results are shown in the following tables.

Results show that $100 \%$ agreements for both positive and negative samples.

Lay person study

A lay user study was performed at three intended use sites with 100 lay persons testing the strip devices, 100 lay persons testing the cassette devices and another set of 100 persons testing the midstream devices (60 by stream method and 40 by dip method). A total of 300 females with diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to $> 5 0$ years performed the study. Urine samples were prepared at $5 \mathrm { m I U / m l }$ , $7 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / m l }$ , $8 . 0 \mathrm { m I U / m l }$ and 10mIU/ml hCG concentrations by spiking hCG into negative pooled urine specimens. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 2 blind labeled samples $\mathrm { \bar { 5 } m I U / m l }$ and $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m l } $ ) and Wondfo’s test kits. Each lay person also tested her own urine sample using the Wondfo device and provided a sample for professional testing. Additional lay-person tests were performed for the spiked hCG $7 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / m l }$ and $8 . 0 \mathrm { m I U / m l }$ samples by 100 lay persons for each device formats.

The results are summarized below.

# Early Pregnancy Test Study

In this study, total 585 urine samples from 65 characterized cycle segments of conceptive cycles were collected from 65 pregnant women. All samples were masked and randomized. Each sample was tested by all three formats of the device. The new device detected $6 8 \%$ positive hCG five days before the Expected Menstrual Period (EMP), and $100 \%$ positive hCG on the day of EMP. No differences were observed between different device formats. The following table is the summary of the data.
