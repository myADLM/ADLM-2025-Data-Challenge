Dimension Tacrolimus Flex® Reagent Cartridge (TAC)

The automated Dimension $\circled{8}$ TAC method uses an immunoassay technique in which free and tacrolimus-bound antibody-enzyme conjugate is separated using magnetic particles. The assay is performed using a method specific Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge. The Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ cartridge contains a pretreatment reagent, antibody-ß-galactosidase conjugate, tacrolimus immobilized on chromium dioxide particles, chlorophenol red ß-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) substrate, and diluent to hydrate the tablets.To perform the TAC assay, a sample cup with a whole blood sample to be analyzed and a TAC Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge are placed appropriately on the Dimension® system. The

Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system mixes and lyses the whole blood sample in the presence of pretreatment reagent 1. This reagent contains a displacer which acts to displace tacrolimus in the sample from binding proteins. The lysed sample is then mixed with the antibody enzyme conjugate. The tacrolimus present in the sample is bound by the tacrolimus antibody. Magnetic particles coated with tacrolimus are added to bind free (unbound) antibody-enzyme conjugate. The reaction mixture is then separated magnetically. Following separation, the supernatant containing the tacrolimus-antibody-enzyme complex is transferred to a cuvette and mixed with the substrate; chlorophenol red ß-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG). ß-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of CPRG to produce chlorophenol red (CPR) that absorbs light maximally at 577 nm. The change in absorbance at 577 nm due to the formation of CPR is directly proportional to the amount of tacrolimus in the patient’s sample and is measured using a bichromatic (577, $7 0 0 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ ) rate technique.

![](images/b4945fcd9eebe1c1da3c78815cf68d38834fc4156f9dc033c7d613d2e1ef7def.jpg)

If the calculated tacrolimus concentration in the patient sample exceeds $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , the test is automatically repeated using pretreatment reagent 2 in place of pretreatment reagent 1. Pretreatment reagent 2 does not contain the displacer so the signal produced represents nonanalyte signal. If significant signal is detected during the second analysis, the potential exists that interference from non-specific signal has impacted the accuracy of the initial test. In this situation, the reported test result is suppressed and replaced by a non-reportable test result message.

The reagents for the Tacrolimus assay are packaged in an 8-well Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Reagent Cartridge represented (top view) in the drawing below:

# 8. Performance Data

# Precision

Reproducibility testing was conducted for the Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ TAC method, at two external evaluation sites in addition to our internal testing. This testing was done in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for User Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices EP5-A2. Typical precision at levels ranging from a mean of 1.8 to $2 7 . 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ was $\leq 6 . 6 \%$ CV for Repeatability and $\leq 1 3 . 1 \%$ CV for Within Lab.

# Linearity

The analytical measuring range of the TAC method was confirmed by the establishment of the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), for the low end, and by a linearity study. The linearity study was performed by mixing of a sample with a known native high tacrolimus concentration $( 4 0 . 3 \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L } )$ with a normal patient pool with no tacrolimus in various ratios. The testing procedure was based on the CLSI Guideline EP 06-A Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement. A linear regression, and a $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ - and $3 ^ { \mathsf { r d } }$ -order polynomial regressions of the mean observed analyte values vs. expected concentrations were performed. The assay range for the Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ TAC method was established as $1 . 0 - 3 0 . 0 \mathsf { n g / m L }$ by these two studies.

# Specificity

Interference and cross-reactivity testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry: EP7-A2. The compounds tested included endogenous compounds, drugs that are commonly co-administered with tacrolimus, and the anticoagulant EDTA. The cross-reactivity testing was done with major tacrolimus metabolite, M I (13-O-desmethyl-tacrolimus), M II (31-O-desmethyl-tacrolimus); as well as minor metabolites M III (15-O-desmethyl-tacrolimus), M IV (12-O-hydroxyl-tacrolimus), M V (15,31-O-didesmethyltacrolimus); and second pass metabolites, M VI (13,31-O-didesmethyl-tacrolimus), M VII (13,15- O-didesmethyl-tacrolimus) and M VIII(unknown name). Testing was done as recommended in the FDA Guidance document “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: cyclosporine and Tacrolimus Assays; Guidance for Industry and FDA” – 09/16/2002. These studies showed that the Dimension® TAC method has low cross-reactivity to the major (M-1) tacrolimus metabolite, and partial cross reactivity to the minor and second pass metabolites of lower prevalence. Coadministered drugs and other compounds tested for interference, exhibited less than $10 \%$ bias at the levels tested.

# Recovery

The recovery capability of the Dimension® TAC assay was challenged across the assay range using samples spiked with USP tacrolimus. All samples met the acceptance criterion of $\leq 1 0 \%$ mean bias in recovery.

# Method Comparison

A method comparison study was performed at two external evaluation sites and internally per the “FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance document: Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus Assays; Guidance for Industry and FDA”. Samples included a nearly equal distribution of liver and kidney transplant patients which covered ${ > } 8 0 \%$ of the assay range $( 1 . 0 - 3 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ . CLSI Guideline EP-9A2 “Method Comparison and Bias Estimation using Patient Samples” was used to develop the study design.

As recommended by the guidance, samples were evaluated, at two external sites as well as internally, versus the predicate, ARCHITECT Tacrolimus Assay (k070820), and an LCMS reference method. An additional comparative method, Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ TACR, was also run at two sites. Analysis was done by Passing – Bablok regression. Least Squares regression was used to compute the correlation coefficient.

The samples range for the proposed Dimension TAC assay, in these studies, was 1.2 – 25.6 ng/mL.

# Calibrator Traceability

Siemens Tacrolimus (TAC) Calibrator is traceable to purified tacrolimus drug through standardization of the LC-MS/MS reference method with gravimetrically prepared standards.

# Calibrator Stability

Unopened vials of Siemens Tacrolimus (TAC) Calibrator are stored frozen (-25 to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ) until the expiration date printed on each carton. Once thawed, assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ .

# 9. Conclusion:

The Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Dimension® TAC method and the ARCHITECT Tacrolimus Assay (k070820) are substantially equivalent based on their intended use, indications for use and performance characteristics. In performance studies, summarized above, the Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ Tacrolimus methods demonstrated performance similar to the predicate ARCHITECT Tacrolimus Assay (k070820).

The modified Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ TAC calibrator and the predicate Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ TACR calibrator (K060503) are also substantially equivalent in design, intended use, principle and performance.
