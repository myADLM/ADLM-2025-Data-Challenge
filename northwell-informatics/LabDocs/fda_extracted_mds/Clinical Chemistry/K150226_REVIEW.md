# Stability:

The shelf-life stability (real time testing) was conducted with three lots of Hematocrit and Metabolite QUALICHECK Level 1 and 2 at $3 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 3 months followed by 25 $^ \circ C$ for a total of 25 months. Multiple time points were tested, with six replicates at each test point. The real-time stability study protocol and acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be adequate. The data indicated that the control solutions are stable for 24 months at $2 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . There is no open-vial (in use) stability claim since the controls can only be used once. The contents should be used immediately after opening.

# Expected Values/Value assignment

Assigned values and control ranges are established based on the true values and predetermined specifications according to the internal procedure. The sponsor provided assigned values and control ranges for each analyte on each of the 3 different analyzers. To determine the assigned values and control ranges for the Hematocrit and Metabolite QUALICHECK, six trays of 1000 ampoules are sampled randomly from the Hematocrit and Metabolite QUALICHECK batch. Five ampoules are sampled from each of the 6 trays and 30 ampoules are sampled from the reference batch. The samples are conditioned and shaken at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a water bath for 6 hours. Measurements of each parameter is performed alternately on the reference ampoules and the sample ampoules and repeated 5 times on one analyzer platform.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable
