# L. Test Principle:

The ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D is a one-step delayed competitive enzyme immunoassay which, after sample pretreatment, is performed entirely in the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D test cup. Sample pretreatment reagents (containing sodium hydroxide) disassociate 25-OH vitamin D from its binding proteins in the test sample. 25-OH vitamin D present in the pretreated sample is bound to 25-OH vitamin D-specific monoclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads. After that, the enzyme-labeled 25-OH vitamin D is added to the reaction mixture. The enzyme-labeled 25-OH vitamin D competes with 25-OH vitamin D for binding to the antibody on magnetic beads in the reaction mixture.

After the second incubation, the magnetic beads are washed to remove the unbound enzymelabeled 25-OH vitamin D and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4- methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled 25-OH vitamin D that binds to the beads is inversely proportional to the 25-OH vitamin D concentration in the test sample. A standard curve is constructed, and unknown 25-OH vitamin D concentrations are calculated using this curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP-6A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. Samples were prepared by diluting a serum sample with a high 25-OH vitamin D concentration with a serum sample with a low 25-OH vitamin D concentration to obtain eleven (11) intermediate concentration levels across the measuring range. Samples were run in four replicates, using one reagent lot. The samples tested ranged from 3.4 to 128.5 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The linear regression of the observed mean concentrations versus the expected concentration was calculated.

The resulting linear regression equation was $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 2 \mathrm { x } . 0 . 5 6 \mathrm { n g } / \mathrm { m L }$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 0$

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from $\mathrm { 4 - 1 2 0 \ n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Standardization and Traceability

The ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D Assay was originally cleared under 510(k) k123131. Tosoh has modified the assay by standardizing the cleared vitamin D assay in accordance with the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP). The VDSP is an international collaborative effort to standardize the laboratory measurement of serum 25-OH vitamin D. This collaboration involves the coordinated efforts of the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST), Ghent University, and other institutions. Please refer to http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the VDSP program.

To achieve standardization against the VDSP recognized Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP), the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D Assay master calibration parameters were aligned to the CDC VDSP by using 107 human serum samples from the CDC VSDP program which were value assigned by the RMP, Ghent University ID-LC-MS/MS and traceable to NIST SRM2972.

# Calibrator traceability and value assignment

This assay is traceable to the isotope dilution-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-/MS/MS) 25-OH Vitamin D Reference Method Procedure (RMP) that is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2972. The calibrator traceability and value assignment are prepared according to an internal procedure.

The values of the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D primary reference materials were assigned to align with CDC VDSP recognized RMP, Ghent University ID-LCMS/MS. The values of the secondary reference material were assigned using the AIA instruments with the primary reference materials as calibrators. The values of the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrators supplied to the user, are assigned using the AIA instruments with the secondary reference materials as calibrators. The ST AIAPACK 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrator target values are listed below:

Calibrator Level $1 \colon 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Calibrator Level 2: $8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Calibrator Level 3: $1 7 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Calibrator Level 4: 33 ng/mL Calibrator Level 5: 66 ng/mL Calibrator Level 6: $1 3 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

The ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay (candidate device) has passed the certification process for the CDC VDSP and a certificate has been provided by the CDC. Please see http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/hs.html for more information on the CDC VDSP certification program.

# Stability

The calibrator shelf-life and open-vial stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were previously reviewed in k123131. Reconstituted calibrators are stable for one day when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) studies were performed according to CLSI EP-17A.

To establish the Limit of Blank (LoB), three blank samples (human serum based calibrator 1) were assayed 60 times using two reagent lots over multiple days on two analyzers. The Limit of Blank was the value at the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile and was determined to be $1 . 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), four low level human serum samples, with concentrations in the range from LoB to approximately 4xLoB, were measured in four replicates per day for three days on two analyzers using two reagent lots for a total of 48 measurements per sample. The LoD was determined to be $3 . 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ using the following equation: $\scriptstyle \mathrm { L o D = L o B + C _ { B } X }$ SD.

To determine the Limit of Quantification (LoQ), four low level human serum samples, with concentrations in ranging from LoB to approximately 5xLoB, were measured in replicates of 8 for five days on one analyzer using one reagent lot for a total of 40 measurements per sample. The LoQ claim is $3 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ based on a functional sensitivity at $20 \%$ CV.

Detection limits results:

The claimed measuring range of the assay is $4 { \cdot } 1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Potential interference from common endogenous substances, as well as potential cross reactivity of substances with a similar chemical structure as 25(OH) vitamin D, was evaluated in k123131.

The package insert contains the following limitation: Do not use hemolyzed samples.   
Hemolyzed samples will give erroneous results.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate device (standardized ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay) to the predicate device (nonstandardized ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay, k123131). A total of 181 native serum samples were tested in singleton on an AIA-200 analyzer. Deming regression analysis was performed and the results are shown below:

Standardized vs non-standardized ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N=181</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Deming regression (95%CI)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.808 (0.801to 0.816)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.26 (-0.15 to 0.67)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9979</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range tested</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.4 to 92.3 ng/mL</td></tr></table>

The slope showed an approximate bias of $- 2 0 \%$ between the candidate device and the predicate device; however, this shift is expected because the purpose of the device modification was to adjust the calibration to better align with the VDSP reference sample concentration target levels. Therefore, test results from the candidate device do not, and are not expected to, directly correlate with test results from the predicate device. Laboratories that use the Tosoh ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D should be aware of the significantly different performance of the modified assay.

An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy between the candidate device and the RMP, University of Ghent’s ID-LC/MS/MS method. The method comparison against the RMP was the basis of the substantial equivalence determination. In this method comparison study, a total of 111 unaltered serum samples value assigned by ID-LC-MS/MS RMP (Ghent University) were tested in singleton on an AIA-200 analyzer using the candidate device. Results from the Weighted Deming regression analysis is shown below:

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The reference range study was conducted with reference to the CLSI C28-A3 guideline. A total of 252 serum specimens from 111 females and 141 males from ages 21 to 86 years were assayed in singleton utilizing the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay on the AIA-2000 analyzer. The specimens were obtained from the diverse regions of the United States to represent a broad spectrum of UV light exposure in the intended use population. The samples were obtained from apparently healthy light skin and dark skin individuals who were not taking Vitamin D supplements of more than 2000 IU. Specimens with abnormal PTH, TSH, Calcium, Magnesium and Phosphorus were excluded from the data. The $9 5 \%$ reference interval was calculated by a non-parametric method and the following range was obtained:

Normal Adults: $1 2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $6 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $\mathrm { ( n = 2 5 2 ) }$ )
