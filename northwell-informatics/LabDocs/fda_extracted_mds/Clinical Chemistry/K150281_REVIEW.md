# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for Use below.

2. Indications(s) for use:

The StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System is intended for point-of-care, in vitro diagnostic, multiple-patient use for the quantitative determination of glucose in capillary finger stick, venous whole blood, arterial whole blood, neonate arterial whole blood and neonate heel stick specimens.

The StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System is also intended for use in the quantitative determination of glucose in venous whole blood, arterial whole blood, neonatal heel stick and neonatal arterial whole blood samples throughout all hospital and all professional healthcare settings.

The system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices when performing a capillary finger stick or neonate heel stick.

It is not intended for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is indicated for use in determining dysglycemia.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only

For in vitro diagnostic use only

Capillary whole blood specimens (e.g. obtained by fingerstick) should not be used in patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy because of the potential for preanalytical collection error and specifically in patients with decreased peripheral blood flow, as it may not reflect the true physiological state. Examples include, but are not limited to, severe hypotension, shock, hyperosmolar-hyperglycemia (with or without ketosis) and severe dehydration.

The system has not been evaluated for use with neonate venous blood.

Temperature and humidity extremes - Test results may be inaccurate when test strips are stored outside of the storage and handling conditions.

Altitudes above 15,000 feet (4500 meters) above sea level have not been evaluated.

Specimens - Only fresh whole blood or whole blood collected in lithium heparin collection devices should be used for arterial and venous specimens.

Fluoride, EDTA, Sodium, and Ammonium blood collection devices should not be used.

Use only whole blood. Do not use serum or plasma.

Should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices

# L. Test Principle:

The Nova StatStrip Hospital Meter System is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
