# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None was referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value Assignment:

The mean values and the corresponding $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ ranges printed in the package inserts were derived from replicate analyses and are specific for each lot of product. The tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of this lot of control. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use those provided only as guides.

# Stability Studies:

Real time stability studies were performed to establish thawed and opened stability claims. Thawed and open vial stability when stored at $2 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ to $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ is as follows: Nterminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) is15 days, Troponin 1 is 10 days, B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) is 8 days, Troponin T is 4 days and all other analytes are 20 days. Frozen aliquot stability is 30 days at when stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ { o } C } }$ to $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Accelerated stability studies were performed for establishing the shelf life stability. The shelf life of the Liquichek Cardiac Markers Plus Control LT is 36 months from the date of manufacture when stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Real time studies are ongoing. Shelf life and open-vial stability studies protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Expected values for the representative analyzers are provided as a guide in the labeling for each specific lot.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
