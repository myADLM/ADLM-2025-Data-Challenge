# I. Device Description:

ADVIA Centaur TSH3-Ultra (TSH3-UL) kit consists of the following reagents:

Ultra-Lite Reagent- bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated to monoclonal anti- TSH $( \sim 0 . 3$ $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ labeled with acridinium ester in HEPES buffered saline, mouse IgG, BSA, goat serum, surfactant, and preservatives.

Solid Phase Reagent - anti-fluorescein monoclonal mouse antibody covalently linked to paramagnetic particles (PMP) $( \mathrm { { \sim } 8 5 \ \mu g / m L ) }$ in HEPES buffered saline, BSA, goat serum, surfactant, and preservative.

Ancillary Well Reagent – Fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated to monoclonal anti-TSH $( \sim 3$ $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ in HEPES buffered saline, mouse IgG, BSA, goat serum, surfactant, and preservative.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Defining, Establishing and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory;   
Approved Guideline - Third Edition (CLSI C28-A3).

# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA Centaur TSH3-Ultra assay is a third-generation assay that employs anti-FITC monoclonal antibody covalently bound to paramagnetic particles, and FITC-labeled antiTSH capture monoclonal antibody, and a tracer consisting of a proprietary acridinium ester and an anti-TSH monoclonal antibody conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) for chemiluminescent detection. A direct relationship exists between the amount of TSH present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A pediatric reference range study using population age from 1 month old to 20 years old was conducted. Serum samples were collected at 8 U.S. sites to be representative of the U.S. population diversity. Data from a total of 442 pediatric patients (94 infants, 198 children, and 150 adolescents) from one ADVIA Centaur analyzer and three reagent lots were analyzed to establish the ADVIA Centaur TSH-3 Ultra assay reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile were used as the pediatric reference ranges. The reference interval for the infant group was calculated by performing a log-transformation of the raw data followed by the application of the robust symmetric method to the transformed data. This approach was selected to be most appropriate for the smaller sample size as the data from this population was highly skewed to the right and a transformation was necessary to obtain a normal distribution. The sponsor has added language to their package insert explaining the uncertainty in the value for the upper limit of the reference range. A non- parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents based on the CLSI C28-A3 recommendation because the sample size was greater than 120. Reference ranges are summarized in the table below.
