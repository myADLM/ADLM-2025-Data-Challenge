3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only

For in vitro diagnostic use only

Capillary whole blood specimens (e.g. obtained by fingerstick) should not be used in patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy because of the potential for preanalytical collection error and specifically in patients with decreased peripheral blood flow, as it may not reflect the true physiological state. Examples include, but are not limited to, severe hypotension, shock, hyperosmolar-hyperglycemia (with or without ketosis) and severe dehydration.

The system has not been evaluated for use with neonate venous blood.

Temperature and humidity extremes - Test results may be inaccurate when test strips are stored outside of the storage and handling conditions.

Use of the system outside of traditional healthcare settings (e.g., ambulance services) is limited to the following ambient temperature range: ${ 5 9 } { - } 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ ( $1 5 - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Outside of this range, the system will generate an E-2 Temperature Error code and a blood glucose result will not be obtained.

Altitudes above 15,000 feet (4500 meters) above sea level have not been evaluated.

Specimens - Only fresh whole blood or whole blood collected in lithium heparin collection devices should be used for arterial and venous specimens.

Fluoride, EDTA, Sodium, and Ammonium blood collection devices should not be used.

Use only whole blood. Do not use serum or plasma.

Should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices

4. Special instrument requirements:

StatStrip Express Glucose Hospital Meter

# I. Device Description:

The Nova Biomedical StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System consists of a hand held StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter, StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter Test Strips, StatStrip Glucose Control Solutions (Levels 1, 2, 3, sold separately), StatStrip Glucose Linearity Kit solutions (Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, sold separately) and Instructions for Use Manual. The test strip contains a reagent (glucose oxidase) that reacts with the glucose in the test sample. The sample is applied to a reagent test strip, which is then analyzed with the meter. The test strip contains glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenase, which reacts with the glucose in the test sample. The reaction produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample, and the electrical current is detected by the meter and displayed to the user as a glucose value.

Each StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter Test Strip contains glucose oxidase (Aspergillus sp.) ${ \mathrm { > } } 1 . 0$ IU, mediator and buffer ${ \tt > } 2 0 ~ \mu \ g$ , and other nonreactive substances.

Three levels of control solutions (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) and five levels of linearity solutions (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4, Level 5) are available for use with the StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System and were previously cleared in k060345.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None.

# L. Test Principle:

The Nova StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System measures glucose levels using disposable test strips and a handheld meter. The test principle is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and capillary action. Blood is applied to the reagent portion of a test strip via capillary action. The system quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during a reaction in the reagent portion of the test strip are transferred from the blood to test strip electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current in the test strip electrodes is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System that is the subject of this submission is identical to the device cleared in k070960. Performance of the StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System cleared in k070960 was established in k060345 and k063821. The StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System uses identical technology, software measurement algorithm, user workflow, test strips, quality control, and linearity solution as the predicate device, the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System (originally cleared in k060345 and modified in k063821 and k132121). This submission was for the expansion of the intended use population for the StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System to add the use of venous whole blood, arterial whole blood, neonatal heel stick and neonatal arterial whole blood samples throughout all hospital and all professional healthcare settings.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity:

Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

The performance of the StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System in hospitalized patients—including potential interference from medications and medical conditions—was established in k132121, in a clinical study performed with 1698 patients throughout 5 hospitals. This study evaluated potential interfering effects of over 250 medical condition subclasses and 8000 medications. No specific medical conditions or medications were determined to have an interfering effect on the device.

# CLIA WAIVER

The StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System previously obtained CLIA WAIVER by application on October 30, 2009. Studies performed to support CLIA waiver for this device were reanalyzed to evaluate whether the data would meet new and clinically appropriate Limits of Erroneous Results (LER) and Allowable Total Error (ATE) for the sponsor’s new intended use population (all hospitalized patients). The analysis demonstrates that the previous CLIA Waived studies in venous and arterial whole blood meet appropriate waiver standards for hospitalized patients. The percentage of arterial and venous data over the entire measurement range that falls within the ATE zone is $9 8 . 1 \%$ . None of the results for any sample type were in the LER zone.

Therefore, the sponsor’s CLIA waived status is extended to cover the new intended use claims cleared in this current submission.

4. Clinical cut-off:

Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: The sponsor included the following Expected Values from the literature1 for normal glucose levels in their test strip labeling:

The normal adult fasting blood glucose range for a non-diabetic person is less than 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) and less than $1 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (7.77 mmol/L) 1-2 hours after meals.
