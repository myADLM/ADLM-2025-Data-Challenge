# L. Test Principle:

Cholesterol esters in serum are completely hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to free cholesterol and free fatty acids. The cholesterol liberated by the esterase, plus any endogenous free cholesterol, are oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to yield hydrogen peroxide $\left( \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } _ { 2 } \right)$ , which then reacts oxidatively with phenol and 4-aminoantipyrine (AAP) in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, producing a red colored quinoneimine complex. The amount of colored complex formed, determined by quantitatively measuring the increase in absorbance at $5 1 0 \mathrm { n m } / 7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision of the Cholesterol test system was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A2. Two reagent lots and 2 RX Daytona Plus analyzers were utilized in the study. A native patient serum pool, altered serum sample pools, control pools and a calibrator serum sample were all evaluated. Two replicates of the serum samples were tested on two separate runs per day for 20 days, leading to the generation of 80 data points for each sample. The results of one representative lot are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed following CLSI EP6-A by evaluating a dilution series of serum samples containing the cholesterol analyte. Samples were prepared by mixing a high spiked serum sample with a low diluted serum sample to obtain 11 samples with concentrations spanning the claimed measuring range, 25 to $6 1 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each level was analyzed in replicates of five using two lots of Randox Cholesterol reagent on one RX Daytona Plus analyzer system. The results of the linear regression analysis of one representative lot are shown below:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 \mathbf { x } - 5 . 4 9 ; \mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9
$$

The RX Daytona Plus analyzer is capable of auto diluting with a 1:15 dilution factor when measuring samples $> 6 1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and an auto-dilution study was conducted against a manual dilution and all results were within a pre-specified acceptance criteria.

The reportable range of the assay is $2 5 - 6 1 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The controls and calibrator to be used with this assay are manufactured by Randox Laboratories. Calibrator (Randox Calibration Serum Level 3) and controls (Randox Assayed Multisera Level 2 and Level 3) were previously cleared in k053153 and k942458 respectively. Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 is traceable to Cholesterol reference material NIST 1952a.

# Stability Studies:

Stability of the Cholesterol kit is based on real-time stability study data of three kit lots. The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The real time stability study supports a shelf life stability of 24 months when materials are stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Once opened, the kit is stable for 28 days at 2- $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

A detection limit study was performed according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by running 4 blank samples (serum based matrix free of analyte) in 20 replicates across 3 days giving 60 determinations in total on the RX Daytona Plus analyzer, and LoB was the value at the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by evaluating 4 diluted patient serum sample pools in 20 replicates across 3 days for a total of 60 data points on a RX Daytona Plus analyzer. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by running 4 diluted patient serum sample pools in 12 replicates across 5 days yielding a total of 60 results. Sponsor defines the LoQ as the lowest analyte concentration where the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ is $\leq$ $20 \%$ .

The claimed measuring range is $2 5 - 6 1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the Randox Cholesterol Assay.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP-7A2 with 2 different concentrations of cholesterol ( $\mathrm { 1 5 0 m g / d L }$ and $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ using one RX Daytona Plus analyzer and one reagent lot. Samples with added potential interferents were tested in replicates of 10, and the mean recoveries were compared to samples without interferent. The sponsor defined no significant interference as $\leq 1 0 \%$ difference from the control sample.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2. A total of 107 serum patient samples spanning the range of 25 to $5 9 9 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were analyzed with the candidate cholesterol assay on the Randox Daytona Plus system versus the predicate device. Of the 107 samples, 9 samples were diluted or spiked. All samples were analyzed in singlicate. Results of the linear regression are presented below:

<table><tr><td>Slope (95% CI)</td><td>Intercept (95% CI)</td><td>R</td></tr><tr><td>1.00 (0.98 to 1.01)</td><td>-4.77 (-7.99 to -1.57)</td><td>0.997</td></tr></table>

# b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was conducted using matched sets of serum and plasma (lithium-heparin and $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ plasma) samples which spanned the reportable range of the assay. The samples (6 diluted and 4 spiked) were analyzed on the RX Daytona Plus analyzer. The details and results of the study using simple linear regression analysis are as follows:
