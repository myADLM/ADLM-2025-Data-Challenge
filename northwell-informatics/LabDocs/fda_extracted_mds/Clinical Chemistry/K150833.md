Dear Yi Liu:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

Device Name iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System

Indications for Use (Describe)   
The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System consists of the iHealth Align Glucose meter (BG1), iHealth Blood Glucose Test Strips (AGS-1000I), and the iHealth Gluco-Smart App mobile application as the display component of the iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System. The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, or thigh. The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System is intended for self testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The iHealth Align GlucoMonitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

# 8.0 Performance summary

Software validation and user study has been performed to establish the performance, the functionality and the reliability characteristics of the new device. Testing of iHealth Gluco-Smart App included system test and unit test.

# 9.0 Comparison to the predicate device and the conclusion

The proposed device is similar with the predicate device iHealth BG1, they are both for single patient use, they use the same test strip, and can test the blood glucose at the alternative site. The hematocrit range, the altitude and the use function are all the same. However, the proposed devices, BG1, BG5/BG5L systems can be operated with the claimed platforms.

iHealth Gluco-Smart App can operate with both iHealth BG1 Align Gluco-Monitoring System and iHealth BG5/BG5L wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System, The style of the app are also changed. Some new function are added ,such as A Blood Glucose summary according to the data saved in database should be displayed, People can share the data by Facebook.

However, the test in this submission provides demonstration that these small differences do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness.
