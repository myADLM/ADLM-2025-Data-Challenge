The labeling provides instructions on when quality control testing should be performed.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Software: Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes.

2. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) (radiated emissions and immunity) testing: As established in k120813

3. Usability Questionnaire: Using representative Apple platforms, a 40 participant study was conducted to verify users with average education and computer skills and no prior knowledge of the system can use the new device without direct instruction or training. Study results demonstrated that participants rated the ease of use of the devices as normal or above.

4. Data transmission accuracy: Demonstrated, using representative Apple platforms and 5 of each meter (iHealth Align, iHealth BG5 and BG5L), that sent and received data matched.

# 5. Infection Control and Robustness Studies:

The iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System, iHealth BG5 Wireless Smart GlucoMonitoring System, and BG5L Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System are intended for single-patient use. The sponsor stated that the disinfection efficacy for the meters was established in k110017 (BG5 and BG5L) and in k123935 (Align Mini) and that the materials comprising the candidate meters are identical. CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA registration #46781-8) were previously validated through disinfection efficacy studies demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) virus using materials comprising the meter.

Robustness testing was previously established in k133790 (Align Mini) and k123935 (BG5 and BG5L) demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 11,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

The sponsor provides a disposable sleeve for use with the iPod or iPhone to be used with each test strip, not to be reused and to be disposed of as bio-hazard, therefore no disinfection studies were required of the iPod or iPhone. The sleeve is intended to be used with the iHealth Align Gluco-Monitoring System.
