C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Medtronic Minimed, Inc. MiniMed Connect System   
D. Type of Test or Tests performed:

Continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump secondary display device

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

MiniMed Connect is a secondary display of continuous glucose monitor and/or insulin pump data on a suitable consumer electronic device for insulin pump patients and their care partners. This system is designed as an optional accessory to compatible sensor-augmented pump systems. MiniMed Connect consists of a MiniMed Connect app (for a local secondary display), the CareLink Connect module of CareLink Personal (for a remote secondary display), and the MiniMed Connect uploader (for data transmission to the local app).

The MiniMed Connect uploader is a small, battery-powered, ambulatory device that is carried with the patient in near proximity to the insulin pump. Its rechargeable battery is charged as needed (approximately once a day) using a USB Charger that accompanies the device. The MiniMed Connect uploader receives continuous glucose monitor and/or insulin pump data from the sensor-augmented insulin pump using a proprietary 916.5 MHz RF, and then converts it into a $2 . 4 \ : \mathrm { G H z }$ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) format. This BLE formatted data can then be read by the MiniMed Connect app installed on a compatible consumer electronics device with BLE capabilities.

The MiniMed Connect app reads the BLE data transmission and displays it on the patient’s compatible consumer electronic device. The MiniMed Connect app then uploads the continuous glucose monitor and/or insulin pump data to CareLink Connect, the remote monitoring module of CareLink Personal. Authorized care partners can access CareLink Connect to view the patient’s continuous glucose monitor and/or insulin pump data through an Internet-enabled consumer electronic device for the purpose of passive monitoring.

Accessories associated with this system include:

· USB Charger (for charging the MiniMed Connect uploader)

2. Principles of Operation:

The MiniMed Connect System is a real time secondary display for Continuous Glucose Monitor data and Insulin Pump data. The MiniMed Connect System is an accessory to compatible Continuous Glucose Monitors and Insulin Pumps.

The MiniMed Connect System local mobile application is currently supported on the Apple iOS Operating System version 8.

The MiniMed Connect System web-based remote application, CareLink Connect, can be accessed from any internet browser with an internet-connected consumer electronic device (e.g. iPhone, iPod Touch, Android Phone, personal computer (PC), Macintosh, etc.).

# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

MiniMed Connect is intended to provide a secondary display of continuous glucose monitoring and/or insulin pump data on a suitable consumer electronic device to care partners and users of a MiniMed 530G system or Paradigm REAL-Time Revel system for the purposes of passive monitoring.

MiniMed Connect system is not intended to replace the real-time display of continuous glucose monitor and/or insulin pump data on the primary display device (i.e., the sensor-augmented pump). All therapy decisions should be based on blood glucose measurements obtained from a blood glucose meter.

The MiniMed Connect is not intended to analyze or modify the continuous glucose monitor data and/or insulin pump data that it receives. Nor is it intended to control any function of the connecting continuous glucose monitor system and/or insulin pump. The MiniMed Connect is not intended to serve as a replacement for a primary display device for the continuous glucose monitoring system and/or insulin pump data. The MiniMed Connect is not intended to receive information directly from the sensor or transmitter of a continuous glucose monitoring system.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a) Accuracy: Not applicable.   
b) Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.   
c) Linearity: Not applicable.   
d) Carryover: Not applicable.   
e) Interfering Substances: Not applicable.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

1. The sponsor performed a bench study in order to demonstrate that the device transmitted and stored accurately and securely. Testing was also carried out to verify that corrupted data could not be displayed. All data was shown to be accurately transmitted by the device. It was verified that the data is stored on the mobile device in an encrypted state, and that it is transmitted over secure channels. When purposely corrupted data was transmitted to the application, the application correctly did not display that information.

2. The MiniMed Connect system was evaluated for usability using a representative population. Study participants consisted of twenty-five (25)

patients with diabetes mellitus, currently undergoing treatment with a MiniMed Paradigm pump (i.e., Revel or 530G) and with continuous glucose monitoring capability.

Study participants were presented with typical tasks associated with use of the device. Selected tasks that were identified to be either high or medium usability risk during task analysis were assessed. Use errors and near errors committed by participants during the course of the study were collected. The type, frequency, and anticipated consequences of these errors were assessed and assigned a usability risk severity according to the task analysis. Subjective feedback was also collected on the observed errors and included in the analysis.

The use errors reported during the study were judged to be nuisance issues, and involved users having difficulty pairing the device with the mobile app. These errors were primarily caused by users not reading the provided user guide before attempting a task.

Based on the results of this testing, the MiniMed Connect system was determined to be adequately safe and effective for its intended use and the intended environment.

3. The results of a Flesch-Kincaid readability analysis for the MiniMed Connect system user guide were provided. The user guide achieves a score of Flesch-Kincaid grade level equivalent to 8th grade, which is in the acceptable range.

4. The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that mechanical, electrical, and electromagnetic testing had been evaluated and found to be compliant.

# K. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
