# 5. Description of the Device:

The Bio-Rad D-100™ HbA1c utilizes principles of ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A high-pressure pumping system delivers a buffer solution to an analytical cartridge and detector. Whole blood samples undergo an automatic hemolysis and dilution process before being introduced into the analytical flow path. Prediluted samples are identified based upon the use of a microvial adapter in the sample rack, and the automatic dilution step is omitted.

A programmed buffer gradient of increasing ionic strength delivers the sample to the analytical cartridge where the hemoglobin species are separated based upon their ionic interactions with the cartridge material and the buffer gradient. The separated hemoglobin species then pass through the flow cell where changes in the absorbance are measured at 415 nm and recorded as a digital chromatogram.

The software performs an analysis of the hemoglobin peaks in the chromatogram, recording information including retention time, peak area, and relative are percent. Any peaks that are identified as the target analyte(s) are calibrated before generating a sample report and chromatogram for each sample. The software includes an optional feature (Advisor) that compares the sample report against a set of rules that are programmed to take user-specified actions.

The D-100™ HbA1c test is designed to be used on the D-100™ Hemoglobin Testing System.

# b. Linearity

A linearity study was performed per CLSI EP06-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measuring Procedures; A Statistical Approach. Linearity across the reportable range was performed using low $3 . 5 \%$ HbA1c) and high ( $20 \%$ HbA1c) EDTA whole blood patient samples. These samples were mixed together in varying ratios. The measured values were compared to the theoretical values based upon the dilution factor. Polynomial regression analysis (for first, second, and third order polynomials) were performed to determine the statistical significance of non-linearity. The higher order coefficients were found not to be significant and linearity was demonstrated.

$\%$ HbA1c (NGSP) using the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ HbA1c test has been demonstrated linear from 3.5 $- 2 0 . 0 \%$ HbA1c with the maximum measured difference of

$\pm 0 . 0 9 \%$ between the predicted $1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ and $2 ^ { \mathsf { r d } }$ order results as shown in Table 11 below. Mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) has been demonstrated as linear from 15 – 195 mmol/mol with the maximum measured difference of $\pm 0 . 9 \%$ (or $+ / - 0 . 9 4 \mathrm { { m m o l / m o l } ) }$ ) as shown in Table 12 below.

d. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (calibrators)

The D-100 HbA1c test standardization is traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference calibrators. The D-100 HbA1c assay is NGSP certified. The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org. The derived results of $( \% )$ from the NGSP correlation are calculated from the individual quantitative results for Hemogloblin A1c (HbA1c). The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation NGSP $( \% ) = 0 . 0 9 1 4 8 \times$ IFCC (mmol/mol) + 2.152. HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP equivalent units $( \% )$ and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).

Calibrator Materials:

Value assignment for D-100™ HbA1c Calibrators are traceable to IFCC reference method and can be transferred to DCCT/NGSP by calculation.

Stability:   
Shelf life claims: Un-opened calibrators can be stored at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ until the expiration date or for 24 months.   
Open-vial claims: The recommended storage condition for in-use calibrators is one day. On-board stability for the D-100 HbA1c calibrator pack and reagents demonstrated 90 days stability on the D-100 Hemoglobin Testing System.

e. Analytical specificity:

i.) Endogenous Interference

An Endogenous Interference study was performed per CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Two EDTA whole blood sample pools were evaluated using a low level whole blood sample with a concentration ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ HbA1c and a high level whole blood sample with a concentration of HbA1c of ${ \sim } 8 . 0 \%$ .

Conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin and glucose, available in pure form, were obtained and stock solutions prepared at $1 0 \times$ the intended test concentration. The $1 0 \times$ stock solution of the test substance was pipetted into a low whole blood sample pool (at ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ HbA1c) and a high whole blood sample pool $( \sim 8 . 0 \%$ HbA1c), making the test pool. Ten replicates of each pool prepared with the test and control samples were analyzed using the D$1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ HbA1c on the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Hemoglobin Testing System.

Rheumatoid factor, lipemia and total protein were not available as pure standards therefore serum samples with known concentration of these compounds were used. The test pool was prepared by mixing the serum sample known to have a high test substance concentration with a whole blood non-variant sample such that the concentration of test substance in the final mixture would be at the desired level. Ten replicates of each pool prepared with the test and control samples were analyzed using the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ HbA1c on the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Hemoglobin Testing System.

Significant interference was defined as $a \pm 7 \%$ change in %HbA1c value from the control. Results in Table 17 showed no significant interference up to the stated concentrations.

ii.) Drug Interference:

A Drug Interference study was performed based per CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Two EDTA whole blood sample pools were evaluated using a low level whole blood sample with a concentration ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ HbA1c and a high level whole blood sample with a concentration of ${ \sim } 8 . 0 \%$ HbA1c. Test samples were prepared by spiking each drug at the interferent concentration shown in Table 18. Ten replicates of each drug prepared with the test and control samples were analyzed using the D-100™ HbA1c on the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Hemoglobin Testing System.

Significant interference was defined as a more than $\pm \ : 7 \%$ change in %HbA1c value from the control. No significant interference was observed at therapeutic levels up to the stated concentrations in Table 18 on the following page.

iii.) Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives:

A Hemoglobin Derivatives Interference study was performed based on CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Potential interference from Acetylated hemogloblin (Hb), Carbamylated hemoglobin (Hb) and Labile HbA1c were evaluated using a low level whole blood EDTA sample with a concentration ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ HbA1c and a high level whole blood EDTA sample with a concentration of ${ \sim } 8 . 0 \%$ HbA1c. The potentially interfering hemoglobin derivatives were spiked into the low and high level blood samples and each sample was analyzed using ten replicates each in the same analytical run on the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Hemoglobin Testing System with the D-100™HbA1c.

Significant interference was defined as more than a $\pm 7 \%$ change in HbA1c value from the control. The test result conclusions are as follows:

Acetylated Hb- up to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ does not interfere with this assay. Carbamylated Hb – up to $5 \%$ does not interfere with this assay. Labile A1c- up to ${ 1 2 0 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of glucose does not interfere with this assay.

Results showed there was no cross reactivity with these substances at physiological levels.

iv.) Hemoglobin Variant Study:

A Hemoglobin Variant study was performed using specific variant samples known to contain hemoglobin variants S, C, E, D, A2 and F. Two whole blood EDTA patient samples containing an HbA1c ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ and $\sim 8 \%$ and the appropriate hemoglobin variant were tested. Testing of the samples containing hemoglobin variants S, C, E, D , A2 and F were performed in duplicate. Testing of the samples was performed using the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ HbA1c on the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Hemoglobin Testing System and compared to results obtained by a NGSP reference method that has been demonstrated to be free from the hemoglobin interferent.

# Conclusion:

The information and data in this $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ document demonstrate that the D-100™ HbA1c test as performed on the D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Hemoglobin Testing System is an accurate, reliable, precise test that correlates well with current cleared methods and NGSP standardized testing for the quantitation of HbA1c. The contents of this submission demonstrates that the D-100™ HbA1c test as performed on the $\mathsf { D } \mathsf { - } 1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Hemoglobin Testing System is substantially equivalent to its predicate device, VARIANT II TURBO HbA1c Kit – 2.0 and, therefore, safe and effective for its intended use. The performance criteria as stipulated by the Special Controls requirements for HbA1c systems that diagnose diabetes have clearly been met. The D- $1 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ HbA1c must be found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate and, therefore, cleared by the agency for the intended use requested.
