# L. Test Principle:

The Dimension Vista LOCI Total Testosterone (TTST) Flex method is a homogeneous, competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI technology. LOCI reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and labeled testosterone antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a testosterone analog and contains a chemiluminescent dye.

The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. Chemibeads and labeled testosterone antibody are added sequentially to the reaction vessel. Testosterone from the patient sample competes with the testosterone-analogchemibeads for a limited amount of labeled testosterone antibody. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotinylated portion of the labeled testosterone antibody to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen for the Sensibeads which diffuses to the Chemibeads triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is an inverse function of the concentration of total testosterone in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were performed for serum and Li-heparin, Na-heparin, and K2- EDTA plasma samples. One high sample and one low pool for each sample type were combined in varying ratios to produce ten dilutions across the claimed measuring range of 8.0 to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The expected values were calculated based on the dilution factor used. The following linear regression equations were obtained:

Serum: $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 7 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 8$

Li-Heparin: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9$

Na-Heparin: $y = 0 . 9 8 x + 0 . 1 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 6$

K2-EDTA: $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 6 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 1 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9$

The linearity data supports the claimed measuring range of $8 . 0 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L } .$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The Dimension Vista Testosterone Calibrator is traceable to a primary reference method, CDC Reference Method: ID-LC/MS/MS. Traceability was verified by serum sample method comparison on the Dimension Vista against the CDC reference method, ID-LC/MS/MS.

The sponsor has obtained certification in the CDC Hormone Standardization (HoST) program. Please see CDC Hormone Standardization program at http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/hs.html.

Value Assignment: Each lot of calibrator is assigned during manufacturing with a Testosterone Masterpool, which is traceable to CDC ID-LC/MS/MS. The lot value assignment of the calibrators are determined by measuring 5 replicates of each calibrator, during 3 runs, over 3 days, using 3 reagent lots and 3 analyzers. The calibrator results must meet internal specifications before release. The calibrator target concentrations are as follows:

Level A: $0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ Level B: $2 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ Level C: 50 ng/dL Level D $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ Level E: $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ Level F: 1100 ng/dL

Stability: Real-time open-vial and shelf-life stability studies were performed to determine the stability of the Dimension Vista Testosterone Calibrator. The study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The stability studies support the sponsor’s shelf-life stability claim of 12 months when stored at -15 to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once reconstituted, the calibrators are stable for 14 days when stored on board the Dimension Vista System. Reconstituted calibrators are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available control material in the package insert labeling.

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB):

The LoB was estimated using a nonparametric approach. Six blank samples (testosterone stripped serum) were tested on three reagent lots on one analyzer over three days, for a total of 90 measurements. The LoB for each lot was taken as the rank position at the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile calculated from the following equation, Rank position $\mathrm { \Omega } = 0 . 5 + 0 . 9 5 \mathrm { B }$ , where $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { B } } =$ total number of replicates. The largest result across lots was taken as the LoB. The LoB was determined to be $1 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

Limit of Detection (LoD):

The LoD was calculated parametrically for each of three reagent lots using 8 individual serum samples with low endogenous testosterone (0.6 to $8 . 5 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ ). For each reagent lot tested, 120 replicate determinations were made over three days. The LoD was calculated using the following equation: $\mathrm { L o D } { = } \mathrm { L o B } + \mathrm { c } _ { \mathrm { p } } \mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { L } } ,$ where $\mathrm { c _ { p } }$ is a multiplier to give the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of a normal distribution and $\mathrm { L }$ is the total number of all low level ample results across all reagent lots. The maximum observed LoD across all reagent lots was taken as the LoB estimate value. The LoD was determined to be $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):

The LoQ was determined using 8 individual low-level serum samples $( 0 . 6 { - } 8 . 5 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ and 5 low-level plasma samples for each plasma sample type (Li-Hep, Na-Hep, K2- EDTA). All sample types were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day for 20 days for a total of 80 measurements per sample. The LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that can be reproducibly measured with a total precision CV of $\leq 2 0 \%$ .

The maximum LoQ for two lots tested for serum was 4.5 ng/dL

The maximum LoQ for the two lots tested for sodium-heparin and lithium-heparin sample types was $6 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ ; and for the K2- EDTA sample type was $5 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$

The sponsor lists the following detection limits in the assay package insert labeling:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.0 ng/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.0 ng/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.0 ng/dL</td></tr></table>

The claimed measuring range of the assay is 8.0 to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Interference:

The Testosterone assay was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-A2. Hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia and several specific interferents were tested using a paired-difference approach. Serum and plasma samples containing the substance to be tested and control sample not containing the substances were spiked with approximately 50 and $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ of testosterone. Five replicates were tested for each test and control sample. The sponsor defines significant interference as greater than $10 \%$ difference in the test sample results as compared to the control samples. The results are summarized in the table below:

The sponsor includes the following cross-reactivity claims in the assay package insert labeling:

“Nandrolone decanoate (19-nortestosterone) shows significant cross-reactivity with the TTST assay. Do not use samples from patients under Nandrolone treatment.”

# HAMA interference study:

Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) interference was evaluated according to CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Samples tested consisted of individual human serum samples with low and high endogenous HAMA. The samples were spiked with two levels of testosterone, approximately $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ and $7 0 0 { - } 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ testosterone. The sponsor defined significant interference $a \mathbf { s } \geq \pm 1 0 \%$ difference between the tested sample and the control sample. Five replicates were run on each sample. The results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HAMA Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Testosterone Level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Interference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1248 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>149 ng/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-4%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>285 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>156 ng/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-2%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1248 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>887 ng/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-6%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>285 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>746 ng/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-5%</td></tr></table>

The sponsor includes the following limitation in the labeling regarding heterophilic antibody (HAMA) interference:

“Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies, of which human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) are the most commonly encountered. Heterophilic antibodies such as HAMA may cause falsely decreased or elevated results in immunoassay tests. Siemens characterized the impact of HAMA in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 and this testing indicated $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias with the TTST assay. While the TTST reagent has been designed to mitigate interference from heterophilic antibodies, complete elimination of these interferences from all patient specimens cannot be guaranteed. A test result that is inconsistent with the patient’s clinical presentation and history should be interpreted with caution.”

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was conducted to compare the Dimension Vista TTST assay to the predicate device, the Roche Elecsys Testosterone II assay. Two-Hundred and fifteen (215) unaltered patient serum samples were tested using one reagent lot. The sample results on the candidate device ranged from 11.0 to $9 8 2 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . Passing Bablok was used to analyze the data and the following regression data was obtained:

$$
\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 0 \mathrm { x } - 2 . 6 , \mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 9
$$

The slope showed an approximate bias of - $- 1 0 \%$ between the candidate device and the predicate device; however, this shift is expected because the purpose of the device modification was to adjust the calibration to better align with the CDC reference sample concentration target levels. Therefore, test results from the candidate device do not, and are not expected to, directly correlate with test results from the predicate device. An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy between the candidate device and the CDC reference method. The method comparison against the CDC reference method was the basis of the substantial equivalence determination.

A method comparison study was performed between the Dimension Vista TTST assay and the CDC reference method, ID-LC/MS/MS. One hundred thirteen (113) native serum samples were run in singlet on the candidate and comparator methods. The test results as measured by the candidate device ranged from 8.0 to $9 4 9 { \mathrm { n g / d L } }$ . Regression analysis was performed using Passing-Bablok to obtain the following regression equation:

# b. Matrix comparison:

Fifty nine sample sets were collected and analyzed by Deming weighted regression to compare testosterone results obtained from serum to serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST), Li-Heparin plasma, Na-Heparin plasma, and K2-EDTA plasma. Results from the serum samples ranged from 12 to $9 2 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ . The regression equations are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ComparativeSample type toSerum(n=59)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Correlationcoefficient</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Li-Hep plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.98</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.998</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Na-Hep plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>K2-EDTAplasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.998</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SSTserum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.97</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.995</td></tr></table>

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A reference interval study was performed for the Dimension Vista LOCI Total Testosterone assay. The sample groups tested consisted of males, $> 5 0$ years old $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 1 4 6 } )$ ; males between the ages of 21 to 50 years old $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 1 } 7 4 )$ ); post-menopausal females, ages 48 to 85 years $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 4 6 )$ ; and pre-menopausal females, ages 21 to 60 years $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 8 9 )$ . The central $9 \bar { 5 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile range of each sample category was calculated by finding the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ ranked sample on the low end and the $\mathsf { \bar { g } } 7 . 5 ^ { \mathsf { t h } }$ ranked sample on the high end. The follow reference intervals were obtained for each category:

Adult males (21 to 50 yrs): 113 to $1 0 6 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ Adult males $( > 5 0$ yrs): 95 to $9 4 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ Pre-menopausal females: 9 to $5 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$

Post-menopausal females: ${ < } 8$ to $4 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$

A reference range study was performed on the pediatric population following CLSI EP28-A3c. Male and female pediatric patient samples were obtained spanning multiple age ranges and Tanner Stages. Serum specimens were obtained prospectively at eight sites located across the US. Each category of samples was analyzed separately. The reference intervals are presented in tables below for both Tanner Stages and age range:
