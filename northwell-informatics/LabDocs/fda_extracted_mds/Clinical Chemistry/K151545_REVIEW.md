# L. Test Principle:

The PTS Panels Lipid Panel test strips and the CardioChek Home Lipid Panel test strips are identical except the CardioChek Home Lipid Panel test strips are for over-the-counter use. The test strips utilize enzymatic methods on a dry strip that is read by reflectance photometry. The test strip contains three sets of dry components, which are dry test strip reagents one set for each analyte (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides). A single application of whole blood flows laterally to dose each set of analyte specific membranes once the blood is applied to the test strip. The red blood cells are separated by the test strip such that only the serum or plasma reaches the reaction membranes. The color resulting from the enzymatic reaction is read by the analyzers by reflectance. The reflectance is compared to the calibration curve stored in the memory chip and converted into concentration and displayed by the analyzer.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

The CardioChek Home analyzer is the same as the CardioChek Plus analyzer but is labeled for home use; the performance studies for the CardioChek Plus are applicable for the CardioChek Home analyzer. The CardioChek PA Home analyzer is the same as the CardioChek PA analyzer but is labeled for home use; the performance studies for the CardioChek PA are applicable for the CardioChek PA Home analyzer.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed using 3 Lithium heparin venous whole blood samples tested 8 times by 2 operators using 5 of each type of analyzer (CardioChek PA and CardioChek Plus) in 2 runs beginning 3 hours apart.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity study followed recommendations in CLSI EP06-A.The linearity was evaluated using three lots of Lipid Panel test strips on each type of analyzer (CardioChek PA/CardioChek PA Home and CardioChek Plus/CardioChek Home) and a series of $1 0 \mathrm { H D L }$ cholesterol concentration levels in whole blood that spanned the reportable range of the test. The statistical analysis of the 2nd and 3rd order regressions indicated statistically significant non-linear components but the maximum deviation from nonlinearity was $10 \%$ within the claimed interval. The linearity was adequate across the reportable range (20 to $1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

PTS Lipid Panel test strips are calibrated using a commercially available CRMLN certified method. PTS Lipid Panel test strips were CRMLN certified for Total Cholesterol and HDL Cholesterol with both the CardioChek PA/CardioChek PA Home analyzer and CardioChek Plus/CardioChek Home analyzer.

# Stability:

The shelf life and open vial stability protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

The change in measuring range is due to a software modification and had no impact on the detection limit therefore detection limit studies were not performed.

The measuring range for HDL on the test systems is $2 0 { - } 1 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

The change in measuring range is due to a software modification and had no impact on interferences therefore studies to evaluate potential interferents were not performed.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison:

A method comparison study was performed using 2 CardioChek PA/CardioChek PA Home analyzers and 2 CardioChek Plus/CardioChek Home analyzers and 80 Lithium Heparin whole blood samples covering the HDL cholesterol range (21 to $1 1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . None of the specimens were altered. A single replicate from the proposed devices and the predicate device were used in the analysis.

b. Matrix comparison:

The matrix comparison study was performed using 2 CardioChek PA and 2 CardioChek Plus analyzers and 40 blood samples of each sample type across the HDL cholesterol range (21 to $1 1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Individual results of each matrix comparison study were compared to the reference results and it was determined if the results were correctly classified per NCEP Working Group recommendations1.

# N. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Infection control studies:

The CardioChek PA/CardioChek PA Home analyzer materials are the same as the materials used in the CardioChek Plus/CardioChek Home analyzer, therefore the disinfection efficacy studies were only performed for the CardioChek Plus/CardioChek Home analyzer. The disinfection efficacy for the CardioChek Plus/CardioChek Home analyzer was reviewed in k140068. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed by an outside commercial testing laboratory and demonstrated complete inactivation of duck hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth (EPA Registration #9480-4).

Robustness studies were performed on the CardioChek PA/CardioChek PA Home test system demonstrating that there was no change in performance for HDL, cholesterol and triglycerides or in external materials of the meters after 11,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles with Super SaniCloth. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# O. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# P. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
