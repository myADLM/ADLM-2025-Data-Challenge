4. Special instrument requirements: On Call Express Pro glucose meter

# I. Device Description:

The On Call Express Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the On Call Express Pro Blood Glucose Meter, On Call Express Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips and 3 levels of On Call Express Pro Glucose Control Solutions (Control Solution 0, Control Solution 1 and Control Solution 2), Carrying Case and User’s Manual and single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices (On Call Safety Lancets). Test Strips, Control Solutions and single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices are required but not provided with the Meter and must be purchased separately.

The On Call Express Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System that is the subject of this submission uses identical technology, software, measurement algorithm, test strips, and quality control solutions as the predicate device, the On Call Express Blood Glucose Monitoring System, which was cleared in k132086. The only differences between this device and the predicate are the name, labeling (for multiple patient use by health care professionals) and the materials of the meter.

Test strips are packaged in vials of 50 and also available individually packaged. Each test strip contains the following reagent compositions: Glucose Oxidase (from Aspergillus niger).

Each box of control solutions (Control Solution 0, Control Solution1, Control Solution 2) contains one vial of each control solution level $2 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial) of viscosity-adjusted, buffered aqueous control solutions that contain known concentrations of d-glucose. Control solutions were previously cleared under k132086 as the On Call Express Blood Glucose Control Solutions and are being renamed under this submission.

# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. A blood sample is drawn into the test strip by capillary action, and reacts with reagents on the test strip. This reaction produces an electrical current which is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the samples. The electrical current is measured by the meter and is displayed to the user as a corresponding blood glucose level.
