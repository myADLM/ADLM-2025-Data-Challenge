4. Special instrument requirements: ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX Analyzers

# I. Device Description:

The ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers are portable, automated systems intended for in vitro testing of samples of whole blood for the parameters $\mathsf { p H }$ , ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ , $\mathsf { p C O } _ { 2 }$ , potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride, glucose, hematocrit (ABL80 FLEX analyzer only) and the oximetry parameters (ABL80 FLEX CO-OX only) total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, FO2Hb, FCOHb, FMetHb, and FHHb.

The ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers each exist in two different software configurations differing in the number of parameters available.

The ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers consist of an instrument with a sensor cassette and a solution pack as the main accessories. Multiple models of sensor cassettes are available. The various sensor cassette models include models for different parameter combinations. For each parameter combination, models allowing for different test loads are available. The solution pack is available in four models, one model for each of the four different configurations of the analyzer.

The ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers were previously cleared in k051804 and k080370. The current modification to the glucose measurement software is to automatically handle certain glucose results depending on the ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ value in the sample. This will allow incorporating limitations of reporting glucose results when the ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ value of the sample is low.

# L. Test Principle:

The amperometric test principle is used for the measurement of both ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ and glucose because glucose measurement is dependent upon enough ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ in the sample; therefore, ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ and glucose are measured simultaneously. The magnitude of an electric flow of current is proportional to the concentration of the substance being oxidized or reduced at an electrode.

d. Detection limit: See k051804 and k080370.   
e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical Specificity for glucose measurement was reviewed and cleared in k051804 and k080370. However, additional studies were conducted to further characterize the impact of, or interference from, limitations on the amounts of oxygen in the sample. The cause of this interference effect is that the enzymatic conversion of glucose in the sensor is oxygen consuming, the oxygen coming from the sample. The interference study was performed according to the CLSI “Interference testing in clinical chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition”, CLSI document EP7-A2. Testing was performed on three ABL80 FLEX and three ABL80 FLEX CO-OX instruments with five levels of glucose and four levels of ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ . Base pools of whole blood were prepared for each glucose level and split into two samples with one being tonometered to $1 0 0 { \mathrm { ~ m m H g ~ p O } } _ { 2 }$ (control sample) and the other to the ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ level being tested (test sample). Each sample was tested on the ABL80 FLEX and ABL80 FLEX CO-OX analyzers, and the glucose bias for each test sample vs. the control sample was calculated. The bias for the test sample was calculated and should be less than or equal to the acceptance criterion which was set to $10 \%$ of the control value. Results are summarized below:

The interference study test results support the glucose linearity ranges shown below and documented in the labeling:

The labeling (reference manual and owner’s manual) highlights awareness of dependency of glucose measurement on sample ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ levels and includes the following description for flagging glucose results outside the validated glucose linear range and the ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ level of the sample:

All glucose results at ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ level ${ < } 2 0 \ \mathrm { m m H g }$ are suppressed and flagged by the symbol $\mathbf { \bar { \Sigma } } ^ { c < } > ^ { , , }$ with a message “Glu not usable. $\mathsf { p O } _ { 2 }$ too low for reliable cGlucose measurement”. All glucose results $\mathrm { > } 1 8 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $\mathsf { p O } _ { 2 }$ level between $2 0 - 4 0 \mathrm { m m H g }$ will be suppressed and flagged by the symbol $\mathbf { \bar { \Sigma } } ^ { c < } > ^ { , , }$ with a message “Glu not usable. ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ too low for reliable cGlucose measurement”.   
· When the measured value of ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ is not numeric (Not Reportable (N/R)) or ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ parameter is Lockout $\left( \mathrm { P / L } \right)$ or Not Derived (N/D) or Inactive (I/A) or QC Lockout $\left( \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { O } \right)$ , then the results for glucose measurement will not be displayed and the symbol “N/R” is displayed.   
· If the results are outside the test range of the analyzer for glucose measurement (see table above), the results are highlighted in red and flagged with $\cos \frac { \pi } { 4 }$ or $\$ 7$ .
