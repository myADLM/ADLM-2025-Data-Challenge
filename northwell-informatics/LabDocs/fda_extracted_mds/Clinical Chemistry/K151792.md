# H. Intended Use / Indications for Use:

The Trinidad Immunoassay (IM) system is an automated, immunoassay analyzer designed to perform in vitro diagnostic tests on clinical specimens. The Trinidad IM system’s assay applications utilize chemiluminescent technology for clinical use.

The Trinidad IM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) in human serum and plasma (EDTA and lithium heparin) using the Trinidad IM system. Measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary are used in the diagnosis of thyroid or pituitary disorders.

The Trinidad IM TSH Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in calibrating the Trinidad IM system TSH assay.

# I. Substantial Equivalence Information:

Both the Trinidad IM TSH assay (New Device) on the Trinidad IM system and the ADVIA Centaur TSH3 Ultra assay on the ADVIA Centaur (Predicate Device cleared under k150403) employ the same prepackaged reagents for use on automated test systems. The Intended Use / Indications for Use, Assay Principle and reagent formulations are the same. The major differences between the New and Predicate Devices are the reagent packaging and the instrument.

# L. Test Principle

The Trinidad IM TSH assay is a third-generation assay that employs anti-FITC monoclonal antibody covalently bound to paramagnetic particles, an FITC-labeled anti-TSH capture monoclonal antibody, and a tracer consisting of a proprietary acridinium ester and an anti-TSH monoclonal antibody conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) for chemiluminescent detection. A direct relationship exists between the amount of TSH present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.

# M. Performance Characteristics

Substantial equivalence of the Trinidad IM TSH assay on the Trinidad IM system was demonstrated by testing several performance characteristics including detection limits (LoB, LoD, and LoQ), imprecision, linearity, interfering substances and method comparison.

# a. Detection Limits

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the Trinidad IM TSH assay were determined as described in CLSI Document EP17-A2. The Trinidad IM TSH assay had a LoB of $0 . 0 0 1 ~ \mu \mu / \mu \mathrm { L }$ , a LoD of $0 . 0 0 5 \mu \mu \mu / \mu \mathrm { { m L } }$ , and a LoQ of $0 . 0 0 8 ~ \mu \mu / \mu \mathrm { u } L$ .

The LoB is defined as the concentration of TSH that corresponds to the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the distribution of the TSH zero standard; the TSH zero standard was assayed 10 times in each of at least 10 runs using 1 lot of reagent on 2 systems over a period of at least 5 days $( \mathsf { n } = 2 0 0 )$ ).

The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of TSH that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. The LoD was determined by using low level TSH serum samples that were assayed in duplicate in each of at least 20 runs using 1 lot of reagents on 2 systems over a period of at least 10 days $( \mathsf { n } { = } 8 0 )$ .

The LoQ, or functional sensitivity, is the lowest concentration of TSH at which the total imprecision for the assay does not exceed $20 \%$ , and was determined by assaying multiple patient samples with low TSH values in duplicate in each of 10 runs on 2 systems over a period of 10 days.

# b. Linearity

The Trinidad IM TSH analytical linearity was evaluated by testing a linearity pool that was prepared using a high TSH serum sample mixed with an equine serum pool to prepare nine (9) equally spaced pools, ranging in TSH levels from 0.0001 to 151 μIU/mL. The weighted linear regression of the Observed (y) vs. Expected $( \mathsf { x } )$ values for this pool is:

$$
y = 0 . 9 5 7 \times + 0 . 0 0 0 0 , \mathsf { R } = 1 . 0 0 0
$$

The Trinidad IM TSH assay is linear from 0.0001 to $1 5 0 ~  \mu \mu \mu / \mu \mu \mu$

# c. Precision

Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI Document EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline. Repeatability and within lab imprecision were evaluated by testing four commercial control, six serum samples and six plasma samples. Each sample was assayed in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates. Testing was done using two reagent lots on two systems.

A representative lot is summarized below:

# e. Heterophile Interference

HAMA Type 1 and Type 2 interference studies were provided with the ADVIA Centaur TSH3 Ultra assay cleared in 510(k) k150403; no interference was observed. The Trinidad IM TSH reagents are the same reagents as the Predicate ADVIA Centaur TSH3 Ultra reagents. The packaging is identical and the only difference is the labeling. Therefore, the performance of the Trinidad IM TSH reagents are the same as the ADVIA Centaur TSH3 Ultra reagents in regards to Heterophile interference.

# f. Cross-reactivity

Cross reactivity was evaluated in the Trinidad IM TSH with hCG, FSH, and LH by adding these hormones to human samples containing TSH. Cross reactivity was nondetectable at the levels tested for hCG (200,000 μIU/mL), FSH (1500 μIU/mL) and LH (600 μIU/mL).

# g. High Dose Hook Effect

The potential for the high dose hook effect in the Trinidad IM TSH assay was evaluated by testing serial dilutions of a very high TSH sample. No high dose hook effect was observed in samples with TSH levels as high as $3 , 0 0 0 \ \mu \mu / \mu \mu$ .

# h. Method Comparison

A method comparison study with the Trinidad IM TSH assay was done versus the Predicate ADVIA Centaur TSH3 Ultra assay. The Trinidad IM assay shows good correlation (R value) in sample results compared to and the Predicate. Based on the weighted Deming regression results, the Trinidad IM TSH assay is equivalent to the Predicate.
