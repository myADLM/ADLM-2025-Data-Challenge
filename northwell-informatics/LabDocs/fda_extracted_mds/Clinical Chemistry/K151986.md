# 10.7 Detection Limit

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined as described in CLSI protocol EP17-A2. The ADVIA Centaur TSTII assay has an LoB of $2 . 5 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / d L }$ , an LoD of $5 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ , and an LoQ of $7 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ .

The LoB is defined as the highest measurement result that is likely to be observed for a blank sample. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of testosterone that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. The LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration of testosterone that can be detected at a total CV of $20 \%$ .

# 10.8 Interference

Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Two sample pools were tested. One sample pool had approximately ${ 3 0 \ n \mathfrak { g } } / \mathrm { d L }$ testosterone. The second sample pool had approximately $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ testosterone. These sample pools were spiked with potential interferents. Control samples were prepared by spiking sample pools with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance stock.

Samples with unconjugated bilirubin concentrations $> 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ will cause erroneous results. Specimens that contain $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of unconjugated bilirubin demonstrate a $2 0 . 1 \%$ change in results.

# 10.9 Heterophile Interference

Heterophile interference testing was performed by spiking 19 HAMA-positive serum samples with $\mathord { \sim } 3 0$ and ${ \sim } 3 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ USP testosterone. The Expected Dose was calculated by adding the “spiked” testosterone concentration to the endogenous (neat) testosterone concentration of the sample. The percent recoveries were determined by dividing the Observed Dose by the Expected Dose. The mean recovery for all samples spiked with ${ \sim } 3 0 \ \mathsf { n g / d L }$ USP testosterone was $9 8 . 6 9 \%$ . The mean recovery for all samples spiked with ${ \sim } 3 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ USP testosterone was $9 4 . 5 5 \%$ .

# 10.10 Cross-Reactivity

Cross-reactivity studies were performed using two sample pools of approximately 0 ng/dL and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ testosterone. These sample pools were spiked with potential cross-reactants.

Control samples were prepared by spiking sample pools with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance stock. Results are presented below.
