# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone immunoassay is based on a competitive test principle with anti-testosterone (sheep, monoclonal) coated paramagnetic microparticles and chemiluminescence detection. In the first step, sample, assay specific diluent and antitestosterone (sheep, monoclonal) coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined.

Testosterone present in the sample binds to the anti-testosterone coated microparticles. After incubation, testosterone acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to the reaction mixture. After further incubation and washing, Pre-Trigger and Trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). The concentration of testosterone is interpolated from a calibration curve established with calibrators of known testosterone concentration.

In order to obtain the free testosterone index (FTI) or Free Androgen index (FAI) result, the ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone assay and the Abbott ARCHITECT SHBG assays are utilized and are measured at the same time when the sample is tested on the analyzer. The free testosterone index (%FTI) or free androgen index (%FAI) was obtained using the following equation:

FTI or FAI $( \% ) =$ ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone Value (nmol/L) x100 ARCHITECT SHBG (nmol/L)

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Reference ranges are assay dependent for total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and the free testosterone index (FTI). FTI is calculated from the total testosterone and SHBG results. Therefore, to determine the reference range for the FTI, new reference range studies were performed to obtain expected human SHBG and total testosterone values for apparently healthy males $( \mathbf { n } = 3 0 7 )$ ) and females $\mathbf { \bar { n } } = 3 4 9$ ) using the ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone assay and the Abbott ARCHITECT SHBG assays. The free testosterone index $( \% \mathrm { F T I } )$ or free androgen index $( \% \mathrm { F A I } )$ was obtained using the following equation:

FTI or FAI $( \% ) = \underline { { { \mathrm { A R C H I T E C T } } } } 2 ^ { \underline { { { \mathrm { n d } } } } } .$ Generation Testosterone Value (nmol/L) x100 ARCHITECT SHBG (nmol/L)

The expected values for total testosterone, SHBG, and FTI are presented in the tables below:
