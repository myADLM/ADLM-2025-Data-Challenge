# 8. TEST PRINCIPLE (1)

The bilirubin is oxidised by vanadate at about pH 2.9 to produce biliverdin. In the presence of detergent and vanadate, both conjugate (direct) and unconjugated bilirubin are oxidised. This oxidation reaction causes a decrease in the optical density of the yellow colour, which is specific to bilirubin. The decrease in optical density at 450/546 nm is proportional to the total bilirubin concentration in the sample. The concentration is measured as an endpoint reaction.

# 9. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated consistent with C.L.S.I documents EP5-A2 Precision studies were performed by two operators on two RX Daytona plus systems using serum based control material and unaltered human serum samples that were spiked with unconjugated Bilirubin or diluted to achieve Total Bilirubin concentrations based on normal ranges $0 . 3 - 1 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Testing was conducted for two reagent lots of Total Bilirubin, one lot on each RX Daytona plus system, twice per day for 20 non-consecutive days. Two replicates per run were performed for each sample. The assay was calibrated initially with no further calibration required. The results are summarized in the following tables.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. standard EP6-A. Linearity studies were performed at 11 levels to determine the analytical range of an assay - that is the range where the reported result is a linear function to the analyte concentration (or where deviation from linearity is less than $5 \%$ ).

The linearity samples were prepared at 11 levels. The sponsor set a range from 0.21 mg/dl analyte concentration up to a high concentration approximately 26.3 mg/dl using low and high serum pools. The low and high pools were mixed to make nine intermediate levels. Each level was run in replicates of five on two lots of Total Bilirubin reagent on one RX Daytona plus system. The observed values were compared to the expected values; the linear regression correlation between the expected values and the observed values are summarized in the following table:

Table 3 Linearity Summary including Regression equation and correlation coefficient.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte Tested</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total Bilirubin(mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LinearRegression</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y = 1.02 + 0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9999</td></tr></table>

The low end of the reportable assay range is based on the Limit of Quantitation. The high end of the reportable assay range is based on the linearity. The Rx Daytona Plus analyzer has an auto-dilution feature that is automatically activated when measuring samples ${ > } 2 6 . 3 \ \mathsf { m g / d L }$ , which are diluted and remeasured to obtain values within the measuring range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Refer to K942458 Randox Assayed Multisera Level 2 and Level 3.

Refer to K053153 Randox Calibration Serum Level 3.

Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 for Total Bilirubin is traceable to an internal master reference material.

# d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP17-A2 ‘Evaluation of detection capability for clinical laboratory measurement procedures; Approved Guideline Second Edition’. A Limit of Blank (L.o.B.), a Limit of Detection (L.o.D.) and a Limit of Quantification were performed on two lots of reagents tested by two operators on one RX Daytona Plus system.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for Total Bilirubin on the RX Daytona Plus is 0.08 mg/dL based on 240 determinations, with 4 low level samples.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) is $0 . 0 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L } .$

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is 0.21 mg/dL as determined by the lowest concentration at which precision is still met.

# e. Analytical Specificity:

Interference studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP7-A2 ‘Interference testing in clinical chemistry; Approved Guideline Second Edition’ The effects of potential interferents were determined by calculating the mean value of the spiked interferent with the corresponding control solution. The spiked sample results were compared to control samples prepared without the potential interferents.

# Acceptance Criteria:

The criteria for no significant interference is recovery within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the initial value of Total Bilirubin concentration of $0 . 9 9 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ and 15.03 mg/dL

Haemoglobin No significant interference up to 1000mg/dL Triglycerides No significant interference up to 2000mg/dL Intralipid® No significant interference up to 1000mg/dL Ascorbic Acid No significant interference up to 25.0mg/dL f. Method comparison with predicate device:

Correlation studies were carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP9-A2 ‘Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples: Approved Guideline – Second Edition’.

106 serum patient samples spanning the range 0.21 to $2 6 . 9 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested by two operators on two lots of Total Bilirubin reagent on one RX Daytona plus analyzer and the predicate device tested on one ADVIA 1650 system across 3 working days with each sample tested in singlicate.

The test method was compared to the predicate device and the following linear regression equation was obtained:

$\mathsf { Y } = 1 . 0 2 \mathsf { x } - 0 . 0 2$ Correlation coefficient of $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 9$

# g. Matrix comparison:

Matrix method comparisons for Total Bilirubin assay was tested by one operator on one RX Daytona plus system and was assessed for two lots of reagents. Both serum and lithium heparin plasma were tested to determine whether method accuracy with plasma specimens are equivalent to serum results and that lithium heparin plasma does not interfere with either the method or the system.

Total Bilirubin matrix comparison on the RX Daytona plus (Lithium Heparin)

Patient samples were drawn in matched pairs – one sample serum $( \mathsf { x } )$ and the second sample lithium heparin plasma (y). A minimum of 40 matched patient sample pairs were analyzed spanning the 0.23 to $2 3 . 5 \ : \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d } \mathsf { I }$ and the following linear regression equation was obtained:

$$
\mathsf { Y } = \mathsf { \Omega } 0 . 9 9 \mathsf { x } + 0 . 0 4
$$

Correlation coefficient of $\mathsf { r } = \mathsf { \Omega } 0 . 9 9 9 9$

# Expected values/Reference range:

Referenced from literature

A reference interval for Total Bilirubin was verified using NCCLS C28-A3 guidelines. In a study, human serum from 30 normal donors were tested in singlicate on the RX daytona plus. The results obtained were ordered from lowest to highest before being examined for outliers using the Dixon test.

Upon confirmation there were no outliers; the values were compared to the quoted ranges for Total Bilirubin. Results of the study indicate that all values reported in the range for Healthy Individuals.

Testing results indicate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
