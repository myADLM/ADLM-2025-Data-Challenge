# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced:

• ISO 13485: Medical Device – Quality Management Systems

• ISO 14971: Medical Device – Application of Risk Management in Medical Devices

# L. Test Principle:

Upon contacting saliva cells, the stabilizing liquid lyses cellular and nuclear membranes to release and stabilize nucleic acids (DNA). Samples can be immediately processed, transported or stored for future use. Samples can be shipped or transported at ambient temperature to the laboratory for processing. ORAcollect·Dx samples are stable at room temperature for up to 60 days. Device and sample integrity are preserved during typical ambient transport and storage conditions. DNA extraction from ORAcollect·Dx saliva samples should be performed using the QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Mini Kit.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three reproducibility studies were conducted.

The first reproducibility study was designed to show collection-to-collection, lot-to-lot and day-to-day reproducibility. Ten donors self-collected nine saliva samples each over 3 days using 3 reagent lots (OCD-100 format). The 10 donors had never used the product previously. One operator performed the DNA extraction (from one aliquot of each sample on each of two days) followed by testing for concentration, yield and $\mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 }$ ratio. DNA testing using the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test was performed over several days. A total of 120 aliquots from the 60 self-collected samples from the 10 donors were tested.

All specimens yielded a DNA concentration of $2 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ or better, DNA purity $\left( \mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 } \right)$ between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least $1 0 \mathrm { n g } ( 0 . 0 1 0$ $\mu \mathrm { g } )$ .

After the first round of testing, total percent agreement between the results of the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and genotype (by sequencing) was $100 \%$ .

A second reproducibility study was performed to evaluate operator-tooperator reproducibility. For this study, 3 of the samples collected by the ten donors for the first study were pooled and aliquoted into 3 tubes (and one reserve aliquot was stored). Each of 3 operators performed the DNA extraction (from one aliquot of each sample that they received on each of two days) followed by testing for concentration, yield and $\mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 }$ ratio prior to testing each aliquot from each sample received on the eSensor $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Warfarin Sensitivity Test. One lot of the collection device was used for this study. A total of 60 aliquots from 30 self-collected samples from 10 donors were tested.

All specimens yielded a DNA concentration of $2 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ or better, DNA purity $\left( \mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 } \right)$ between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g } }$ (0.010 $\mu \mathrm { g } )$ .

After the first round of testing, total percent agreement between the results of the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and genotype (by sequencing) was $100 \%$ .

A third reproducibility study was conducted. Thirty (30) donors collected multiple saliva samples each from 3 sites; 2 of the 3 sites were in a professional setting and had supervised collections compared to unsupervised collections at the third site. The 30 donors were selected to encompass a diverse genotype distribution for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype distribution. After sample collection, one sample from each donor was transported at ambient temperatures to three independent sites. Each site had one operator for a study total of 3 operators. Following sample extraction, all purified genomic DNA samples were tested for DNA concentration and A260/A280 at the sites where they were extracted. All purified genomic DNA samples were transported to Site 1 for testing on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test (k152612) where 1 extracted DNA aliquot from each sample from each site was tested on the Warfarin assay, excluding a single sample that did not meet assay input criteria. When data from all 3 sites are combined one sample did not meet the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test DNA quality input requirements. In the first run there were 88/89 $( 9 8 . 9 \% )$ correct calls on the 89 testable samples of 90 total collected samples. In the second run there was $100 \%$ agreement (89/89) with bidirectional sequencing on the 89 testable samples of 90 total collected samples.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Shelf-life stability:

Stability testing protocols and simulated transport shelf-life studies were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Current real-time data supports a shelf-life 24 months at ambient temperature.

Stability of samples post-saliva collection: A study was performed to evaluate the stability of samples after saliva collection. Two samples were collected from each of 30 donors (using 3 lots of the OCD-100 format). One was exposed to simulated transport conditions (3 freeze-thaw cycles, where each cycle was comprised of a minimum of 3 hours at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and a minimum of 3 hours at $5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ). The second was stored at room temperature and processed after 30 days and 70 days of storage. At each time point, an aliquot of sample was extracted and the DNA was analyzed for concentration, yield and $\mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 }$ ratio and percent bacterial content.

All specimens from all samples at all conditions (baseline, simulated transport, 30 days and 70 days) yielded a DNA concentration of $2 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ or better, DNA purity $\left( \mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 } \right)$ between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least $1 0 \mathrm { n g } ( 0 . 0 1 0 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ . There was also no significant difference from baseline in the bacterial content in the samples.

A subset of 10 donors was selected and all samples (baseline, transport, 30 days and 70 days) from those donors tested for agreement between genotyping results on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and sequencing. There was $100 \%$ agreement (40/40) of the eSensor $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Warfarin Sensitivity Test results to bidirectional sequencing.

# d. Detection limit:

The device is intended for the collection of a saliva sample by using the double ended tube cap with attached integrated sponge to collect and transfer saliva samples. The sample is collected using 10 sponge actions per each of the lower gum one each side of the mouth for a total of 20 sponge actions total. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of over or under collecting a sample using the OCD-100 collection device.

Individuals collected a sample by one of the following methods:

“recommended” (10 sponge actions per each lower gums one each side of the mouth for a total of 20 sponge actions total); “over-collection” (10 sponge actions per each upper and lower gums on each side of the mouth for a total of 40 sponge actions total); “Under-collection by $5 0 \% ^ { \prime \prime }$ (5 sponge actions per each lower gums for a total of 10 sponge actions total); “Under-collection by $7 5 \% ^ { \prime 5 }$ (5 sponge actions on a single lower gum for a total of 5 sponge actions total); and “no motion” (sponge placed in lower gutter region for 10 seconds for each side of the mouth).

A total of 10 donors were asked to collect 5 saliva samples using the different collection methods. A total of 50 DNA samples were analyzed for DNA concentration, yield and $\mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 }$ ratio. In addition, 49 samples were processed on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test.

All specimens from the “recommended,” “over-collection,” and “undercollection” methods collected samples with sufficient DNA purity and yield. For the “no motion” group, only $90 \%$ of samples had sufficient DNA purity and yield. In addition, one sample $( 1 0 \% )$ from the “no motion” group did not collect a sufficient concentration of DNA.

DNA testing resulted in 4 no calls (45/49 or $91 \%$ agreement between genotyping results on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and sequencing). Upon retesting there was $100 \%$ agreement of the eSensor $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Warfarin Sensitivity Test results to bidirectional sequencing. One sample from the no motion group did not meet the concentration criteria and was not able to be tested on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test.

Effect of Incorrect Collection sites: The sample is collected using 10 sponge actions per each of the lower gum one each side of the mouth for a total of 20 sponge actions total. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of collecting from incorrect collection sites using the OCD-100 collection device.

Individuals collected a sample by one of the following methods: “recommended” (10 sponge actions per each lower gums one each side of the mouth for a total of 20 sponge actions total); “cheek” (10 sponge actions per inside of cheek on each side of the mouth); “teeth” (10 sponge actions per each lower teeth on each side of the mouth); and “tongue” (10 sponge actions per each side of the top of the tongue).

A total of 10 donors were asked to collect 4 saliva samples using the different collection sites. A total of 40 DNA samples were analyzed for DNA concentration, yield and $\mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 }$ ratio. In addition, 39 samples were processed on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test.

All specimens from the “recommended” collection site, collected from the “teeth” and the “tongue” had adequate DNA purity and yield. For the samples collected from the “cheek”, $90 \%$ of samples had adequate DNA purity and yield. In addition, one sample $( 1 0 \% )$ from the “cheek” group did not collect a sufficient concentration of DNA.

DNA testing resulted in $100 \%$ agreement (39/39) between genotyping results on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and sequencing. One sample collected from the cheek did not meet the concentration criteria was not able to be tested on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test.

Dry Mouth Study: 13 donors with dry mouth were recruited to participate in the study (based on answers to the modified Xerostomia Inventory which is used to evaluate dry mouth. The sponsor used at least 3 “yes” responses to the questions to select participants, and recruited participants with the most yes responses).

11 of 12 specimens had adequate DNA purity and yield.

DNA testing resulted in 2 no-calls $8 4 . 6 \%$ agreement - 11/13) between genotyping results on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test and sequencing. Upon retesting there was $100 \%$ agreement of the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test results to bidirectional sequencing.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Effect of Endogenous Interfering Substances: Interfering substances were spiked into saliva samples. 10 donors each provided five samples which were each spiked with one of the four interfering substances. A control sample was included. All samples were evaluated for effect on DNA concentration, purity, $\mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 }$ ratio and testing on a genotyping device.

Three independent DNA extractions were performed on each spiked sample while one DNA extraction was performed for the control samples. No endogenous substances tested exhibited interference with the assay.

Effect of Exogenous Interfering Substances: Potentially interfering exogenous substances introduced into saliva samples through various activities (eating, drinking, chewing gum, using mouthwash, smoking and brushing teeth) were tested. Each activity group was composed of five to nine donors who each provided samples immediately after activity, 10 minutes and 30 minutes postactivity. There was $100 \%$ agreement between the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test results and bidirectional DNA sequencing for all activities tested in one run at the 30 minute time point, demonstrating no effect of any interfering substances on genotyping.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed in order to determine the accuracy of the genotype obtained on the eSensor $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test (k110786) using saliva samples collected using the proposed collection device (3 lots of OCD-100) as compared to bi-directional DNA sequencing. Samples from 156 subjects were collected. Eighty percent of donors were naïve to the device. Twenty percent had used the device more than once.

All samples yielded a DNA concentration of $2 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ or better, DNA purity $\left( \mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 } \right)$ between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least $1 0 \mathrm { n g } ( 0 . 0 1 0$ $\mu \mathrm { g } )$ .

Overall, there was $9 8 . 1 \%$ (153/156) first run agreement of the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test to bidirectional sequencing. In the first run there were 2 incorrect results and one no-call result. After re‐testing, there was $9 9 . 4 \%$ (155/156) agreement between the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test results and DNA sequencing, including one no-call result.

No call result: There was one first and final run no‐call, sample MC002. This sample was re‐tested using the same purified DNA (retest 1) and upon a second no‐call result, was re‐extracted and re‐tested on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test (retest 2). The original test, retest 1 and retest 2 all gave a no‐call result (all $^ { * 3 }$ indeterminant score). For investigation purposes, both the original and re‐extracted DNA was diluted 1:10 and re‐tested on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test. Both the 1:10 diluted samples gave a correct call of $^ { * } 1 / { } ^ { * } 3$ , G/G, concordant with sequencing. The sponsor hypothesizes that there may be an inhibitor present in the sample that was not removed by the Qiagen QIAmp Mini Kit purification. Users should be aware of this potential failure mode.

Incorrect results: There were two first run incorrect calls $( \mathrm { C Y P 2 C 9 } * 2 / { ^ { * } } 2 .$ , VKORC1 G/G and $\mathrm { C Y P 2 C 9 } * 1 / { * 2 }$ , VKORC1 G/A). An investigation revealed that a sample mix‐up had occurred. Both samples were re‐tested on the and re‐test 1 resulted in genotypes concordant with sequencing for both samples.

# b. Matrix comparison:

The sponsor conducted a method comparison study between the two tube types, OCD-100 and OCD-100A. The collection of samples from 45 different donors was evaluated for DNA concentration, total DNA yield, A260/A280 and the warfarin sensitivity assay. All 45 samples collected had adequate DNA concentratoin, total DNA and A260/A280. Samples from the OCD100A generated correct results on the warfarin sensitivity genotyping assay $9 5 . 6 \%$ in the first pass due to 2 no-call results, and $100 \%$ in the final pass).

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

A user study was performed to evaluate usability and user understanding of the collection instructions. 101 naïve donors were recruited. After being provided oral instructions from the Package insert by a professional and handed an ORAcollect∙Dx collection kit, each donor was observed for their ability to complete the core tasks. Actions for each of the core tasks were recorded by the study observer. The overall pass rate for all tasks was $9 3 . 9 \%$ .
