# 3. Predicate Device Information:

K111456 Medisign $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# 4. Device Description:

Medisign $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the glucose in the fresh capillary whole blood sample by using a small electrical current produced by chemical reaction between glucose in the blood and glucose oxidase on the test strip. This current is proportionally converted to the amount of glucose in the blood sample to display as the blood glucose result. Glucose measurements are reported as plasma equivalents. Blood glucose results from test strips that are plasma-equivalent are approximately $1 1 \%$ higher than those obtained with whole-blood equivalent test strips.

Medisign $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MM 1000 BT Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Medisign $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MM 1100 BT Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Medisign $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MM1200 BT and Smart Diabetes Bluetooth Blood Glucose Monitoring System are basically provided with a blood glucose meter and a carrying bag including user manual, quick reference manual and log book.

Smart Diabetes Bluetooth Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of the glucose in fresh capillary whole blood drawn from fingertip, palm, and forearm of diabetic patients by healthcare professionals as an aid in the management of diabetes, and may be used for testing multiple patients in a professional healthcare setting. It is intended for use outside the body (invitro diagnostic use) and not for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. The alternative site testing (palm and forearm) should be done only during steady state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly). Only auto-disabling, single use lancing devices should be used with this system.

The Smart Diabetes Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips are to be used for monitoring glucose concentration of fresh capillary whole blood with Smart Diabetes Bluetooth Pro Blood Glucose Meter. The test strips and associated meter are for use with fingertip, forearm, and palm testing. The system is intended for use for multiple patient use by healthcare professionals in healthcare settings. Only auto-disabling, single use lancing devices should be used with this system. The strips are not for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use.

Smart Diabetes Glucose Control Solutions are for use with the Smart Diabetes Bluetooth Pro meter and Smart Diabetes test strips as a quality control check to verify that the meter and test strips are working properly together.
