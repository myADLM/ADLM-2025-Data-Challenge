# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use, below.

The iHealth Wireless Gluco-Monitoring System consists of the iHealth Wireless Glucose meter (BG5), iHealth Blood Glucose Test Strips (AGS-1000I), and the iHealth GlucoSmart App mobile application. The iHealth Wireless Gluco-Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, or thigh. The iHealth Wireless Gluco-Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The iHealth Wireless Gluco-Monitoring System is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The iHealth Wireless Gluco-Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

Not for use in critically ill patients The iHealth system is not intended for use on neonates The iHealth system is not intended for use on arterial blood, serum, or plasma The following substances at levels greater than normal or therapeutic levels may cause significant interference (affect the result by greater than $10 \%$ ), resulting in an inaccurate result: ascorbic acid, uric acid, acetaminophen, dopamine, L-dopa Do not use haemolysis samples, icterus samples, or high lipemia samples. Patients undergoing oxygen therapy may show results lower than actual levels. AST should be done only during steady state times when glucose levels are not changing rapidly.   
Do not perform AST if you think your glucose is low, you are unaware that you might have hypoglycemia, you are testing for hyperglycemia, your AST results do not match the way you feel, your routine glucose results fluctuate often Do not use AST results to calibrate a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) Do not use AST results for insulin dosing calculations This device is not for use in people who are severely dehydrated, in people who are severely hypotensive, or people who are in shock, consult your healthcare professional immediately when this happens. Not for use in individuals who are in a hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis.   
· Use only fresh capillary whole blood samples. Very low or very high red blood cell count (hematocrit) can lead to incorrect test results. If you do not know your hematocrit level, please consult your healthcare provider. For over-the-counter use Do not perform AST if you think your glucose is low, you are unaware that you

might have hypoglycemia, you are testing for hyperglycemia, your AST results do not

match the way you feel, your routine glucose results fluctuate often · Do not use AST results to calibrate a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) Do not use AST results for insulin dosing calculations If you take acetaminophen or acetaminophen containing medications (Tylenol, certain cold and flu remedies, or certain prescription drugs) higher than the recommended levels $( > 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ then you should know that this medication might affect the reliability of your blood glucose results and you should not use this Blood Glucose Monitoring System. If you are unsure, than ask your doctor. Certain conditions may cause your blood level of uric acid to rise. These conditions include gout or kidney disease. Uric acid levels in your blood are measured by a laboratory test that your doctor orders. You should know that if your blood level of uric acid is high $\mathrm { ( \ge 1 0 ~ m g / d L ) }$ then your blood glucose results may be not reliable. If your doctor tells you that your uric acid level is greater than $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , then do not use this blood glucose monitoring system. If you are unsure, then ask your doctor. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid $( > 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ naturally in your blood or from food or taking Vitamin C supplements might cause inaccurate blood glucose results when using this blood glucose monitoring system.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

EN 60601-1-2:2007 – Medical electrical equipment, general requirements for basic safety and essential performance – Collateral standard: Electromagnetic compatibility

# L. Test Principle:

The iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (BG5) measures glucose amperometrically. The reaction of glucose oxidase and an electron mediator in the test strip with glucose in the sample produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration, which is displayed by the meter.
