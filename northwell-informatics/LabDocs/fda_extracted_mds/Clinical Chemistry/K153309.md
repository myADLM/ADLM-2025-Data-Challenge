Dear Mr. Amato:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical devicerelated adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

# 2. Device:

Trade Name: BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set

Common Names: Blood Collection Set

Classification Name: Blood Specimen Collection Device

Classification: Class II, 21 CFR 862.1675

Product Code: JKA and FPA

# 3. Predicate Device:

BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set – K030573 Manufactured by: Becton, Dickinson and Company

# 4. Device Description:

The BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set has two models. One is a steel winged blood collection set with flexible tubing, female luer connector, with an integrated male luer adapter which connects to a Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Brand Needle Holder and is intended to be used with blood collection tubes. The other model is sold identical except without the male luer adapter. This model allows the clinician to obtain blood sampling with a syringe, if necessary, or can be used for short-term, single infusions. The device is not to be left in place and remain under the supervision of a clinician.

The BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set also contains a sharps injury prevention feature. The wing set is designed with an active retraction method. When the button is actively depressed, the needle fully retracts and is enclosed and locked within the barrel of the device. The retraction of the intravenous (IV) end of the needle is designed to protect users from an accidental needle sticks.

The BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set consists of:

 Stainless steel cannula (Intravenous end and Non-patient end of cannula)   
 Stainless steel spring   
 Hub, front and rear barrel   
 Wings (color coded according to needle gauge)   
 Tubing   
 Female luer connector and an optional male luer adapter   
 Intravenous (IV) needle protector (covers the needle before use)   
 Luer Cap (provided if there is no luer adapter attached)

The intravenous needle of the blood collection set is bonded to one end of the hub. The tubing of the blood collection set is bonded to the other end of the hub and the female luer connector. A spring is assembled over the needle protector and onto the front of the hub. Once the sample is collected the user will depress the button that projects through the barrel. As soon as the button is depressed, the needle assembly moves using spring energy. In this retracted (locked) position, the IV point of the needle is fully contained within the body of the device. This will prevent the needle from coming out of the front barrel once it has retracted as well as preventing accidental overriding of the safety feature.

The optional male luer adapter contains threads for attachment to a Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Brand Needle Holder, and a non-patient cannula for puncture of evacuated blood collection tube stoppers. The non-patient end (NP) of the cannula of the luer adapter has a sleeve that recovers over the cannula to stop blood flow during collection of multiple tubes.

The purpose of this Special ${ \displaystyle 5 1 0 ( { \bf k } ) }$ is to expand the needle range to include the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set design with ultra thin wall cannula and a five bevel point. The intended use for the modified device remains the same as the predicate device.

# 5. Indications for Use:

The BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set is a sterile, multiple sample, single-use fixed winged blood collection set intended for venipuncture to obtain blood specimens from patients. When used without the male adapter, the device allows the clinician to obtain blood sampling to the female hub with a syringe, if necessary, or can be used for short-term, single infusions with consideration given to patient size and appropriateness for the solution being infused. The device is not to be left in place and remain under the direct supervision of a clinician.

The recommended use of the device is to activate the needle safety feature prior to removal from the venipuncture site. The retraction of the intravenous (IV) end of the needle aids in the prevention of accidental needlestick injury.

# 6. Technological Characteristics:

The subject BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set is equivalent to that of the predicate BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set in intended use, materials and performance characteristics. The Indications for Use are not identical; however, the intended use remains the same for blood collection/sampling.
