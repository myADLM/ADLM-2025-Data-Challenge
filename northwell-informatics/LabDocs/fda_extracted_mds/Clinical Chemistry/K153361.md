# Device Description:

Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents, for the quantitative measurement of 25-OH Vitamin D in specimens based on CLEIA technology by a two-step sandwich immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE G System. 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrator or specimen is initially auto-diluted with Specimen Diluent 1 in the system. 25-OH vitamin D in specimens is separated from vitamin D binding protein by the extraction agent and specifically bound to anti-25-OH vitamin D monoclonal antibody (sheep) on the particles, and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP: calf)-labeled anti-(25-OH vitamin D/anti- 25-OH vitamin D monoclonal antibody immunocomplexes) recombinant chicken monoclonal antibody specifically binds to 25-OH vitamin D immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes are formed The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate Solution is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of 477 nm) is generated by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent signal reflects the amount of 25-OH vitamin D.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D demonstrated linearity in a study consistent with the guidelines in the CLSI Guideline EP6-A. Two human serum specimen pools and two K2EDTA plasma specimen pools with high 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-Hydroxyvtiamin D3 levels were diluted with one human serum specimen pool and one dipotassium EDTA plasma specimen pool with low 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-Hydroxyvtiamin D3 levels throughout the range of the assay. The linearity was found in the range of 6.9 to 150.0 ng/mL for serum and plasma. Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D correlated with expected concentrations according to the linear regression formulas:

Serum: $y = 1 . 0 3 8 2 ( \mathsf { x } ) + 1 . 2 5 1$ ; R-squared: 0.9978   
Plasma: $y = 1 . 0 1 5 1 \ ( \times ) + 6 . 7 6 6 9$ ; R-squared: 0.9936

Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D has been verified to detect 25-OH vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 in equal parts to the true molar concentration. 25-OH vitamin D2 and 25-OH vitamin D3 were prepared in seven (7) different ratios targeting a final concentration of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ in a serum sample pool with a low endogenous 25-OH vitamin D level. The concentration of 25- OH vitamin D was determined using Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ 25-OH Vitamin D and the resulting percent recovery was calculated. Samples with varying amounts of 25-OH vitamin D2 and 25-OH vitamin D3 recover within $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ , ranging from $101 \%$ to $103 \%$ . The data are summarized in the following table

There is considerable discussion of the serum concentrations of 25-OH Vitamin D associated with deficiency, adequacy for bone health and optimal overall health. In the past, vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25-OH vitamin D below 10 ng/mL. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined vitamin D insufficiency as serum 25-OH vitamin D below $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . However, others recently started to define vitamin D deficiency as serum 25-OH vitamin D level below $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and vitamin D insufficiency as less than 30 ng/mL. A review of the available literature suggests the following recommendations for 25-OH vitamin D levels:

Results from a total of 322 samples were used to determine the distribution of Lumipulse G 25-OH Vitamin D results in apparently healthy adults.

Excluded from the study were individuals who had history of current use of dietary supplements containing $> 2 , 0 0 0$ IU per day of Vitamin D, history of Vitamin D deficiency, any disease considered chronic, history of seizures, bariatric surgery, parathyroid and thyroid disease, were pregnant or lactating, had an active malignancy or were diagnosed with cancer other than basal/squamous cell skin cancer within 5 years, were receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment, had a family history of parathyroid or calcium regulatory disease, were on medicines known to affect absorption or increase catabolism, or had abnormal serum levels for calcium PTH or TSH.

The subjects ranged in age from 18 to 74 years (median age of 36) and were representative of the overall US population in terms of sex $4 6 . 9 \%$ male and $5 3 . 1 \%$ female) and ethnicity/race $( 6 0 . 0 \%$ White, $7 . 5 \%$ Black, $1 9 . 3 \%$ Hispanic, $8 . 1 \%$ Asian/Pacific Islander and $5 . 3 \%$ Other). The majority of the population was $\mathtt { < 5 0 }$ years old $( 2 3 1 / 3 2 2 , 7 1 . 7 \% )$ with a median age of 28.

To represent a broad spectrum of UV light exposure, the study population included adult subjects from 2 geographically diverse regions of the US (North: Northern California and New Jersey and South: Southern California and North Carolina) that were sampled during spring/summer (April through September) and fall/winter (October through March) seasons. The majority of patients was from Northern sites (247/322, $7 6 . 7 \%$ ) and sampled during the fall/winter season (241/322, $7 4 . 8 \%$ ).

To represent a broad spectrum of skin types, the assessment of skin type was done using the Fitzpatrick Skin Test questionnaire, which was completed by each study participant. Subjects were classified into six categories of the Fitzpatrick scale. There were 265 $( 8 2 . 3 \% )$ lighter skinned subjects (Fitzpatrick scale Types I, II, III) and 57 $( 1 7 . 7 \% )$ darker skinned subjects (Fitzpatrick scale Types IV, V, VI). The majority of subjects (198/322, $6 1 . 5 \% )$ were Type III. Type I and Type VI had the smallest populations $0 . 6 \%$ and $0 . 3 \%$ , respectively).

The observed range of 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations, established according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Protocol EP28-A3c is summarized in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean Conc.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MedianConc.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Observed Range(2.5th to 97.5th percentile)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>287</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22.9ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22.2ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.6 to 47.6ng/mL</td></tr></table>
