# 8. TEST PRINCIPLE (1)

The assay consists of 2 distinct reaction steps:

1. Elimination of chylomicron, VLDL-Cholesterol and LDL-Cholesterol by cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase and subsequently catalase.

![](images/be03aae56385e6f081a1a4eaa15f27936f60a9ae99c5097c46113c14b5060eb3.jpg)

2. Specific measurement of HDL-Cholesterol after release of HDL-Cholesterol by detergents in Reagent 2.

![](images/88b445bcb7361b05ba74fb883048283cfc002d22fde26092a10f15602f313741.jpg)

The intensity of the quinone imine dye produced is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration when measured at $6 0 0 \mathsf { n m }$ .

In the second reaction catalase is inhibited by sodium azide in Enzyme Reagent 2.

Key: 4 - AA - 4 - Aminoantipyrine HDAOS - N - (2 - hydroxy - 3 - sulfopropyl) - 3,5 - dimethoxyaniline.

This assay uses a Rate method and a single point calibration.

# 9. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated consistent with C.L.S.I documents EP5-A2 Precision studies were performed by two operators on two RX Daytona plus systems using control material and unaltered human serum samples that were spiked with HDL cholesterol concentrations or diluted to achieve concentrations based on established ranges ${ < } 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d } |$ undesirable, high risk HDL Cholesterol levels; $\geq 6 0 \mathrm { ~ m g / d ! }$ desirable, low risk HDL cholesterol levels . Testing was conducted for two reagent lots of Direct HDL Cholesterol (HDL), one lot on each RX Daytona plus system, twice per day for 20 non-consecutive days. Two replicates per run were performed for each sample. The assay was calibrated on the first day of the study and no assay re-calibrations were required throughout the duration of the study. The results of Lot 1 which is representative of both lots of Direct HDL Cholesterol (HDL) reagent is summarized in the following table.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. standard EP6-A. Linearity studies were performed at 11 levels to determine the analytical range of an assay - that is the range where the reported result is a linear function to the analyte concentration (or where deviation from linearity is less than $5 \%$ ).

The linearity samples were prepared at 11 levels. Randox used a low serum pool sample around $9 . 7 \ : \mathrm { m g / d } |$ analyte concentration and a serum pool with a high concentration approximately $1 2 5 - 1 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d ! }$ . The low and high pools were mixed to make nine intermediate levels. Each level was run in replicates of five on two lots of Direct HDL Cholesterol (HDL) reagent on one RX Daytona plus system. The observed values were compared to the expected values; the linear regression correlation between the expected values and the observed values for the samples with acceptable linearity are summarized in the following table:

Table 3 Linearity Summary including Regression equation and correlation coefficient.   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte Tested</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HDL Cholesterol(mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LinearRegression</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y = 1.06 - 2.80</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.998</td></tr></table>

The reportable range of the assay is 20 to 129 mg/dl

The low and high end of the reportable assay range is based on the linearity. The Rx Daytona Plus analyzer has an auto-dilution feature that is automatically activated when measuring samples $> 1 2 9 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ , which are diluted and remeasured to obtain values within the measuring range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Refer to K122126 Direct HDL/LDLCalibrator and K022591 Lipid Controls.

The Direct HDL-C/LDL-C Calibrator is traceable to an internal master reference material. Calibrators are value assigned using one instrument and multiple

repetitions. The mean, standard deviation, and $\%$ CV are calculated and evaluated against acceptance criteria.

The reagent system has not been tested or certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN). The labeling contains language that the device has not been certified by the CRMLN.

# d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP17-A2 ‘Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantification; Approved Guideline’. A Limit of Blank (L.o.B.), a Limit of Detection (L.o.D.) and a Limit of Quantification were performed on two lots of reagents tested by two operators on one RX Daytona Plus system.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for Direct HDL Cholesterol (HDL) on the RX Daytona Plus is 0.73 mg/dl based on 240 determinations, with 4 low level samples.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) is $0 . 1 9 \mathrm { m g / d } |$ .

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is $7 . 1 \ \mathrm { m g / d } 1$ as determined by the lowest concentration detected with $\leq 2 0 \%$ imprecision.

# e. Analytical Specificity:

Interference studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP7-A2 ‘Interference testing in clinical chemistry; Approved Guideline Second Edition’ The effects of potential interferents were determined by calculating the mean value of the spiked interferent with the corresponding control solution. The spiked sample results were compared to control samples prepared without the potential interferents.

Acceptance Criteria: $\%$ of Control ± 10%

The following analytes were tested up to the levels indicated at HDL Cholesterol concentrations of $3 4 . 8 \mathrm { ~ m g / d } |$ and $7 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d ! }$ and found not to interfere:

Haemoglobin No significant interference up to 1000mg/dL Total Bilirubin No significant interference up to 60mg/dL Conjugate Bilirubin No significant interference up to 60mg/dL Triglycerides No significant interference up to 500mg/dL Intralipid® No significant interference up to 2000mg/dL Ascorbic Acid No significant interference up to 6mg/dL

f. Method comparison with predicate device:

Correlation studies were carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP9-A2 ‘Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples: Approved Guideline – Second Edition’.

103 serum patient samples spanning the range 23 to $1 1 8 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d } { \sf I }$ were tested by two operators on two lots of Direct HDL Cholesterol (HDL) reagent on one RX Daytona plus analyzer and one RX Imola system across 3 working days with each sample tested in singlicate. The test method was compared to the predicate device and the following linear regression equation was obtained:

$\mathsf { Y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathsf { x } - 0 . 7 5$ Correlation coefficient of $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 9 4$

# g. Matrix comparison:

Matrix method comparisons for the Direct HDL Cholesterol (HDL) assay was tested by one operator on one RX Daytona plus system and was assessed for two lots of Direct HDL Cholesterol (HDL) reagents. Both serum and lithium heparin plasma were tested to determine whether method accuracy with plasma specimens are equivalent to serum results and that lithium heparin plasma does not interfere with either the method or the system.

Direct HDL Cholesterol (HDL) matrix comparison on the RX Daytona plus (Lithium Heparin)

Patient samples were drawn in matched pairs – one sample serum $( \mathsf { x } )$ and the second sample lithium heparin plasma (y). 45 matched patient sample pairs were analyzed spanning the 28 to $1 0 6 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d } } |$ and the following linear regression equation was obtained:

$\ Y = \ 0 . 9 9 x + 2 . 1 8$ Correlation coefficient of $\mathsf { r } = \ 0 . 9 9 3$
