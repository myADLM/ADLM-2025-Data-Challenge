Dear Yi Liu:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

# 4.0 Predicate device information

Manufacturer: Andon Medical Co., Ltd.   
Device: AG-608N Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System 510(k) number: K110017

# 5.0 Device description

The AG-607 and AG-607 Multi Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) consist of blood glucose meter, single use test strips, sterile lancets, lancing device and the control solutions.

They are based on an electrochemical biosensor technology (electrochemical) and the principle of capillary action. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in 5 seconds. The control solution available is used to test the performance of the device. It uses the same technological characteristics for testing with its predicate device.

# 8.0 Performance summary

The AG-607 and AG-607 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) conform to the following standards:

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems- Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

Non-clinical test and the clinical test are done according to the above standard.

# 9.0 Comparison to the predict device and the conclusion

The proposed device AG-607 is similar with the predicate device AG-608N, they are both for single patient use, and can test the blood glucose at the alternative site. The hematocrit range, the use function are all the same. The appearance, internal power source and the qualified test strip of the two device is different. Moreover, the new device AG-607 meter does not have the USB function.

However, the test in this submission provides demonstration that these small differences do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness.
