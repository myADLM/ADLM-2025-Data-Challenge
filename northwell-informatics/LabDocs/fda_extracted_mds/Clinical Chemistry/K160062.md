• AUTION ELEVEN model AE-4022 urine analyzer (device component) • AUTION Sticks 10EA test strips (reagent component)

# Device Description

The AUTION ELEVEN Semi-Automated Urinalysis System provides a qualitative and semi-quantitative measurement for glucose, protein, bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrites, leukocytes, specific gravity and color tone. The system is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in screening patient populations found in clinical laboratories. The AUTION ELEVEN Semi-Automated Urinalysis System consists of AUTION ELEVEN model AE-4022 urine analyzer and AUTION Sticks 10EA test strips.

The AUTION sticks 10EA consist of a plastic strip containing 10 pads impregnated with chemicals specific for the determination of a particular analyte. The chemical reaction with the urine results in a color change which is measured by the AUTION ELEVEN AE-4022 device, resulting in a display and print out indicating analyte concentration. The AUTION ELEVEN technology provides fast results that can be used along with other diagnostic information to rule out certain disease states and to determine if microscopic analysis is needed.

The semi-automated nature of the device requires the user to dip an AUTION Stick 10EA test strip into a patient urine specimen and place it on the instrument. The instrument processes the test strip, allowing 60 seconds for the chemical reactions to occur on the test strip reagent pads. After 60 seconds, the device measures the amount of reflectance generated from each reagent pad and converts the reflectance measurements to qualitative and semi-quantitative results for physician use.

# Test Principle

The AUTION ELEVEN Semi-Automated Urinalysis System device model AE-4022 uses 4 LED wavelengths to accurately read AUTION 10EA Stick test strips which are impregnated with chemicals to induce the reactions shown below upon contact with particular analytes in urine. Three (3) of the wavelengths read the analyte interaction while the fourth wavelength is used for color tone detection and correction.

![](images/538bc02ef04e8ac56ab65397683c7b2c15045bd320f6791c041777eabfd90523.jpg)

# Performance Characteristics

Bench testing and clinical testing were done in order to verify that the above differences are minor in nature and do not affect the overall performance, safety, or effectiveness of the proposed device compared to the predicate device.

# Precision Results

Each analyte was tested at 3 clinical sites using 3 operators on 3 devices for a minimum of 20 days. Three (3) levels of quality controls were used to attain results at negative, midlevel positive and high-positive analyte ranges. Two (2) levels of commercial controls were used to obtain the 3 levels, using dilutions and spiking materials as needed to obtain the highest and mid-level controls for testing of all the analyte ranks.

# Comparison Study Results

A Method Comparison study was performed at 3 sites to compare the AUTION ELEVEN Semi-Automated Urinalysis System against 2 commercially available urinalysis predicates, 1 semi-automated urine analyzer was used for specific gravity comparison and one fully-automated urine analyzer was used to compare all the rest of the analytes.

Each site collected urine patient samples from their clinical laboratory or obtained them from nearby hospitals. Urine samples were collected and refrigerated within 2 hours of collection, for up to 24 hours of refrigeration prior to clinical study testing. For inclusion into the study, the samples collected had to be positive for at least one of the chemistry analytes present on the AUTION Stick 10EA urinalysis strip

Data from each site was combined for the analysis. Accuracy (percent agreement) results are shown below.

# Proposed Labeling

Labeling adequately communicates device intended use, safety precautions and directions for use. It satisfies 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices.

# Conclusion

# Bench Testing

Bench testing evaluations were used to verify performance characteristics of the AUTION ELEVEN Semi-Automated Urinalysis System. Bench testing evaluations included: linearity, sensitivity, interfering substances, detection limit/specificity, electrical compatibility and safety, radiofrequency compatibility, device software validation, and test strip shelf life and stability. In all instances, results from bench testing met pre-determined acceptance criteria and support a determination of substantial equivalence.

# Clinical Testing

A precision study was performed on each analyte across 3 sites with 3 operators (1 per site) and 3 devices using 3 levels of quality control solutions per analyte to evaluate repeatability and reproducibility. A Method Comparison study was performed at a predetermined number of sites with 8395 tests of individual analytes including both natural and spiked samples. The overall conclusion from the clinical evaluation is that the results are acceptable and support a determination of substantial equivalence without additional risk to safety and efficacy.

Based upon the intended use, comparison with the previously cleared predicate devices, technology similarities, and bench and clinical data, the AUTION ELEVEN SemiAutomated Urinalysis System is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices, AUTION MAX AX-4030 Fully-Automated Urinalysis System.
