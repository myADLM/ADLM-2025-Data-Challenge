# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

No applicable standard was cited.

# L. Test Principle:

The StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures glucose levels using disposable test strips and a handheld meter. The test strip contains a flow channel to draw blood by capillary action into a biosensor measurement zone. The sensor comprises an enzyme (Glucose oxidase) that oxidizes glucose present in the blood sample. The sensor also contains an electron shuttle to re-generate, by oxidation, the active form of the enzyme. The meter applies a low electrical voltage to the sensor electrodes and measures a change in current caused by the electrochemical oxidation of the electron shuttle.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

This submission seeks an Over-The-Counter clearance and new trade name (StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System) for the previously cleared StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meter System; k150461. The proposed device uses identical technology, measurement algorithm, user workflow, test strips as the predicate, the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System (originally cleared in k060345 and modified in k063821, k070960, k132121 and k150461). Bench studies to collect performance data relied on these previously cleared devices, which are cited, as appropriate in each section.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run and intermediate precision were established in k060345.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity and reportable range were established in k060345.

The reportable range for the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# Readings outside of reportable range:

Bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a glucose measurement is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged and a ‘LO’ indicator is displayed. If a glucose measurement exceeds $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged and a ‘HI’ indicator is displayed.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST Standard SRM917B.

# Test Strip Stability:

Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Test Strips were evaluated in $\mathrm { k } 0 6 0 3 4 5$ and found to be acceptable. The claimed closed-vial stability is 24 months at $3 4 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ RH. The claimed open-vial stability is 6 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures $3 4 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ RH or until the expiration date printed on the label, whichever comes first.

# Controls Stability:

Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the StatStrip Xpress Glucose Control Solutions were reviewed in k060345 and found to be acceptable. The control solutions have a 24 month shelf-life from the date of manufacture when stored at 59- $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ . The claimed open-vial stability is 3 months when stored within the recommended storage temperature range of $5 9 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ .

User performance study:

To assess the performance of the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users, a lay user study was conducted with 360 subjects. Each participant self-tested their blood glucose level unassisted and was given only the instructions and training materials routinely provided with the system. The blood glucose results obtained from the fingerstick were compared to a reference method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose & Lactate Analyzer). The range of glucose concentrations across all subjects was 48 to $4 3 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ according to the reference method. The results from this study are summarized below:

Glucose concentrations $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ :

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Test Strips package insert includes the following:

The normal fasting adult blood Glucose range for a person without diabetes is less than $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . One to two hours after meals, normal blood Glucose levels should be less than $1 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study: As established in k060345 to support the claimed hematocrit range of $20 – 6 5 \%$ .

2. Altitude study: As established in k060345. There is no significant affect of altitude up to 15,000 feet (4500 meters) above sea level.

3. Temperature and Humidity Study: As established in k060345 to support the claimed operating condition range of $5 9 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F }$ - $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. The meter displays an error code and no result will be obtained when the meter is outside of this temperature range.

4. Sample Volume Study: The sponsor performed a study to validate the test strip sample volume requirement for the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood glucose samples (71, 122, and $3 0 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ were tested at five sample volumes (0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and $1 . 3 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). The glucose concentrations were compared a reference method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose & Lactate Analyzer). The sample volume study results support the claimed sample volume of $1 . 2 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the error code for insufficient sample volume.
