Dear Priscilla Chung:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

Device Name SD LipidoCare BT Home System

Indications for Use (Describe)   
SD LipidoCare BT Home System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm, forearm or upper arm; and to measure total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and HDL cholesterol (HDL) in capillary whole blood from the fingertip. SD LipidoCare BT Home System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared. It is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use).

The glucose testing system is for use by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. Glucose testing with the SD LipidoCare BT Home System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes and is not for use in neonates. For glucose testing, alternative site testing should be done only during steady-state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly). Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. Lipoprotein measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders (such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis, and various liver and renal diseases. Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephoris, liver obstruction, other diseased involving lipid metabolism, or various endocrine disorders. Use the lipid profile test system at the frequency your doctor recommends testing for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

SD LipidoCare BT Home Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with SD LipidoCare BT Home Analyzer to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip, palm, forearm, or upper arm by a single person and should not be shared. SD LipidoCare BT Home Lipid Profile Test Strips are intended for use with the SD LipidoCare BT Home Analyzer to quantitatively measure total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and HDL cholesterol (HDL) in capillary whole blood by a single person and should not be shared.

# 4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

SD LipidoCare (BT) Professional/Home Analyzer can measure TC, TG, HDL, and Glucose, and it also can calculate LDL and non-HDL using the blood sample from the human with the SD LipidoCare (BT) Professional/Home Lipid Profile and SD LipidoCare (BT) Professional/Home Glucose test strips. This system is portable using batteries for power source and can store up to 500 test results in the memory. Users can search the stored results and can review the average results for 7, 15 and 30 day glucose test results. The average calculation function is for glucose test results only. This system can set the beep, date, time, unit, auto printing, simplex/duplex printing, hypo warning for glucose, alarms and Bluetooth. The analyzer offers 2 models: one with Bluetooth function for printing the test results and transferring data to a PC via Bluetooth technology and the other without it. The analyzer without the Bluetooth unit can still print the test results and transfer the data to a PC using a cable.   
The system includes Lipid Profile Test Strip which is based on a reflectance photometry, and Glucose Test Strip which is based on glucose oxidase biosensor.   
There are also lipid check strips and glucose check strips for users to check the internal malfunction (or problem) of the analyzer prior to testing.   
The code chip is for the analyzer to read the lot-specific characteristics of the test strips currently in use.   
The SD Ezi Tube $^ +$ is used to apply blood sample for lipid profile testing.

# Substantial Equivalence Discussion

1) Similarities

Intended Use Principle of operation , Test Procedures Display method Sample Type

Both the predicate and the subject device have the similar intended use, principle of operation, display method, and sample type.

2) Differences

Testing range   
Hematocrit limit range   
Operating conditions (temperature range)   
Testing time   
Memory capacity

There are differences in testing range, hematocrit limit range, operating conditions (temperature range), testing time, and memory capacity between the two devices. We performed various clinical and bench tests and the test results supported that despite these differences the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Substantial Equivalence Discussion 1) Similarities

C-4th&5th, 16, Deogyeong-Daero, 1556beon-Gil, Yeongtong-Gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-Do, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF 443-813

Intended Use Principle of operation • Test procedures Sample type Sample volume Various specifications

Both the predicate and the subject device have the similar intended use, principle of operation, sample type, sample volume and various specifications.

2) Differences

Size of Meter Power Source Operating Temp.

There are differences in size of meter and batter type between the two devices. We performed various clinical and bench tests and the test results supported that despite these differences the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

# 7. DISCUSSION OF NON-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL TESTS PERFORMED FOR DETERMINATION OF SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE ARE AS FOLLOWS:

There are a number of differences between the subject devices and the predicate devices as presented in the table above, however, the non-clinical studies and clinical-studies provided in this submission demonstrated that the differences do not raise a question of safety and effectiveness. Based on the information provided, we conclude that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

# 8. CONCLUSION:

Based on documentation supplied with this submission, the conclusions drawn from the non-clinical and the clinical studies demonstrate that the subject devices are substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
