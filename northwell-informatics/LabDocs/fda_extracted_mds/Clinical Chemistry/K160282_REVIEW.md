# L. Test Principle:

The SD LipidoCare System combines enzymatic methodology and solid-phase technology to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. A capillary whole blood sample is applied to an SD LipidoCare test strip. The test strip is then placed into the SD LipidoCare Analyzer, where a unique system on the test strip separates the plasma from the blood cells. A portion of the sample flows to the bottom layer of the test strip and is transferred to the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol reaction pads. The LipidoCare analyzer measures TC, TG, and HDL by an enzymatic method which causes a color change in the test area of the strip. The color changes are proportional to the lipid concentration in the sample. LDL value is calculated from TC, HDL and TG values using the numerical formula LDL ${ \boldsymbol { \mu } } = ^ { \prime }$ TC-HDL-(TG/5). Calculated LDL-cholesterol values are reported only when triglycerides are ${ \leq } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; when triglycerides are $> 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the calculated LDL-cholesterol is not reported.

The SD LipidoCare Blood Glucose Test Systems quantitatively measure glucose in a capillary whole blood sample by detecting a small electrical current that results from a chemical reaction of glucose in the blood with glucose oxidase present on the glucose test strip. The amount of current created depends on how much glucose is in the blood. The resulting current is converted to a blood glucose value for display to the user.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The four systems are identical except for the device name and Bluetooth technology present in the two ‘BT’ versions (SD LipidoCare BT Home/BT Professional Systems); therefore only one set of performance data is presented below, which is representative of the performance of each of the four systems.

# Lipid Profile:

Linearity was evaluated by diluting a venous Na-heparin whole blood sample with high concentrations of each analyte (Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and HDL) with a venous Na-heparin whole blood sample containing low concentrations of each analyte to obtain 9 intermediate dilution samples $\mathrm { ( T C 9 0 - } 4 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , TG 35- 720 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and HDL $2 2 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each sample was run in replicates of 5 on the candidate device. Each result obtained by the candidate device was compared to the expected value for each level. The resulting linear regression equations for each analyte are presented below:

Triglycerides: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 7 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } { - 1 3 . 8 4 } , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 8$ HDL: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 3 4 3 + 3 . 3 4 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 6$

# Glucose test:

Linearity was evaluated by diluting a venous whole blood sample with a high concentration of glucose with a venous whole blood sample with a low concentration of glucose. The resulting glucose concentrations as determined by YSI comparator method were: 16.1, 23.7, 56.6, 86.5, 156.3, 227.5, 300.3, 363.8, 435.0, 508.8, 572.8, 645.0, and $7 2 5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was run in replicates of 5 on the candidate device and compared to the results from the comparator analyzer. The resulting linear regression equations for Glucose are presented below:

Lot $\operatorname { l } \colon \mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 5 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 6 8 8 4 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } =$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$ Lot 2: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 0 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0 1 4 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$ Lot 3: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 6 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 7 6 5$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$

The linearity studies support the claimed measuring ranges below: Total Cholesterol: $1 0 0 { - } 4 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Triglycerides: $4 5 { \mathrm { - } } 6 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ HDL: 25-95 mg/dL Glucose: $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$

The meter will display “LO” when the results are below the measuring range for each analyte and will display “HI” when the results are above the measuring range for each analyte. The sponsor validated the “LO” and “HI” functions and demonstrated that they functioned as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The SD LipidoCare Total Cholesterol is traceable to the primary reference measurement procedure, Proton NMR spectroscopy using the NIST standardized reference material, SRM 911c.

The SD LipidoCare Triglyceride and HDL test system is traceable to the glycerol kinase-pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase UV method using the primary calibrator, COA of JCCRM 224-6.

The SD LipidoCare Total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol test systems were certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN) as meeting the National Cholesterol Education Program’s (NCEP) performance criteria for accuracy and precision in capillary whole blood samples.

The SD LipidoCare Glucose test system is traceable to the NIST certified reference material, SRM 917c. Method comparison performance demonstrated accuracy to YSI 2300 analyzer.

Stability:

The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria for the LipidoCare Test Strips for all the analytes measured (total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, and glucose) were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the sponsor’s labeled stability claims:

SD LipidoCare Lipid Profile Test Strips are stable for 18 months unopened when stored at $3 6 { - } 9 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { F } }$ $( 2 { - } 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. Each Lipid Profile Test Strip is individually wrapped with a desiccant pack and the labeling indicates to perform the testing immediately after opening.

The SD LipidoCare Glucose test strips are stable for 24 months when stored unopened at $3 6 { - } 9 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { F } }$ $( 2 { - } 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. Each Glucose Test Strip is individually wrapped with a desiccant pack and the labeling indicates to perform the testing immediately after opening.

# d. Detection limit:

Detection limit studies for the Total Cholesterol, Triglyceride, and HDL analytes were performed in accordance to CLSI EP17-A2 using two SD LipidoCare Analyzers and two lots of SD LipidoCare Lipid Profile Test Strips.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined for TC, TG, and HDL by testing in vitro blank serum samples not containing the analyte being measured. Each sample was assayed in two runs over 15 days using two analyzers with two test strip lots (one lot per analyzer) for a total of 60 measurements. The following equation was used to determine the LoB for each analyte: $\mathrm { L o B = }$ mean $_ \mathrm { b l a n k } + 1 . 6 4 5$ $\mathbf { \langle S D _ { \ b l a n k } \rangle }$ .

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for TC, TG, and HDL by measuring 4 low levels of venous NaHep whole blood samples for each analyte in two runs over 15 days using two analyzers with two test strip lots (one per analyzer) to give a total of 60 measurements. The following equation was used to determine the LoD for each analyte: $\mathrm { L o D } { = } \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5$ (SD low concentration sample).

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined for TC, TG, and HDL by measuring 5 low levels of venous NaHep whole blood samples over 15 days using two analyzers with two test strip lots (one lot per analyzer) to give a total of 60 results measurements. The sponsor defines LoQ as the lowest concentration at which an imprecision goal of $C V < 1 0 \%$ can be met.

The results of the detection limit studies are summarized below:   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total Cholesterol</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>47.5 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51.7 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>26.6 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29.0 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>45.0 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HDL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18.6 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>21.2 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25.0 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

The measuring ranges for the SD LipidoCare System lipid panel are as follows:

TC: $1 0 0 { - } 4 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ TG: $4 5 { \mathrm { - } } 6 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ HDL: 25-95 mg/dL

The measuring range for the SD LipidoCare System glucose measurement is 20-600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and is supported by the linearity assay study above (M.1.b).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Glucose interference study:

To assess the effect of potential interfering substances on the performance of the SD LipidoCare System glucose measurement, venous whole blood samples with low and high glucose concentrations of approximately $6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (as measured on the YSI 2300 STAT Plus comparator method )were spiked with two to three levels of each potential interferent. The samples were run in replicates of nine. The results of the spiked samples were compared to the results of control samples (as measured on the YSI 2300 STAT Plus comparator method) which did not contain any interferent substance. The sponsor defined significant interference as $\geq \pm 1 0 \%$ bias between the individual spiked sample concentrations and the mean concentration of the control sample.

The sponsor has included the following language in the labeling:

- If you are taking acetaminophen or acetaminophen containing drugs (for example Tylenol; at blood concentrations ${ > } 6 . 6 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) you may get inaccurate results with this system. If you have a disease or condition in which uric acid levels in your blood may be elevated $( { > } 5 . 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , such as gout, you may get inaccurate results with this system.   
Do not use this device during or shortly after receiving xylose absorption therapy since xylose in your blood may cause inaccurate results with this system.

Lipids interference study:

To assess the effect of potential interfering substances on the performance of the SD LipidoCare System lipid panel measurement, sodium heparin venous whole blood samples with low and high concentrations of total cholesterol (175 and $2 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), triglyceride (175 and $3 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ ) and HDL (36 and $6 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were spiked with two or three levels of each potential interferent. The samples were run in replicates of five. The results of the spiked samples were compared to the results of control samples which did not contain any interferent substance. The sponsor defined significant interference $\mathrm { a s } \geq \pm 1 0 \%$ bias between the individual spiked sample concentrations and the mean concentration of the control sample.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

LipidoCare Glucose test Method Comparison Study: To assess system accuracy, a method comparison study was performed by healthcare professionals at three external sites with capillary samples collected from the fingertip. Testing was performed on SD LipidoCare analyzers at each site for a total of 9 analyzers using 3 lots of SD LipidoCare Glucose test strips (one lot at each site). A total of 596 glucose samples were obtained (200 from site 1, 199 from site 2, and

197 from site 3). The results obtained on the SD LipidoCare system were compared to the YSI 2300 STAT Plus glucose results performed by a laboratory professional. The glucose range tested was 21.4 to $5 0 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured on the YSI 2300 STAT Plus. Five samples with glucose concentrations below $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 0 . 8 \% )$ and 5 samples with glucose concentrations above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 0 . 8 \% )$ were contrived samples. The linear regressions obtained from the 3 glucose test strip lots for a total of 596 glucose results were as follows:

LipidoCare Lipid Profile Professional Method Comparison Study:

A method comparison study was performed by healthcare professionals at three external sites with capillary samples collected from the fingertip and a venous sample collected in a Na-heparin tube. The capillary and venous whole blood samples were tested on 3 different SD LipidoCare analyzers at each site for a total of 9 SD LipidoCare analyzers using 3 lots of SD LipidoCare Lipid Profile test strips (one lot/site). Samples which exceed the lower and higher end of the candidate device measuring range were excluded from the analysis. A total of 355 total cholesterol, 356 triglyceride results, and $3 5 8 \mathrm { H D L }$ results were obtained from the 3 test sites. The candidate capillary whole blood test results were compared to test results obtained from Na-heparin venous plasma tested using Roche Cobas Ready Total Cholesterol, Roche HDL Cholesterol, and Roche Cobas Ready Triglyceride reagent by a laboratory professional. All samples were unmodified. The regression analysis results are summarized below:

Lay-User Performance study:

Lipid Profile Test:

The accuracy of the SD LipidoCare system when used by the lay-user was evaluated by 600 lay-user participants at 3 external medical sites (200 users per site). Testing was performed using a total of 15 analyzers (5 per site) and 3 lots of SD Lipid Profile test strips (one lot per site). The lay-user participants were provided with the SD LipidoCare user manual. A healthcare professional then collected a blood sample from the participant’s fingertip and obtained results using the comparator device (Roche Cobas Ready Total Cholesterol, Roche HDL Cholesterol, and Roche Cobas Ready Triglyceride reagent). The participants were given a survey for feedback on the user manual and the candidate device. The accuracy data from each of the 3 test sites was similar. A total of $1 0 \mathrm { H D L }$ results were excluded at the 3 sites from the data analysis due to being outside the measuring range of the candidate device.

Lay-user results (candidate) vs. comparator method

Glucose Test:

To assess accuracy of the SD LipidoCare system in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a study with 586 lay-user participants at 3 external sites. The number of lay-user participants at each site were as follows: site $1 \colon \mathrm { n = } 1 9 6$ , site 2: $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 9 5$ , and site $3 \colon \mathrm { { n = 1 9 5 } }$ . Testing was performed using 3 lots of SD Glucose test strips (one lot per site). The lay-user participants were provided with the SD LipidoCare user manual in English. The lay-users collected their own fingertip capillary blood using the SD LipidoCare Home System first and then from alternative sites (palm, forearm, and upper arm) and recorded their own results. A healthcare professional then collected the participant’s capillary blood sample from the fingertip and tested the blood using the comparator device (YSI 2300). The participants were given a survey for feedback on the user manual and the candidate device. The following regression equations were obtained from one representative site for glucose measurement:

A Flesch-Kincaid reading assessment was performed on the test strip inserts and user manuals demonstrating that the proposed labeling used in the lay-user studies is at an ${ 8 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade reading level or lower.

Usability study:

The SD LipidoCare System and its instructions for use were surveyed by lay users after the user studies by means of a questionnaire during the lay user studies. The questionnaire included questions regarding the user friendliness of the system, the clarity of the user instructions. The survey results demonstrated that the lay users found the instructions and the use of the system to be satisfactory.

# N. Instrument Name:

SD LipidoCare Professional Analyzer SD LipidoCare Home Analyzer SD LipidoCare BT Professional Analyzer SD LipidoCare BT Home Analyzer

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings. There are two separate test strip insertion ports. The glucose test strip port is located at the top of the meter and the lipid profile test strip port is located at the bottom of the meter.

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X_____ or No _

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected. The SD LipidoCare System will store up to 500 patient results including control solution results. The results include the date and time the sample was run.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The SD LipidoCare System is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, forearm, and upper arm for glucose measurement; and capillary whole blood from the fingertip for lipid measurement. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip and there is no special handling or storage required. The glucose test strip requires a sample volume is $0 . 9 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of whole blood and the lipid profile test strip requires $3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of whole blood.

# 5. Calibration:

There is no user calibration required to perform the LipidoCare lipid profile and glucose tests; however, a lot specific code chip is provided with each Lipid Profile test strip package. Lipid Profile test calibrations were performed in-house and parameters were coded into the code chip. The user inserts the code chip into the meter’s code chip portal. The meter turns on automatically. A three-digit code number appears in the display window. The user must check that the number on the display window matches with the number on the test strip box. The calibration procedure programs the meter with the lot number, expiration date and test strip technology. The blood glucose testing requires no coding.

6. Quality Control:

The SD LipidoCare Professional and Home Systems User Manual states to use only SD Lipid Control Solution and the SD Glucose Control Solution with this system. The SD Lipid Control Solution consists of two levels of controls and is used as quality control for the total cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL cholesterol measurements on the SD LipidoCare Professional and Home Systems. The SD Glucose Control Solution consists of two levels of controls for the glucose measurement on the SD LipidoCare Professional and Home Systems. The SD Lipid Control Solutions and SD Glucose Control Solutions are sold separately from the SD LipidoCare Professional and Home System. Instructions on how to order the control solutions are included in the user manual. The meter has a function for the user to select that they wish to run a control solution to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as patient results. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results when the measurements are performed in the “control solution mode”. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Sample volume study

Glucose: The SD LipidoCare Test system was tested with venous blood at three glucose concentrations (approximately 50, 150, and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and seven specimen volumes (0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0 and $1 . 1 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). Each sample was measured in five replicates on the candidate device and the results compared to those obtained with by an established laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer)). Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the meter error code for insufficient sample volume.

Lipid Profile: The SD LipidoCare Test system was tested with venous blood at three total cholesterol levels (approximately 150, 194, and $2 5 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), three triglyceride levels (approximately 92, 182, and $2 6 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and three HDL levels (approximately 38, 54, and $8 2 { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ ) and nine specimen volumes (10, 20, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and $3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). Each sample was measured in triplicate on the candidate device and compared to the results obtained using the laboratory comparator method (YSI). Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $3 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the meter error code for insufficient sample volume.

2. Altitude study:

A study was performed by the sponsor to evaluate the effect of altitude on the performance of the SD LipidoCare glucose test. Venous whole blood samples with concentrations of glucose approximately 45, 110 and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were exposed to conditions simulating sea level (0ft), 3,280 feet, 6,561 feet, and 13,120 ft. The results from the candidate device were compared to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes from sea level up to 12,388 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the SD LipidoCare system.

3. Hematocrit study:

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit on three concentrations of total cholesterol (150, 220, and $2 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), triglyceride (120, 185, and $5 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), and HDL (35, 50, and $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ); and five concentrations of Glucose (40, 80, 125, 355, and ${ 5 2 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ in venous whole blood. The blood samples were adjusted to the following hematocrit levels:

To assess the effects of hematocrit on TC and TG: 25, 30, 50, 52, 55 and $60 \%$ To assess the effects of hematocrit on HDL: 25, 30, 50, 52, and $5 5 \%$ To assess the effects of hematocrit on Glucose: 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and $65 \%$

The samples were run on eight 8 SD LipidoCare analyzers (one test strip per analyzer for TC, TG, HDL and Glucose) and the results were compared to control sample with a hematocrit of $40 \%$ containing the same concentrations of analyte as the test samples. The sponsor concluded that a hematocrit range between $30 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \%$ for TC and TG, $30 \%$ for HDL, and $20 \%$ for Glucose did not show any significant hematocrit effects.

4. Test System Operating Conditions Study:

Glucose test: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples with five glucose concentrations (60, 108, 205, 300 and $4 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ to evaluate the effects of temperatures ranging from $5 0 \mathrm { ^ { o } F }$ to $1 1 3 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 1 0 – 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity conditions from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ . Five temperature and humidity combinations were tested: low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average temperature/average humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. Meter results were compared to YSI comparator analyzer. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of ${ 5 0 { - } 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } }$ (10-45 $^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) with relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ for glucose testing.

Lipid Profile test: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using two concentrations of venous blood samples for total cholesterol (approximately 180 and 270 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ , triglycerides (approximately 120 and $1 8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and HDL cholesterol (approximately 50 and $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) to evaluate the effects of temperatures ranging from $6 4 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F }$ to $9 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $1 8 { - } 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ . Meter results were compared to the comparator method. Five temperature and humidity combinations were tested: low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average temperature/average humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. No significant effect (relative to the comparator method) was observed with the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of $6 4 – 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ b $( 1 8 - 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ for lipid testing.

The final operational temperature range for the test system for measuring glucose and the lipid profile tests is $6 4 – 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $1 8 { - } 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , which is the narrower of the glucose operating condition ranges. The meters will display an error code (E- 4) and a thermal icon to prevent a test result from being displayed when the system is outside of $6 4 { - } 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ .

# 5. Infection Control Studies:

The four devices in this submission (SD LipidoCare Home, SD LipidoCare Professional, SD LipidoCare BT Home, and SD LipidoCare BT Professional Systems)are for single patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating

complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Discide Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA registration #10492-4). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles simulating weekly single-patient use cleaning and disinfection over the 5 year use life of the meter. The subject device labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 6. EMC Testing

The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing (EMC) has been performed on the SD LipidoCare Analyzer (both Bluetooth and nonBluetooth models) and was found to be compliant.

7. This device was reviewed after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance documents were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to finalization of the guidance documents.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
