# IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer (TC-201) is a portable easy to use instrument which reads Teco Diagnostics' Urine Reagent (URS-10) Strips for testing in the clinical laboratory. The analyzer can determine the intensity of different colors on the reagent strip test area. It does this by irradiating the test area with light and detecting the reflectance of different wavelengths using photodiode. Results are calculated by a reflection rate which is a percentage of the total reflectance of the testing wavelength and are printed automatically.

The Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer reports semi-quantitative assays for Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite and Leukocytes in urine. The analyzer features a display, internal printer, a serial computer interface and an electrical outlet. Communication between the operator and the analyzer is made through the display using the user interface touch screen on the front surface of the instrument. Reagent strip results are automatically displayed on the screen in one minute. A printed hardcopy can also be created either from the results screen or recalled from memory.

The Urine Reagent Strips (URS-10) for Urinalysis are firm plastic strips to which ten different reagent pads are affixed. The reagent pad areas are bibulous material saturated with chemically active substances, then dried and affixed to the plastic strip with double-sided adhesive. The Teco Urine Reagent (URS-10) Strips provide tests for the semi-quantitative determination of Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite, and Leukocytes in urine.

# 510(k) SUMMARY

# 510(k) SUMMARY

The Teco Diagnostics Urine Reagent (URS-10) Strips and Clinitek Multistix 10 SG Strips share the same characteristics including Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite and Leukocyte methodologies.

# VII TEST PRINCIPLE

Glucose: This test is based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. One enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the reaction in which glucose is oxidized to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. A second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with potassium iodide chromogen in which the chromogen is oxidized to different colors ranging from blue-green to greenish-brown through brown and dark brown.

Bilirubin: This test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with a diazotized dichioroaniline in a strongly acid medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce light tan to reddish brown color proportional to its concentration in urine.

Ketone: This test is based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid with sodium nitroprusside in a strongly basic medium. The colors range from beige or buff-pink color for a "Negative" reading to pink and pink-purple for a "Positive" reading.

Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated polyelectrolytes in relation to the ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, the colors range from dark blue or blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green in urine of higher ionic concentration.

Blood: This test is based on the pseudoperoxidase action of hemoglobin and erythrocytes which catalyzes the reaction of $^ { 3 , 3 } , 5 , 5$ '-tetramethyl-benzidine and buffered organic peroxide. The resulting colors range from orange to yellow-green and dark green. Very high blood concentration may cause the color development to continue to dark blue.

pH: This test is based on the well-known double $\mathsf { p H }$ indicator method, where bromothymol blue and methyl red give distinguishable colors over the pH range of 5-9. The colors range from redorange to yellow and yellow-green to blue-green.

Protein: This test is based on the protein error-of-indicator principle. At a constant $\mathsf { p H }$ , the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow for a "Negative" reaction to yellow-green and green to blue-green for a "Positive" reaction.

Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction in which pdiethylaminobenzaldehyde reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly acid medium. Colors range from light pink to bright magenta.

# 510(k) SUMMARY

Nitrite: This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram negative bacteria in the urine. The nitrite reacts with p-arsanilic acid to from a diazonium compound in an acid medium. The diazoniumn compound in turn couples with 1,2,3,4- tetrahydrobenzo(h) quinolin to produce a pink color.

Leukocytes: This test is based on the action of esterase present in leukocytes, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative. The indoxyl ester liberated reacts with a diazoniumn salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color.

# A. Precision Study:

# i) In-house Precision Study:

Within Run Precision of Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer with the Teco Diagnostics Urine Reagent Strips (URS-10) was evaluated using commercially available urine control solutions at Level I (High analyte concentration), Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III (Negative). The package insert and certificate of analysis of these control solutions confirmed the specific target analyte concentration in each level. The repeatability of the Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer was evaluated by testing each level of control solution by three operators on three analyzers in replicates of 20 per run per day with three strip lots. A total of 180 strips were used for each level control solution tested (20 strips x 3 strip lots x 1 day x 3operators/analyzers $= 1 8 0$ tests per control).

As shown in the following tables, all analytes read $100 \%$ within the expected results $+ / -$ one color block. Please see Appendix 18.B for In-House Precision Study Data tables. The results from the Within-Run Precision study are summarized below:

The Run to Run precision of Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer with the Teco Diagnostics Urine Reagent Strips (URS-10) was evaluated by testing each level of control solution (negative, low positive, and high positive) by two operators with three lots of URS-10 strips in three replicate assays per run, 2 non- consecutive runs each day for over 10 days on 2 Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer. Run 1 and Run 2 were separated by atleast 1 hour. A total of 120 strips were used for each level control solution tested (3 strips $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ run x 10 days $\textbf { x } 2$ operators/analyzers/strip lots $=$ 120 tests per control).

As shown in the following tables, all analytes read $100 \%$ within the expected results $+ / -$ one color block. Please see Appendix 18.B for In-House Precision Study Data tables. The results from the Run to Run Precision study are summarized below:

# ii) Point-of-Care Precision Study:

The precision of Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer at point-of-care (POC) sites was evaluated using commercially available urine control solutions at Level I (High analyte concentration), Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III (Negative). The package insert and certificate of analysis of these control solutions confirmed the specific target analyte concentration in each level. The three level control solutions were dispensed in to different containers and were randomly labeled with numbers. Each sample was tested in duplicates per run, two runs per day for 10 days $\mathrm { N } = 4 0$ testing per sample).

# B. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range

A study to evaluate the reportable range for each analyte color block on the Teco Diagnostics Urine Reagent Strips (URS-10) was performed by measuring negative urine and negative urine spiked with known increasing and decreasing concentrations of analytes relative to each color block covering the entire measuring range of each analyte present on the URS-10 strip. Sample measurement was performed in replicates of 8 by 3 operators on each of 3 individual strip lots (8 strips $\textbf { X 3 }$ operators/ strip lots), for a total of 24 measurements for every sample tested. A pH meter was used to confirm the $\mathsf { p H }$ results. The specific gravity values were confirmed by a

# C. Traceability and Stability:

# Traceability and Expected Value:

Three levels of commercial urine controls that represent values as negative, low and high for all 10 URS parameters were used to assess the quality, the integrity and the stability of URS-10 strips during the manufacturing process and the storage of the strips. The package insert and certificate of analysis of these control solutions confirmed the specific target analyte concentration in each level. These controls were purchased from a commercially available supplier (HYCOR Biomedical), who sells their controls for standard testing throughout the world.

The expected ranges for all controls used for testing URS-10 strips are listed in the following table. Please see Appendix 18.D for the control details.

# Stability:

Although the Teco Diagnostics URS-10 strips (K970250) have already passed all the Stability studies and approved by FDA for commercial use but we are performing three types of stability studies to assess the stability of URS-10 reagent strips with our new Uritek TC-201 urine analyzer.

# (1) Open bottle study:

To monitor URS-10 strip's integrity after the strip bottle has been opened for use, open bottle study was conducted. This study involves testing URS-10 strips once per week periodically on TC-201 device, for 13 weeks using commercial urine controls levels I, II and III. Three (3) lots of URS-10 strip bottles used in the Open-vial Study will have passed Quality Control inspection and are opened (seals broken) and stored at room temperature $( 1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $20 \mathrm { - } 3 0 \%$ humidity. The acceptance criteria was that the tested strips must read all controls within the expected ranges as listed in the package insert for $\geq 9 0$ days (pass 13 weeks) to confirm the statement "Do not use after 90 days of breaking the foil" on the URS-10 strip bottle label.

# (2) Accelerated stability study:

Besides being used for testing product's integrity, accelerated stability study is often carried out to assess the shelf-life of a new product, which is verified in real-time studies. Accelerated stability study involves testing URS-10 strips once per week periodically on TC-201 device, for 13 weeks using commercial urine controls levels I, II and III. Three (3) lots of URS-10 strip bottles used in the Accelerated stability study will have passed Quality Control inspection and are sealed and stored at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ oven and $20 \mathrm { - } 3 0 \%$ humidity. The acceptance criteria was that the tested strips must read all controls within the expected ranges as listed in Table 18.3.1 for $\geq$ 90 days (pass 13 weeks) to confirm the sealed URS-10 strips bottle shelf life of two (2) years at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with $20 \mathrm { - } 3 0 \%$ humidity.

# (3) Real-time shelf-life study:

A real time, temperature and humidity stability study is currently being performed on sealed bottles of URS-10 strips to validate the claims stated in the Accelerated Stability Studies. This

# 510(k) SUMMARY

study involves testing the URS-10 strips on TC-201 device using commercial urine control levels I, II and III for every six (6) months from the manufactured date, until 18 months. After the URS-10 strips has passed 18 months, test every three (3) months until the product fails or until 27 months (3 months after the stated expiration date). Three (3) lots of URS-10 strips used in the Real Time Shelf Life Study will have passed Quality Control inspection and are sealed and stored at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $20 { - } 3 0 \%$ humidity. The current strip label has an expiration date of 2 years.

The acceptance criteria was that the tested strips must read all controls within the expected ranges as listed in the package insert in real-time through its expiration date in the conditions that the product will be stored: sealed bottle, room temperature $( 1 5 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$

Results of all the stability studies are summarized in the following table. Please see Appendix 18.E Stability Study Data for data table.

# D. Detection Limit

Sensitivity Study was performed to determine the cutoff point concentration at which each analyte on the URS-10 strip changed from negative to the positive color blocks. Samples were prepared by spiking the specified analyte concentration into negative urine with a minimum of 4 levels across the measuring range for each color block. Each pool was then analyzed in replicates of 8 by 3 operators on each of the 3 individual strip lots (8 strips $_ { \mathrm { ~ X ~ } 3 }$ operators/ strip lots), for a total of 24 data points for each level. The cutoff point determination study for each color block for each analyte is defined as the lowest concentration at which $5 5 5 \%$ of the test results are positive.

# E. Analytical Specificity

Endogenous and Exogenous Interference Study:

Potential endogenous interferents and drugs commonly found in urine were evaluated to assess the interfering effect of various substances on the performance of URS-10 strips on Uritek TC201 Urine Analyzer. At least 2 levels of the listed interferents were added to the urine sample pools which were prepared at 3 concentrations for each urine chemistry analyte; negative, low positive and high positive. Each urine sample was tested with 3 replicates using Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer. Interference was defined as a change in output of $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ color blocks between spiked and unspiked control sample for all the URS parameters.

The concentrations of the potential interfering substances that did not have any influence on the test results are listed below:

# pH Interference Study:

The sponsor performed an additional study to evaluate the effect of sample $\mathsf { p H }$ on the test results for the ten analytes in human urine. The study result shows that sample $\mathsf { p H }$ from 5.0 to 9.0 does not affect the test results for leukocytes, urobilinogen, ketone, $\mathrm { p H }$ , blood, nitrite, bilirubin and glucose. Samples with $\mathsf { p H }$ greater than 8.5 affected the protein test resulting in a false high result.

# Specific Gravity Interference Study:

The sponsor performed an additional study to evaluate the effect of sample specific gravity on the test results for the ten analytes in human urine. The study result shows that sample specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.040 does not affect the test results for leukocytes, urobilinogen, ketone, blood, nitrite, bilirubin and glucose. Samples with specific gravity greater than 1.030 affected the pH and protein tests resulting in a false low result.

Based on the results of this testing the sponsor has included the effects from above interfering substances in the labeling as limitations of procedure.

# F. Flex Study

Temperature and Humidity Study:

The environmental effect on the performance of Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer and URS-10 strips was evaluated by placing the strips in relative humidity of $< 2 0 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $60 \%$ and $70 \%$ environment at $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Strips were removed at 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 16h and $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ for testing using commercially available urine control solutions at Level I (High analyte concentration), Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III (Negative).

# 510(k) SUMMARY

Teco Diagnostics URS-10 strips were stable up to $70 \%$ humidity for over $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ at either $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . 3 replicates of strips tested passed each control level at $100 \%$ exact match. Please see Appendix 18.H Humidity Study Data for data tables.

# Timing Flex Study:

The effect of various dipping time in urine samples was evaluated for the performance of the Teco Diagnostics URS-10 strip. The strip was dipped in the urine samples for 1 second, 5 seconds and 10 seconds before removed for testing using commercially available urine control solutions at Level I (High analyte concentration), Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III (Negative). Results showed that the dipping time had no interfering effect on the test. Please see Appendix 18.I Timing Flex Study Data for data tables.

# Sample Running Over Study:

The interference of samples running over from one pad to the adjacent pad on the performance of URS-10 strip was evaluated. The strip was dipped into a urine sample and upon removal, was held upward to allow the sample flow from the leukocyte pad to the next aligned pads or held downward to allow the sample flow from the glucose pad to the next aligned pads before testing. Commercially available urine control solutions at Level I (High analyte concentration), Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III (Negative) were used for testing. Results demonstrate that sample running over from one test pad had no interfering effect on the test of the other pad. Please see Appendix 18.J Sample Running Over Study Data for data tables.

# Analyzer Operating Conditions Study:

All the performance testing (linearity, sensitivity and interference) was carried out at ideal laboratory conditions $1 5 { - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 5 - 3 0 \%$ Relative Humidity.

An additional study was performed to ensure the claim of acceptable operating conditions at 15- $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 8 \mathrm { - } 8 0 \%$ Relative Humidity for the Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer. The performance of Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer and URS-10 strips was evaluated by placing the Uritek TC-201 Urine analyzer in relative humidity of ${ > } 8 0 \%$ environment at ${ \ge } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { { C } }$ . These conditions were manufactured artificially in the Laminar Air Flow Cabinet by placing Hot Water Steam Bath and a Humidifier. Tests were performed at particular time-points at 0.1h, 8h, 16h and $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ using commercially available urine control solutions at Level I (High analyte concentration), Level II (Low analyte concentration) and Level III (Negative).

Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer was stable at $9 2 \%$ humidity for over $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The acceptance criteria was that the tested strips must read all controls within the expected ranges as listed in Table 18.3.1. 5 replicates of strips tested passed for each control level. Please see Appendix 18.M Analyzer Operating Conditions Study Data for data tables.

# 4. Comparison Study

# A. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Three Point-of-Care (POC) Sites that represented the intended user sites of these devices were selected to perform the method comparison studies to evaluate the performance of the Teco Diagnostics Urinalysis Reagent Strip (URS-10) read by the Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer compared to the performance of the predicate method, Siemens Multistix 10 SG Reagent strip read by Siemens Clinitek Status $^ +$ Urine Analyzer. Each site randomly selected at least 115, unaltered patient samples to test on both device pairings. In order to evaluate the performance of the candidate device over the entire measuring range of each analyte, additional contrived samples ( $10 \%$ of the total samples) were tested resulting in up to 392 specimens evaluated at all sites. Three lots of Teco Diagnostics Urinalysis Reagent Strip (URS-10) and 3 units of Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer were used in the study (detailed information is provided in Appendix 18.L). Three operators at each site ran the samples.

An additional method comparison study was performed at POC Site I and Site II for a total of 91 clinical samples to demonstrate the substantial equivalence accuracy for all the URS parameters. Moreover a separate study was performed at Site I wherein the patient urine samples were prescreened at $\mathrm { p H } \geq 8 . 0$ using a standardized $\mathsf { p H }$ meter and then performed the method comparison study using Uritek TC-201 Urine Analyzer and Siemens Clinitek Status $^ +$ Urine Analyzer. The total number of patient urine specimens evaluated in the Method Comparison Study is 509. $( 3 9 2 + 9 1 + 2 6 )$ Gender and unique patient identifiers were recorded for each sample tested. Testing results are summarized in the following tables.

B. Matrix Comparison: Not applicable.

5. Clinical Study: Not applicable.

# 6. Expected Values/Reference Range:

Glucose: Small amounts of glucose are normally excreted by the kidney.5 Concentrations as little as $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { g / d l }$ glucose, read either at 10 or 30 seconds, may be significantly abnormal if found consistently. At 10 seconds, results should be interpreted qualitatively; for semi-quantitative results, read at 30 seconds only.

Bilirubin: Normally, no bilirubin is detectable in urine by even the most sensitive method. Even trace amounts of bilirubin are sufficiently abnormal to require further investigation. Atypical colors (colors produced which are different than the negative or positive color blocks shown on the Color Chart) may indicate that bilirubin derived bile pigments are present in the urine sample and are possibly masking the bilirubin reaction.

# 510(k) SUMMARY

Ketone: Normally, no ketones are present in urine. Detectable levels of ketone may occur in urine during physiological stress conditions such as fasting, pregnancy, and frequent strenuous exercise.6-8 In starvation diets, or in other abnormal carbohydrate metabolism situation, ketones appear in the urine in excessively large amounts before serum ketones are elevated.9

Specific Gravity: Random urine may vary in specific gravity from $1 . 0 0 3 { - } 1 . 0 4 0 { + }$ . Twenty-four hour urine from normal adults with normal diets and normal fluid intake will have a specific gravity of 1.016-1.022.10

Blood: Any green spots or green color developing on the reagent area within 40 seconds is significant and the urine should be examined further. Blood is frequently, but not invariably found in the urine of menstruating females.

pH: The normal pH of urine can range from 4.5-8.0. The average pH values in healthy subjects is 6.0.3

Protein: In 24-hour urine, $\mathrm { 1 - 1 4 \ m g / d l }$ of protein may be excreted by the normal kidney.4 A color matching any color block greater than trace indicates significant proteinuria. For urine with high specific gravity, the test area may most closely match the trace color block even though only normal concentrations of protein are present. Clinical judgment is needed to evaluate the significance of trace results.

Urobilinogen: In a healthy population, the normal urine urobilinogen range obtained with this test is 0.2-1.0 Ehrlich Unit/dL. A result of 2.0 EU/dL may be of clinical significance and the same patient sample should be evaluated further.

Nitrite: Normally no detectable amount of nitrite is present in urine.3 The nitrite area will be positive in a proportion of cases of significant infection, depending on how long the urine specimens were retained in the bladder prior to collection. Retrieval of positive cases with the nitrite test range from as low as $40 \%$ , in instances where little bladder incubation occurred, to as high as $80 \%$ in instances where a minimum of 4 hours incubation occurred.

Leukocytes: Normal urine specimens generally yield negative results with this test. A trace result may be of questionable clinical significance and it is recommended that the test be repeated using a fresh sample from the same patient. Repeated trace and positive results are of clinical significance.
