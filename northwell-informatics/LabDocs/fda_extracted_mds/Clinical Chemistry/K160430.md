Dear Ms. Gregory:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

The system is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is to be used as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.

The Contour Next blood glucose monitoring system is indicated for use with fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip and palm only. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

The system consists of a Contour Next blood glucose meter, Contour Next test strips and Contour Next control solutions.

Contour Next test strips are intended for self-testing by persons with diabetes for the quantitative measurement of glucos in whole blood samples.

The Contour Next blood glucose monitoring system is not intended for the diagnosis or screening for diabetes mellitus and is not intended for use on neonates.

# Contour Next Link Wireless Blood Glucose Meter:

The Contour Next Link Wireless Blood Glucose Meter consists of a small handheld blood glucose meter that utilizes dry reagent test strips for the measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes. Liquid control solution is used to check the performance of the system. The meter, together with the test strips and control solutions, is referred to as the Contour Next Link Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

The System also contains radio frequency (RF) functions for sending blood glucose results to compatible Medtronic MiniMed insulin pumps. The RF function can also serve as a pass through for data being transmitted from Medtronic MiniMed insulin pumps to Medtronic’s MiniMed PC-based data management software.

The chemical principle utilized for both the predicate and modified devices is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose in the blood with chemicals on the reagent strip. The blood sample is drawn into the tip of the reagent strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) enzyme on the reagent strip. The electrons generated by this reaction are shuttled to an electrode by a mediator chemical, producing a current that is proportional to the glucose in the sample. After a fixed reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is calculated and displayed.

# Data demonstrating substantial equivalence

# Contour Next Link Wireless meter:

The Contour Next Link Wireless Blood Glucose Meter consists of a small handheld blood glucose meter that is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the Contour Next Link Wireless Blood Glucose Meter (K122370). The modified and predicate devices use the same glucose calculation algorithm. Both devices also use dry reagent test strips for the measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes and liquid controls to check the performance of the system. The same Contour Next test strips and Contour Next control solutions are used by both the modified and predicate devices.

# Summary of Performance testing for the Contour Next Link Wireless and Contour Next meters

Bench testing was conducted to ensure that the error checks acted as intended and gave error messages for:

• Test strips that had been exposed to a reducing agent • Un-mixed control test solution • Samples that had been disturbed during the test countdown

Software verification testing was conducted to ensure that no good results were classified as errors as a result of the modifications.

Equivalency testing was conducted to ensure the performance of the modified and predicate meters was not statistically different.

An internal user study was conducted to ensure the modifications did not impact the blood glucose result accuracy of the Contour Next Link Wireless system.

# Conclusions from Performance Evaluations

The Contour Next Link Wireless Blood Glucose Meter is substantially equivalent in its intended use, performance, safety and effectiveness to the predicate Contour Next Link Wireless Blood Glucose Meter (K122370) based on the performance of the Contour Next Link Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

The Contour Next Blood Glucose Meter is substantially equivalent in its intended use, performance, safety and effectiveness to the predicate Contour Next Blood Glucose Meter (K121190) based on the performance of the Contour Next Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
