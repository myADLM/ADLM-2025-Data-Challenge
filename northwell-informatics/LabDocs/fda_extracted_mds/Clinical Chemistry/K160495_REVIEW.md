D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

Quantitative, immunoassay

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

VITROS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automation Solutions is a configurable, scalable laboratory automation system (LAS) designed to streamline pre and post analytical processes in the clinical laboratory. VITROS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automation Solutions is comprised of Personal Computer (PC) Kit(s) (including software and hardware), sample conveyors with turns, parallel and perpendicular bypasses, storage module, single-tube entry, rack entry and exit, centrifuge, de-capper modules and clinical analyzers.

The connection between the automation software of the VITROS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automation Solutions allows the establishment of a connection with the laboratory information system (LIS) and the clinical analyzers such as VITROS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Systems to enable sample routing based on reagent and calibration status.

In the basic configuration, patient sample tubes are loaded onto the automation track to be centrifuged, de-capped, and sorted for further processing on clinical analyzers such as the VITROS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Systems. Additional modules may be added to enable aliquot capability, sample capping, and refrigerated storage.

2. Principles of Operation:

The Carbamazepine assay is based on an enzyme heterogeneous, competitive immunoassay.

The Gentamicin assay is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay.

The Total T4 assay is a competitive immunoassay.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between results for samples delivered to the VITROS System analyzers via the VITROS Automation Solutions (on-track) and samples manually placing on the VITROS System analyzers by the operator (off-tack). A total of 70 samples were tested for carbamazepine, 13 samples were spiked $( 1 8 \% )$ with a stock solution of carbamazepine using the VITROS® 5,1 FS Chemistry System. A total of 55 native samples were tested for gentamicin using the 5600 Integrated System and a total of 51 native samples and an additional 6 diluted samples ( $10 \%$ spiked) were tested for Total T4 using the 3600 Immunodiagnostic System. The samples were split into pairs: one sample processed through the VITROS Automation Solutions (on-track) and delivered to the VITROS chemistry analyzer and the other was processed by manually loading directly to the VITROS chemistry analyzers systems (off-track). The samples were tested in three replicates per sample both on and off the track. The first replicate from each sample was used to generate the regression statistics. The regression analysis for each assay are summarized in the tables below:
