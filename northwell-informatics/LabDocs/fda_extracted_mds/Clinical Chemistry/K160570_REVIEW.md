# L. Test Principle:

The Creatine Kinase assay is a UV test for the quantitative determination of creatine kinase (CK) in human serum and plasma on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems. The CK is activated by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). In a primary reaction, the activated CK catalyzes the dephosphorylation of creatine phosphate. In a coupled reaction, catalyzed by hexokinase (HK), glucose is phoshorylated by the ATP formed in the primary reaction to form Dglucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Finally D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) catalyzes the oxidation of G6P by NADP to form D-6-phosphogluconate and NADPH. The rate of NADPH formation is directly proportional to catalytic CK activity. It is determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ (main) and 546nm (sub).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision experiments were performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP5-A2. Five serum pools and two levels of control were tested using two aliquots per run, two runs per day for 21 days on the same cobas c 501 analyzer and 3 lots of reagent. Repeatability (within run precision) and intermediate precision (within lab precision) were calculated. Precision results are:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted by preparing dilution series using human sample pools (one serum pool and one plasma pool) with creatine kinase concentrations to cover the claimed measuring range. The ranges tested were 5.3 to ${ 2 0 9 9 } \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ for serum and 3.6 to $2 1 8 1 \ \mathrm { U / L }$ for plasma. Dilutions were made using $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl. The dilution series contain 18 concentrations for both serum and plasma. Samples were measured in triplicate on a cobas c 501 analyzer and data analysis was done separately for each sample type. Linear regression analysis was done according to EP6-A. The results of the linearity evaluation are:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample Type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Linear Regression</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y=1.00x-1.137</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9996</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y=1.00x-2.842</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9997</td></tr></table>

The claimed measuring range for creatine kinase is $7 - 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ (0.12-33.4 μkat/L).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: This method has been standardized against the IFCC Method for Creatine Kinase.

Stability: The reagent shelf life stability claim is 12 months at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The reagent onboard (in use and refrigerated) stability claim is 8 weeks.

Calibrator: The calibrator used with the Creatine Kinase assay is the previously cleared Roche Diagnostics Calibrator for Automated Systems (k101456).

Controls: The controls used with the Creatine Kinase assay have been previously   
cleared:   
Precinorm U plus/Precipath U Plus (k042389)   
Precinorm CK‑MB/Precipath CK-MB (k062972)   
PreciControl ClinChem Multi 1 and 2 (k102016)

Sample stability assessment: A plasma sample stability study was performed using native plasma samples collected in Li Heparin, K2 EDTA and K3 EDTA and stored at $1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2 days, at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 7 days and frozen at (-15 to $- 2 5 ) ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 28 days. The samples were tested using the CK assay on the cobas c 501 analyzer and ranged from 82.2 to $1 3 9 . 1 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ . The $\%$ recovery relative to the analyte content of the time zero samples (reference) was calculated from the median of the threefold measurement. The study supported the sample stability claim of EDTA/heparin plasma: 2 days at $1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 7 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 4 weeks at (-15 to -25) $^ \circ \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The evaluation of the limits of detection followed the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was defined as the concentration at which there is a $9 5 \%$ probability that a sample is analyte-free. The LoB calculation was performed with one analyte free sample measured with three reagent lots in 10-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. In total, 60 measurements were obtained per lot. Data analysis is based on determination of the 95th percentile of the 60 measured values.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was defined as the concentration at which there is a $9 5 \%$ probability that a sample contains analyte. For determination of LoD five samples with low-analyte concentration (approximately up to 4 times the LoB) were measured with three reagent lots in two-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. In total 60 measurements were obtained per lot. $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 3 \mathrm { x S D t }$ ot.

The limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that can be quantitatively determined with a stated acceptable precision and trueness under stated experimental conditions. For determination of LoQ a low level sample set was prepared by diluting 5 human serum samples with an analyte free diluent $( 0 . 9 \% \mathrm { N a C l } )$ . The low level sample set was tested in 5 replicates per sample on 5 days, one run per day on one cobas c 501 analyzer. LoQ is calculated with the precision at $20 \%$ CV results.

The results of the evaluation of the detection limits are in the table below. The label states that the detection limit of the test system is $7 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous Interference:

The effects of endogenous interference by hemoglobin, lipemia (Intralipid), and bilirubin on the Creatine Kinase test system was performed on the cobas c 501 analyzer using 2 CK concentrations (Level 1 approximately $1 2 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ and Level 2 approximately $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ of pooled human serum samples spiked with varying levels of interferent. The resulting sample series (10 dilution steps per sample) were tested in triplicate and then the measured concentration was compared to the expected concentration (which is the CK concentration when no interferent was added). The results are:

Exogenous Interference:

Two sample pools containing a low and high concentration (low is approximately 120 U/L and high is approximately $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { U / L } )$ of CK were used. These sample pools were divided into an appropriate number of aliquots. One aliquot was not spiked with the drugs and it was used as the reference sample for CK concentration. The other sample aliquots, with either the high or low CK concentrations, were spiked with the respective amount of drug. The CK concentration of the spiked aliquots were determined in triplicate on a cobas c 501 analyzer and compared to the CK concentration determined for the reference aliquot (mean of $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ ). The sponsor defined no significant interference as $< 1 0 \%$ difference from the reference sample.

No interference was found when tested using Acetylcysteine $( 1 6 6 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Ampicillin-Na ( $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L ) }$ , Ascorbic acid $( 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Cyclosporine $( 5 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Cefoxitin $( 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ), Heparin (5000 U), Intralipid (10,000), Levodopa $( 4 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Methyldopa $+ 1 . 5$ $2 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Metronidazole $( 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Phenylbutazone $( 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Doxycycline $( 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Acetylsalicylic Acid $\mathrm { { ( 1 0 0 0 m g / L ) } }$ , Rifampicin $( 6 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ,

Acetaminophen $( 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , Ibuprofen $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ), and Theophylline $[ 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ . The labeling states that no interference was found at therapeutic concentrations using common drug panels.

Interference was found with Cyanokit. The labeling states that Cyanokit (Hydroxocobalamin) at therapeutic concentrations interferes with the test.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 132 human serum samples with values ranging from 7.59 to $1 9 4 6 \mathrm { U / L }$ were tested in the method comparison study. The samples were tested in singlicate with the CK assay on the cobas c 501 analyzer and the predicate device. Nine of the 132 samples were spiked with human recombinant CK MB. The data were evaluated using Passing Bablok regression analysis. The results of the analysis are:

$$

$$

# b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was performed using samples drawn into serum and different types of plasma collection tubes (K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA, Li Heparin, and Gel Separation). For each of the four tube types, 36 samples ranging from 8 to $1 9 5 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ were tested in singlicate on the cobas c 501 analyzer. Regression analysis was performed using the serum data as the reference. The results of the studies are:

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Reference intervals for CK depend on the patient group and the specific clinical situation. Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if necessary, determine its own reference ranges.

For healthy people, according to Klein et al. 1

<table><tr><td>CK</td><td>U/L</td><td>μkat/L</td></tr><tr><td>Men</td><td>39-308</td><td>0.65-5.14</td></tr><tr><td>Women</td><td>26-192</td><td>0.43-3.21</td></tr></table>

The reference values according to Klein et al. are based on the 95th percentile of a group of healthy persons (202 men and 217 women) not involved in high‑intensity athletic activities and were established on Roche/Hitachi analyzers using CK reagent.
