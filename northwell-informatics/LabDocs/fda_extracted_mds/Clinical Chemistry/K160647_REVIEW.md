# L. Test Principle:

IMMULITE 2000 Free T4: IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 is a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with monoclonal murine anti-T4 antibody. The liquid phase consists of alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to T4. The patient sample and the reagent are first incubated together with the coated bead. During this time, free T4 in the sample competes with enzyme conjugated T4 in the reagent for a limited number of antibody binding sites on the bead. Unbound patient sample and enzyme conjugate are then removed by centrifugal washes. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the reaction tube containing the bead and the signal is generated in proportion to the bound enzyme.

IMMULITE 2000 Third Generation TSH: IMMULITE 2000 Third Generation TSH is a solidphase, two-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with monoclonal murine anti-TSH antibody. The liquid phase consists of alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to polyclonal goat anti-TSH antibody. The patient sample and the reagent are incubated together with the coated bead for 60 minutes. During this time, TSH in the sample binds to enzyme conjugated anti-TSH antibody in the reagent, and then this complex is captured by the anti-TSH antibody on the bead. Unbound patient sample and enzyme conjugate are then removed by centrifugal washes. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the reaction tube containing the bead and the signal is generated in proportion to the bound enzyme.

IMMULITE 2000 Free T4: A pediatric reference range study using population age from 1 month old to 20 years old was conducted. Serum samples were collected at 8 U.S. sites to be representative of the U.S. population diversity. The samples were obtained from apparently healthy individuals who were not taking prescribed or over-the counter medications in the 7 days prior to sample collection, or were not taking contraceptive medication in the 90 days prior to sample collection, or were not pregnant. Subject who are suspicious of premature/delayed puberty, or are positive for the presence of autoantibody against Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) and Thyroglobulin (TG) are also excluded from the study. All samples were shipped and tested at a single laboratory study site. A total of 426 pediatric patient (81 infants, 197 children, and 148 adolescents) samples were tested in singleton using four (4) reagent lots to establish the IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile were used as the pediatric reference ranges. The reference interval for the infant group was calculated using the robust symmetrical method to accommodate the smaller sample size of this population. A non- parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents based on the CLSI C28-A3 recommendation because the sample size was greater than 120. Reference ranges are summarized in the table below.

IMMULITE 2000 Third Generation TSH: A pediatric reference range study using population age from 1 month old to 20 years old was conducted. Serum samples were collected at $8 \mathrm { U } . \mathrm { S }$ . sites to be representative of the U.S. population diversity. All samples were shipped and tested at a single laboratory study site. A total of 433 pediatric patient (90 infants, 195 children, and 148 adolescents) samples were tested in singleton using three (3) reagent lots to establish the IMMULITE 2000 Third Generation TSH reference ranges for the studied pediatric population. Results from the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile were used as the pediatric reference ranges. The reference interval for the infant group was calculated by performing a log-transformation of the raw data followed by the application of the robust symmetric method to the transformed data. This approach was selected to be most appropriate for the smaller sample size as the data from this population was highly skewed to the right and a transformation was necessary to obtain a normal distribution. The sponsor has language in their package insert explaining the uncertainty in the value for the upper limit of the reference range. A non- parametric approach was used to establish the reference intervals for children and adolescents based on the CLSI C28-A3 recommendation because the sample size was greater than 120. Reference ranges are summarized in the table below.
