Dear Jennifer Gregory:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

510(k) Number (if known) K160682

Device Name Contour Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indications for Use (Describe)   
The Contour $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood drawn from the fingertips or palm. The Contour $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared. The Contour $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of a diabetes control program.

The Contour $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing (palm) should be done only during steady state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly). The Contour $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Next test strips are for use with the Contour $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Next ONE blood glucose meter to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood drawn from the fingertips or palm.

The system is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only.

Trade name: CONTOUR® NEXT ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System K160682   
Common name: Blood Glucose Meter and app   
Classification name: 75 NBW; Glucose Test System, OTC,   
75 LFR; Glucose Dehydrogenase   
CONTOUR® NEXT USB Blood Glucose Monitoring   
System (K150942)

3) Predicate device: 4) Device description:

CONTOUR® NEXT ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a blood glucose meter with Bluetooth Low Energy technology built in so that the meter can communicate wirelessly to a mobile smart device. The meter uses the CONTOUR NEXT test strips and CONTOUR NEXT control solution. It utilizes a similar algorithm to the one used in the CONTOUR NEXT USB blood glucose meter, but this algorithm has been enhanced for even better accuracy. The meter has a 7- segment display and icons in the display to aid the user with the features of the meter. It uses two replaceable CR2032 coin cell batteries. The associated CONTOUR Diabetes app is compatible with Apple iOS operating system and the Android operating system. The app communicates with the CONTOUR® NEXT ONE blood glucose meter using Bluetooth Low Energy wireless technology. Blood glucose test results are automatically sent to the mobile device for viewing and editing, and settings on the meter can be modified using the app.

5) Intended Use:

The Contour® Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring

System is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood drawn from the fingertips or palm. The Contour® Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared. The Contour® Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of a diabetes control program.

The Contour® Next ONE Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing (palm) should be done only during steady state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly). The Contour® Next test strips are for use with the Contour® Next ONE blood glucose meter to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood drawn from the fingertips or palm.

The system is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only.

# Summary of Performance testing

Clinical trials and bench testing showed that the Contour Next One Blood Glucose Monitoring System performed as intended and met the system specifications.

Usability testing was conducted to ensure that the Contour Next One Blood Glucose Monitoring System was easy to use by typical customers. Usability testing was also done on the app to ensure that the app could be linked to the meter, that the applicable meter parameters could be set up, that data could be successfully transmitted from the meter to the app, and that the features of the app were easy to use and understand.

# Conclusions from Performance Evaluations

Based on the outcome of the performance testing conducted, the modified Contour Next One Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the predicate Contour Next USB Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K150942).
