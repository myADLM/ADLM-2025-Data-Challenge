Dear Mr. Saysana:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls.

# 3. Predicate Device

Accu-Chek Aviva Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System (k141867), concurrence received on March 3, 2015. The Accu-Chek Aviva Controls (k043474), concurrence received on April 27, 2005.

The Accu-Chek Aviva Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. The Accu-Chek Aviva Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

# 4. Device Description

The Accu-Chek Guide System consists of the following:

Accu-Chek Guide meter   
• Accu-Chek Guide test strips   
• Accu-Chek Guide control solutions (previously cleared in k043474)

The Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System makes use of the Accu-Chek Guide test strips, the Accu-Chek Guide meter, and the Accu-Chek Guide control solutions. This system is a single-patient use blood glucose monitoring system intended to be used to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm, and upper arm as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of glucose control. It should be noted that the Accu-Chek Guide control solutions are identical to the Accu-Chek Aviva control solutions that were cleared previously in k043474. The name has simply been updated to reflect their use with the Accu-Chek Guide system.

The components of the Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System are shown below:

# bG Measurement Technology Description

The enzyme on the test strip, an FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) expressed in A. Oryzae, converts the glucose in the blood to gluconolactone. This reaction creates a harmless DC electrical current that the meter interprets for the blood glucose result. The sample and the environmental conditions are evaluated using AC and DC signals.

# 5. Intended Use

The Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System is comprised of the Accu-Chek Guide meter and the Accu-Chek Guide test strips.

The Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm, and upper arm as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of glucose control.   
The Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for in vitro diagnostic single-patient use by people with diabetes.   
The Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

This system is not for use in diagnosis or screening of diabetes mellitus, nor for neonatal use.

Alternative site testing should be done only during steady-state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

Accu-Chek Guide Control Solutions are for use with the Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System to check that the meters and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly.

# 6. Substantial Equivalence

The Accu-Chek Guide system substantially equivalent to the Accu-Chek Aviva Connect system. Below is a table that provides a comparison between the Accu-Chek Guide system and its predicate device.
