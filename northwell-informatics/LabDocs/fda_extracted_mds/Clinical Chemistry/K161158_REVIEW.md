# L. Test Principle:

A chemiluminescent immunoassay technique is used, in which a polyclonal goat anti-human antibody recognizing the C-terminal region (amino acids 39-84) of human PTH is used as the capture antibody. A polyclonal goat anti-human PTH antibody which recognizes the Nterminal region (amino acids1-84) of PTH, is conjugated with acridinium for detection. This system also detects the large PTH fragment of amino acid 7-84. Patient samples are incubated with both antibodies followed by the addition of streptavidin coated magnetic particles with further incubation. A magnet is then used to capture the labeled antibodyantigen complexes, and following a wash and the addition of reagent, the concentration of PTH is determined. Concentration of PTH is directly proportional the amount of emitted light from the acridinium labels.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated by testing 1 human serum sample and 6 human K2-EDTA plasma samples using two lots of IDS-iSYS Intact $\mathrm { P T H } ^ { \mathrm { { N } } }$ reagent cartridges on two analyzers (one lot per analyzer). Each sample was tested in duplicate, 2 runs per day, for 20 days for a total of 80 results per reagent lot/analyzer. Similar precision results were obtained from both lots. Precision results from one lot are provided below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were performed using serum and K2-EDTA plasma samples in accordance with CLSI EP-6A.

The serum samples were prepared by diluting a high serum sample with a low serum sample to obtain 15 evenly spaced intermediate PTH sample concentrations. The expected PTH concentrations were as follows: 3.54, 7.28, 11.02, 22.24, 78.35, 115.75, 227.96, 377.58, 751.62, 1125.67, 1499.71, 1873.76, 2247.80, 2621.84, 2743.98, 2995.89, and $3 3 6 9 . 9 3 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Each sample was assayed in replicates of four. The following linear regression analysis for serum was obtained:

$$
\mathrm { y = 1 . 0 2 \ x - 0 . 2 \ p g / m L \ , \ R ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 0 }
$$

The K2-EDTA plasma samples were prepared by diluting a high K2-EDTA sample with a low K2-EDTA sample to obtain 15 evenly spaced intermediate PTH sample concentrations. The expected concentrations were as follows: 2.91, 6.31, 9.72, 19.92, 70.96, 104.99, 207.07, 343.18, 683.45, 1023.73, 1364.00, 1704.27, 2044.54, 2384.81, 2725.08, 3065.36, and $3 4 0 5 . 6 3 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Each sample was assayed in replicates of four. The following linear regression analysis for K2-EDTA was obtained:

$$
\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 6 ~ \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L } , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 0
$$

The results from the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range for the IDS iSYS Intact $\mathrm { P T } \dot { \mathrm { H } } ^ { \mathrm { N } }$ assay of 5.0 to $3 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

Cleared in k103325.

Stability:

Cleared in k103325. The calibrators are stable for 6 months unopened when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; for 14 days when open and reconstituted and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; and for 2 hours on board the analyzer.

Calibrator Value Assignment:

Cleared in k103325.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A.

The LoB was determined for three lots of reagent cartridges by testing a zero serum based calibrator in replicates of 10 over 6 assays for a total of 60 measurements per lot. LoB was determined by the parametric method of calculating the concentration corresponding to the $9 5 \%$ probability of detecting a blank sample using the equation $\mathrm { L o B = }$ mean (blank) $+ 1 . 6 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ SD $\left( \mathrm { { b l a n k } } \right)$ .

The LoD was determined for three cartridge reagent lots by assaying 10 serum samples with very low PTH concentrations in duplicate over 6 assays spanning multiple days for a total of 120 measurements per lot. LoD was calculated using a parametric method to determine the lowest concentration that can be detected $9 5 \%$ of the time.

The LoQ was determined for three reagent cartridge lots by testing 10 low PTH level serum samples in duplicate over 6 assays spanning multiple days for a total of 120 measurements per lot. LoQ was determined as the lowest PTH concentration from the regression curve for which $\% \mathrm { C V }$ is less than $20 \%$ .

The results of detection limit studies are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Limit of Blank</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Limit of Detection</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Limit of Quantitation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9 pg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.3 pg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.5 pg/mL</td></tr></table>

The claimed measuring range of the assay is 5.0 to $3 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2. Samples with low and high PTH concentrations were spiked with potential interfering substances. Percent interference was calculated using the following formula:

mean conc. of spiked sample – mean conc. of un-spiked sample x100 mean concentration of un-spiked sample

For total cholesterol and Rheumatoid factor (Rf) the interference was evaluated by recovery of Intact PTH from a high pool was spiked into a sample with known interferent substance levels. Percent recovery was calculated using the formula below:

$\%$ Recovery $=$ (Recovery value / Expected recovery value) x 100

The sponsor defines significant interference as a bias in results of $\geq 1 0 \%$ .

The interference study results are summarized in the table below:

The labeling includes the following limitations:

“Total cholesterol at concentrations greater than $3 9 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ have been shown to cause falsely elevated Intact PTH results when measured by this assy. Samples that contain high levels of total cholesterol should not be measured using this Intact PTH assay.”

“HAMA at concentrations of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ have been shown to interfere with Intact PTH results when measured by this assay of up to $1 4 . 4 \%$ bias.”

# Cross Reactivity:

Cross-reactivity studies were performed according to CLSI EP-7A2. A serum sample and a zero calibrator matrix was spiked with human PTH fragments and structurally similar proteins at the concentrations listed below. The cross reactivity was determined by the following formula:

$\%$ cross reactivity $=$

Mean conc. of spiked sample – mean conc. of un-spiked sample $\mathbf { x l 0 0 \% }$ Spike concentration

# High Dose Hook Effect:

A hook effect study was performed to determine if the IDS-iSYS Intact $\mathrm { P T H } ^ { \mathrm { N } }$ assay is susceptible to produce falsely low results in the presence of very high levels of PTH. One K2-EDTA sample and two serum samples were spiked with the following concentrations of 1-84 PTH: 5,000, 25,000, 50,000, 75,000, and $1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Each specimen was measured in replicates of 4 using 3 reagent lots. The study demonstrated that no high dose hook effect was observed for intact PTH concentrations up to $1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The IDS iSYS Intact $\mathrm { P T H } ^ { \mathrm { N } }$ assay was compared against the previously cleared IDS iSYS Intact PTH (k103325) assay in accordance with CLSI EP-9A2.

A total of 312 serum samples (291 native, 21 spiked) were assayed with the candidate and predicate devices at two external sites. The PTH concentrations as measured by the candidate device ranged from 6.3 to $3 3 7 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Three reagent cartridge lots of the candidate device were used in the study. Deming regression analysis of the results yielded the following regression equation:

$$
\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 2 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 7 , \mathrm { r } { = } 1 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { ( n } { = } 3 1 2 \mathrm { ) }
$$

b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was performed on 52 matched (45 native, 7 spiked) sample sets of serum, serum separator tube (SST) serum, K2-EDTA plasma, and Lithium-heparin plasma. The sample range tested was between 10.6 and 2759.0 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ . Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed on the comparative data. The following regression analyses were obtained:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>K2-EDTA plasmaVS.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.94</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SST serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.93</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.38</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lithium Heparin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.98</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.42</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00</td></tr></table>
