# L. Test Principle:

The BGM014/Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are electrochemical biosensors using a glucose-dehydrogenase, (Aspergillus sp.), along with a redox mediator on a disposable test strip (the electrochemical embedded sensor), and a handheld device to measure current generated by test strip. The software in the hand held device converts the measured current into glucose concentration, where generated current is directly proportional to glucose concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

BGM014 and BGM014 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems only differ in name and intended use (single-patient use vs. multiple-patient use); therefore, performance data provided in this section is applicable for both systems.

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous blood from one donor adjusted to 5 glucose levels $( 3 0 { - } 5 0 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , $5 1 { \mathrm { - } } 1 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 111- $\mathrm { . 1 5 0 \ m g / d L }$ , $1 5 1 - 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 5 1 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) tested on ten BSM014 meters with three lots of strips. Within-run test was performed every day for 20 days. Each sample was tested in 10 replicates per meter and per strip lot, giving a total of 200 measurements per lot for a total of 600 measurements for each glucose level. Results are summarized below:

Within-run precision:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose Level( mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Number ofreadings</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV(%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30-50</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>600</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51-110</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>600</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>70</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>111-150</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>600</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>122</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>151-250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>600</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>221</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>251-400</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>600</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>331</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.0</td></tr></table>

Intermediate precision was evaluated using three levels of glucose control solutions, Level 1, 2 and 3. Each glucose level was analyzed once per day on 10 meters using 3 lots of test strips over 20 days. Results for intermediate, between-day precision are summarized below.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples. The evaluation was conducted using eight different glucose concentrations according to the reference ( $1 9 . 8 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $2 0 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $3 0 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $5 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $6 1 3 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , YSI. Each sample was measured in replicates of 40 with 3 test strip lots and ten BGM014 meters and the values compared to a laboratory reference method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Results from the regression analysis:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y-Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{2}$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9927</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0132</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9993</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0062</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.2672</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9996</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0051</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.8185</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9996</td></tr></table>

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample is less than $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If a sample result exceeds $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as HI.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The BGM014/Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are traceable to NIST SRM 917c glucose.

# Test strips stability:

Test strip stability was assessed for test strip vials and individually wrapped test strips in real-time studies. Testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacture claims a shelf life stability of 24 months and open vial stability (for the vials of test strips) of 6 months at the recommended storage conditions of $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 3 9 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ ) and $10 \mathrm { - } 8 5 \%$ relative humidity.

Control Solution Stability and Value Assignment:

The stability and value assignment of the Contrex Plus 5 Control solutions were assess in real-time studies. Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the glucose control solutions were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life stability of 24 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended storage temperatures of $3 9 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).

# Value Assignment:

Value assignment on glucose control solutions is performed using 3 lots of Contrex Plus 5 control solutions (for all 3 levels) using two BGM014 Blood Glucose Monitoring systems daily for 10 days, with two tests/meter for each control solution, for a total of 360 test results. Results were verified against values from the YSI-2300 reference method and using pre-determined acceptance criteria for glucose recovery within a specified range for each control lot/level. The acceptable control range is established using the mean value of each control solution level. Glucose control ranges are lot dependent and are listed on the test strip vial label for each lot and level.

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range for the BGM014/Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is 20- $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed by adding endogenous and exogenous substances, each at two or more levels (normal/therapeutic and high) to venous whole blood samples containing two different glucose levels (70-90 and $3 0 0 { - } 3 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). Each sample was measured in replicates of ten on the BGM014 glucose meter and the $\%$ difference between the results obtained with the test samples was compared to those obtained using the corresponding control sample (containing no added interferent). The table below shows the highest levels tested at which no significant interference compared to YSI 2300 analyzer (defined by the sponsor $\mathrm { a s } \leq + / - 1 0 \% )$ was observed:

User Performance Studies:

To assess the performance of the BGM014 System in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a study with 137 lay user participants, who collected their own fingerstick, palm and forearm samples. Samples ranged from $6 2 { - } 4 1 7 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by YSI. Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from the BGM014 meter obtained by the lay user against the YSI 2300 reference value obtained by healthcare professionals. The results are summarized in the tables below:

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

# 1. Sample volume study:

The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum sample volume requirement $( 0 . 8 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ and the test strip fill error $( ^ { \infty } \mathrm { E r } ^ { \infty } 3 )$ function established for the BGM014 Blood Glucose Meter. Blood samples were tested at 6 sample volumes: 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and $1 \mu \mathrm { l }$ and values obtained were compared to the reference, YSI values. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the error code for insufficient sample volume.

# 2. Altitude Study:

To assess the effect of altitude, venous whole blood samples were adjusted to 5 glucose concentrations: 50, 120, 220, 330 and $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and tested at sea level and 10,335 feet above sea level using 10 meters and 3 test strip lots. Results were compared to YSI reference values. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,335 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the BGM014 system.

# 3. Hematocrit Study:

The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the BGM014 glucose meter was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 10, 20, 30, 35, 43, 50, 55, 60 and $70 \%$ , at glucose concentrations of 40, 60, 130, 300 and 500 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ using 10 meters and 3 test strip lots. For each blood sample, individual glucose readings taken on the BGM014 glucose meter were compared to YSI reference values to calculate the bias. The results demonstrate acceptable bias for hematocrit levels between

# 4. Readability Assessment

The readability of the labeling (user manual, quick reference guide and test strip insert) using Flesch-Kincaid’s analysis were found to be written not higher than ${ 8 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade level.

# 5. Test System Operating Conditions:

The effect of temperature $( 4 1 - 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 5 - 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity (RH) $( 2 0 - 9 0 \% )$ on the BGM014 glucose meter was evaluated using venous blood samples at 60, 120, 200 and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose. Twenty replicates were tested at each of the multiple temperature and humidity combinations that included the extreme combinations (low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity). Meter results were compared to YSI values. The study results support the operating conditions claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of $4 1 - 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 5 - 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of $2 0 -$ $90 \%$ RH.

# 6. EMC Testing:

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and the System was found to be compliant.

# 7. Infection Control Studies:

The device systems BGM014 and BGM014 Pro are intended for single-patient use only and multi-patient use, respectively. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed by the sponsor using each of the following disinfectants: Clorox Healthcare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Bleach Germicidal and Disinfectant Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 67619-12), Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towel with Bleach (EPA Reg# 56392-8), Medline MicroKill™ Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 69687-1-37549), Medline Micro-Kil $+ \mathbf { T M }$ Disinfecting, Deodorizing, Cleaning Wipes with Alcohol (EPA Registration Number: 59894-10). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 730 and 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles for single and multi-patient use, respectively. The robustness studies support 3 years of single and multi-patient use. The sponsor has included a warning in the label “These disinfectants were validated separately. Only one disinfectant should be used on the device for the life of the device, as the effect of using more than one disinfectant interchangeably has not been evaluated.” Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

8. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance documents were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to the finalization of the guidance documents.
