# ATELLICA CH CREATININE_2 (CREA_2)

The Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) assay is based on the reaction of picric acid with creatinine in an alkaline medium as described in the original procedure of Jaffe. Creatinine reacts with picric acid in an alkaline medium to produce a red-colored creatinine-picrate complex. The rate of complex formation is measured at 505/571 nm and is proportional to the creatinine concentration. The Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) assay is a modification of the Jaffe method using rate blanking and intercept correction. Rate blanking is used to minimize bilirubin interference. Also, because nonspecific serum/plasma protein interactions with this reagent have been found to produce a positive bias of approximately 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L), serum/plasma measurements are automatically corrected by subtracting $0 . 3 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (26.5 μmol/L) from each result.

Serum, lithium heparin plasma and urine specimens may be used. The reagent is stored unopened at $2 - 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and is stable for use on system for 17 days. Calibration is performed every 60 days for a reagent lot or every 6 days for an individual pack.

# ATELLICA CH CHEMISTRY CALIBRATOR (CHEM CAL)

The Atellica CH Chemistry Calibrator (CHEM CAL) is a 1 level lyophilized calibrator product prepared from bovine serum base product. The product is stored at $2 - 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The Atellica CH Chemistry Calibrator is stable for 48 hours at $2 - 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after being opened, rehydrated and securely recapped.

# SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE TESTING

Assay performance comparison results for the Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) with the Atellica CH Chemistry Calibrator (CHEM CAL) were obtained by processing the appropriate body fluids. Summary statistics for each are provided. These data demonstrate substantial equivalency of the Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) and the Atellica CH Chemistry Calibrator (CHEM CAL) versus the predicate devices. The following data represent typical assay performance.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation: Approved Guideline.

Assessment of LoB was the 95th percentile of all values (sorted from lowest to highest), using non-parametric approach.

LoB Rank Position $= 0 . 5 + 0 . 9 5 ^ { \star } \mathsf { B }$ , where $\mathsf { B } = \mathsf { \cdot }$ total reps $\mathtt { - 6 0 }$ ; Rank = 57.5

The nonparametric approach described in EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Detection.

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for serum was determined as described in CLSI Document EP17-A2. Total Error is calculated using: $\Gamma \mathsf { E } = \mathsf { b i a s } + 2 ^ { \star } \mathsf { S D }$ .

Five replicates of ten low samples were processed on three reagent lots for three days on five calibrations per day, on one instrument for a total of 75 measurements per reagent lot per sample. For serum, the measured LoQ was $0 . 1 3 \mathrm { ~ m g / d L }$ in support of the LoQ claim of $0 . 1 5 { \mathrm { ~ m g } } / { \mathrm { d L } }$ for serum and plasma samples. For urine, the measured LoQ was $2 . 5 7 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in support of the LoQ claim of $3 . 0 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine samples. The LoQ claims for serum and urine are each based a total of 2250 determinations with a total error goal of $\leq \pm 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum specimens and $\leq \pm 1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine specimens.

# LINEARITY STUDY

Linearity was evaluated with 12 samples which spanned the assay measuring interval for serum and plasma specimens and 10 samples which spanned the assay measuring interval for urine specimens. Each was prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples across the measurement interval as described in CLSI Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedure (EP06-A). The high sample was prepared by spiking native serum or urine pools with purified creatinine. Low pools were created by diluting serum and urine samples with a $6 \%$ BSA or $0 . 9 \%$ saline solution respectively. Five replicates were measured for each sample. The mean of these replicates was used for the calculations.

The assay was considered linear across the measuring interval if the p values of nonlinear terms in the quadratic and cubic fit equations are nonsignificant $( \mathsf { p } \leq 0 . 0 5 )$ . If the p-value is $> 0 . 0 5$ , then the allowable bias is $\leq 5 \%$ or $0 . 1 5 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ , whichever is greater.

# Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods: Approved Guideline –

Third Edition. Precision was tested ${ \mathsf n } = 2$ replicates, two times a day for at least 20 days for a total of 80 replicates with controls, serum and plasma pools on one instrument. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP05-A3. The data are summarized in the following table.

CLSI EP7-A2 was followed for the interference testing. The interference study was conducted using a “paired difference worst case scenario” approach where these compounds were spiked into fresh sample pools containing either low or high levels of measurand in serum and urine pools.

Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference. Dilution studies were conducted to determine the level at which the spiked substance no longer displayed significant interference. Dilution studies were conducted at two analyte concentrations, if both sample pools show significant interference. This study was conducted as needed for both serum pools.

The predicate device selected for the method comparison study was the ADVIA Chemistry Enzymatic Creatinine_2 (ECRE_2) (k070727). Remnant de-identified samples were tested. No patient history information was obtained on these samples. Inclusion/exclusion data criteria are not applicable. The study included native and spiked samples to properly span the assay intervals.

These studies were conducted internally by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic Inc. R&D organization personnel. The personnel conducting the study were laboratory technicians with training similar to personnel who would conduct the tests in a hospital laboratory setting. They were trained on the operation of both the device and the predicate device. A split sample method comparison, following EP09-A3, demonstrated good agreement between the Atellica CH Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) and the predicate ADVIA Chemistry Enzymatic Creatinine_2 (ECRE_2) assay with patient samples.

The table below also summarizes the data for comparison between Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS) and the Atellica Creatinine_2 (Crea_2) assay. These data demonstrate good agreement with IDMS.

The results across the full assay intervals were analyzed using weighted Deming regression. One replicate of each sample was tested and used in the analysis.

Serum and lithium heparin plasma equivalency was demonstrated by testing fifty eight matched samples. Some samples were spiked with creatinine to obtain samples spanning the assay measuring intervals. The table below summarizes the weighted Deming linear regression statistics. One replicate of each sample was tested and used in the analysis.

Reference intervals for healthy adults were verified on the Atellica CH Analyzer in accordance with CLSI Document EP28-A3c. As with all in vitro diagnostic assays, each laboratory should determine its own reference interval for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results. Consider these values as guidance only.
