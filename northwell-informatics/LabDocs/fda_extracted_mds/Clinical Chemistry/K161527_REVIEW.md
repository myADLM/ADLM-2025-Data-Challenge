# L. Test Principle:

Teco Diagnostic’s creatinine enzymatic method employs a two reagent system which eliminates interferences by endogenous creatine and ascorbic acid. Step wise enzymatic reactions are shown below:

C Creatinine $+ \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ , in the presence of Creatinine amidohydrolase, produce Creatine   
· Creatine $+ \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ , in the presence of Creatine amidinohydrolase, produce Sarcosine $^ +$ Urea   
· Sarcosine $+ \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } + \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } .$ , in the presence of Sarcosine oxidase, produce Glycine $^ +$ HCHO $+ \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ $2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } + 4$ -aminoantipyrine $^ +$ ESPMT\*, in the presence of Peroxidase, produce Quinoneimine $\mathrm { D y e } + 4 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$

\*ESPMT: 3-(N-Ethyl-3-methylanilino) propanesulfonic acid sodium salt

Hydrogen peroxide generated from creatinine reacts with 4- aminoantipyrine and ESPMT in the presence of peroxidase to yield a quinoneimine dye. The change in absorbance at $5 4 6 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the creatinine concentration in sample. The rate of formation of color is proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The following data were collected on the TC-MATRIX instrument.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study was performed following a modification to the recommendations in the CLSI EP5-A3 guideline. The precision study was conducted over 20 nonconsecutive days with two reagent lots using three serum samples at approximately $0 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $3 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ creatinine. The serum samples were prepared by mixing natural patients’ serum sample pools. The testing included two runs per testing day, with at least two hours separation between runs, three replicates per sample per run using one instrument. A total of 240 replicates per sample were generated. The calibrator used was the Teco Chemistry Calibrator. The representative results from one lot are shown below. The within-laboratory imprecision estimate includes imprecision from within-run, between run and between reagent lots.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP6-A guideline. A set of eleven equally spaced creatinine level samples were prepared by mixing a low serum sample with a high serum sample. The expected creatinine concentration levels used in the study are 0.37, 0.94, 1.50, 2.06, 2.71, 3.31, 3.83, 4.38, 4.90, 5.49, and $6 . 1 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was tested in duplicate. The results showed that the deviation from linearity did not exceed $5 \%$ . The results of the regression analysis are summarized below:

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 9 2 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 0 0 7 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 3
$$

The study result supports the linearity of the Teco Creatinine Enzymatic Reagent Kit assay from $0 . 3 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $5 . 0 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of creatinine.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Reagent stability – Both reagents are stable until expiration dates found on their labels when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once opened the creatinine reagents are stable for 60 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Traceability and stability of control and calibration materials:

Calibration Material – The sponsor recommends in the labeling using the Teco Chemistry Calibrator. This calibrator is traceable to NIST reference material SRM 967.

Quality Control Materials – The sponsor recommends in the labeling using quality control samples (two levels – low and high) at least once a day and after each calibration and every time a new bottle of reagent is used. The values on control materials are traceable to the reference material, NIST SRM 967.

# d. Detection limit:

A limit of blank study was performed following the recommendations in the CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. The study was conducted using four blank samples and two lots of reagents. These samples were measured in replicates of five over three days (15 replicates per sample) with a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot. The data were assessed using the nonparametric analysis option described in the guideline. The claim was based on the lot with the higher estimate.

A limit of detection study was performed using four diluted serum samples prepared by diluting serum pool 100x, 50x, $3 3 \mathrm { x }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { x }$ with saline. The samples were tested using two reagent lots. Each sample was tested 15 times over three days for a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot. The data were assessed using the parametric analysis option described in the guideline. The claim was based on the lot with the higher estimate.

A limit of quantitation study was performed using four low concentration serum samples prepared using serum pools and two reagent lots. Each sample was assayed 15 times over three days per reagent lot. The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and SD were calculated, and LoQ was defined as the concentration with a $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of less than $20 \%$ . The claim was based on the lot with the higher estimate.

The LoB, LoD and LoQ are claimed as $0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $0 . 0 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $0 . 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , respectively.

The claimed measuring range is $0 . 3 7 - 5 . 0 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum creatinine with the candidate device.

# e. Analytical specificity:

An interference study was performed by evaluating potential interfering substances spiked into serum containing creatinine at either $1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $5 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The recommendations in the CLSI EP7A2 guideline were followed for the interference testing. Each interferent was tested at two levels except for acetaminophen which was tested at only one concentration of $1 . 9 6 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each test and control sample was tested in triplicate. The sponsor defines interference as bias exceeding $10 \%$ . The following substances had no significant interference (less than $10 \%$ interference) when tested on the Teco Creatinine Enzymatic Reagent Kit at the concentrations listed below.
