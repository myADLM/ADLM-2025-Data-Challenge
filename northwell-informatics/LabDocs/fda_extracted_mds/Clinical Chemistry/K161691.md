# 8. TEST PRINCIPLE (1, 2)

The assay consists of 2 distinct reaction steps:

1. Elimination of chylomicron, VLDL-Cholesterol and HDL-Cholesterol by cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase and subsequently catalase.

![](images/4e6b5fe716e99dc65c0bc017c4dca6143f5201bf0ef27befd6066396f2455322.jpg)

2. Specific measurement of LDL-Cholesterol after release of LDL-Cholesterol by detergents in Reagent 2.

![](images/3510015d03158703217b8da15db640f4cd5cc6ca20bbf48fb756ea4febbb533e.jpg)

The intensity of the quinoneimine dye produced is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration when measured at $6 0 0 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ .

In the second reaction catalase is inhibited by sodium azide in Enzyme Reagent 2.

# 9. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated consistent with C.L.S.I documents EP5-A2. Precision studies were performed by two operators on two RX Daytona plus systems using control material and unaltered human serum samples that were spiked with LDL cholesterol concentrations or diluted to achieve concentrations based on established ranges <100mg/dl optimal LDL cholesterol, $1 3 0 - 1 5 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ borderline high LDL Cholesterol, $1 6 0 - 1 8 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ high LDL Cholesterol, $> 1 9 0 \ m g / \mathrm { d L }$ very high LDL Cholesterol. Testing was conducted for two reagent lots of Cholesterol levels, one lot on each RX Daytona plus system, twice per day for 20 non-consecutive days. Two replicates per run were performed for each sample. The assay was calibrated on the first day of the study and no assay recalibrations were required throughout the duration of the study. The results of Lot 2, which is representative of both lots of reagent, is summarized in the following table.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. standard EP6-A. Linearity studies were performed at 11 levels to determine the analytical range of an assay - that is the range where the reported result is a linear function to the analyte concentration (or where deviation from linearity is less than $10 \%$ ).

The linearity samples were prepared at 11 levels. The sponsor set a range from approximately 21 mg/dl analyte concentration up to a high concentration of approximately 850 mg/dl using low and high serum pools. The low and high pools were mixed to make nine intermediate levels. Each level was run in replicates of five on two lots of LDL Cholesterol reagent on one RX Daytona plus system. The observed values were compared to the expected values; the linear regression correlation between the expected values and the observed values are summarized in the following table:

Table 3 Linearity Summary including Regression equation and correlation co-efficient.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>AnalyteTested</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LDL Cholesterol(mg/dl)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LinearRegression</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y = 0.99x +6.34</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td></tr></table>

The reportable range of the assay is $2 1 { \mathrm { - } } 7 4 0 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d ! } } .$ .

Samples with concentrations greater than the linearity limit established are returned $> 7 4 0 \ m g / \mathrm { d L }$ and are re-run automatically by the RX daytona plus using the established high re-run conditions.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Refer to K122126 Direct HDL/LDL Calibrator and K022591 Lipid Controls.

The Direct HDL-C/LDL-C Calibrator is traceable to an internal master reference material. Calibrators are value assigned using one instrument and multiple repetitions. The mean, standard deviation, and $\%$ CV are calculated and evaluated against acceptance criteria.

The reagent system has not been tested or certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN). The labeling contains language that the device has not been certified by the CRMLN.

# d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP17-A2 ‘Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantification; Approved Guideline’. A Limit of Blank (L.o.B), a Limit of Detection (L.o.D) and a Limit of Quantification (L.o.Q) were performed on two lots of reagents tested by two operators on one RX Daytona Plus system.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for LDL Cholesterol on the RX Daytona Plus is 3.19 mg/dl based on 240 determinations, with 4 low level samples.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) is 1.94 mg/dl.

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is 16.1 mg/dl as determined by the lowest concentration detected with $\leq 2 0 \%$ imprecision.

# e. Analytical Specificity:

Interference studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP7-A2 ‘Interference testing in clinical chemistry; Approved Guideline Second Edition’. The effects of potential interferents were determined by calculating the mean value of the spiked interferent with the corresponding control solution. The spiked sample results were compared to control samples prepared without the potential interferents.

Acceptance Criteria: $\%$ of Control ± 10%

The following analytes were tested up to the levels indicated at LDL Cholesterol concentrations of $9 6 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d } |$ and $1 9 3 . 5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d } |$ and found not to interfere:

Hemoglobin No significant interference up to 1000mg/dl.   
Total Bilirubin No significant interference up to 60mg/dl.   
Conjugate Bilirubin No significant interference up to 60mg/dl.   
Triglycerides No significant interference up to 500mg/dl.   
Intralipid $\textcircled{8}$ No significant interference up to 500mg/dl.   
Ascorbic Acid No significant interference up to 6mg/dl.

# f. Method comparison with predicate device:

Correlation studies were carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP9-A2 ‘Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples: Approved Guideline – Second Edition’.

The candidate device on the RX Daytona Plus analyzer, was tested against the predicate device on the RX Imola analyzer.

139 serum patient samples spanning the range 22.45 to 735.68 mg/dl were tested by two operators on two lots of LDL cholesterol reagent, across 3 working days with each sample tested in singlicate.

The candidate device was compared to the predicate device and the following linear regression equation was obtained:

$\mathsf { Y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathsf { x } - 1 . 4 5$ Correlation coefficient of $\Gamma = 0 . 9 9 8$

# g. Matrix comparison:

Matrix method comparisons for the LDL cholesterol assay was tested by one operator on one RX Daytona plus system and was assessed for two lots of LDL cholesterol reagents. Both serum and lithium heparin plasma were tested to determine whether method accuracy with plasma specimens are equivalent to serum results and that lithium heparin plasma does not interfere with either the method or the system.

# LDL Cholesterol matrix comparison on the RX Daytona plus (Lithium Heparin)

Patient samples were drawn in matched pairs – one sample serum $( \mathsf { x } )$ and the second sample lithium heparin plasma (y). 70 matched patient sample pairs were analyzed spanning the range 25.45 to $6 6 5 . 6 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d } |$ and the following linear regression equation was obtained:

$\mathsf { Y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathsf { x } - 2 . 8 1$ Correlation coefficient of $\Gamma = 0 . 9 9 8$
