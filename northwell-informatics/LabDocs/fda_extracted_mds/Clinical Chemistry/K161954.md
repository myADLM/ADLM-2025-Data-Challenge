Dear Justin DiValentino:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

Device Name   
Atellica™ Solution, Atellica™ A-LYTE Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl), Atellica™ CH Albumin BCP Reagent (Alb_P)Atellica™   
IM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) assay, Atellica™ CH Vancomycin (Vanc) assay Indications for Use (Describe)   
The Siemens Atellica™ Solution is a multi-component system for in vitro diagnostic testing of clinical specimens. The system is intended for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of various body fluids, using photometric, turbidimetric, chemiluminescent, and integrated ion selective electrode technology for clinical use.

The Atellica™ A-LYTE Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl) is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of sodium, potassium, and chloride (Na, K, Cl) in human serum, plasma, and urine using the Atellica™ CH system. Measurements of sodium obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus (chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst), adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease (caused by destruction of the adrenal glands), dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance. Measurements of potassium obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels. Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.

The Atellica™ CH Albumin BCP Reagent (Alb_P) is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative measurement of albumin in human serum or plasma on Atellica™ CH system. Albumin measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases primarily involving the liver or kidneys.

The Atellica™ IM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) in human serum, and plasma (EDTA and lithium heparin) using the Atellica™ IM system. Measurements of the thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary are used in the diagnosis of thyroid or pituitary disorders.

The Atellica™ CH Vancomycin (Vanc) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative measurement of vancomycin in human serum or plasma on the Atellica™ CH System. Vanc test results may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of vancomycin overdose and in monitoring levels of vancomycin to ensure appropriate therapy.

The Siemens Atellica™ Solution is a multi-component system for in vitro diagnostic testing of clinical specimens. The system is intended for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of various body fluids, using photometric, turbidimetric, chemiluminescent, and integrated ion selective electrode technology for clinical use.

The Atellica™ A-LYTE Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl) is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of sodium, potassium, and chloride (Na, K, Cl) in human serum, plasma, and urine using the Atellica™ CH system. Measurements of sodium obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus (chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst), adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease (caused by destruction of the adrenal glands), dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance. Measurements of potassium obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the

diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels. Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.

Albumin measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases primarily involving the liver or kidneys.

Vanc test results may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of vancomycin overdose and in monitoring levels of vancomycin to ensure appropriate therapy.

# 1.1.9 Substantial Equivalence Information:

The Atellica Solution (New Device) and the Trinidad IM analyzer (Predicate Device cleared under k151792 for chemiluminescence technology) as well as the Trinidad CH analyzer (Predicate Device cleared under k151767 for ion selective electrode and photometric technology, and k160202 for turbidimetric technology) employ the same prepackaged reagents for use on automated test systems. The Intended Use / Indications for Use, Assay Principle and reagent formulations are the same. The major differences between the New and Predicate Devices are the sample loading and transport system as well as the ability to configure multiple analyzers. The New Device sample loading and transport system delivers the sample to the analytical module and does not pipet the sample to the analytical module nor perform any analytical pipetting. A comparison of the important similarities and differences of these systems are shown in the following tables:

# 1.1.11 Performance Characteristics

The below studies are submitted on the Atellica Solution to support the use of the Atellica SH with the Atellica CH and IM Systems cleared as the Trinidad CH and IM systems under k151767, k160202 and k151792 respectively. Full assay performance can be found in the assay associated 510(k)s.

Performance equivalence of the Atellica Solution was demonstrated by testing precision and running a method comparison of IM/CH assays on IM and CH modules fitted with a Direct Load component .

# 1.1.11.1 Precision

Precision was tested ${ \mathsf n } = 5$ replicates, one time a day for 5 days with controls and serum pools for the Na, K, Cl, Alb_P, Vanc and TSH assays on one instrument. This is consistent with the governing standard CLSI EP15-A3: User Verification of Precision and Estimation of Bias with 1 reagent lot.

# 1.1.12 Conclusions

Comparative testing of Atellica™ Solution (Atellica SH with the Atellica™IM and Atellica™CH analyzers) is substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the Predicate Devices, Trinidad IM immunoassay analyzer (cleared under k151792) and the Trinidad CH clinical chemistry analyzer (cleared under k151767 and k160202).
