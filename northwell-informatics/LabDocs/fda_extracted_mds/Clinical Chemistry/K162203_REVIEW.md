3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For in vitro diagnostic use   
The POGO Automatic System is not intended for multi-patient use. Do not use on more than one patient in a clinical setting such as hospitals, long-term care, assisted living facilities, clinics or health fairs as this might pass infection from one patient to another.   
The POGO Automatic System is not intended for the quantitative measurement of venous or arterial blood.   
The POGO Automatic System is not intended for use on neonates.   
The POGO Automatic System should not be used for the diagnosis of or   
screening of diabetes.   
The POGO Automatic Meter should only be used with POGO Automatic Test Cartridges and POGO Control Solutions.   
Individual test cells and cartridges are single use only. Do not attempt to reuse. Use only fresh whole capillary blood. Do not attempt to use plasma or serum to obtain an accurate blood glucose test result.   
Not to be used for patients who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock, critically ill or in a hyperosmolar state.   
The hematocrit range for the POGO Automatic System is $2 0 \% - 6 0 \%$ . Extremely high hematocrit levels above $60 \%$ may cause falsely low results and very low hematocrit levels below $20 \%$ may cause falsely high results.   
The POGO Automatic System has not been evaluated at altitudes above 10,000 feet. WARNING: Each lancet is coated with a tiny amount of heparin $( < 0 . 2 4 ~ \mathrm { I U } )$ which keeps the collected blood from clotting inside the test cell until your results appear. Before using this device, let your doctor know if you are allergic to heparin or have ever been diagnosed with Heparin- Induced Thrombocytopenia, also known as HIT. HIT is a very rare condition which causes blood clots. Stop using the device and contact your doctor if you notice unexplained swelling in one arm or leg, sudden severe chest pain or shortness of breath, or stroke   
symptoms.

4. Special instrument requirements: POGO Automatic Meter

# I. Device Description:

The POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the POGO Automatic Meter, disposable POGO Automatic Test Cartridges (10 tests per cartridge; glucose oxidase from Aspergillus), and 2 levels of ready-to-use control solution wands (POGO Control Solution, Level 1 and Level 2, previously cleared in k152493).

The POGO BGMS automatically lances, collects the blood sample and transports the sample via capillary action to an internal test strip inside the disposable cartridge to measure blood glucose. The meter also includes a vacuum pump to assist in sample collection.

The device has been modified by adding a reapplication feature, the ‘add more blood’ feature to the previously cleared device (k152493). This reapplication feature detects when the sample volume is underfilled and when no blood reaches the test pad, and allows the user 15 or 90 seconds (respectively) to add blood to the test strip.

The 10-test Test Cartridge includes 10 individually foil-sealed hollow lancets, springs, and test strips. The lancing mechanism is built into individual test cells of the cartridge. The used tests (test strips and lancets) are retained within the cartridge.

# L. Test Principle:

The POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System (POGO BGMS) is a quantitative assay for the detection of glucose in capillary whole blood sampled from the fingertip. The system includes glucose-oxidase-based dry-reagent test strips housed in a cartridge and a photometer to read the glucose-dependent color change from the in-use strip. The meter uses calibration information from a barcode on the disposable cartridge to convert the reflectance information into a plasma-equivalent glucose value.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes or No __ X_

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes __ X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test cartridge as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test pad through the lancet in the test cartridge by capillary action.

5. Calibration:

The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user.

6. Quality Control:

Two pre-filled, single-use control solution wands are provided with the POGO System (POGO Control Solutions Level 1 and Level 2, previously cleared in k152493). The wands have a foil-sealed reservoir at the end that is inserted into the meter test port. The meter automatically detects whether the sample is blood or control solution and distinguishes from Level 1 and Level 2. The meter uses the cartridge barcode information to evaluate the calculated control result to display a P (pass) or F (fail). Different cartridge lots have different levels encoded on the barcode.

Up to 500 user-accessible test results can be stored. Results are stored automatically and identified by the meter as either a user glucose reading or a control solution result that the meter determines by detecting the signature of a dye added to the control solution. The meter also allows previous test results to be recalled and displayed individually or averaged (for example, 7, 14 or 30 day averages of glucose test results).

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study: Established in k152493

2. Altitude Study: Established in k152493

3. Sample volume study: Established in k152493

4. Operating conditions study: Established in k152493

5. Readability Assessment: Established in k152493

6. EMC Testing: Established in k152493

7. Software documentation:

The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm provided documentation to support the device modification did not affect the performance of the device. There are two error messages associated with the reapplication feature of the device: “E- $4 ^ { \circ }$ and “NO”, with a blood droplet icon. “E-4” indicates that blood is detected on the test pad, but not enough blood has been applied. “NO”, with a blood droplet icon, indicates that no blood is detected on the test pad. The sponsor provided adequate verification and validation that the re-app mode and associated error messages functioned as intended.

# 8. Infection Control Studies:

Established in k152493. No physical modifications are being made to the device, therefore no cleaning, disinfection or robustness need to be redone.

The device system is intended for single-patient use. Cleaning and disinfection efficacy studies were performed in k152493 demonstrating that the meter interior and exterior can be cleaned and disinfected using Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No. 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor using the POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System and demonstrating that there was no change in performance of the system or internal and external materials of the meter after 730 cleaning and disinfection cycles, using the chosen disinfectant, to simulate cleaning and disinfecting the meter (exterior and interior) every 1.5 day over the 3 years use life to support cleaning and disinfection after

each test cartridge use (10 tests per cartridge). Robustness testing was also performed to support 1100 cleaning and disinfection cycles for the removable test platform to support cleaning and disinfecting every day. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

9. This device was cleared after the FDA issued final guidance documents for prescription use blood glucose monitoring systems (BGMS) and over-the-counter use blood glucose monitoring systems (SMBG). However, the recommendations in the guidance documents were not followed for this device since the submission was received prior to the finalization of the guidance documents.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
