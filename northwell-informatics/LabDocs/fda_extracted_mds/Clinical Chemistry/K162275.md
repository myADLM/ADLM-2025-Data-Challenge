# 8. TEST PRINCIPLE (1)

The substrate $\mathsf { p }$ -nitrophenyl phosphate is hydrolyzed by Alkaline Phosphatase from the sample, in the presence of Magnesium ions, to form $\mathsf { p }$ -nitrophenol which is yellow in colour and can be read at $\yen 05\mathsf { n m }$ .

The intensity of colour produced is proportional to the Alkaline Phosphatase activity in the sample.

# 9. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated consistent with C.L.S.I documents EP5-A2 Precision studies were performed by two operators on two RX daytona plus systems using control material altered human serum samples and unaltered human serum samples that were spiked with ALP concentrations or diluted to achieve concentrations based on established ranges of 30 to ${ 1 2 0 \ \mathsf { U } } / \mathsf { L }$ for adults. Testing was conducted for two reagent lots of ALP, one lot on each RX daytona plus system, twice per day for 20 non-consecutive days. Two replicates per run were performed for each sample. Both lots yielded similar results. The results of one representative lot are summarized in the following table:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. standard EP6-A. Linearity studies were performed at 11 levels to determine the analytical range of an assay - that is the range where the reported result is a linear function to the analyte concentration.

# Acceptance Criteria:

$\mathsf { L o Q } / \mathsf { L 1 p o o l } \leq 2 0 \%$ deviation to target   
L2 to $L 1 1 \leq 5 \%$ deviation to target   
Slope 0.90 – 1.10   
Intercept < established LoQ   
$\mathsf { r } \geq 0 . 9 5$

The linearity samples were prepared at 11 levels. The range was from 7.50 Ul/l analyte concentration up to a high concentration of approximately $9 2 2 \ \mathrm { U } / |$ . The low and high level pools were mixed to create 9 intermediate levels. Each level was run in replicates of five on two lots of ALP reagent on one RX Daytona Plus system. The results are summarized in the following table:

Table 3 - Linearity Summary Serum   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ALP (U/I)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LinearRegression</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y = 1.00x + 6.49</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.000</td></tr></table>

The claimed range of the assay is $8 - 9 1 8 \ : \mathrm { U } / 1$ .

# c. Calibration

The use of Saline and Randox Calibration Serum Level 3 is recommended for calibration of the Randox RX Daytona Plus Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) assay.

# d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity studies have been carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP17-A2 ‘Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantification; Approved Guideline’. A Limit of Blank (LoB), a Limit of Detection (LoD) and a Limit of Quantification (LoQ) were performed on two lots of reagents tested by two operators on one RX Daytona Plus system.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for ALP on the RX Daytona Plus is $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ based on 240 determinations, with 4 low level samples.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) is $0 . 1 4 \ : \mathrm { U / L }$ .

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is $7 . 5 \ : \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ as determined as the lowest concentration which meets an imprecision of $< 1 0 \%$ bias.

# e. Analytical Specificity:

The following analytes were tested up to the levels indicated at ALP concentrations of $8 0 ~ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { I }$ and ${ 2 4 0 \ \mathsf { U } } / \mathsf { I }$ and found not to interfere with the ALP assay.

# Acceptance Criteria:

The control pool must be within $10 \%$ of the decision level target and the control and test pools must recover within $10 \%$ of each other, for the analyte to be deemed not to interfere.

f. Method comparison with predicate device:

Correlation studies were carried out in accordance with C.L.S.I. guideline EP9-A2 ‘Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples: Approved Guideline – Second Edition’.

106 serum patient samples spanning the range 8 to ${ 8 8 3 \ U / L }$ were tested by one operator on two lots of Randox ALP reagent on one RX daytona plus analyzer and one lot of Siemens ALPAMP reagent on one Advia 1800 system, across 3 working days with each sample tested in duplicate. The test method was compared to the predicate device and the following linear regression equation was obtained:

$$
\mathsf { y } = 1 . 0 0 5 \mathsf { x } - 3 . 9 5
$$

Correlation coefficient of $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9$

# g. Matrix comparison:

Matrix method comparisons for the Randox RX Daytona Plus Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) assay was tested by one operator on one RX Daytona Plus system and was assessed for two lots of ALP reagents. Both serum and lithium heparin plasma were tested to determine whether method accuracy with lithium heparin specimens is equivalent to serum results and that lithium heparin plasma does not interfere with either the method or the system.

Patient samples were drawn in matched pairs – one sample serum $( \mathsf { x } )$ and the second sample lithium heparin plasma (y). A total of 46 matched patient sample pairs were analyzed spanning the 15.3 to $7 7 3 . 1 \ \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { L }$ and the following linear regression equation was obtained:

Correlation coefficient of $\mathsf { r } = 1 . 0 0$

# Expected values/Reference range:

Referenced from literature

Reference intervals for ALP was verified using NCCLS C28-A3 guidelines. In a study, human serum from 30 normal donors were tested in singlicate on the RX Daytona Plus. The results obtained were ordered from lowest to highest before being examined for outliers using the Dixon test.

Upon confirmation there were no outliers, the values were compared to the quoted ranges for ALP. Results of the study indicate that all values reported in the range for Healthy Individuals.

It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own reference range to reflect the age, sex, diet and geographical location of the population.

# 10. CONCLUSION

Testing results indicate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
