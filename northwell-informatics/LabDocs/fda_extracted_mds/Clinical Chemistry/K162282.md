Dear Ms. Enright:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Page 2—Ms. Enright

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

# 7. Reason for Special510(k):

Device Modifications

The CardioChek Plus Test System and the CardioChek Home Test System are modifications of the original devices (cleared in k071507, k071593 and k041750) to include the following:

• Wireless communications capability (professional system)   
• Software solutions capability   
• Printer connectivity capability   
• MEMo chip appearance   
• Battery type   
• Multiple language software capability   
• Wired PC Communication   
• Analyzer dimensions

The CardioChek Plus Test System and the CardioChek Home Test System include the PTS Panels test strips for use with the CardioChek Plus analyzer and the CardioChek Home test strips for use with the CardioChek Home analyzer. The test strips are unmodified from K041750, K071507 and K071593.

The three test strips are: Chol+HDI $^ +$ Glu, Chol+HDL and Chol+Glu. The current trade names for each are:

a. PTS Panels Chol+HDL $^ +$ Glu test strips b. PTS Panels Chol+HDL test strips c. PTS Panels Chol+Glu test strips d. CardioChek Home Chol+HDI $^ +$ Glu test strips e. CardioChek Home Chol+HDL test strips f. CardioChek Home Chol+Glu test strips

# 8. Statement of Substantial Equivalence

The CardioChek Plus Test System and CardioChek Home Test System are substantially equivalent to the predicates (k071507, k071593 and k041750).

9. Predicate Device Information Predicates

Name: PTS Panels Chol+HDL+Glu Test Strips Device Company: Polymer Technology Systems, Inc. (PTS) 510(k) Number: K071507

# 10. Similarities and Differences Similarities

Both systems employ reflectance photometry.   
Both systems provide results that correlate to reference methods.   
Both test systems use the same test strips.   
Both systems require a lot specific memory chip for result calculation, which are included in the same package with the test strips

# Differences

The software for the CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Home analyzers have multiple language options.

• The CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Home analyzers provide:

Software solutions capability   
Wired PC communication capability   
Printer connectivity capability via a USB   
Wireless communication capability (professional analyzer)

The MEMo chip appearance is changed to make it more aesthetically pleasing. (The printed circuit board inside is the unmodified.)

Analyzer outer case is larger.

The modified analyzers use 4 AA batteries; the BioScanner Plus uses 2 AAA batteries.

# 11. Verification and Validation Summary

As required by the risk analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.

# 12. Conclusion

The intended use of the device is unchanged. The CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Home test systems are as safe and effective and perform as well as the predicate devices: k071507, k071593 and k041750.
