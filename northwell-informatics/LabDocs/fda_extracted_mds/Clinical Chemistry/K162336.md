Dear Jennifer Gregory:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

# 510(k) Summary

Date prepared: January 4, 2017

According to the requirements of 21 CFR 807.92, the following information is being submitted in sufficient detail to provide an understanding of the basis for a determination of substantial equivalence.

1) Submitter

Jennifer Gregory Regulatory Affairs Manager Ascensia Diabetes Care US Inc. 430 South Beiger Street Mishawaka, IN 46544 Telephone: (574) 256-3447 Fax: (574) 256-3519

2) Device name:

Trade name: Contour $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System K162336   
Common name: Blood Glucose Test System   
Classification: Class II   
Classification name: Blood Glucose Test System, Over-the-Counter, 75 NBW and Glucose Dehydrogenase, 75 LFR (21 CFR § 862.1345)

3) Predicate device: Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K130265))

4) Device description:

The Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter consists of a small handheld blood glucose meter that utilizes dry reagent test strips for the measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes. Liquid control solution is used to check the performance of the system. The meter, together with the test strips and control solutions, is referred to as the Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

The chemical principle utilized for both the predicate and modified devices is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose in the blood with chemicals on the reagent strip. The blood sample is drawn into the tip of the reagent strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) enzyme on the reagent strip. The electrons generated by this reaction are shuttled to an electrode by a mediator chemical, producing a current that is proportional to the glucose in the sample. After a fixed reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is calculated and displayed.

5) Intended Use:

The CONTOUR®NEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring system is an over the counter (OTC) device utilized for self-testing by persons with diabetes at home for the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood, is for single-patient use only, and should not be shared.

The system is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and is to be used as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring system is indicated for use with fresh fingertip capillary whole blood samples.

The CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring system is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus and is not intended for use on neonates.

The CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT test strips are for use with the CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT EZ blood glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips.

# Data demonstrating substantial equivalence

The Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter consists of a small handheld blood glucose meter that is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Meter (K130265). The modified and predicate devices use the same glucose calculation algorithm. Both devices also use dry reagent test strips for the measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes and liquid controls to check the performance of the system. The same Contour Next test strips and Contour Next control solutions are used by both the modified and predicate devices.

A detailed comparison of the characteristics featured between the modified and predicate devices is provided in the tables on the following pages:

# Summary of Performance testing

Bench testing was conducted to ensure that the error checks acted as intended and gave error messages for:

• Test strips that had been exposed to a reducing agent • Un-mixed control test solution • Samples that had been disturbed during the test countdown

Equivalency testing was conducted to ensure the performance of the modified and predicate meters was not statistically different.

Software verification testing was conducted to ensure that no good results were classified as errors as a result of the modifications.

Control testing was conducted to ensure that adequately mixed control solution did not generate error codes.

# Conclusions from Performance Evaluations

The Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent in its intended use, performance, safety and effectiveness to the predicate Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K130265) based on the performance of the modified Contour Next EZ Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
