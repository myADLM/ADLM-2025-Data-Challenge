The Atellica CH Mg assay is based on the modified xylidyl blue reaction, which was first described by C.K. Mann and J.H. Yoe.1,2 The reagent was modified to eliminate the use of organic solvents. Magnesium ions react with xylidyl blue in an alkaline medium to form a water-soluble purple-red complex. The increase in absorbance of xylidyl blue at 505/694 nm is proportional to the concentration of magnesium in the sample. Calcium is excluded from the reaction by complexing with EGTA.

Serum, lithium heparin plasma and urine specimens may be used. The reagent is stored unopened at $2 - 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and is stable for use on system for 14 days. Calibration is performed every 60 days for a reagent lot or every 3 days for an individual pack.

# INTENDED USE/INDICATIONS FOR USE

# ATELLICA CH MAGNESIUM (MG)

The Atellica™ CH Magnesium (Mg) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of magnesium in human serum, plasma (lithium heparin), and urine using the Atellica™ CH Analyzer. Magnesium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of hypomagnesemia (abnormally low levels of magnesium) and hypermagnesemia (abnormally high levels of magnesium).

Assay performance comparison results for the Atellica CH Magnesium (Mg) were obtained by processing the appropriate body fluids. Summary statistics for each are provided. These data demonstrate substantial equivalency of the Atellica CH Magnesium (Mg) compared to the predicate device. The following data represent typical assay performance.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline.

Assessment of LoB was the 95th percentile of all values (sorted from lowest to highest), using non-parametric approach.

LoB Rank Position $= 0 . 5 + 0 . 9 5 ^ { \star } \mathsf { B }$ , where $\mathsf { B } =$ total reps $\mathtt { - 6 0 }$ ; Rank = 57.5

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for serum was determined as described in CLSI Document EP17-A2. The mean, SD, $\% 0 \%$ and bias relative to the reference values were calculated for each sample per reagent lot. The lowest sample concentration that met the maximum allowable imprecision and maximum allowable bias acceptance criteria was taken as the LoQ estimate for each reagent lot.

For both serum/plasma and urine fluids, 4 low samples were processed on three reagent lots for three days, on one instrument for a total of 60 measurements per lot. For serum LoQ estimate is $0 . 4 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (0.19 mmol/L) with maximum allowable imprecision of $5 \%$ CV and maximum allowable bias of $1 5 \%$ . For Urine LoQ estimates is $0 . 5 7 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ ( $0 . 2 3 \mathrm { m m o l } / \mathrm { L } ,$ ) with maximum allowable imprecision of $5 \%$ CV and maximum allowable bias of $1 5 \%$ . For serum, the measured LoQ was $0 . 4 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in support of the low end of the measuring interval of $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ for serum and plasma samples. For urine, the measured LoQ was $0 . 5 7 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ in support of the low end of the measuring interval of $1 . 0 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine samples.

# LINEARITY STUDY

Linearity was evaluated with 10 samples which spanned the assay measuring interval for serum specimens and 10 samples which spanned the assay measuring interval for urine specimens. Each was prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples across the measurement interval as described in CLSI Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedure (EP06-A). The high sample was prepared by spiking native serum or urine pools with magnesium acetate. Low pools were created by diluting serum and urine samples with saline solution. Four replicates were measured for each sample. The mean of these replicates was used for the calculations.

The assay was considered linear across the measuring interval if the p values of nonlinear terms in the quadratic and cubic fit equations are nonsignificant $( \mathsf { p } \leq 0 . 0 5 )$ . If the p-value is $> 0 . 0 5$ , then the allowable bias is $\leq 5 \%$ or $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , whichever is greater. Linearity of the Atellica CH Magnesium (Mg) was demonstrated with both serum and urine specimens to encompass the measuring intervals of 0.50 to 5.00 mg/dL for serum and plasma specimens and 1.00 to $1 4 . 0 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine specimens.

# PRECISION STUDIES

Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods: Approved Guideline – Third Edition. Precision was tested ${ \mathsf n } = 2$ replicates, two times a day for at least 20 days for a total of 80 replicates with controls, serum and plasma pools on one instrument. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP05-A3. The data are summarized in the following table.

CLSI EP7-A2 was followed for the interference testing. The interference study was conducted using a “paired difference worst case scenario” approach where these compounds were spiked into fresh sample pools containing either low or high levels of measurand in serum and urine pools.

Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference. Dilution studies were conducted to determine the level at which the spiked substance no longer displayed significant interference. Dilution studies were conducted at two analyte concentrations, if both sample pools show significant interference. This study was conducted as needed for both serum pools.

The predicate device selected for the method comparison study was the Dimension Magnesium Flex Reagent Cartridge. Remnant de-identified samples were tested. No patient history information was obtained on these samples. Inclusion/exclusion data criteria are not applicable. The study included native and diluted samples to properly span the assay intervals.

These studies were conducted internally by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic Inc. R&D organization personnel. The personnel conducting the study were laboratory technicians with training similar to personnel who would conduct the tests in a hospital laboratory setting. They were trained on the operation of both the device and the predicate device. A split sample method comparison, following EP09-A3, demonstrated good agreement between the Atellica CH Magnesium (Mg) and the predicate Dimension Magnesium Flex Reagent Cartridge (Mg) assay with patient samples.

The results across the full assay intervals were analyzed using Deming regression. One replicate of each sample was tested and used in the analysis.

Due to the difficulty with obtaining matched serum and plasma magnesium samples across the measuring interval, an additional method comparison study was conducted with lithium heparin plasma samples on Atellica CH Magnesium (Mg) and Dimension Magnesium Flex Reagent Cartridge. Some samples were diluted to obtain samples spanning the assay measuring interval. The table below summarizes the Deming linear regression statistics.

# EXTENDED MEASURING INTERVAL

The Mg assay parameters support both serum/plasma and urine extended ranges 2x the upper measuring intervals. Two-fold manual dilutions of 5 serum pools and 5 urine pools were made with CH Diluent, and both the undiluted and diluted pools were processed with $\Nu = 5$ replicates. The serum/plasma extended measuring interval is up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The urine extended measuring interval up to $2 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# STANDARDIZATION

Magnesium values are traceable to Atomic Absorption reference method which is calibrated with NIST SRM 929 reference material. SRM909 reference material from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was processed with $\Nu = 5$ replicates with 3 reagent lots of Atellica CH Magnesium (Mg) and the mean results were compared to the target value. All results recover within $\pm 5 . 0 \%$ of the expected value.

# CONCLUSION

The Atellica CH Magnesium (Mg) is substantially equivalent to the Dimension Magnesium Flex Reagent Cartridge in principle and performance based on the similarity of device designs and function demonstrated through method comparison and other performance attributes.
