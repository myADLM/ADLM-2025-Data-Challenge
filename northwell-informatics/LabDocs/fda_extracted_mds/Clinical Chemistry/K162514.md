Dear Bernd Hass:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

# 8.0 Value assignment process

The value assignment performance outlined here, was performed using a single analyser with single reagent and calibrator lot. Variability was introduced by performing the testing over multiple days.

Target assigned here were performed on the, Tosoh, Beckman and Trinity analysers, independently, with values claimed on each platform. The control target is the mean value of all the replicates generated on the specified instrument. The number of replicates performed is detailed in the below tables. No data points were excluded. Target values assigned have to be with the following acceptance specifications:

# 9.0 Summary of Performance Data

Stability studies have been performed to determine the open vial stability and shelf life for this control. Product claims are as follows:

Open vial stability: 30 days at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to ${ } ^ { 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$   
Storage (Closed/Shelf-Life): - $\mathsf { 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ to $\mathfrak { - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ until expiration date.

The submission provides the summary data necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the reference predicate. Additional supporting data is retained on file at Techno-path Manufacturing Ltd. The summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 and the implementing regulation 21 CFR 807.92.

# Stability (Open Vial)

The Multichem A1c (Assayed) controls were evaluated using an Isochronous (Staggered Start [Backwards / Back-ended]) protocol design as per CLSI EP25-A.

Open Vial testing was performed (at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ by testing vials which were thawed and opened for pre-defined durations (test vials) against a freshly thawed, unopened vial (reference vials). All analytes from open vial and freshly thawed vial samples were tested in replicates of 3 at each time-point.

Acceptance criteria: Maximum Allowable Degradation / Drift Limit $10 \%$

# Stability (Closed Vial)

# Accelerated Stress Test:

An in-house study was performed which shows that an accelerated model of 6.5 hours $@ 3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ is comparable with $\geq 2 0$ month real-time data and therefore represents a suitable model for the prediction of a shelf-life of (significantly beyond) 12 months.

Testing, using this accelerated model, was performed on 3 separate HbA1c Control lots. The A1c $\%$ value of the stressed vials was verified versus the A1c $\%$ value of a fresh (unstressed) sample. All samples were tested in duplicate.

Acceptance Criteria: Drift Limit of $\leq 1 0 \%$

The $\%$ shift in HbA1c value is calculated using the following formula.

% shift in A1c = [(mean stressed value % / mean fresh value %) -1] x 100

Testing supports a shelf life of ${ \tt \ge } 1 2$ months.

A real time stability test program has been implemented at Technopath Manufacturing Ltd.

Stability is assessed by testing the HbA1c analyte at specific time points over the proposed shelf life of the product. Testing will be completed for a minimum of 3 lots of the controls at each time point using product stored at both $\mathsf { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ and at $\mathfrak { - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ .

Acceptance Criteria: Drift Limit of $\leq 1 0 \%$

# 10.0 Conclusion.

The Submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
