# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Creatine Kinase-MB assay is a two reagent assay for the quantitative determination of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) in human serum and plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The rate of the NADPH formation is directly proportional to the catalytic CK-MB activity. It is determined by measuring the increase in absorbance photometrically.

# 2. INDICATIONS FOR USE

The Creatine Kinase-MB assay is an in-vitro test for the quantitative determination of the catalytic activity of creatine kinase MB subunit (CK-MB) in human serum and plasma on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems.

Measurements of creatine phosphokinase and its isoenzymes are used in the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction and muscle diseases such as progressive, Duchenne-type muscular dystrophy.

# 3. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Human CK-MB is composed of two subunits, CK-M and CK-B which both have an active site. With the aid of specific antibodies to CK-M, the catalytic activity of CK-M subunits in the sample is inhibited to $9 9 . 6 \%$ without affecting the CK-B subunits. The remaining CK-B activity, corresponding to half the CK-MB activity, is determined by the total CK method. As the CK-BB isoenzyme only rarely appears in serum and the catalytic activity of the CK-M and CK-B subunits hardly differ, the catalytic activity of the CK-MB isoenzyme can be calculated from the measured CK B activity by multiplying the result by 2.

Figure 1: CK MB: UV test

# 4.2. Analytical Sensitivity

# 4.2.1. Limit of Blank (LoB)

For determination of LoB one analyte free sample was measured with three lots in 10-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. In total, 60 measurements were obtained per lot. Data analysis is based on determination of the 95th percentile of the 60 measured values.

# 4.2.2. Limit of Detection (LoD)

For determination of LoD five samples with low-analyte concentration (approximately up to 4 times the LoB) were measured with three lots in twofold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. In total 60 measurements will be obtained per lot.

# 4.2.3. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

A low Level Sample Set was prepared by diluting 5 human serum samples with an analyte free diluent $( 0 . 9 \% \mathrm { N a C l } )$ ). The Low level Sample Set was tested in 5 replicates per sample on 5 days, one run per day on one cobas c 501 analyzer.

# 4.3. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range

# 4.3.1. Regression Analysis

The linearity study was conducted to demonstrate that measurements across the claimed measuring range for each parameter are linear. The study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP6-A.

Dilution series were prepared using the human sample pools (one serum pool and one plasma pool) with CKMB concentrations above the upper end of the measuring range. Dilutions were made using $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl. The dilution series contain 16 concentrations for serum and 18 dilution steps for plasma. Samples were measured in triplicate and data analysis was done separately for each sample.

Linear regression analysis was done according to EP6-A.

In a first step, a linearity check was performed with first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic). The linear regression was not forced through the origin. The linear regression was weighted.

# 4.4. Endogenous Interferences

# 4.4.1. I, H, and L Indices

The effects of interference by hemoglobin, lipemia (Intralipid), Bilirubin on the CK-MB test system is determined on the cobas c 501 analyzer using pooled human serum samples spiked with varying levels of interferent. The resulting sample series were tested in triplicate and the mean values used to calculate $\%$ recovery, by comparing the measured concentration to the expected concentration (which is the CK-MB concentration when no interferent was added).

Hemolysis interferes with the assay. Hemolyzed samples should not be used.

# 4.5. Exogenous Interferences – Drugs

Two sample pools, containing a low and high concentration of CKMB were used. These sample pools were divided into an appropriate number of aliquots. One aliquot was not spiked with the drugs and was used as the reference sample for CKMB concentration. The CKMB concentration in the sample was determined with ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 3$ measurements on a cobas c 501 analyzer.

The other sample aliquots, with either the high or low CKMB concentrations, were spiked with the respective amount of drug. The CKMB concentration of the spiked aliquots were determined in triplicate and the mean of the triplicate determinations was compared to the CKMB concentration determined for the reference aliquot (mean of $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ ).

No interference was found at therapeutic concentrations using common drug panels with the exceptions of Cyanokit (Hydroxocobalamin) and Cefoxitin which interfere with the test.

# 4.6. Method Comparison to Predicate

A total of 105 human serum samples were tested in singlicate with the CK-MB assay on cobas c 501 and on the predicate device. 4 samples were spiked with CK MB rec human. The results were calculated using Passing/Bablok regression.

$\mathrm { t } = 0 . 9 6 8$

# 4.7. Matrix Comparison - Anticoagulants

The effect of the presence of anticoagulants on analyte recovery was determined by method comparison, obtained from samples drawn into serum and different types of plasma collection tubes (K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA, Li Heparin, and Gel Separation). For Li Heparin 31 tubes, for K2 EDTA 30 tubes, for K3 EDTA 31 tubes and 31 gel Separation tubes were collected and filled completely.

Method comparison was executed by using the serum data as the reference. Slope, Intercept and Correlation were calculated.
