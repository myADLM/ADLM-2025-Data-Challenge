Stability -

Shelf-Life (closed vial) and in-use (open vial) stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate.

Real-time stability testing supports a shelf-life stability claim of 36 months when stored frozen at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $- 8 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for the Multichem IA Plus three level controls.

Real-Time stability testing supports open vial stability claims as listed below:

Acetaminophen, Amikacin, EPO, hGH, Free Estriol, Lithium, NT Pro-BNP, Salicylate, Thyroglobulin and Tobramycin of 10 days at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$   
· ACTH of 8 hours at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$   
· Calcitonin and Troponin T of 7 days at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$

Value Assignment -

The value assignment for all analytes was performed on analyte specific assay/analyzer systems using the proposed new value assignment protocol. Fifteen replicates of each analyte were tested over a minimum of three runs with a minimum of three replicates per run using and run over multiple days. The mean from the 15 data points was used as the target concentration. The assignment of value assignment ranges was established based on the 3SD value for each level of the analyte control. The target mean and range for each analyte level along with their respective acceptance criteria were provided for review and found acceptable. Representative values for target mean and range for each analyte for a lot are provided in tabular form in the value assignment sheets.
