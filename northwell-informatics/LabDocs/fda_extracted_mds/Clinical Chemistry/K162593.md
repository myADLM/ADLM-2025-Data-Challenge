# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The HDL-Cholesterol Gen.4 is a homogeneous enzymatic colorimetric test. Non-HDL lipoproteins such as LDL, VLDL and chylomicrons are combined with polyanions and a detergent forming a water-soluble complex. In this complex the enzymatic reaction of CHER and CHOD towards non-HDL lipoproteins is blocked. Finally only HDL-particles can react with CHER and CHOD. The concentration of HDL-cholesterol is determined enzymatically by CHER and CHOD.

# 2. INDICATIONS FOR USE

In vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative determination of the HDL-cholesterol concentration in human serum and plasma on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems.

A lipoprotein test system is a device intended to measure lipoprotein in serum and plasma. Lipoprotein measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders (such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis, and various liver and renal diseases.

# 3. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Cholesterol esters are broken down quantitatively into free cholesterol and fatty acids by CHER. In the presence of oxygen, cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to $\Delta 4$ -cholestenone and hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of peroxidase, the hydrogen peroxide generated reacts with 4 -amino-antipyrine and EMSE to form a dye. The color intensity of this dye is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration and is measured photometrically.

# 4.2. 8BAnalytical Sensitivity

# 4.2.1. 17BLimit of Blank (LoB)

LoB of the HDL-Cholesterol Gen.4 on the cobas c 501 analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. Limit of Blank determines the highest observed measurement values for samples free of analyte. The Limit of Blank was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples.

One analyte free sample was measured on three lots of reagent in 10-fold determinations in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one analyzer. In total, 60 measurements were obtained per reagent lot. Data analysis was based on determination of the 95th percentile of the 60 measured values.

LoB Observed: 0.00 mg/dL

LoB Claim: 3.09 mg/dL

# 4.2.2. 18BLimit of Detection (LoD)

LoD of the HDL-Cholesterol Gen.4 on the cobas c 501 analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoD determines the lower limit for samples with analyte. The LoD is the concentration at which there is a $9 5 \%$ probability that a sample contains analyte.

For determination of LoD, five samples with low-analyte concentration (approximately up to 4 times the LoB) were measured with three lots of reagent in two-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one analyzer. In total 60 measurements were obtained per lot of reagent.

LoD was determined using the following equation:

$$
\mathsf { L o D } = \mathsf { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 3 \times \mathsf { S D _ { t o t } }
$$

Where:

$\mathrm { D _ { t o t a l } = \mathsf { S q u a r e } \ r o o t \ [ 0 . 2 \ x \left( ( \mathbb { S } D _ { s a m p l e a } ) ^ { 2 } \right. \left. + ( \mathbb { S } D _ { s a m p l e a } ) ^ { 2 } \right. \left. + ( \mathbb { S } D _ { s a m p l e a } ) ^ { 2 } \right. \left. + ( \mathbb { S } D _ { s a m p l e a } ) ^ { 2 } \right. \left. + ( \mathbb { S } D _ { s a m p l e a } ) ^ { 2 } \right. \left. + ( \mathbb { S } D _ { s a m p l e a } ) ^ { 2 } \right. \left. \right] } .$ LoD Observed: $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ LoD Claim: $3 . 0 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# 4.2.3. 19BLimit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The LoQ of the HDL-Cholesterol Gen.4 was determined on the cobas c 501 analyzer according to CLSI Guideline EP17-A2.

The LoQ is derived from a plot (mean concentration versus $\% \mathrm { C V }$ ) with the goal of $\% \mathrm { C V }$ less than or equal to $20 \%$ which was met. A low level sample set was prepared by diluting 5 human serum samples with an analyte free diluent $( 0 . 9 \% \mathrm { N a C l } )$ . The low level sample set was tested in 5 replicates per sample on 5 days, one run per day on one analyzer.

LoQ Observed: 2.89 mg/dL LoQ Claim: 3.09 mg/dL

# 4.3. 9BLinearity/Assay Reportable Range

# 4.3.1. 20BRegression Analysis

The linearity study was conducted to demonstrate that measurements across the claimed measuring range for each parameter are linear. The study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP6-A.

Dilution series were prepared using the human sample pools (1 serum pool and 1 plasma pool) with HDL-C concentrations above the upper end of the measuring range. Dilutions were made using $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl. The dilution series contain 11 concentrations for serum and 15 concentrations for plasma. Sample dilution levels were measured in triplicate and data analysis was done separately for each sample type.

Linear regression analysis was done according to EP6-A.

In a first step, a linearity check was performed with first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic). A linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression for plasma and additionally a 2nd order regression for serum. The linear regression was weighted 1/Conc².

The nonlinearity of the assay did not deviate by more than $10 \%$ during testing.

# 4.4. 10BEndogenous Interferences

# 4.4.1. 21BL, H, and I Indices

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances was determined at two HDL-Cholesterol concentrations (approximately 33 and $6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and a dilution set of the added interfering substances. Interfering substances evaluated include:

Hemolysis up to an H index of 1200

Lipemia up to an L index of 2000

Icterus/Conjugated and Unconjugated Bilirubin up to an I index of 60

High concentrated stock solutions of the interference substances were prepared in a suitable solvent. Two human serum pools were spiked with the defined HDL-Cholesterol concentrations and divided into two aliquots. The potential interfering substance was added to one aliquot, while the other aliquot was mixed with the same amount of solvent without the interfering substance. A

dilution series was prepared with 11 dilution steps for each interferent by mixing the 2 aliquots.   
Three aliquots per level were tested in 1 run on 1 instrument and 1 lot.

The aliquot containing the interfering substance had the same HDL-Cholesterol concentrations as the aliquots containing no interfering substance. When diluting those two aliquots the HDLCholesterol concentration remained constant while the concentration of interferent varied. Thus the effect of increasing concentrations of interferent can be determined.

Mean of the measured results were compared to the expected result (aliquot with no interfering substance) and the recovery was determined (paired difference testing). Interference was defined as bias greater than $10 \%$ .

This procedure was repeated for each of the interfering substances.

Two human serum sample pools spiked with approximately 30 and $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ HDL-Cholesterol concentrations were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot of each concentration were used as the reference sample for HDL-Cholesterol concentration and were not spiked with the drugs but the solvent for the drug.

The other aliquots, with either the high or low HDL-Cholesterol concentration, were spiked with the respective amount of drug. The HDL-Cholesterol concentration of the spiked aliquots were tested with 3 replicates in one run, 1 reagent lot and one instrument.

# 4.6. 12BMethod Comparison to Predicate

One hundred eleven routine laboratory serum samples were used in the method comparison testing. No patient information was obtained.

Four samples were spiked with high human serum HDL-Cholesterol. One sample was diluted with $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl.

The samples were tested in singlicate using the HDL Ultra Cholesterol reagent from Sekisui on Roche/Hitachi 917 analyzer and the HDL-Cholesterol Gen.4 reagent on cobas c 501 analyzer.

The data was evaluated using Passing Bablok Regression analysis.

Regression analysis results:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 5 6 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 9 4 9 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 5
$$

Bias at medical decision points:

- $. 6 . 7 \%$ at $4 0 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$

$6 . 0 \%$ at $5 9 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# 4.7. 13BMatrix Comparison - Anticoagulants

Each pair of serum and plasma of a single donor were spiked with HDL-Cholesterol. The 38 paired sample tubes are tested in singlicate.

A method comparison was executed by using the serum data as the reference. Only samples within the measuring range were used.

The following method comparisons were completed:

Gel separation tubes K2-EDTA plasma vs serum K3-EDTA plasma vs serum Li-Heparin plasma vs serum
