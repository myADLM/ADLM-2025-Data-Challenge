# 4. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

# 4.1. Repeatability and Intermediate Precision

Precision of the Elecsys TSH assay was evaluated on one cobas e 801 analyzer according to CLSI EP05-A3. One reagent lot was evaluated.

The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each control (PC Universal and PreciControl TS) and human sera (HS) per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days. The samples were run in randomized order on the analyzer. Pooled serum samples were used (Human serum 1-5, 11) and pooled spiked sera (Human serum 6-10).

# 4.2. Linearity

Linearity of the Elecsys TSH assay was assessed on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer according to CLSI EP6-A. Three high analyte serum samples were diluted with Diluent MultiAssay. 12 concentrations (dilutions) throughout the measuring range were prepared. Samples were assayed in 3-fold determination within a single run. The linearity data were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials according to CLSI EP6-A. A summary of the linearity data is presented below:

Serum 1: intercept $= - 0 . 0 0 1 5 5$ , slope $= 0 . 9 6 3$ , Pearson’s $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 4$ Serum 2 intercept $= - 0 . 0 0 1 9 3$ , slope $= 0 . 9 5 8$ , Pearson’s $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 2$ Serum 3 intercept $= - 0 . 0 0 2 7 2$ , slope $= 0 . 9 5 2$ , Pearson’s $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 8 6$

# 4.3. Analytical sensitivity

The limit of Blank (LoB) determines the highest observed measurement values for samples free of analyte. It was determined for three reagent lots using 60 replicates (one cobas e 801 instrument, six days, one run per day, one blank sample with ten replicates per run). LoB is $0 . 0 0 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. It was determined for three reagent lots using 60 replicates (one cobas e 801 instrument, six days, one run per day, two replicates per sample per run and five low-level human serum samples). LoD is $0 . 0 0 5 \ : \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is defined as the mean value of that sample which is the first that fulfills the specification for the intermediate precision and for which no sample with higher concentration exists that exceeds this specification. It was determined for three reagent lots using 10 low level TSH samples tested on one instrument, for five days, one run per day and five replicates per sample. The mean value and the intermediate precision as coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (SD) for each LoQ sample were then calculated. The LoQ is 0.005 $\mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ at a $C V \leq 2 0 \%$ .

# 4.4. Endogenous interferences

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances using the Elecsys TSH was determined on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay analyzer using human serum samples. No interference was observed up to the levels indicated:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interferent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>No interference seen up to</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intralipid (Lipemia)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Biotin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>56.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>66.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Rheumatic Factor</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IU/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>human IgG</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>g/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>human IgM</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>g/dL</td></tr></table>

# 4.5. Exogenous interferences- anticoagulants

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys TSH Immunoassay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples (single donors, native as well as spiked) drawn into Serum, Li-Heparin, K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA plasma tubes. Anticoagulants: A minimum of 40 serum/plasma pairs per sample material were tested in singleton with one reagent lot on one cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer. Data were evaluated using a regression analysis according to Passing/Bablok and supported the above sample types.

# 4.6. Exogenous interferences- drugs

In vitro tests were performed on 16 commonly used drugs. No interference with the assay was found. In addition the following special drugs were tested. No interference with the assay was found to the levels tested:

# 4.7. Method comparison

A method comparison was performed between the cobas e 801 and the predicate Elecsys 2010. A total of 130 human serum samples (single donors and serum pools; native, spiked as well as diluted) were measured with the Elecsys TSH immunoassay on analyzers in singlicate covering

the entire measuring range. Sample concentrations were between $0 . 0 0 8 - 9 2 . 6 ~ \mathrm { \mu I U / m L }$ . The summary of the analysis is presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Passing/Bablok</td><td>Linear regression</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td colspan="2">130</td></tr><tr><td>Slope</td><td>0.936</td><td>0.958</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>-0.003</td><td>-0.052</td></tr><tr><td>Correlation coefficient Pearson (r) Kendall ()</td><td>- 0.989</td><td>0.999 -</td></tr></table>

# 4.8. Expected Values

These values correspond to the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles of results obtained from a total of 516 healthy test subjects examined.

# CONCLUSION

The Elecsys TSH assay applied to the cobas e 801 analyzer is substantially equivalent to the predicate device based on the intended use, principle and performance characteristics described above.
