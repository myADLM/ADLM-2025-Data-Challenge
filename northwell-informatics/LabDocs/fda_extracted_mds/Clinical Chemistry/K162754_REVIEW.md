# L. Test Principle:

The FREND Vitamin D Test System is a competitive immunoassay with gold microparticles labeled with Vitamin D-specific monoclonal anti-Vitamin D-antibody (mouse), Vitamin Dbiotin labeled with fluorescence nanoparticles and fluorescence detection by the FREND System. The concentration of the analyte of interest in an unknown sample is calculated using the ratio of the fluorescent intensity of the test zone and the reference zone. The magnitude of the fluorescent ratio is inversely proportional to the amount of 25-OH Vitamin D in the sample. There is no calibration needed by the user because each cartridge is coded with the calibration information generated by the manufacturer.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

An internal precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A3 in which three serum samples with low, intermediate and high 25-OH Vitamin D levels were assayed in duplicate in two runs per day for 20 days using one reagent lot for a total of 80 results per sample. The precision results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>ID#</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N=80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Repeatability</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Between run</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Between day</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean(ng/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.76</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.7%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.46</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.3%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.22</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.83</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.1%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.26</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.31</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.6%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.59</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.2%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.67</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.53</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.6%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.13</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.4%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.74</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.72</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.9%</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP-6A. A linearity sample set was prepared by diluting a serum sample with high 25-OH vitamin D concentration with a serum sample with low 25-OH vitamin D concentration to obtain nine (9) concentration levels (8.0, 20.2, 32.4, 44.6, 56.8, 69.0, 81.2, 93.4, $1 0 5 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ across the measuring range of the candidate assay. Samples were run in replicates of 4 on one FREND system using one reagent lot. The ordinary least squares linear regression of the observed mean concentrations versus the expected concentration was calculated and yielded the following linear regression equation:

$$
\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 5 6 7 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 9 6 2 6 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 9 4
$$

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from $1 3 - 9 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The FREND Vitamin D Code chip calibration information is traceable to the manufacturer’s primary calibrators. The primary calibrators are prepared gravimetrically from a certified standard material and confirmed by measurement on the ARCHITECT $i 2 5$ -OH Vitamin D assay (k110619). All calibration statistics and information have been electronically stored on the FREND Vitamin D Code chip included in each box of FREND Vitamin D cartridges. There is no need for calibration by the operator as the calibration information is coded in each code chip, which is lot-specific.

# Quality Control:

The sponsor recommends the use of at least two levels of commercially available quality control material that contains 25-OH Vitamin D as the measurand. The sponsor used Bio-Rad Lyphocheck Immunoassay Controls (cleared under k133960) during performance characteristic studies.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) studies were performed according to CLSI EP-17A2.

To establish LoB, six blank serum samples were assayed 10 times per day per sample over 6 days using 3 reagent lots on one FREND system. The Limit of Blank was calculated from $\mathrm { N } = 6 0$ results using a non-parametric analysis and was determined to be $3 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

To determine LoD, five low level serum samples were assayed 2 times per day over 6 days using 3 reagent lots on one FREND system. The LoD was calculated from LoB using the following formula $\mathrm { L o D = L o B \mathrm { + } C _ { \beta } \Delta x }$ SD and was determined to be 6.3 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The LoQ was determined by performing a functional sensitivity study. Six levels of 25-OH vitamin D serum samples $( 2 . 5 - 4 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L } )$ were assayed using 3 lots of reagent for 4 days on one FREND system. The 25-OH vitamin D concentration giving an imprecision of $2 0 \% \mathrm { C V }$ was determined to be the LoQ value.

The reportable range of the assay is $1 3 { \mathrm { - } } 9 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

# Interference:

The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effect of potential interferents on the performance of the FREND Vitamin D Test, following the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Two levels of serum sample pools containing approximately $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and 40-50 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ of Vitamin D were spiked with different concentrations of the potential interferents. Each level of Vitamin D sample was tested with each interferent in 3 replicates. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as recovery from $90 \%$ to $1 1 0 \%$ of the expected Vitamin D concentration. The table below lists the substances tested and the concentration at which no significant interference was observed:

Cross reactivity:

Cross-reactivity with the FREND Vitamin D was evaluated by spiking potential cross reactants to two levels of (low and high) 25-OH Vitamin D serum pools. The crossreactivity was calculated using the following equation:

$\%$ cross reactivity $= 1 0 0 \mathrm { { x } }$ [(Measured value – true value) / concentration of interferent)]

Results from this study are summarized in the tables below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Cross-reactant</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Conc. of cross-reactant(ng/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>% Cross-reactivity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1,25-(OH)2-Vitamin D2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1,25-(OH)2-Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3-epi-25-(OH) Vitamin D3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25-(OH) Vitamin D2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>97.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>97.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25-(OH) Vitamin D3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>107.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>92.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Paricalcitol</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14.7</td></tr></table>

The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling:

Patients taking the drugs containing Paricalcitol (e.g., Zemplar) should not be tested by this assay.   
· Certain medications may interfere with assay performance. All results should be interpreted with respect to the clinical picture of the patient.   
· Although hemolysis has an insignificant effect on the assay, hemolyzed samples may indicate mistreatment of a specimen prior to assay and results should be interpreted with caution.   
· Lipemia has an insignificant effect on the assay except in the case of gross lipemia where interference with the lateral flow of the sample in the cartridge may occur.

# Hook effect study:

The sponsor performed a hook effect study by testing Vitamin D-depleted serum spiked with 25-OH Vitamin D3 using a single lot of reagents on one FREND system. The Vitamin D concentrations ranged from 20 to $1 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The results supported the following statement in the labeling:

The FREND Vitamin D assay has been evaluated and no high dose hook effect was observed for Vitamin D concentrations up to $1 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate device (FREND Vitamin D Test System) to the predicate device (ARCHITECT Vitamin D assay, k110619). A total of 133 native serum samples were tested by two operators in singlicate at one clinical laboratory. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed, as summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range (ng/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>133</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13.3-91.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.069(1.001-1.117)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.182(-1.561 - 1.106)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.971</td></tr></table>

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

The matrix comparison study was performed using 36 paired samples in the control tube type (serum separator tube) and in the following tube types: lithium heparin plasma, $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ plasma and citrate plasma tubes. The Passing-Bablok analysis for results from each plasma tube type in comparison to serum separator tube results are summarized below:

Lithium heparin plasma: $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 5 8 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 6 7$ , $_ { \mathrm { r = 0 } . 9 9 5 }$ $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA plasma: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 1 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 6 2 , \mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 3$

Citrate plasma: $\mathrm { y = 0 . 9 3 7 x + 0 . 7 0 0 , r = 0 . 9 9 5 }$

The results of the matrix comparison study support the sponsor claims that all the tube types tested above are acceptable for use with the FREND Vitamin D assay.
