# 5. Device Description

The ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system is a fully automated analyzer that uses ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technology to separate glycated (labile A1c(L-A1c) and stable A1c (S-A1c)) and non-glycated (HbA0) forms of hemoglobin.

Hemoglobin A1c measurements obtained from the ADAMS A1C HA-8180V are used as an aid in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, an aid in the identification of individuals who may be at risk of developing diabetes, and for the monitoring of long-term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. The subject device consists of the ADAMS A1c HA-8180V test analytical instrument and CALIBRATOR 80, which is used to calibrate the HA-8180V. The ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system is for use in professional clinical laboratory settings.

This method is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP).

# DEVICE:

Hemoglobin test samples are prepared by automated dilution of anticoagulated whole blood in Hemolysis Washing Solution 80H. Alternately, hemolysis samples may be prepared “off-line” by manual dilution of anticoagulated whole blood with Diluent 80. The sample is then injected into the column, which contains a filter to remove sample impurities. The differing polarity and ionic charges of the released hemoglobin fractions bind with variable strength to the negatively charged stationary phase of the column. The mobile phase, consisting of three eluents of increasing ionic strength, is injected into the column. Hemoglobin fractions eluted from the column are identified and quantified using light absorption, and are measured at 420 nm and $5 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The dual wavelength colorimetric analysis of the separated peaks is processed by a microcomputer to obtain peak identification and hemoglobin fraction quantitation. All pre-analytical and analytical steps are performed automatically by the ADAMS A1c HA8180V system. Tests may be ordered in batch or for STAT measurement.

HbA1c and HbF results are reported in the presence of HbC, HbD, HbE, or HbS. A result of the detected HbC or HbS, and a peak resulting from HbD or HbE is also listed in the peak information. When a peak resulting from HbD or HbE is detected, a ‘V’ is listed in the peak information. HbA1c and HbF results are not reported when the instrument detects other peaks that affect HbA1c measurement value. The identification of any of these variants is not intended for use in diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies.

# CALIBRATOR:

Value assignment for HA-8180V HbA1c Calibrators are traceable to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference method and can be transferred to Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/NGSP values by calculation.

The Calibrator 80 consists of two levels of single-use, lyophilized calibrators. Diluent used to reconstitute the calibrators is also included. Three eluent solutions, a washing solution, and a control dilution set (used for sample dilutions and control material preparation) are also provided by ARKRAY for use on the HA-8180V system.

The candidate ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system is similar to the legally marketed predicate Tosoh G8 system in general design and assay principles, technology, performance characteristics and indications for use. The minor differences between the candidate and predicate device do not raise new issues of safety or effectiveness. The same applies to the candidate calibrator to be used with HA-8180V system and the Tosoh’s HLC-723G8 system. The performance of the ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system is substantiated in various sections throughout the submission. Therefore, we consider that the ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system is Substantially Equivalent to the predicate.

# 8. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system was evaluated based on CLSI EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. The study design included three lots and three instruments. All data was collected at ARKRAY, (a Point of Care (POC) claim is not being made), consistent with the FDA recommendations in pre-IDE I110310. EDTA whole blood samples from four donors at the approximate targeted HbA1c concentrations of ${ \sim } 5 . 0 \%$ (Patient 1), ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ (Patient 2), ${ \sim } 8 . 0 \%$ (Patient 3) and ${ \sim } 1 2 . 0 \%$ (Patient 4) were utilized in the study.

Three quality control materials were also tested. Precision was evaluated using three reagent lots and three HA-8180V HbA1c Testing Systems at one site (ARKRAY USA, Edina, MN). All samples were run in duplicate in two runs per instrument per day for 20 days. National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) results and International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) results are shown in the Table 3 – Table 10.

# 9. Linearity/Reportable Range

A linearity study was performed per CLSI EP06-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measuring Procedures; A Statistical Approach. Linearity across the reportable range was performed using controlled samples ranging from low $3 \%$ HbA1c) to high ( $1 9 \%$ HbA1c) EDTA whole blood patient samples. These samples were mixed together in varying ratios. The measured values were compared to the theoretical values based upon the dilution factor. Acceptance criteria was no more than $\pm 0 . 1 5 \%$ bias $( \mathrm { N G S P \% }$ units, not actual percentage) from the theoretical value.

The study demonstrated linearity of ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system over 3.0 to $1 9 . 0 \%$ (NGSP) and 9 to $1 8 4 \mathrm { \ m m o l / m o l }$ (IFCC) with a maximum measured difference of - $. 0 . 1 0 \%$ and - $1 . 0 9 \mathrm { m m o l / m o l }$ respectively, between the theoretical and measured value. Maximum difference between the predicted $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ order and $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order was $\pm 0 . 0 8 \%$ (NGSP) and $\pm 0 . 9 2 \mathrm { \ m m o l / m o l }$ (IFCC). This supports the claimed measurement range of 4.0 to $1 5 . 0 \%$ (20 to $1 4 0 \mathrm { m m o l / m o l } \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) HbA1c.

# Detection Limit

The claimed measurement range is 4.0 to $1 5 . 0 \%$ HbA1c based on the results from the linearity study.

10. Traceability, Stability, Expected Value (Calibrators)

# A. Traceability:

The ADAMS A1c HA-8180V test standardization is traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference calibrators. The HA-8180V HbA1c assay is also NGSP certified. The NGSP certification is re-certified by ARKRAY on an annual basis.

The derived results of $( \% )$ from the NGSP correlation are calculated from the individual quantitative results for Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The IFCC units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation:

NGSP $( \% ) = 0 . 0 9 1 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ IFCC (mmol/mol) + 2.15.

The final reportable range is traceable to both the IFCC and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP equivalent units $( \% )$ and IFCC equivalent units $\mathrm { ( m m o l / m o l ) }$ ).

# B. Calibrator Materials:

Value assignment for ADAMS A1c HA-8180V Calibrators are traceable to IFCC reference method and can be transferred to DCCT/NGSP values by calculation.

Using an ADAMS A1c HA-8180V instrument calibrated using standard material JCCRM-411 (provided by ReCCS, a primary (APRL) as well as a secondary (ASRL) reference laboratory within the NGSP Network), CALIBRATOR 80 was measured $( \mathrm { n } { = } 9 )$ over 3 days (total of $\mathtt { n } = 2 7$ ) to assign values. The mean generated over the 3 days is set as the reference value. Values are given in IFCC value system and converted to NGSP using the master equation.

# C. Stability/Shelf Life Claims:

C.1. Shelf life claims: Shelf life studies were performed with three lots of Calibrator 80 as per CLSI EP 25, Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. Based on the NGSP certification standards, acceptance criteria was defined as: relative bias in HbA1c $( \% )$ from 0 month result should be within $\pm 6 \%$ bias at 18 months, when the un-opened calibrators were stored between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The study results confirmed that the acceptance criteria was met. This supports the recommendation that un-opened calibrators can be stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until expiration date or for 18 months.

C.2 Open-Vial Stability: The open-vial stability studies were performed with two lots of Calibrator 80 as per CLSI EP 25, Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. Based on the NGSP certification standards, acceptance criteria was defined as: relative bias in HbA1c $( \% )$ should be within $\pm 6 \%$ for measurement at 0 and 8 hours.

The study resultsconfirmed that the acceptance criteria was met. This supports the recommended open vial stability claim of 8 hours when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . On-board stability for the Calibrator 80 pack is not evaluated as the calibrators are intended for single use only.

# 11. Analytical Specificity:

# A. Interferences Study

An Interference study was performed per CLSI EP07-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. The study assessed common or known endogenous substances, drugs and hemoglobin derivatives that could interfere with ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system. Whole blood samples with HbA1c values of ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ and ${ \sim } 8 . 0 \%$ were analyzed by spiking the interfering substance into each of the two whole blood samples as shown in Table 28 and Table 29. Ten replicates of each drug prepared with the test and control samples were analyzed using ADAMS A1c HA-8180V system.

Significant interference was defined as a more than $\pm 7 . 0 \%$ change in $\%$ HbA1c value from the control. No significant interference was observed at therapeutic levels up to the stated highest concentrations as summarized below.

# B. Hemoglobin Variant Study:

A hemoglobin variant interference study was performed using a total of 165 samples known to contain Hemoglobin variants A2, C, D, E, F, or S. At least, 10 samples were tested around each of the two HbA1c concentrations of ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ and ${ \sim } 8 . 0 \%$ . Testing of the samples containing the Hemoglobin variants A2, C, D, E, F, or S was performed at least in duplicate. Testing was performed on the HA-8180V system and compared to results obtained by a reference method that has been demonstrated to be free from the hemoglobin interference being tested. Table 20 shows the samples that were measured.

# Total Error Near the Cutoff

Using the results of bias estimation $( \% \mathrm { B i a s } )$ in the method comparison study and precision estimated in the reproducibility study, Total Error (TE) at four concentrations $( 5 . 0 \%$ , $6 . 5 \%$ , $8 . 0 \%$ and $1 2 . 0 \%$ ) were calculated as follows: $\begin{array} { r } { \% \mathrm { { J 6 T E } = 1 \% 0 } b i a s \vert + 1 . 9 6 * \% C V * ( 1 + \frac { \% b i a s } { 1 0 0 } ) } \end{array}$ %???????????????? ). The study results, as summarized in Table 28 and Table 29 demonstrated that the Total Error was $6 \%$ .

# B. Matrix Comparison:

A matrix study was performed to determine the suitability of $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA, anticoagulants used with fresh whole blood for use with the ADAMS A1c HA8180V system. Specimens with concentration values spanning 4.7 to $1 5 . 7 \%$ HbA1c were collected from a total of 40 different donors.

$\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA was the reference anticoagulant and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA was the test anticoagulant. Following regression results were obtained:

# $\mathbf { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA whole blood vs $\mathbf { K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA: $\mathbf { y } = \mathbf { 1 . 0 0 5 x } - \mathbf { 0 . 0 4 7 } ; \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = \mathbf { 1 . 0 0 0 }$

The labeling lists $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA as the acceptable anticoagulants.

# CONCLUSION:

The information and data in this $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ notification demonstrates that the ADAMS A1c HA8180V System is an accurate, reliable, precise test that correlates well with currently cleared methods and NGSP standardized testing for the quantitation of HbA1c.

The contents of this notification demonstrate that the ADAMS A1c HA-8180V System performance is substantially equivalent to its predicate device. The performance criteria as stipulated by the Special Controls requirements for HbA1c systems that diagnose diabetes have been met.
