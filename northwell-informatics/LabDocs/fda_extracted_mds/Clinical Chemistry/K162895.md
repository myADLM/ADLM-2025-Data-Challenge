# Troponin T value at intermediate precision of $\mathbf { C V } = 1 0 \%$

In addition, we report the value where a CV of $\pm 1 0 \%$ can be achieved in our product insert. This was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.

The accuracy goal was defined as intermediate precision equal to a CV of $10 \%$ , using the CLSI EP5-A2 20 day protocol to estimate intermediate precision. Ten Li-Heparin plasma pools were prepared across the low-end of the measuring range of the assay. Data were collected with two lots over 21 days, two runs per day with two replicates per run. Estimates of mean and intermediate precision were calculated for each sample.

The functional relationship between CV and concentration is modeled according to the suggestion in EP17 as:

# $\% C V = \mathrm { A } ^ { * }$ concentration B

To simplify the fit of the data, the CV and the mean are log-transformed. “Log” here refers to the natural logarithm. After log-transformation a linear regression using least squares can be performed and the model looks like this:

# log(%%CV)  A+ B• log(eoncentratton)

# With

Results are visually assessed and the goodness of fit of the data is evaluated.

# LoQ

# LoQ/Functional Sensitivity

# Methods:

LoQ of the Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay was determined according to CLSI EP17- A2.

LoQ is defined as the lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively established with stated accuracy and stated experimental conditions. The LoQ was set as the lowest concentration of analyte which can be quantified with a CV (intermediate precision) of no more than $20 \%$ .

# Limit of Quantitation as Functional Sensitivity:

Functional sensitivity has been used as a detection capability performance attribute for the TnTGen5 Assay. It represents the measurand concentration associated with a desired within-lab (intermediate) precision, based upon a precision profile experiment in the low-end region of the measuring interval. This performance attribute however, simply represents a limiting form of the limit of quantitation (LoQ) in which the acceptable accuracy goal is based solely upon a precision requirement. This is suggested by CLSI EP5-A2 for troponin.

The accuracy goal was defined as intermediate precision equal to $20 \%$ CV, using the CLSI EP5-A2 20 day protocol to estimate intermediate precision.

Ten Li-Heparin plasma pools were prepared across the low-end region of the measuring interval and in addition two controls were included. Data were collected with two lots over 21 days, two runs per day with two replicates per run. Estimates of the mean and intermediate precision were calculated for each sample for each reagent lot.

Total CV is based on the total variance, calculated as the sum of the variance components from day, run and within run $2 1 ^ { * } 2 ^ { * } 2 = 8 4$ measurements). The square root from the total variance divided by the grand mean times 100 is the results for the total CV $[ \% ]$ . The calculation of the variance components is based on a strict hierarchical model with random factors according CLSI EP5-A2.

The functional relationship between CV and concentration is modeled according to the suggestion in EP17 as:

$\% C V = \mathrm { A } ^ { * }$ concentration B

To simplify the fit of the data, the CV and the mean are log-transformed. “Log” here refers to the natural logarithm. After log-transformation a linear regression using least squares can be performed and the model looks like this:

Results are visually assessed and the goodness of fit of the data is evaluated.

The concentration where $20 \%$ CV is achieved is calculated by:

$$
= \exp ( \frac { \log ( 2 0 ) - A } { B } )
$$

Specification: $20 \%$ CV (intermediate precision) at $\leq 6 \mathrm { n g / L }$

# Results:

For visual illustration the graphs below show the relationship between the total CV (log transformed) and concentration (log transformed).

LoQ was determined to be $5 . 5 \mathrm { n g / L }$ on cobas e 411 and $2 . 5 \mathrm { n g / L }$ on the cobas e 601 analyzer and meets the specification. LoQ for the assay will be labeled as $6 \mathrm { n g / L }$ .

# Linearity

# Methods:

The linearity of the Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer by diluting one high analyte plasma sample (spiked with recombinant TnT) with native low analyte plasma. 21 concentrations (19 dilutions) throughout the measuring range were prepared. The dilutions were measured in three-fold determination within a single run using one lot.

In the first step, a linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression analysis and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic). Data were analyzed using linear, quadratic and cubic order least square regression analysis according to CLSI protocol EP6-A:

$\mathtt { y } = \mathtt { a } + \mathtt { b } \mathtt { 1 } \ast \mathtt { x }$ (first order polynomial or linear fit) $\ y = { \mathrm { a } } + { \mathrm { b } } 1 * { \mathrm { x } } + { \mathrm { b } } 2 * { \mathrm { x } } ^ { 2 }$ (second order polynomial fit [quadratic]) $\ y = \mathtt { a } + \mathtt { b } 1 * \mathtt { x } + \mathtt { b } 2 * \mathtt { x } ^ { 2 } + \mathtt { b } 3 * \mathtt { x } ^ { 3 }$ (third order polynomial fit[cubic])

# Results:

The nonlinear coefficient b2 in the second order model (polynomial fit [quadratic]) is significant at the $5 \%$ level. Therefore it is used for the calculation of deviation from linearity. For cobas e 411, the test results did not deviate from linearity by more than $6 . 3 \%$ . For cobas e 601, the test results did not deviate from linearity by more than $12 . 4 \%$ .

Linearity was confirmed in the overall range from $3 . 1 9 \mathrm { n g / L }$ to $1 0 , 4 3 9 \mathrm { n g / L }$ . The labeled measuring range is $6 - 1 0 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / L }$ .

# High Dose Hook Effect

# Methods:

The high dose hook effect of the Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer.

Two samples were spiked with analyte to high TnT concentrations. For each sample a dilution series was performed using a low TnT concentration Li-Hep plasma.

The hook concentration reported corresponds to the analyte concentration with a signal corresponding to at least $10 \%$ above the highest master calibrator.

# Results:

No hook effect was seen up to $1 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / L }$

# Endogenous Interferences

# Methods:

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances using the Troponin T Gen 5 STAT was determined on the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzers for the following 7 interfering substances, Intralipid, biotin, bilirubin, hemoglobin, rheumatoid factors, cholesterol and human serum albumin using three native or spiked (for Bilirubin and Lipemia interference) plasma samples (one low, one medium, and one high concentration of Troponin T) to prepare dilution series that were tested with one reagent lot.

# Results:

Recoveries of samples containing interferents were within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the values measured in samples not containing interferents.

# HAMA Interference

The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse-antibodies on the TnT Gen 5 STAT assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 analyzers. Samples with three different levels of TnT were spiked with potential interfering HAMA and tested in duplicate. The HAMA serum used for the interference testing has been tested in an external laboratory with a commercial assay yielding a HAMA concentration of $8 0 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ .

# Results:

Interference of approximately $10 \%$ was seen with HAMA concentrations $\geq 3 2 2 \mu \mathrm { g / L }$

# Analytical Specificity/Cross Reactivity

# Methods:

The analytical specificity of the Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 analyzers using three concentrations of troponin in plasma samples spiked with the potential cross-reacting compounds listed below. The spiked and non-spiked samples were tested in singlicate on cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 analyzer.

Note: Human cardiac and skeletal TNC are identical proteins.

# Results:

Recoveries of samples containing the potential cross-reactants were within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the values measured in samples not containing cross-reactants.

# Exogenous Interference Drugs

# Methods:

16 common pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into plasma samples. The analyte concentrations were approximately 15 to $9 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The drug concentrations tested are according to the recommendation (if available) given in the CLSI guideline EP7-A. When concentrations are not given in the guideline, we used at least 3-times the maximum recommended dosage.

In addition 18 cardiac drugs were assessed by spiking into human plasma samples.   
The analyte concentrations were approximately 15 and $1 9 0 0 \mathrm { n g / L }$ .

Plasma samples were divided into aliquots and spiked with the potential interferents. The reference sample without interferent was spiked with the respective amount of solvent only.

Testing was performed in 3-fold determination with one reagent lot in one run on one cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 analyzer.

# Sample Stability

# Methods:

The sample stability was performed in two different studies: Study 1. Sample stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Study 2. Sample stability at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \left( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$

Study 1 - Sample stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Nine samples of Li-Heparin Plasma were aliquoted and measured fresh and after storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 9 and 25 hours. Measurements were performed with threefold determination on the cobas e 601 analyzer and recovery was calculated.

Study 2 - Sample stability at ${ } - 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ :

Ten samples of Li-Heparin Plasma were aliquoted and measured fresh and after storage at - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 13 months. Measurements were performed with threefold determination on the cobas e 601 analyzer and recovery was calculated.

# Results:

All stressed samples recovered within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of fresh samples.

The following information will be provided in the method sheet: Stable for 24 hours at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 12 months at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Freeze only once.

# Calibration Stability

# Methods:

The calibration stability on the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer for the Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay was determined by reading the recovery of controls and plasma samples of a day 1 calibration curve.

# Onboard Calibration Frequency- Study 1:

Calibration is recommended every 7 days if kit is not consumed.   
Three plasma samples and two control levels were tested with reagents opened on day 1 and kept at $2 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (on board) between test points. Each sample was tested with two-fold determination.

# Lot calibration - Study 2:

Calibration is recommended every 12 weeks with the same reagent lot if the reagent pack is consumed within 7 days. Three human plasma samples and two control levels were tested with fresh reagents kits of the same lot after up to 13 weeks. Each sample was tested with two-fold determination.

# Troponin T Gen 5 STAT Clinical Performance

# Expected Values: Healthy Reference Cohort

A total of 1301 healthy subjects (656 females, 645 males), were enrolled and included in the testing for determining the 99th percentile upper reference limit of a normal US population (age range 21 to 89 years) using the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay, in lithium heparin samples on both the cobas e 411 and the cobas e 601 analyzers. The 99th percentile upper reference limits were determined to be:

▪ $1 9 \mathrm { n g / L }$ for both genders $( \mathtt { n } = 1 3 0 1 $ ) ▪ $1 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / L } }$ for females $( \mathtt { n } = 6 5 6 )$ ) ▪ $2 2 { \mathrm { n g / L } }$ for males $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } = 6 4 5$ )

The Universal Definition of AMI takes into consideration the ESC/ACC/AHA/WHF definition. These guidelines recommend the detection of at least one value above the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile and a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin in the clinical setting of acute myocardial ischemia.

# Diagnostic Sensitivity and Specificity

# APACE Population

The Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndromes Evaluation (APACE) study is an international, multicentric prospective trial of acute chest pain patients that is currently continuing enrollment (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00470587.6). The study sites enrolled all patients who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and angina pectoris. Peak of symptoms had to have occurred within the last 12 hours (onset of symptoms reported ranged from 0 to 72 hours). The only exclusion criterion was kidney failure that required dialysis. Diagnosis of MI was done through an independent adjudication committee which included cardiologists. This included 60 day follow-up information on each subject. In the case of a disagreement, a third independent cardiologist was used as the tie breaker. The subjects were diagnosed with acute MI by using the diagnostic criteria described in the ACC/ESC/AHA guidelines reference including ECG changes, symptoms characteristic for ischemia and elevations of cardiac troponin. All 718 subjects had a baseline test result. Five hundred fifteen (515) of the 718 subjects had a second test result at the 3 hour time point and 310 (of the 718) subjects had a test result at the 6 hour time point.

# Results:

The clinical performance (clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) of the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay in the diagnosis of MI in this trial is shown below using a single 99th percentile cutoff 19 $\mathrm { n g / L }$ for all patients:

The positive predictive value for females using the lower sex-specific cutoff (14 ${ \bf n } { \bf g } / { \bf L } )$ ) is lower when compared to the higher cutoff of $1 9 \mathrm { n g / L }$ . When looking at the lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI, up to $69 \%$ , $82 \%$ and $78 \%$ of positive test results for females are non-MI. Troponin results should always be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms.

These observations underline the Universal AMI guideline requirements to use troponin results always in conjunction with at least one of the following criteria: symptoms of ischemia, ECG changes (ST and/or Q wave), left bundle branch block, imaging evidence of viable myocardium loss, wall motion abnormality or intracoronary thrombus to clarify the origin of myocardial injury.

In a second multicenter study, a total of 1679 subjects presenting emergently with chest pain were enrolled. The trial excluded chest pain subjects with an MI within the last 3 months, subjects with surgery or hospitalization within the last 3 months, subjects with revascularization or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within the last 3 months, subjects with an established acute non-cardiac primary illness and subjects transferred from another hospital or facility. These excluded subjects could be expected to have elevated troponin concentrations that would likely reflect cardiac comorbidities besides MI, and yield positive results; therefore, the specificity and positive predictive value may be overestimated. Within this population, there were 173 adjudicated MIs. 1679 of these subjects were evaluated on the cobas e 411 analyzer and 1675 subjects were evaluated on the cobas e 601 analyzer. Final diagnoses were determined by an independent adjudication committee which included cardiologists and emergency medicine physicians using the universal guidelines.

The positive predictive value for females using the lower sex-specific cutoff (14 ${ \bf n } { \bf g } / { \bf L } )$ ) is lower when compared to the higher cutoff of $1 9 \mathrm { n g / L }$ . When looking at the lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI, up to $69 \%$ , $82 \%$ and $78 \%$ of positive test results for females are non-MI. Troponin results should always be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms.

These observations underline the Universal AMI guideline requirements to use troponin results always in conjunction with at least one of the following criteria: symptoms of ischemia, ECG changes (ST and/or Q wave), left bundle branch block, imaging evidence of viable myocardium loss, wall motion abnormality or intracoronary thrombus to clarify the origin of myocardial injury.

# CalSet Stability

# Methods:

The stability for the Elecsys Troponin T CalSet was determined by calculating the recovery of stressed calibrators compared to unstressed/freshly reconstituted calibrators.

# Study 1: Combined On Board Stability/ Stability after reconstitution:

Stability of reconstituted Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT CalSet onboard is claimed to be up to 5 hours at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ within two weeks after reconstitution when stored at 2 – $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

CalSets were reconstituted and kept at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for three weeks. During this time period the opened calibrators were incubated at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $( \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for a total of 6 hours.

# Study 2: Stability at - $\bf { 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ $\mathbf { ( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } C ) }$

Stability of Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT CalSet at ${ } - 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ is claimed to be 3 months. Calibrators should be frozen for one time only and also be used only once after thawing.

CalSets were reconstituted and stored at ${ } - 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for four months.

The TnT concentration of six human plasma samples and two controls was determined using the calibration curve generated by the stressed calibrators and compared to the TnT concentration determined by using the calibration curve generated by the freshly reconstituted calibrators (reference).

# Acceptance criteria:

Concentrations of $< 1 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / L }$ : Recovery $\pm 1 . 4 \mathrm { n g / L }$ Concentrations of $\geq 1 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / L }$ : Recovery $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$

# Results:

On board stability for the CalSet on the cobas e 411 analyzer ( $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ was determined to be up to 5 hours. For the CalSet on the cobas e 601 analyzers, the labeling states to use only once. CalSets stored at ${ } - 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ are stable for three months.

# CalSet Real-Time Stability

# Methods:

Real-time stability of Troponin T Gen 5 STAT CalSet was evaluated as follows:

In the real-time stability study, the Troponin T Gen 5 STAT CalSet material was stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stored assay reagents were tested at time point $\mathrm { t } = 0$ and at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device up to the planned shelf life plus one month. Testing was performed using PreciControl Troponin 1 and PreciControl Troponin 2 as well as of internal manufactured control samples.

Data for the time-points tested are available in duplicate. The average on-test recovery value was calculated as the percent recovery compared to the reference value (assigned value of PreciControl Troponin 1 and PreciControl Troponin 2 and assigned value of internal manufactured control samples).

# PreciControl In-Use Stability

# Methods:

The stability for the PreciControl Troponin was determined by calculating the recovery based on the use of stressed PreciControl Troponin 1 and 2 compared to unstressed freshly reconstituted PreciControl Troponin 1 and 2.

Study 1 - Combined in-use stability: On board stability and stability of reconstituted PreciControl Troponin at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Stability of reconstituted PC Troponin onboard is claimed to be up to 5 hours at $2 0 -$ $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and is claimed to be 4 days when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

PreciControl 1 and 2 were reconstituted and kept at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $9 7 \mathrm { h }$ . During this time period the opened controls were incubated at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $( \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for a total of 6 hours ( $_ { 6 \mathrm { ~ X ~ } }$ 1hour).

Study 2 - Stability of reconstituted PreciControls stored at - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$

PC Troponin 1 and 2 were reconstituted and stored at ${ } - 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 94 days.

# Acceptance criteria:

Concentrations of $< 1 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / L }$ : Recovery $\pm 1 . 4 \mathrm { n g / L }$ Concentrations o $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { f } \geq 1 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / L }$ : Recovery $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$

# Results:

# Troponin T Gen 5 CalCheck 5 Stability

# Methods:

Open vial stability was performed on the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 in order to verify the claims for the Troponin T Gen 5 CalCheck 5.

Study 1 - Open-Vial Stability

The on-test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The on-test material was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (in an open vial). The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The on-test recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference value.

One Troponin T Gen 5 CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate.

# Acceptance criteria:

CalCheck Level $1 \mathrm { : } \leq 6 \mathrm { n g / L }$ CalCheck Level 2-5: recovery of $90 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of the reference value.

# Results:

The data support the package insert claim that reconstituted Troponin T Gen 5 CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The CalCheck products are not stored on-board the analyzers, therefore no on-board stability claims are made.

Study 2 - Real-time stability

In the real-time stability study, the Troponin T Gen 5 CalCheck 5 test material is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The CalChecks are tested at $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ and at intervals over the shelf life of the device up to the planned shelf life plus at least one month. The target shelf life claim for the Troponin T Gen 5 CalCheck 5 is 18 months.

For the lot on stability, data for the time-points 0, 13, 19, 25 and 37 months tested in duplicate will be available. The average on-test recovery value will be calculated as percent recovery compared to the $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ reference value.

# Acceptance criteria:
