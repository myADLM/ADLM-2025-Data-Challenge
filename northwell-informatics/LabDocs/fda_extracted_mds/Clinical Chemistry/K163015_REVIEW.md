K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced: Not applicable

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The mean values and corresponding $\pm 3$ standard deviation ranges in the Assignment of Values Data Charts were derived from replicate analyses by different clinical laboratories using Bio-Rad’s protocol or by manufacturers’ using their own value assignment protocols; each value is specific for this lot of product and clinical analyzer. The tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of this lot of product. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own acceptable ranges and use those provided only as guides.

# Stability Studies:

Real-time stability studies were performed to establish thawed stability claims. Thawed and open-vial stability when stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is as follows: IGF-1 is 15 days, CA 125 is 10 days, and all other analytes are 30 days.

Thawed and unopened-vial stability when stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is as follows: IGF-1 is 35 days, free PSA is 30 days, CA 125 is 14 days, and all other analytes are 60 days.

Frozen aliquot stability is 30 days when stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for all analytes.

Accelerated stability studies were performed for establishing the shelf life claim of 28 months from the date of manufacture when stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real time studies are ongoing, and support 10 months stability at this writing.

Shelf-life and open-vial stability studies protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
