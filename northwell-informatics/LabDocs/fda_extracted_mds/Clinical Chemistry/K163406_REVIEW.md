# L. Test Principle:

Mission Cholesterol and Mission Cholesterol Pro Meter:   
The Mission Cholesterol/Mission Cholesterol Pro Meter consists of a reflectance photometer that measures the intensity of light reflected from the reagent area of a test strip. The meter reads the Test Cartridges along with the lot-specific code chip.

Test Cartridge:

The Mission Cholesterol/Mission Cholesterol Pro Test Cartridge is a lipid panel test device used to measure concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in whole blood. The cartridge is a plastic housing into which multilayers of dry reagents are applied . The test cartridge contains three distinct and separated reagent areas for total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides. After whole blood is applied into the test cartridge, blood cells are separated by a glass fiber layer and a membrane. The plasma then enters the color membrane layer and the analytes in the plasma react with the enzymes to affect a color change. The color change is measured as a reflectance by the meter.

Total cholesterol:

Trinder reaction - Cholesterol esterase hydrolyzes cholesterol esters to free cholesterol and fatty acids. The free cholesterol is oxidized to cholesten-3-one and hydrogen peroxide by cholesterol oxidase. Peroxidase catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with 4- aminoantipyrine and phenol to produce a colored quinoneimine product.

# HDL:

The dextran sulphate $/ \mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ on the test device precipitates the chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL, leaving HDL in the sample. The HDL cholesterol concentration is then determined enzymatically by the Trinder reaction.

Triglycerides:

Triglycerides in the sample are hydrolyzed to glycerol and free fatty acids by the action of lipase. A sequence of three coupled enzymatic steps using glycerol kinase, glycerophosphate

oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase causes the oxidative coupling of 4-aminoantipyrine to form a blue dye.

Calculated LDL:

When the concentration of triglycerides in the specimen is $\leq 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the LDL concentration is calculated by the Friedewald equation:

LDL cholesterol, $\mathrm { { m g / d L } = }$ total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - triglycerides/5

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical performance:

The analytical performance studies were conducted using with the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System. The meters are identical and the only differences between the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System and Mission Cholesterol Pro Monitoring System are the intended use with associated sample types and labeling.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three separate point-of-care (POC) studies were performed to evaluate the precision of the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System.

# #1 Precision using whole blood samples

A precision study was performed at three POC sites using freshly collected lithium heparin venous whole blood samples. In order to cover the analytical measurement range, whole blood samples with three concentration levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were tested.

To minimize the effects of whole blood aging on the results, all samples were tested within 4 hours from preparation. Each POC site used the same whole blood sample as three aliquots from the same stock were taken to the three sites.

At each POC site, 3 operators performed the study. Each operator used a different lot of cartridges; three lots per site. The same three lots were used at all three sites. Each operator used 2 different meters to conduct a run of 25 replicates with each meter; total of 3 operators x 2 meters x 25 replicates per meter $= 1 5 0$ measurements per level per site, and 450 measurements per level across all sites. Each operator tested all three concentration levels.

Total precision represents the sum of all variabilities; the variance of total precision was calculated by taking the sum of the between-site, between-operator, between-lot, between-meter, and repeatability variances. The data was analyzed by ANOVA and the results are summarized below:

# #2 Precision using control materials

A second precision study was performed at three POC sites using control material. At each clinical site, 2 operators performed the study with 1 meter, 1 run of two replicates for each operator per day, over a total of 20 days for a total of 240 replicates per level across the sites. Each site used a different lot of test cartridges. The control material was from one lot and common to all three sites.

The precision study was designed as a three factorial design with site/lot/meter, operator/run, and day as the factors of interest. Total precision represents the sum of all of these variabilities. The data was analyzed by ANOVA and the results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted on the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System in accordance to CLSI EP6-A.

To challenge the analytical measuring range for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides a linear dilution series of 9 levels was prepared from a high and a low sample pool. A high sample pool was prepared by spiking each analyte into a lithium heparin whole blood sample. The low pool was a native lithium heparin whole blood sample. Each sample of the dilution series was tested in replicates of 10 on each of three lots of test cartridges for a total of $\mathrm { n } { = } 3 0$ measurements at each level.

Linearity was assessed by a polynomial evaluation of linearity. For total cholesterol, regression analysis found statistically significant coefficients for second order and third order polynomial fits which indicated possible non-linearity. The degree of nonlinearity was further assessed by comparing the deviation of the second order and third order polynomial regression lines from linearity. At each level, the deviation from linearity by either the second order and third order polynomial was $\leq 2 \%$ .

For HDL cholesterol, regression analysis found a statistically significant coefficient for a third order polynomial fit which indicated possible non-linearity. The degree of nonlinearity was further assessed by comparing the deviation of the regression line for the third order polynomial from linearity. At each level, the deviation from linearity was $\leq 1 \%$ .

For triglycerides, regression analysis found statistically significant coefficients for a second order and third order polynomial fit which indicated possible non-linearity. The degree of nonlinearity was further assessed by comparing the deviation of the second order and third order polynomial regression lines from linearity. At each level, the deviation from linearity by either the second order and third order polynomial was $\leq 5 \%$ .

The linear regression results are given in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R{2$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tested Range,mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Totalcholesterol</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.005</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.12</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9989</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>~ 100 to 500</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HDLcholesterol</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.039</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9985</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>~ 15 to 115</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.007</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.46</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9993</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>~ 45 to 695</td></tr></table>

Based on these results, the sponsor concluded that the linearity data supported the claimed analytical measurement range for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides:

100 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for total cholesterol · 15 to $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for HDL cholesterol 45 to $6 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for triglycerides

Readings outside of reportable range:

Bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides measurement was less than the lower end of the analytical measurement range, a $^ { \mathfrak { c } } < ^ { \mathfrak { s } }$ indicator is displayed preceding the lower limit; e.g. ${ < } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for total cholesterol. If a measurement exceeded the upper end of the analytical measurement range a ${ \bf \bar { \Psi } } > { \bf \bar { \Psi } }$ indicator is displayed preceding the upper limit; e.g. ${ \scriptstyle > 4 0 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for total cholesterol.

# LDL cholesterol

The LDL cholesterol concentration is derived by calculation using the Friedewald equation. Software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that the reported LDL concentration is calculated according to the Friedewald equation when the triglycerides concentration is $\leq 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if the triglycerides concentration is $> 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the LDL cholesterol result will not be calculated, and the meter will display “--”.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System is CRMLN certified for total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol using whole blood samples. The total cholesterol assay is traceable to the National Reference System for Cholesterol. The HDL cholesterol assay is traceable to the National Cholesterol Education Program. The accuracy and precision performance in lithium heparin venous whole blood met the NCEP’s performance criteria. The triglyceride assay is traceable to NIST certified reference material 1951c.

Test cartridge shelf life stability

The shelf life stability of the Mission Cholesterol Test Cartridges in foil pouches was assessed in a real-time stability study; test cartridges are provided in individual foil pouches. The study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable to support the product shelf life under the recommended storage conditions of $3 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ (2 to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). The sponsor can currently support a shelf life claim of 6 months.

# Test cartridge stability under shipping conditions

The Mission Cholesterol Meter and Test Cartridges were stressed under conditions to simulate the range of possible conditions experienced during actual shipping. The study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) for the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.

LoB: To estimate the LoB, the sponsor tested analyte free venous blood samples using two reagent lots and two meters. The samples were tested in replicates of 10 on each meter/lot across each of three testing days for a total of 60 replicates per lot. LoB was derived using the parametric approach, and where the value was derived from the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of a normal distribution.

LoD: To estimate the LoD, the sponsor prepared five low level venous blood samples with analyte concentrations ranging from the LoB to approximately 4 x LoB. Each samples was tested in replicates of 10 on two reagent lots each, with one meter per lot for a total of 20 replicates per level. The data was analyzed to calculate LOD using a parametric analysis recommended in the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.

LoQ: To estimate the LoQ, the sponsor prepared four venous blood samples with concentrations spanning the anticipated LoQ. The samples were tested using two lots of test cartridges and two meters. Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 on each instrument/ lot across two runs for a total of 40 replicates per sample. LOQ was derived based upon a total error goal as described in CLSI EP17-A2:

Total error goals Total cholesterol $\leq 9 \%$ HDL cholesterol $\leq 1 2 \%$ Triglycerides $\leq 1 3 \%$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing on the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2.

Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances using lithium heparin venous whole blood spiked at two concentrations of each analyte: total cholesterol 150 and $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , HDL cholesterol 35 and $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and triglycerides 150 and $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The samples were divided into two aliquots: control with no added interferent and test with added interferent. Each sample was measured in five replicates using five meters and three test cartridge lots.

The sponsor defined no significant interference according to the following for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides:

Average Bias vs. Actual Level $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ Individual Bias vs. Actual Level $\leq \pm 1 5 \%$

To address potential interference from bilirubin and uric acid, the labeling contains the following statements:

High concentrations of uric acid $( \geq 1 2 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } } )$ can lead to falsely low measurements for the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. High concentrations of bilirubin $( \ge 1 5 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ can lead to falsely low measurements for the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

POC method comparison studies were performed to establish the accuracy performance of the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System at three POC sites. The study data was analyzed in accordance with CLSI EP09-A2. A total of 369 patients were recruited for the study at three physician office laboratory sites located in different geographical locations. Participants included male and female adults, aged 18 years or older, across diverse ethnicities, educations, and occupations in the US.

The accuracy assessment for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides comprised a comparison of an FDA cleared comparator method using plasma samples to the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System using samples of: (1) fingertip

capillary collection by the lay user, (2) fingertip capillary collection by the professional, and (3) venous draw into lithium heparin collection tube by the professional. No contrived or altered samples were tested in this clinical POC study. The comparator methods used lithium heparin plasma samples from the same venous draw.

Capillary collection and self testing

For self-testing, the lay user followed the OTC product labeling and performed the test with their capillary fingertip blood using the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System.

Capillary collection and testing by professional   
For each participant following their self collection/testing, a medical professional performed the test with the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System from a second fingertip puncture.

Venous draw and testing by professional

For each participant, a venous draw was collected by a phlebotomy professional. A medical professional then mixed by inversion the collection tube, and used the transfer tube to collect $3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ venous blood from the collection tube, and dispense blood to the Mission Cholesterol test cartridge. A total of three different operators per site conducted the test. The plasma from the venous collection was stored at - $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and sent to a clinical laboratory to run on the comparator method.

The results of the method comparison studies are summarized as follows.

3. Specimen Identification: There is no sample identification by this device.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

For capillary specimens, following a lancing procedure, the user applies a drop $( 3 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } )$ of fingerstick whole blood to the specimen application area of the test cartridge using the capillary transfer tube.

For venous specimens, the user draws $3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ venous whole blood from collection tube using the capillary transfer tube and dispense to the specimen application area of the test cartridge.

# 5. Calibration:

The Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System and Mission Cholesterol Pro Monitoring System are factory calibrated and not user adjustable. Calibration information for the test cartridges is stored in the code chip, which is provided with each lot of test cartridges and is required to run the test. The meter reads the code chip automatically when inserted into the meter. The concentrations of CHOL, HDL and TRIG based on a standard curve is programmed into the code chip.

# 6. Quality Control:

The Mission Cholesterol and Mission Cholesterol Pro Monitoring Systems include two levels of control solutions with known concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

The Mission Cholesterol and Mission Cholesterol Pro Monitoring System also include an optical verifier that checks the proper operation of the meter’s optical detection system.

The effect of hematocrit was evaluated with two samples of lithium heparin venous whole blood with total cholesterol at 150 and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m d / d L }$ , HDL at 35 and $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and triglycerides at 150 and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The hematocrit of each sample was adjusted to $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $42 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , and $60 \%$ . Each sample was tested in 10 replicates with each of three lots of the test cartridges $\mathrm { ( n = } 3 0$ ). The $\%$ bias of each sample relative to a plasma sample of the same concentration run on the comparator method, and the average $\%$ bias at each hematocrit level relative to $42 \%$ was calculated. The bias results supported the sponsor’s claimed acceptable hematocrit range of 30 to $50 \%$ for the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System.

2. Temperature and Humidity Studies:

a. To verify the operating temperature range (15 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) of the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System, the system was tested at the following temperatures: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Lithium heparin venous whole blood samples with cholesterol at 150 and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , HDL at 30 and $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and triglycerides at 120 and 450 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested in 5 replicates on each of three cartridge lots $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 5 )$ at each of the temperatures. The results relative to the comparator method supported the sponsor’s claim that the test results are not significantly impacted by temperatures ranging from 15 to $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

b. To verify the operating humidity range (20 to $90 \%$ RH) of the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System, the system was tested at $20 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $90 \%$ RH and at room temperature $( 2 3 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Lithium heparin venous whole blood samples with cholesterol at 150 and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , HDL at 30 and $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and triglycerides at 120 and $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested in 5 replicates on each of three cartridge lots $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 5 )$ at each of humidity level. The results relative to the comparator method supported the sponsor’s claim that the test results are not significantly impacted by humidity ranging from $20 \%$ to $90 \%$ RH.

c. A study was performed to test the device at different combinations of temperature and humidity. The operating temperature range and humidity range for the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System were evaluated using 5 meters and one lot of test cartridges, and with lithium heparin venous whole blood samples at total cholesterol of 120, 200, $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , HDL cholesterol of 35, 50, $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and triglycerides 85,150, $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The following four combination temperature and humidity extreme conditions were evaluated:

$1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $( 5 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and $20 \%$ RH $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $( 5 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ )and $90 \%$ RH $4 0 \%$ ( $\mathrm { 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } F ) }$ and $20 \%$ RH $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \left( 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } \right)$ and $90 \%$ RH

The results support the claimed operating temperature range of $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $( 5 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ to $4 0 \%$ $( 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and operating relative humidity range of 20 to $90 \%$ .

d. Validation studies were provided to demonstrate that when the ambient room temperature is below $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ or higher than $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , the meter will display “LO.t” or “HI.t”, and is disabled so to not conduct a measurement.

3. Sample Volume Study:

A sample volume study was conducted on the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System to verify the robustness of the system to variations in the intended $3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ sample volume applied to the cartridge using capillary transfer tube. A lithium heparin venous whole blood sample was spiked to a total cholesterol of $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , HDL cholesterol of 50 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and triglycerides of $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , as measured by the comparator methods. The

effect of different sample volumes (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) on the accuracy performance of the device was measured on the sample in replicates of 5 on each of three lots of test cartridges and using 5 meters. The bias results relative to the comparator method supported the claims that the device performance is not impacted by sample volumes ranging from $2 5 \mathrm { - } 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

An additional study was conducted to verify that when the sample volume applied to the cartridge is insufficient to return an accurate result the meter displays an “E- $. 5 ^ { , }$ error due to insufficient sample volume.

4. Infection Control Studies:

The virucidal disinfection efficacy for the Mission Cholesterol Meter was established in k122553 using the Mission Plus Hb Meter.

Disinfection robustness testing on the Mission Cholesterol Monitoring System was performed using Oxivir $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ TB wipes for 10,950 cleaning and 10,950 disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of device use cycles (10 tests/disinfection per day, 365 working days per year for 3 year, 10 $\textrm { x } 3 6 5 \textrm { x } 3 = 1 0 9 5 0 $ . After 10950 cycles of disinfection, the meter exterior was found to be unchanged in appearance, the meter passed a basic functional test, and a performance evaluation found no significant change in %bias relative to a comparator method using spiked lithium heparin venous whole blood samples. The labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the cleaning and disinfection procedures.
