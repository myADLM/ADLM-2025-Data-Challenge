# L. Test Principle:

The AQT90 FLEX is a cartridge-based immunoassay analyzer, based on time-resolved fluorescence using a europium (Eu) chelate as the fluorescent label. The test receptacles for the assay are test cups, which contain the antibodies used for capture of the analyte, and the Eu chelate labeled antibodies used to trace the captured analyte. The sample is added to the test cup together with assay buffer. The cup is then incubated to allow formation of the immuno-complex, and subsequently washed to remove unbound antibodies and sample material. Finally, the cup is exposed to excitation light, and after a delay the emitted light generated by the fluorescent label is measured by single photon counting. The total count is then compared to an assay calibration curve to obtain a quantitative measurement of the analyte’s concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were conducted for both the Myo Test Kit and the CKMB Test Kit using whole blood and plasma samples on the AQT90 FLEX system according to CLSI guideline EP6-A.

1. Myo Test Kit :

A linearity study was performed with lithium heparin whole blood and lithium heparin plasma samples. A linearity series with a total of 11 sample levels were prepared by serially diluting a high concentration sample with a low concentration sample. The samples were measured in replicates of ten using one MyoTest Kit lot and one analyzer during one day. The measured mean myoglobin concentrations for each sample type were as follows:

Whole blood: 12.9, 15.6, 34.0, 70.8, 144.4, 275.9, 467.2, 682.4, 897.5, 1148.6, and $1 2 0 8 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

Plasma: 15.4, 17.2, 31.4, 59.2, 116.5, 224.4, 375.9, 550.5, 738.5, 1045.8, and $1 0 5 2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

The second order fit was significant for whole blood, and the third order fit was significant for plasma. The non-linearity degree $( \% )$ was calculated to evaluate linearity. The results showed that the deviation from linearity did not exceed $10 \%$ for either whole blood or plasma.

The claimed measuring range for Myo is $2 0 - 9 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for whole blood and plasma.

2. CKMB Test Kit:

A linearity study was performed with lithium heparin whole blood and lithium heparin plasma samples. A linearity series with a total of 11 sample levels were prepared by serially diluting a high CKMB concentration sample with a low CKMB concentration sample. The linearity series samples were measured in replicates of 10 using one Test Kit lot and one analyzer during one day. The measured mean CKMB concentrations for each sample type were as follows:

Whole blood: 1.3, 1.7, 9.0, 15.0, 21.7, 50.4, 98.8, 177.6, 252.8, 330.4, and 331.7 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$

Plasma: 1.5, 1.8, 8.5, 13.1, 19.0, 42.5, 90.2, 158.5, 220.1, 289.3, and $2 9 1 . 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

The second and third order fits were not significant for whole blood, thus the whole blood assay was considered to be acceptably linear. The third order fit was significant for plasma, and the non-linearity degree $( \% )$ was calculated to evaluate linearity. The results showed that the deviation from linearity did not exceed $10 \%$ for plasma.

The claimed measuring range for CKMB is $1 . 5 - 3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for whole blood and plasma.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

AQT90 FLEX Myo Test Kit: The antigen material, M0725 by Scripps, was used to establish the metrological traceability chain of the AQT90 FLEX Myo assay in k112161 and remains unchanged.

AQT90 FLEX CKMB Test Kit: The antigen material, ERM-AD455/IFCC material, was used to establish the metrological traceability chain of the AQT90 FLEX CKMB assay in k120326 and remains unchanged.

# d. Detection limit:

Limits of detection studies followed the guidelines in CLSI EP17-A2. For the limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies the sponsor set the Type I and II error risks to $5 \%$ .

LoB: The LoB study was performed by measuring four blank samples with five replicates on three days using two test kit lots and two AQT90 FLEX analyzers (one lot/analyzer). The total number of measurements per test kit lot across all samples and days was 60 and a nonparametric method was used.

LoD and LoQ: The study was performed with lithium heparin whole blood and lithium heparin plasma samples. Ten samples per matrix were measured using two test kit lots and two AQT90 FLEX analyzers (one lot/analyzer). Each sample was measured in 45 replicates per lot.

The LoD was calculated using the estimated LoB and the $\mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { t o t a l } }$ of the low concentration samples.

To determine the LoQ, a power function was fit to the concentration versus $\mathrm { C V } _ { \mathrm { t o t a l } }$ plot using data from all samples. For the Myo Test Kit, the intersection of this fit and $1 0 \% \mathrm { C V _ { t o t a l } }$ was used to determine the LoQ. For the CKMB Test Kit, the intersection of this fit and the $20 \%$ $\mathrm { C V } _ { \mathrm { t o t a l } }$ was used to determine the LoQ.

The results for the Myo Test Kit are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison studies were conducted in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP09-A3. The studies were conducted in-house. One Myo Test Kit lot and one CKMB Test Kit lot were used for each method comparison study, respectively. Lithium heparin plasma samples were run in duplicate using two candidate AQT90 FLEX analyzers with modified software and modified reagent and two predicate AQT90 FLEX analyzers with unmodified software and the original reagent. The first data set of the duplicate runs was used in the regression analysis.

1. Myo Test Kit: a total of 103 native lithium heparin plasma samples were tested for the method comparison study. The results ranged from 26 to $8 9 7 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The result of the regression analysis is shown below.

Passing-Bablok regression: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 4 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 0$

2. CKMB Test Kit: a total of 107 lithium heparin plasma samples (including 5 spiked samples) were tested for the method comparison study. The results ranged from 1.5 to $2 9 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The result of the regression analysis is shown below.

Passing-Bablok regression: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 8 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 0$

b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was performed to validate the interchangeable use of four matrices when analyzing Myo and CKMB on the AQT90 FLEX system: EDTA whole blood and plasma and lithium heparin whole blood and plasma. One Myo Test Kit lot and one CKMB Test Kit lot were used in the study.

1. Myo study: A matrix comparison study was perfomed by testing a total of 127 native sample sets with myoglobin values spanning the measuring range (22 to $8 9 2 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Passing-Bablok regression analyses were performed and the results of these studies are shown below:

LiHep plasma $( \mathrm { y } ) = 0 . 9 9$ LiHep WB (x) - 1.0 $\mathrm { \Delta } ( { \mathrm { n } } = 1 2 5$ ; $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 $ ) EDTA plasma $( \mathrm { y } ) = 0 . 9 6$ EDTA WB (x) - 1.4 $\mathrm { \Delta } n { = } 1 2 5$ ; r2= 1.0) EDTA WB $( \mathrm { y } ) = 1 . 0 1$ LiHep WB $( \mathrm { x } ) + 0 . 8$ $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 2 7 ; \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 )$ . EDTA plasma $\mathrm { ( y ) = 0 . 9 9 }$ LiHep plasma $\mathrm { ( x ) } + 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { ( n } { = } 1 2 4 ; \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 )$ EDTA WB $( \mathrm { y } ) = 1 . 0 3$ LiHep plasma $\mathrm { \left( x \right) } + 1 . 6 \mathrm { \left( n = 1 \right)} 2 5 ; \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 $

2. CKMB study: A matrix comparison study was performed by testing a total of 112 sample sets (105 native and 7 spiked). The sample CKMB concentration spanned the measuring range (1.5 to $2 9 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). Passing-Bablok regression analyses were performed and the results of these studies are shown below:

LiHep plasma $( \mathrm { y } ) = 0 . 9 9$ LiHep WB $( \mathbf { x } ) + 0 . 0 1$ $( \mathrm { n } \mathrm { = } 1 0 6$ ; $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 )$ EDTA plasma $\mathrm { ( y ) = 0 . 9 9 }$ EDTA whole blood (x) - $\cdot 0 . 0 2 \ ( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 4 ; \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 )$ EDTA WB $( \mathrm { y } ) = 1 . 0 2$ LiHep WB $( { \bf x } ) + 0 . 0 1$ $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 3 ; \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 )$ EDTA plasma $( \mathrm { y } ) = 1 . 0 1$ LiHep plasma (x) - 0.04 $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 1 ; \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 )$ EDTA WB $( \mathrm { y } ) = 1 . 0 3$ LiHep plasma (x) - 0.02 $\mathrm { \Delta \ n = 1 0 4 }$ ; $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0$ )
