Dear Mr. Robert Burda:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

# F. Device Description

The Audit® MicroControls™ Linearity FD Tumor Markers II is an in-vitro diagnostic device consisting of sets of 5 levels of freeze-dried, linearity material and additives in human based serum. The product contains the following analytes: HE4 and HER2. Each set consists of 5 levels labeled Level A, B, C, D and E. Each level has a fill size of 1ml. Materials of human origin used in the manufacture of this linearity set have been tested using FDA approved methods and are found to be non-reactive for HbsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2.

# G. Value Assignment/Linearity

The mean and expected range for each method shall be presented in each lot specific insert of Audit® MicroControls™ Linearity FD Tumor Markers II. The indicated values shall be derived from analysis of vials representative of the entire lot. Analyte value assignment for Level A through Level E was performed on Siemens Centaur XP for the HER2 analyte and the Roche Cobas e411 for the HE4 analyte using the corresponding reagents. The analytes were measured multiple times. The mean value of each analyte was used to establish a target concentration value at each level. All supporting data is retained on file at Aalto Scientific, Ltd.

# H. Summary of Performance Data

Stability studies have been performed to determine the open vial stability and shelf life for the Audit® MicroControls™ Linearity FD Tumor Markers II.

Open Vial Stability: Once a vial has been opened, the product will be stable for 7 days when stored tightly capped at $\scriptstyle 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \subset$ .

# I. Expected Values

Analyte value assignment was performed for Audit® MicroControls™ Linearity FD Tumor Markers II using the corresponding reagents for HE4 and HER2. Each analyte was measured multiple times and the mean value was used to establish target concentration values at each level. The target ranges are shown below.

The expected range of the mean is provided to assist the laboratory until it has established its own mean and standard deviation. The indicated mean and expected range (target range) of the mean is provided to serve only as a guide in assessing the performance of the test method in laboratories.

Approximate target values for HE4 and HER2 are given in the table below. Lot-specific target values may differ after value assignment.
