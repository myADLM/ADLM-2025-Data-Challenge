D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The ePlex Instrument is a clinical multiplex test system that uses single-use assay cartridges that incorporate digital microfluidics and GenMark’s eSensor detection technology to automate all aspects of nucleic acid testing. The instrument system is used with specific IVD assays to measure multiple analytes. The ePlex Instrument is for in vitro diagnostic use by trained laboratory professionals in a controlled laboratory environment and is not intended for patient contact.

The ePlex Instrument includes the following components:

Base: A touchscreen graphical user interface (GUI) powered by a PC with a Windows Operating System 7. The base communicates with the bays to transfer data. The instrument software installed on the ePlex base processes the raw data generated by the individual bays and determines the test result.   
Tower: A chassis housing six bays. ePlex is scalable from one to four towers   
connected to either side of the base.   
Bay: 6 bays are housed in each tower. Each bay will accept cartridges independent of the testing status of the other bays allowing for random access testing. Each bay has an Ethernet port for communication with the base unit to receive user inputs and deliver test data to the ePlex Instrument software.

The touchscreen graphical user interface (GUI) is flanked on either side by a tower with six bays containing a slot for the cartridge and an LED to indicate bay status. The instrument is designed to be scalable with configurations to accommodate a single tower with 6 bays or up to four towers with 24 bays.

2. Principles of Operation:

Assays developed for use on this system are based on competitive nucleic acid hybridization using a sandwich assay format, wherein a single-stranded target binds concurrently to a sequence-specific solution-phase signal probe and a solid-phase electrode-bound capture probe. The test employs nucleic acid extraction, target amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription PCR (RTPCR) and hybridization of target DNA. In the process, the double-stranded PCR amplicons are digested with exonuclease to generate single-stranded DNA suitable for hybridization.

Nucleic acid extraction from biological samples occurs within the cartridge via cell lysis, nucleic acid capture onto magnetic beads, and release for amplification. The nucleic acid extraction is processed through microfluidic liquid handling. Once the nucleic acid targets are captured and inhibitors are washed away, the magnetic particles are delivered to the electrowetting environment on the printed circuit board (PCB) and the targets are eluted from the particles and amplified.

During hybridization, the single-stranded target DNA binds to a complementary, singlestranded capture probe immobilized on the working gold electrode surface. Singlestranded signal probes (labeled with electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind to specific target sequence / region adjacent to the capture probe. Simultaneous hybridization of target to signal probes and capture probe is detected by alternating current voltammetry (ACV). Each working electrode on the array contains specific capture probes, and sequential analysis of each electrode allows detection of multiple analyte targets.
