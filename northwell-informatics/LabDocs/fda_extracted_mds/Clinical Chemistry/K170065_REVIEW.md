# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Total Bilirubin_2 (TBIL_2) method is based on a chemical oxidation method using vanadate as an oxidizing agent. The bilirubin is oxidized by vanadate at about $\mathsf { p H } 2 . 9$ to produce biliverdin. In the presence of the detergent and the vanadate, both conjugated (direct) and unconjugated bilirubin are oxidized. This oxidation reaction causes the decrease in the optical density of the yellow color, which is specific to bilirubin. The decrease in optical density at $4 5 1 / 5 4 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the total bilirubin concentration in the sample. The concentration is measured as an endpoint reaction.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision for the ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Total Bilirubin_2 (TBIL_2) was previously established in k063845.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A. A high serum pool was prepared by spiking human serum with unconjugated bilirubin at a known concentration. A low serum pool was prepared by dilution of human serum with saline. Dilutions were prepared by mixing different proportions of the high and low serum pools to create nine (9) samples (0, 5, 9.9, 14.8, 19.8, 24.7, 29.6, 34.5, and $3 9 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , which spanned the assay range. Samples were assayed in triplicate and the mean result was compared to the expected values determined by the dilution scheme. Linear regression analysis of the mean observed concentration and expected values is summarized in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Calibrator, traceable to the AACC reference method (Doumas), was previously cleared in k030169.

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The LoB, LoD, and LoQ for bilirubin were determined by running replicate measurements on blank and low level analyte serum samples using three reagent lots, one calibrator lot, one system, and one operator across multiple days.

LoB was determined by running 4 blank samples in 5 replicates over 3 days (for a total of 60 replicates per lot). LoD and LoQ were determined by testing 4 low analyte samples in 20 replicates over 3 days. LoB and LoD were calculated nonparametrically. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was calculated for each reagent lot with the maximum LoQ across all reagent lots taken as the LoQ for the assay. The results are summarized in the table below.

The measuring range of the assay is $0 . 1 5 - 3 5 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and is supported by the linearity and detection limit studies.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing of ascorbic acid and triglycerides for ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry Total Bilirubin 2 (TBIL_2) was established in k063845. Interferences typically seen in neonates were evaluated according to CLSI EP7-A2 using one reagent lot and one calibrator lot.

Interference from cyanokit and 3 endogenous compounds was evaluated using native serum samples with low $( \sim 1 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and high $( { \sim } 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ bilirubin levels. Bilirubin samples were prepared by spiking a native serum pool with approximately $1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin. Test samples were prepared by spiking each drug or endogenous substance (at least five concentrations per interferent) into the low and high bilirubin samples. Test samples were assayed in triplicate and the mean concentration of bilirubin for each interferent concentration was compared to control samples containing no interferent. The sponsor defined significant interference as greater than or equal to $10 \%$ difference between the test and control samples.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP09-A3.
