# Discussion of Tests and Test Results:

To substantiate the product performance claims for UA-Cellular Complete, Streck collected product performance data for the following studies: Multi-Site Precision Study, Single-Site Precision Study, Open-Vial Stability and Closed-Vial Stability. Throughout all tests, the product was stored in accordance with the IFU at the recommended temperature of $2 \cdot 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Specific details of each test are included below:

Multi-Site Precision Study   
Two precision studies were executed for UA-Cellular complete. One for the instruments that report values for the cellular parameters and one for the qualitative and semi-quantitative instruments and methods that report values for the chemistry parameters.

# Cellular Instrument Study

This multi-site precision study was collected for the Sysmex UF1000i and Arkray AU4050. This study was conducted per EP05-A3 across 3 instruments at three different sites. A single operator was used at each site for data collection. Each site ran each lot and level of control for 5 days, 2 runs per day, and 3 replicates per run.

# Chemistry Instrument Study

This multi-site precision study was conducted utilizing the following chemistry instruments/manual methods:

Siemens CLINITEK Atlas Utilizing the CLINITEK Atlas 10 Reagent Pak Siemens Status System Line Utilizing the CLINITEK Multistix 10SG Reagent Strips Arkray AUTION HYBRID AU-4050 Utilizing the AUTION Sticks 10EA Reagent Strips Manual Reading of the Siemens Multistix 10SG Reagent Strips Manual Reading of the Siemens Clinitest hCG Pregnancy Test Cassette Manual Confirmatory Testing (Refractive Index)

instruments/sites were used. If there were more than one instrument at a site, each was physically separated and a separate operator was used.

structed to run at minimum one 10-run reproducibility study. The data received was compared to the range/concentration determined for each level.

# Single-Site Precision Study

Single site precision studies were conducted for the cellular and chemistry instruments/methods.

Cellular instrument Study

This study was combined with the Closed-Vial Stability study for both the UF-1000i and Arkray AU4050 instruments. The study was conducted per the guidelines contained in CLSI EP05-A3, Chapter 3, Single-Site Precision Evaluation Study.

This study was conducted with three separately manufactured lots of control on both the UF-1000i and Arkray AU4050. Data was collected internally at Streck. The $2 0 \times 2 \times 2$ model was followed for this study. Two vials of control were used for each testing interval. Each vial of control was run in duplicate. The study was repeated for each lot and level of control. Data was analyzed per CLSI EP05-A3 guidelines.

Chemistry Instruments/Manual Methods Study

A single-site study was also conducted for all of the instruments and manual methods for the chemistry measurands. Three separately manufactured lots of control were used for this study. Data was collected internally at Streck. The $2 0 \times 2 \times 2$ model was followed for this study. Two vials of control were used for each testing interval. Each vial of control was run in duplicate. The study was completed for each lot and level of control.

Data was collected for the following instruments:

Siemens CLINITEK Atlas Utilizing the CLINITEK Atlas 10 Reagent Pak Siemens Status System Line Utilizing the CLINITEK Multistix 10SG Reagent Strips Arkray AUTION HYBRID AU-4050 Utilizing the AUTION Sticks 10EA Reagent Strips Manual Reading of the Siemens Multistix 10SG Reagent Strips Manual Reading of the Siemens Clinitest hCG Pregnancy Test Cassette Manual Confirmatory Testing (Refractive Index)

Open-Vial Stability Study

An open-vial stability study was conducted for both the cellular and chemistry instrument methods. All studies were conducted real-time for the 30-day open-vial stability claim.

# Cellular Instrument Study

This study was conducted with three separately manufactured lots of control on the UF-1000i and Arkray systems. One vial of control per level from each lot was analyzed over the 30-day open-vial stability plus one additional time point beyond the 30-day claim. Data was collected internally with one operator. Four replicates were taken during each testing event. Throughout the collection of the open-vial stability data each vial of control was stored in accordance with the IFU. Each vial was stored between $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and removed from the refrigerator for testing. After testing, the vial was returned to the refrigerator until the next testing event

This study was conducted with three separately manufactured lots of control for each representative instrument/method. One vial of control per level from each lot was analyzed over the 30-day open-vial stability plus an additional time point beyond the stated stability claim. Day 0 is the baseline value observed on the first day of the study. The last test point was collected after the stated open-vial stability claim to ensure that the claim was fully encompassed. Four replicates were taken during each testing event.

Data was collected utilizing the following instruments:

Siemens CLINITEK Atlas Utilizing the CLINITEK Atlas 10 Reagent Pak Siemens Status System Line Utilizing the CLINITEK Multistix 10SG Reagent Strips Arkray AUTION HYBRID AU-4050 Utilizing the AUTION Sticks 10EA Reagent Strips Manual Reading of the Siemens Multistix 10SG Reagent Strips Manual Reading of the Siemens Clinitest hCG Pregnancy Test Cassette Manual Confirmatory Testing (Refractive Index)

Throughout the collection of the open-vial stability data each vial of control was stored in accordance with the IFU. Each vial was stored between $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $1 0 ^ { \circ } \textsf { C }$ and removed from the refrigerator for testing. After testing, the vial was returned to the refrigerator until the next testing event.

Data for the cellular study was determined to be acceptable if the mean of each run was within the acceptable range of control. Data for the chemistry study was considered acceptable if it was in agreement with the assigned range/concentration. All data collected fell within the acceptance criteria established for each instrument.

# Closed-Vial Stability

A closed-vial stability study was conducted for both the cellular and chemistry instrument methods. All studies were conducted real-time for the 100-day closed-vial stability claim.

# Cellular instrument study

This study was conducted with three separately manufactured lots of control on the UF-1000i and Arkray systems. Two vials of control per level from each lot was analyzed in duplicate over the 100-day closed-vial stability plus one additional time point beyond 100 days. Four data points were collected at each testing event. Data was collected internally with one operator. Each vial was stored between $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and removed from the refrigerator for testing. After testing, the vial was returned to the refrigerator until the next testing event.

# Chemistry Instrument Study

This study was conducted with three separately manufactured lots of control for each representative instrument/method. One vial of control per level from each lot was analyzed over the 100-day closed-vial stability plus an additional time point beyond the stated stability claim.
