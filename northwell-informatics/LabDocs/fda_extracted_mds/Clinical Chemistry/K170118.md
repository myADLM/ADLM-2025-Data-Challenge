2. Product Code:

LJX - Leukocyte peroxidase test JMT - Nitrite (nonquantitative) test system) KQO 3. Panel: Hematology for LJX Clinical Chemistry for JMT

# H. Intended Use:

The Scanostics UTI Check Application test system consists of the Scanostics UTI Check Application and the URS-2L (UTI) Urine Test Strips. The test system is intended for the qualitative detection of nitrite and leukocytes in urine as an aid in the screening of urinary tract infection (UTI). It is intended for over- the-counter home use only.

# I. Device Description:

The Scanostics UTI Check Application test system consists of the Scanostics UTI Check Application and the URS-2L (UTI) Urine Test Strips. The Scanostics UTI Check Application measures the colour developed in two reaction zones (leukocytes and nitrite pads) on the UTI test strip following application of a urine sample. The developed colors are then compared to calibration colours located on the Scanostics backing material and the result for each pad is determined based on the minimum colour distance between the developed colours and calibration colours.

The URS-2L UTI Test Strip comprises of two reagent pads areas, which are absorbent material saturated with chemically active substances, then dried and affixed to the plastic strip with double-sided adhesive.

The backing card comprises of thirty-two (32) calibration colour blocks and three (3) black and white alignment squares printed onto a rigid card stock and die cut to provide a groove for the strip (preventing strip misalignment). The use of the backing card is primarily to compensate for different lighting environments as it allows the calibration colours and the test strip to be subjected to the same conditions as the reagent pads for comparison – this would not be possible if the calibration colours were stored within the application itself.

The representative platform for the test system is the iPhone 6 with iOS 9. The application has been proven to be compatible on the iPhone 6S (iOS 9) and iPod touch $\mathrm { \Delta } ^ { \mathrm { \prime } } 8 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ gen with iOS 8 and iOS 9). The application’s core technology is based on four (4) patents held by Teco Diagnostics (US 8655009, 8877140, 8911679 and 8506901).

The candidate device (application and test strips) uses the same chemical formulation for leukocyte and nitrite reagent pads as the predicate. The main difference between the investigational and predicate device is the inclusion of the smartphone accessory and the backing card.

# K. Test Principle:

Leukocytes: This test is based on the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative through the action of leukocyte esterase. The liberated indoxyl ester reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a colored compound (pink to purple).

Nitrite: This test relies on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of $p$ -arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound in an acid medium. This compound in turn couples with 1, 2, 3, 4 - tetrahydrobenzo(h) quinolin to produce a pink color.

# L. Clinical Performance Characteristics:

The lay user studies were performed at three sites using the Scanostics UTI Check Application test system and the Clinistrip (URS-10) strips. Lay user data was presented to evaluate the accuracy of results in the hands of users and to ensure that the intended users were able to understand and implement smartphone technology.

Results indicate that the intended users were able to obtain comparable testing data when using the Scanostics UTI Check Application as a trained HCP using the Clinistrip (URS-10).

# M. Non-clinical studies:

The performance characteristics of the Scanostics UTI Check Application test system were verified by method comparison, precision, detection limit, interference, specificity, shelf life and stress studies as well as several flex studies. Testing results indicate that the Scanostics UTI Check application test system performs satisfactorily when used appropriately.

# N. Conclusion:

The study results demonstrate a substantial equivalency on performance between the Scanostics UTI Check application test system and the predicate device, Clinistrip (URS-10) test strips.
