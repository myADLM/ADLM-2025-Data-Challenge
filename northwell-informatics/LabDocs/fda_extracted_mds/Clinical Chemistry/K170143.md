Dear Feng-Yu Lee:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

8. Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence is as follows:

Verification and validation of these blood glucose systems evaluated to establish the performance, functionality, and reliability of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280, Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280B, GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 180, and GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 182 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems. The evaluation included precision, linearity, interference, sample volume and hematocrit.

9. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

# System Accuracy Study:

The system accuracy study of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280 was performed by comparing capillary and venous whole blood (plasma equivalent) glucose values on the Rightest Blood Glucose Meter GM280 with glucose values on lab instrument YSI 2300 Plus Glucose Analyzer.

A total of 104 patients participated. The study results demonstrate that the accuracy of Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280 met the acceptance criteria.

# User Performance Study:

The user performance study was performed to demonstrate that English speaking and reading lay users across all educational backgrounds can easily understand and follow the labeling/user instructions to obtain accurate results while using Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280B.

A total of 135 subjects participated. The study results demonstrate that the user accuracy and ease of use (via participant questionnaire scoring) Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280B meet the acceptance criteria.

10. Conclusions:

Results of performance evaluation of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280, Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM280B, GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 180, and GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System 182 demonstrate that the devices are substantially equivalent to the predicate device, GE333 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
