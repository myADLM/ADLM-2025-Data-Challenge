# L. Test Principle:

The carbon dioxide in the human serum or serum based control sample reacts with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and magnesium to yield oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and phosphate. In the second reaction, in the presence of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), the reduced cofactor is oxidized by OAA. The reduced cofactor absorbs strongly at $4 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { \ n m } }$ , whereas its oxidized form does not. The difference in absorbance between the final reading and the blank, which is monitored at 405 $\mathrm { n m } / 4 1 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ , is directly proportional to the total carbon dioxide concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

In the accordance with CLSI EP5-A2 guideline, samples were tested in duplicate, 2 lots, and 2 runs per day for 20 days. The samples were unaltered human serums that were spiked with carbon dioxide concentrations and commercial serum based controls. The results were tabulated, and the data was analyzed for means, standard deviations (SDs), and percent coefficients of variation $( \% C V \mathrm { s } )$ . The precision result from one lot is summarized below.

# Section 5 - 510(k) SUMMARY

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies of Teco Carbon Dioxide Reagent Set were performed in accordance with the guidelines set forth in CLSI EP6-A. Linearity was tested using two lots of reagent with unaltered human serum samples. The samples were prepared by mixing a diluted patient serum sample $( 2 { \mathrm { ~ m m o l / L } } )$ ) and a spiked patient serum sample $( 6 4 \mathrm { \ m m o l / L } )$ in order to obtain 11 different concentrations. Each sample assay was tested in 3 replicates using TCMATRIX analyzer. The reagent revealed that the assay is linear up to 64 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . The linearity of Carbon Dioxide (Enzymatic) was analyzed over a measured range from 8.70 to $4 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . As a result, the linear regression analyses were obtained as below:

$$
\operatorname { y } = 1 . 0 1 9 2 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0 3 5 1 ; \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 3
$$

The reportable range of the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assay is $8 . 7 - 4 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ method is traceable to NIST SRM 351. The $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assay is calibrated by comparing the change in absorbance of the unknown sample to the change in absorbance of the $3 0 { \mathrm { ~ m E q / L ~ C O } } _ { 2 }$ standard (from Integrated Diagnostics Group). The $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ standard was previously cleared under K936245.

It is recommended using an aqueous $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ standard $( 3 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m m o l / L } )$ or an appropriate serum calibrator. To monitor the reliability of results, it is recommended using two levels of control sera with known $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ values to be run along with patient sample.

The stability claim was verified using an accelerated stability protocol. Accelerated stability of the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reagent was determined based on Arrehnius Model equation. Based on the study, accelerated stability of the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reagent was demonstrated to be at least 21 months if the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reagent is tightly capped and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Reagents in unopened vials are stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until the expiry date printed on the label. The assay was calibrated using a valid calibrator and measured as sample in duplicates. The verification of the real time stability is on going.

# d. Quality Control materials

Users are instructed in the labeling to use quality control samples at least once a day and after each calibration and every time a new bottle of reagent is used. It is recommended to use at least two levels (low and high) of controls. Available controls are Lyphochek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Unassayed Chemistry Control (Human)

# Section 5 - 510(k) SUMMARY

Levels 1 and 2 (Lot number: 27661 and 27662) and were previously cleared under K882486.

e. Detection limit:

Detection limit studies have been carried out in accordance with CLSI EP17- A2 guideline. Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) studies were performed on two lots of reagents tested on one TC-MATRIX analyzer (K073370). For the LoB and LoD studies, four (4) samples were tested in five (5) replicates over 3 days. For LoQ study, five (5) samples were tested in three (3) replicates over 3 days. The LoD pools consisted of 4 separate pools, and LoQ pools consisted of 5 separate pools near the current bottom of the serum assay ranges. The $9 ~ \mathrm { L o D } ~ / ~ \mathrm { L o Q }$ serum pools were prepared by diluting patient serum with artificial serum. The LoB pool consisted of artificial serum base matrix with no carbon dioxide added. LoQ is the lowest concentration that can be detected with $\leq 1 0 \% \mathrm { C V }$ . LoB, LoD and LoQ results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CO2 (mmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.92</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.77</td></tr></table>

# f. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies have been carried out in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Two (2) different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate $( 2 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and $3 5 \mathrm { \ m m o l / L }$ ) human serum samples were used to evaluate interference testing using one TC-MATRIX analyzer (K073370) and two reagent lots. Pooled human serum samples with added potential interferents were tested in replicates of ten (10) and compared to a sample without interferent. Teco Carbon Dioxide Reagent Set was evaluated for interferences tested by bilirubin (Total and Conjugated), hemoglobin, triglyceride, ascorbic acid, and intralipid in serum samples. The following substances demonstrated no significant bias as defined as $\pm 1 0 \%$ difference from the control results.
