# L. Test Principle:

The carbon dioxide in the sample reacts with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and magnesium to yield oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and phosphate. In the second reaction, in the presence of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), the reduced NADH cofactor is oxidized by OAA. The reduced cofactor absorbs strongly at 405 nm, whereas its oxidized form does not. Spectrophotometric determination of the decrease in absorbance monitored at $4 0 5 \ \mathrm { n m } / 4 1 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ , is directly proportional to the total carbon dioxide concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was conducted in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. The precision study was performed utilizing 2 reagent lots, using serum based control material and human serum samples that were spiked with carbon dioxide concentrations. Two replicates of each of the control and serum samples were tested on two separate runs per day over 20 days, leading to the generation of 80 data points per sample. The mean, SD, and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ calculated for within-run and total imprecision for each lot yielded similar results. The results from one representative lot are shown below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Samples were prepared by mixing a high spiked serum sample $( 6 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L } \mathrm { C }$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ) with a low diluted serum sample $( 2 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } )$ to obtain 11 concentrations. Each sample was assayed in replicates of three using two different Carbon Dioxide Reagent lots. The results of the linear regression analyses for one representative lot are summarized below:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 1 9 2 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0 3 5 1 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 3
$$

The sponsor claims a linearity range from 8.70 to 40.0 mmol/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The Carbon Dioxide Reagent Set is traceable to NIST SRM 351. The $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assay is calibrated by comparing the change in absorbance of the unknown sample to the change in absorbance of the $3 0 \mathrm { m E q } / \mathrm { L } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ standard. The $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ standard was previously cleared under k936245.

# Stability:

Accelerated shelf-life stability, real-time open-vial stability and on-board stability studies for the Carbon Dioxide Reagent were performed. The protocols and acceptance criteria for stability were reviewed and are found to be acceptable. The studies support a shelf life stability claim of 21 months from the date of manufacture for reagent when stored at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , an open-vial stability claim for the Carbon Dioxide Reagent of 28 days when stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and a reagent on-board stability claim of 13 days. The real-time shelf-life stability testing is on-going.

# d. Detection limit:

Detection limit studies have been carried out in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) studies were performed on two lots of reagents tested on one TC-MATRIX analyzer. For the LoB studies, four (4) blank samples were tested in five replicates over three days. For LoD studies four low $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ level samples with target concentrations ranging from 0.92 to $3 . 6 8 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were tested in five replicates using two lots over three days. For LoQ study, five different samples with target concentrations ranging from 0.7 to $4 . 0 8 \ : \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were tested in replicates of three using two lots over a three days period.

LoB, LoD and LoQ results are summarized in the following table:

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies have been carried out in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Human serum samples with two (2) different concentrations of carbon dioxide ${ 2 0 } \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and $3 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ) were used to evaluate interference testing using two reagent lots. Serum samples with added potential interferents were tested in replicates of ten (10) and compared to a sample without interferent. The sponsor defined no significant interference as $< 1 0 \%$ difference from the control sample.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI guideline EP9- A2. One hundred and seventy-six (176) patient serum samples spanning a range from 8.7 to $3 7 . 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were tested in singlicate using the Pointe Scientific Inc. Carbon Dioxide Reagent (predicate) and Teco Carbon Dioxide Reagent Set (candidate device). Eight samples were contrived $( 4 . 5 \% )$ . The linear regression analysis yielded the following results:

$$
\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 7 8 5 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 2 6 3 6 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 2 5

1Tietz NW. Clinical Guide to Laboratory Tests, $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ ed. Philadelphia, PA: WB Saunders Company; 1995:110-111.

The reference interval for Carbon Dioxide was verified by testing human serum from 23 apparently healthy donors in singlicate using two reagent lots. Results of the study indicate that all values measured are within the expected values of the cited literature, therefore the reference interval has been verified for the Carbon Dioxide Reagent Set.
