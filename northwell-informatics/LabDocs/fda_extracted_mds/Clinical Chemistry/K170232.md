# Description of AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB Test Cartridges:

AFIAS TSH-SP as well as AFIAS TSH-VB Test Cartridge is a plastic structure molded in the form of a disposable, self-contained, unitized device which houses the ‘lyophilized detection buffer’, the ‘diluent i.e. reconstitution buffer’ as well as the ‘test strip’; all of which are integral components of the test.

The test cartridge is an elongated structure having $1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ length, $1 7 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ width and 17 mm height.

# Description of AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB ID Chips:

‘AFIAS TSH-SP ID Chip’ as well as ‘AFIAS TSH-VB ID Chip’ is a flat, rectangular device with its main body measuring $2 4 \ \mathrm { m m } \times 2 0 \ \mathrm { m m } \times 3 \ \mathrm { m m }$ . Another rectangular portion measuring $1 2 \ \mathrm { m m } \times 1 0 \ \mathrm { m m } \times 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ protrudes out from the apical side of the main body.

The ID Chip is an electronic memory device fitted into a plastic matrix. Lot-specific ‘ID Chip’ is an integral component of the test.

Before initiating the test run for testing a clinical sample or a calibrator/control using AFIAS TSH-SP or AFIAS TSH-VB test cartridge belonging to a new lot, the operator needs to mandatorily insert the lot-specific AFIAS TSH-SP or AFIAS TSH-VB ID Chip into one of the ‘ID Chip Ports’ of the AFIAS-6/SP or AFIAS-6/VB analyzer respectively.

# Description of AFIAS-6/SP and AFIAS-6/VB Analyzer:

For performing AFIAS TSH-SP test on a clinical serum/plasma sample or a calibrator/control, AFIAS TSH-SP test cartridge needs to be used in conjunction with the AFIAS-6/SP analyzer.

Similarly, for performing AFIAS TSH-VB test on a clinical venous whole blood sample or a calibrator/control, AFIAS TSH-VB test cartridge needs to be used in conjunction with the AFIAS-6/VB analyzer.

AFIAS-6/SP as well as AFIAS-6/VB analyzer is a compact, bench-top, automated, fluorometric analyzer measuring $4 2 \ \mathrm { c m }$ (L) x 33.6 cm (W) $\textrm { x } 2 9 . 3 \ \mathrm { c m }$ (H). AFIAS-6 weighs $1 5 . 1 \mathrm { k g }$ .

Either analyzer is a flourometer instrument of closed-system analyzer type. The operator does not have access to those configuration parameters that could affect the assay process, test analysis or result calculation or any other parameter that could affect test result outcome. These and other operational parameters can only be configured by the ‘System Administrator’ through software and/or firmware upgrade and modification of operational settings in consultation with the manufacturer or an authorized service provider.

With a simple computerized touchscreen user interface, the analyzer enables the operator to initiate the test run which is completed automatically and terminates with display of test result or an error message alert (in case of any procedural error and/or system malfunction).

# Summary of Performance Evaluation Studies:

# 1) Limit of Blank:

Limit of Blank (LoB) of AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB tests have been evaluated as per CLSI EP 17-A2.

5 replicates each of 5 blank/TSH-depleted human serum as well as 5 blank/TSHdepleted whole blood samples were tested with 3 lots of test cartridges on 3 respective analyzers for 3 days; thus testing 75 replicates per lot/analyzer.

- Limit of Blank (LoB) was calculated by non-parametric analysis of the data.

Limit of Blank of AFIAS TSH-SP test is $0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { \mu I U / m l }$ and that of AFIAS TSH-VB test is $0 . 1 3 ~ { \mu \mathrm { I U / m l } }$ .

# 2) Limit of Detection:

Limit of Detection (LoD) of AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB tests have been evaluated as per CLSI EP 17-A2.

5 replicates each of 5 low TSH-spiked human serum as well as 5 low TSH-spiked whole blood samples were tested with 3 lots of test cartridges on 3 respective analyzers for 3 days; thus testing 75 replicates per lot/analyzer.

- Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated by parametric analysis of the data.

Limit of Detection of AFIAS TSH-SP test is $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { \mu I U / m l }$ and that of AFIAS TSHVB test is $0 . 2 \mu \mathrm { I U / m l }$ .

# 3) Limit of Quantitation:

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB tests have been evaluated as per CLSI EP 17-A2.

For evaluating the LoQ of AFIAS TSH-SP test, 2 replicates of each of the 5 low TSH-spiked serum samples were tested daily in two different runs with two test cartridge lot/analyzer/operator combinations for 21 successive days.

For evaluating the LoQ of AFIAS TSH-VB test, 5 replicates of each of the 4 low TSH-spiked venous whole blood samples were tested daily in two different runs with two test cartridge lot/analyzer/operator combinations for 5 successive days.

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was calculated by considering accuracy goal of interassay $C V \leq 2 0 \%$ .

Limit of Quantitation of AFIAS TSH-SP test is $0 . 0 7 ~ \mathrm { \mu I U / m l }$ and that of AFIAS TSHVB test is $0 . 3 ~ { \mu \mathrm { I U / m l } }$ .

# 4) Linearity and Reportable Range:

For evaluating linearity and measuring/reportable range of AFIAS TSH-SP test, a series of 22 test samples prepared by mixing a high TSH-spiked serum sample $( \mathrm { T S H { \approx } 1 0 0 ~ \mu I U / m L } )$ and a TSH-depleted serum sample $\mathrm { ( T S H \approx 0 \mu I U / m L ) }$ in various proportions, was tested in triplicate with the one lot of AFIAS TSH-SP test cartridges on one AFIAS-6/SP analyzer on the same day.

Similarly, for evaluating linearity and measuring/reportable range of AFIAS TSH-VB test, a series of 22 test samples prepared by mixing a high TSH-spiked venous whole blood sample $( \mathrm { T S H { \approx } 1 0 0 ~ \mu I U / m L } )$ and a TSH-depleted venous whole blood sample $\mathrm { ( T S H \approx 0 \ \mu I U / m L ) }$ ) in various proportions, was tested in triplicate with the one lot of AFIAS TSH-VB test cartridges on one AFIAS-6/VB analyzer on the same day.

Mean of the triplicate test results of each sample was plotted against its expected TSH concentration calculated mathematically.

The following linear regression equations were obtained:

Serum: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 8 1 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 7 8 5$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 3$

Na-heparinized whole blood: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 2 4 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 2 1 6 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 7$

Both tests showed linearity over the entire TSH concentration range $( 0 { \sim } 1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m l } )$ tested for the study.   
Measuring/reportable range of AFIAS TSH-SP test system has been programed as $0 . 0 7 { \cdot } 8 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m l }$ while that of AFIAS TSH-VB test system has been programed as 0.3 - $- 8 0 . 0 \mu \mathrm { I U / m l }$ .

# 5) Susceptibility to High-dose Hook Effect:

For evaluating susceptibility to high dose hook (prozone) effect, a series of spiked samples having TSH concentrations 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { \mu I U / m l }$ was tested in triplicate with one lot of test cartridges using one analyzer on the same day by the same operator.

No hook/prozone effect was observed up to TSH concentration of $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { \mu I U / m l }$ .

# 6) Analytical specificity:

Susceptibility of AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB test systems to interference from various endogenous substances, heterophiles and drugs as well as cross-reactivity with endogenous TSH structural analogs (hFSH, hLH, and hCG) has been evaluated at specified concentrations of the interferants/cross-reactants as follows:

 Albumin/Protein $( 6 ~ \mathrm { g / d L } = 6 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$   
 Conjugated Bilirubin $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$   
 Unconjugated Bilirubin $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ )   
 Human hemoglobin ( $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$   
 Triglycerides $3 \mathrm { g / d L } = 3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$   
 HAMA ( $1 3 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ )   
 Rheumatoid Factor $( 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } )$   
 Biotin $( 5 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$   
 Levothyroxine $( 7 5 \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$   
 Methimazole $( 3 6 \mathrm { m g / L } )$   
 Metoprolol $( 4 . 9 9 \mathrm { m g / L } )$   
 Human Follicle-stimulating Hormone/hFSH (1,200 mIU/ml)   
 Human Luteinizing Hormone/hLH $\mathrm { 1 } { , } 2 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m l } )$   
 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin/hCG (1,200 mIU/ml)

- AFIAS TSH-SP as well as AFIAS TSH-VB tests showed analyte recovery within the acceptable range of $90 { - } 1 1 0 \%$ in presence of specified concentrations of above substances thereby indicating insignificant interference/cross-reactivity.

# 7) Site-to-Site Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility of AFIAS TSH-SP test system was evaluated by testing 5 replicates of each of the 4 serum samples (TSH levels ${ \approx } 0 . 5$ , ${ \approx } 5 . 0$ , ${ \approx } 1 5 . 0$ & $\approx 5 5 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m l } )$ with 3 lots of AFIAS TSH-SP test cartridges on 3 AFIAS-6/SP analyzers (1 analyzer per site) at 3 external point-of-care sites at the hands of 9 intended POC operators (3 operators per site).

# 9) Adult Reference Interval:

- Adult reference interval of AFIAS TSH-SP test was evaluated by testing serum samples collected from total 128 apparently healthy adults (65 males and 63 females) in the age group of 21-70 years.

- Adult reference interval of AFIAS TSH-VB test was evaluated by testing sodium heparin venous whole blood samples collected from total 133 apparently healthy adults (69 males and 64 females) in the age group of 21-70 years.

- Non-parametric reference interval encompassing the central $9 5 \%$ frequency distribution of test results was determined as per CLSI C28-A3c Standard.

- $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile and $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of distribution of test results was taken as the lower limit and upper limit respectively of the reference interval.

- Adult reference intervals of AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB tests have been found to be $0 . 4 5 { - } 4 . 4 9 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $0 . 4 1 { - } 4 . 0 6 ~ { \mu } \mathrm { I U / m L }$ respectively.

- The manufacturer claims $0 . 4 5 { - } 4 . 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu I U / m L }$ as adult reference interval of AFIAS TSH-SP test and $0 . 4 0 { - } 4 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ as the adult reference interval of AFIAS TSH-VB test.

- However, the user laboratories should establish their own reference intervals for specific population and/or specific group(s) of population they may cater to.

# 10) Clinical Method Comparison:

- Method comparison studies of AFIAS TSH-SP and AFIAS TSH-VB tests were carried out at three point-of-care clinical sites at the hands of typical POC operators.

- 183 serum samples (including 22 spiked serum samples) were tested in singlet with one lot AFIAS TSH-SP test cartridges on one AFIAS-6/SP analyzer per site.

Aliquot of each serum sample from across the three study sites was tested with the predicate device Access Fast hTSH (on the Access 2 system) at a centralized laboratory.

- Similarly, 157 sodium heparinized venous whole blood samples (including 22 spiked venous whole blood samples) were tested in singlet with one lot AFIAS TSH-VB test cartridges on one AFIAS-6/VB analyzer per site.

Matching serum samples from across the three study sites were tested with the predicate device Access Fast hTSH (on the Access 2 system) at the centralized laboratory.

Correlation/comparability between the candidate test results of the tested samples and predicate test results of matching serum samples was evaluated by performing weighted deming regression analysis of the data as summarized in the following table:

# Conclusion:

Based on the intended use, principle and non-clinical as well as clinical performance characteristics described above, AFIAS TSH-SP (with AFIAS-6/SP analyzer) and AFIAS TSH-VB (with AFIAS-6/VB analyzer) test systems are substantially equivalent to the predicate device Acces Fast hTSH (with Access 2 System).
