Standardization Statement

The calibrators are manufactured gravimetrically and referenced to the World Health Organization (WHO) 4th International Reference Standard 75/589 for $\beta$ -hCG at each concentration level.

# C. Controls

# Contents

The controls recommended for use with the Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay were cleared under k983424 with the name ARCHITECT Total $\beta$ -hCG Controls. The Total $\beta$ -hCG assay on the Alinity i System uses the same ARCHITECT Total $\beta$ -hCG Controls with no change to formulation or container. Therefore, Abbott is not seeking a new clearance for the Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG Controls in this submission because only the branding has changed.

Control L, Control M, and Control H contain hCG prepared in human serum.

Preservative: Sodium azide.

# D. Alinity i System

The Alinity i System (also known as the Alinity i analyzer) uses chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) detection technology to measure the concentration of analytes in samples. The modular design of the Alinity family of analyzers allows multiple processing modules, which perform all sample processing activities, to be physically joined to form a single workstation or system. The selection of processing module(s) determines the configuration of the system.

Each Alinity analyzer, regardless of type, consists of a System Control Module (SCM), Reagent and Sample Manager (RSM), and processing module.

# E. Principles of the Procedure

The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative and qualitative determination of $\beta$ -hCG in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.

The Alinity i analyzer processes Total $\beta$ -hCG test orders as follows:

1. Sample and anti- $\beta$ -hCG coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined and incubated.   
2. The $\beta$ -hCG present in the sample binds to the anti- $\beta$ -hCG coated microparticles.   
3. The mixture is washed.   
4. Anti- $\beta$ -hCG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated.   
5. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added.   
6. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). There is a direct relationship between the amount of $\beta$ -hCG in the sample and the RLUs detected by the system optics.

# V. Intended Use of the Device

The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) used for the quantitative and qualitative determination of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin $\beta$ -hCG) in human serum and plasma for the early detection of pregnancy on the Alinity i analyzer.

The Alinity i System is a fully automated immunoassay analyzer allowing random and continuous access, as well as priority and automated retest processing using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. CMIA technology is used to determine the presence of antigens, antibodies, and analytes in samples.

# VI. Comparison of Technological Characteristics

The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay (candidate assay) utilizes a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) methodology for the quantitative and qualitative determination of Total $\beta$ -hCG and is intended for use on the Alinity i analyzer.

Linearity   
Linearity was evaluated based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP06-A.

The assay was linear across the range of 2.42 to 15,000 mIU/mL.

Limits of Blank, Detection, and Quantitation (LoB, LoD, and LoQ)

The LoB, LoD, and LoQ study was performed based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP17-A2.

Across the instruments and reagents lots, the LoB ranged from 0.00 to $0 . 2 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , the LoD ranged from 0.16 to $0 . 6 7 \ : \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , and the LoQ ranged from 1.10 to $2 . 4 2 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

The LoB represents the 95th percentile from $\mathrm { n } \geq 6 0$ replicates of zero-analyte samples.

The LoD represents the lowest concentration at which the analyte can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability based on $\mathrm { n } \geq 6 0$ replicates of low-analyte level samples.

The LoQ was determined from $\mathrm { n } \geq 6 0$ replicates of low-analyte level samples and is defined as the lowest concentration at which a maximum TEa (Total Error allowable) of $2 5 \%$ was met.

The method comparison data for the investigational method, Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG and the comparator method, ARCHITECT Total $\beta$ -hCG was acceptable.

# Within-Assay Sample Carryover

The difference between the protected sample and the unprotected sample was $0 . 2 2 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay is not susceptible to within-assay sample carryover.

# Tube Type Equivalency (Matrix Comparison)

The study used 43 unique positive pregnant donor’s serum specimens to supplement the concentration of 45 unique female non-pregnant whole blood specimens to achieve concentrations across the measuring interval. The whole blood, after supplementing, was aliquoted into 7 tube types. The samples were processed according to the blood collection tube manufacturer’s instructions and evaluated for $\beta$ -hCG compared to the serum control.

The following blood collection tube types are acceptable for use with the Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay:

# Expected Values Non-Pregnant (Reference Range)

Because hCG is normally synthesized and secreted by cells of the placenta or its precursor, levels of the hormone in normal, non-pregnant individuals are low to undetectable. Concentrations of $\beta$ -hCG measured in the sera of non-pregnant individuals, as reported in the literature, are $< 5 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . The concentration of $\beta$ -hCG in maternal serum rises rapidly during early pregnancy. $\beta$ -hCG levels between $5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ may be indicative of early pregnancy. Values for $\beta$ -hCG generally peak during the first trimester and decline slowly throughout the remainder of the pregnancy.

Human serum specimens were collected from non-pregnant, pre-menopausal, peri-menopausal, and post-menopausal females and were evaluated using the Alinity i Total $\beta { \mathrm { - h C G } }$ assay. The results are summarized in the following table.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Age (years)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MenopausalStatus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ReferenceInterval(mIU/mL)(2.5 - 97.5percentile)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18-41</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>128</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>pre-menopausal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt; 2.42</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42-55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>140</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>peri-menopausal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt; 2.42  4.87</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt;55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>137</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>post-menopausal*</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt; 2.42 - 7.60</td></tr></table>

# Verification of Auto-Dilution

A total of 25 samples were created by supplementing $\beta$ -hCG stock solution into normal male serum. An aliquot of each sample was tested using the 1:15 automated dilution protocol on both the Alinity i analyzer and the ARCHITECT instrument.

The performance of the Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG automated dilution protocol was considered acceptable if, the difference in mean concentration was within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ when comparing the auto diluted samples on the Alinity i system to auto diluted samples on the ARCHITECT system.

The mean $\%$ difference was $0 . 3 \%$ .

# IX. Conclusion Drawn from Nonclinical Laboratory Studies

The results presented in this $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification demonstrate that the candidate assay (Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG, List No. 07P51) performance is substantially equivalent to the predicate assay (ARCHITECT Total $\beta$ -hCG, k983424) and that the candidate instrument (Alinity i System) is substantially equivalent to the predicate instrument (ARCHITECT $i$ System, k983212).

The similarities and differences between the candidate assay and predicate assay and the candidate instrument and predicate instrument are presented in the tables starting on page 5-8. The results presented in this 510(k) provide reasonable assurance that the

candidate Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay and the candidate Alinity i System are safe and effective for the stated intended use. Any differences between the candidate assay and the predicate assay and the candidate instrument and the predicate instrument shown in the tables do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the candidate assay and instrument.
