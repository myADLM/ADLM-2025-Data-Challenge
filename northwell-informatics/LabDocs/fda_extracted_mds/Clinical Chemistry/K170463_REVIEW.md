# L. Test Principle:

The test principle of the KetoSens Blood $\beta \mathrm { . }$ -Ketone Monitoring System/KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System is based on the amperometric detection of betahydroxybutyrate (also known as 3-hydroxybutyrate) in whole blood. $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate is converted by the enzyme $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to acetoacetate. The magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of $\beta \mathrm { . }$ - hydroxybutyrate present in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

The only differences between the KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System and KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System are the trade name and intended use (single-patient home use vs. multiple-patient use); therefore, performance testing conducted on the KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Repeatability:

Venous EDTA whole blood was spiked with five different $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate concentrations (0.4, 1.1, 3.4, 5.2, and $6 . 9 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ) and tested on ten KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone meters. Ten replicates were tested per meter per concentration with each of three lots of test strips. The results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration(mmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean(mmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD(mmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.39</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.027</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.08</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.056</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.38</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.126</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.16</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.182</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.91</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.248</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.6</td></tr></table>

# Intermediate Precision:

Intermediate precision was evaluated by 10 operators using three lots of test strips. Each operator was provided with three KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone meters. Each meter was assigned to a test strip lot. Each operator conducted testing of three different test strip lots a day for 20 days using three $\beta$ -Ketone control solutions. The results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System was evaluated using venous EDTA whole blood spiked with $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate. Nine whole blood samples were adjusted to the following $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate concentrations: 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.2, 2.1, 3.9, 5.7, 7.7, and $9 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . The concentrations were assigned using the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer. The summary of the linear regression analysis for each lot was as follow:

Lot 1: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 3 4 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 1 4 5$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$ Lot 2: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 2 5 0 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 4 6 6$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8$ Lot 3: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 0 9 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 3 2 3 ; \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8$

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed $\beta$ -Ketone measurement range

of 0.1 to $8 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ for both systems.

Validation testing was performed demonstrating that the meter displays ‘HI’ when the measurement result is greater than $8 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and ‘LO’ when the measurement result is less than $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System and KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ - Ketone Monitoring System are traceable to an in-house standard prepared from commercially available control materials. The method comparison study was performed using the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer as the comparator method (see Section M.2.a.).

# Test strip stability:

The KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips are provided in individual foil packages. The shelf life stability of the foil packaged test strips was assessed in real-time studies. The study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable to support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 15 months when stored under the recommended storage conditions of $3 9 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ (4 to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and relative humidity of 20 to $80 \%$ .

Because each test strip is individually packaged, open vial stability testing is not necessary.

# d. Detection limit:

The $\beta$ -Ketone measuring range is 0.1 to $8 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . The range is validated under the linearity study. See section M.1.b.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances using venous EDTA whole blood spiked at two $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate concentrations of 0.6 and $2 . 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . The samples were divided into two aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test (with added interferent at a toxic level or 10 times the known therapeutic level). Each sample was measured using 20 KetoSens Blood $\beta$ - Ketone meters and three test strip lots.

The sponsor defined no significant interference according to the following:

The following table lists the concentration of each substance at which no significant interference was detected. At the $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate concentration of $0 . 6 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ the $\%$ bias ranged from $- 1 7 \%$ to $12 \%$ . At the $\beta \mathrm { . }$ -hydroxybutyrate concentration of 2.8 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ the $\%$ bias ranged from $- 8 . 3 \%$ to $4 . 3 \%$ . The following table lists the high concentrations at which no significant interference was observed:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Point of Care study: To assess the performance of the KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System in the hands of the intended operators, a point of care (POC) study was conducted by six health care professionals at three POC sites.

The POC study was performed on 136 patients from the intended use population using six KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ -Ketone meters and three lots of KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ -Ketone test strips. Capillary blood was collected from each patient and analyzed once using the KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System. Venous blood was collected from the same patient using an EDTA collection tube and analyzed once using the KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System. The $\beta$ -Ketone measurements on the fingertip capillary whole blood and venous EDTA whole blood were compared to those obtained using the Randox RANBUT d3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer. To test specimens with $\beta$ - Ketone concentrations at the high end of the claimed measuring range, 12 of 136 of these were altered by spiking analyte into both capillary and venous whole blood samples. The results are summarized below:

To assess the performance of the KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users, a lay user study was conducted with 185 lay user participants using three KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone meters and three lots of KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone test strips. Each lay user participants self-tested their fingertip capillary blood $\beta$ -Ketone level unassisted, and was given only the instructions and training materials routinely provided with the system.

The lay user $\beta$ -Ketone measurements were compared to those obtained by trained users using the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer. The range of $\beta$ -Ketone concentrations across all subjects was 0.017 to $1 . 0 5 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ (based on comparator method). Each sample was measured in singlicate. The results are summarized below:

$\beta$ -Ketone concentration <1.5 mmol/L

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study:

The effect of varying hematocrit level on the measurement of $\beta$ -Ketone concentration was evaluated using venous EDTA whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , and $60 \%$ . Five different $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate concentrations of 0.5, 1.6, 2.9, 4.2, and $6 . 1 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were prepared at each of the five different hematocrit levels. The $\beta$ -Ketone concentration was measured using 30 meters and three lots of test strips. The $\%$ bias at each hematocrit level relative to a plasma sample of the same concentration run on the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer was calculated. The results support the claimed acceptable hematocrit range of 20 to $5 5 \%$ .

2. Altitude study:

An altitude/oxygen dependency study was performed to assess the effect of low oxygen levels when the system is used at elevations above sea level. For testing, three different altitudes (0, 5000, and 10000 feet) were simulated. Venous whole blood was spiked to achieve three $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate concentrations (0.6, 2.4, and $4 . 9 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ) as measured by the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer. Each sample was tested across three lots of test strips using 15 meters. The results demonstrated acceptable bias to support the claim that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on $\beta$ -Ketone measurement with the KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System.

# 3. Temperature and Humidity Study:

The sponsor performed operating condition studies to evaluate the operating temperature and relative humidity (RH) ranges. Venous whole blood samples at three $\beta \mathrm { . }$ - hydroxybutyrate concentrations (0.5, 2.5, and $5 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ) were evaluated using the KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System. Each sample was tested at the temperature and humidity conditions shown below using 30 meters and three lots of ketone test strips for a total of 30 replicates per temperature/humidity condition. The results were compared with those obtained using the Randox RANBUT d-3- Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer was calculated.

$5 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \%$ RH, $40 \%$ RH, $90 \%$ RH $5 9 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F }$ $( 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \%$ RH, $40 \%$ RH, $90 \%$ RH $7 3 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F }$ $( 2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \%$ RH, $40 \%$ RH, $90 \%$ RH $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \%$ RH, $40 \%$ RH, $90 \%$ RH $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \%$ RH, $40 \%$ RH, $90 \%$ RH

The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature range of $5 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and operating relative humidity range of 10 to $90 \%$ .

# 4. Sample Volume Study:

A sample volume study was conducted to verify the minimum sample volume required for the KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System. Three venous whole blood samples were spiked to $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate concentrations of 0.7, 2.4, and $4 . 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , as measured by the Randox RANBUT d-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX imola analyzer, to evaluate the effect of different sample volumes (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and $1 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) on the accuracy performance of the device and validation of error message when sample volume is too low. Three lots of test strips and 5 meters were used. Results from the study support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and that the insufficient volume error message (Er4) functioned as intended.

# 5. Infection Control Studies:

The KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use, and the KetoSens Multi Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System is intended for multiple-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters by an outside commercial laboratory service to demonstrate complete inactivation of

hepatitis B virus (HBV) with Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No. 67619-12). Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there were no changes in performance or to the external materials of the meters after 10,950 cleaning and 10,950 disinfection cycles with Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of singlepatient use and 3 years of multiple-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 6. Electromagnetic Compatibility:

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing had been performed and the KetoSens Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Monitoring System was found compliant.
