# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

No applicable standard was cited.

# L. Test Principle:

The StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures glucose levels using disposable test strips and a handheld meter. The test strip contains a flow channel to draw blood by capillary action into a biosensor measurement zone. The sensor comprises an enzyme (Glucose oxidase) that oxidizes glucose present in the blood sample. The sensor also contains an electron shuttle to re-generate, by oxidation, the active form of the enzyme. The meter applies a low electrical voltage to the sensor electrodes and measures a change in current caused by the electrochemical oxidation of the electron shuttle.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

This submission seeks changes in labeling for the previously cleared StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System (k160156). The technological characteristics of the modified device are identical to the technological characteristics of the cleared device (k160156). The StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System cleared in k160156 uses identical technology to the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System (originally cleared in k060345 and modified in k063821, k070960, k132121, and k150461). Performance of the modified device was established using these previously cleared devices, which are cited (as

appropriate) in each section.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Within-run and intermediate precision were established in k060345.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity and reportable range were established in k060345.

The reportable range for the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Readings outside of reportable range

Bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a glucose measurement is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged and a ‘LO’ indicator is displayed. If a glucose measurement exceeds $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged and a ‘HI’ indicator is displayed.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST Standard SRM917B.

# Test Strip Stability

Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the StatStrip Xpress Blood Glucose Test Strips were evaluated in k060345 and found to be acceptable. The claimed closed-vial stability is 24 months at $3 4 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ RH. The claimed open-vial stability is 6 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures $3 4 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ RH or until the expiration date printed on the label, whichever comes first.

d. Detection limit:

See the linearity study in Section M.1.b. above.

e. Analytical specificity:

Potential interference from some common endogenous and exogenous substances was established in k132121.

The following information has been added to the outer carton labeling: “Eliminates interferences from common medicines such as Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vitamin C.”

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Method comparison studies were established in k060345.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable. Capillary whole blood is the only indicated matrix.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Accuracy in the hands of the intended users was established in k160156.

Human factors study

Prior to conducting a human factors study to assess intended user understanding of accuracy labeling, the sponsor assessed ways to display device accuracy information on the outer box labeling of the device for easy understanding by the intended user. Twenty design concepts for accuracy labeling were created and assessed internally by the sponsor as well as through studies with external lay people with diabetes (who did not participate in the human factors study) to identify the most simple and easy to understand the information presented. These designs included varied displays such as text only, pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, and bulls eye graphs with and without text. Independent diabetes educator professionals were also consulted on the design and presentation of labeling. The results of this accuracy labeling design assessment supported the bulls eye graphic presented as part of this effort as easiest for lay users to understand.

A human factors study was then performed using the accuracy labeling design selected in the initial accuracy design phase assessment. For the human factors study, 100 male and female intended use subjects across ethnicities (African American,

Caucasian, Native American) and ages (25 to 83 years), and having not received higher levels of formal education (at least $7 5 \%$ of subjects completed 12 years or fewer of high school education; no more than $2 5 \%$ of subjects attended college or higher education) participated in the human factors study. Subjects were included in the study if they were 18 years of age or older, able to read and write English, diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes, and met the educational requirements above. Subjects with a cognitive disorders or other similar conditions were excluded.

As part of the study, each subject completed a mathematics understanding assessment (MUA) in order to determine a subject’s understanding of basic mathematics concepts. The MUA established the baseline numeracy skills (e.g., comparisons of two numbers, understanding of percentages) of the subjects since the human factors assessment of accuracy labeling comprehension incorporated basic mathematics concepts (e.g., comparisons of pairs of accuracy values). The average score for 100 subjects for the MUA was $7 1 . 3 \%$ .

As part of the assessment of accuracy labeling comprehension, each subject completed assessments for the front panel (1A) and side panel (1B) of the proposed outer carton labeling (System A) and comparisons of labeling for System A to System B (2), System C (3), and System D (4) to determine a subject’s overall understanding of meter accuracy information.

For assessment 1A and 1B, subjects were asked multiple choice questions about the front and side panels of the proposed labeling (System A). The front and side panels of the proposed labeling and the results of these assessments are shown below.
