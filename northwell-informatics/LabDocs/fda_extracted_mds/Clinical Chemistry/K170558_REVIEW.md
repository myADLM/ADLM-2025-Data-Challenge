1. Device Description:

The revogene instrument is similar to a low-speed centrifuge to which are attached the necessary components to perform the different steps of the diagnostic tests. It consists of a rotor to spin the disposable microfluidic cartridge (referred to as “PIE”), two temperature controllers, a multichannel optical excitation source, a fluorescence detector, a tactile user-friendly interface, two barcode readers, integrated firmware, and software to deliver results to the user. The revogene instrument can detect up to four different florescence reporters. The instrument fully automates and integrates sample lysis, dilution, amplification and detection of the target sequence in complex samples using real-time PCR. User intervention is required for discharging the patient specimen into the Sample Buffer Tube (SBT), transferring the sample into the PIE and loading/unloading the PIE into the revogene instrument. The revogene can process from one up to a maximum of eight samples simultaneously in the same run; however, each run requires eight PIEs in the instrument. When fewer than eight samples are being processed, MOCK PIEs are included to bring the total to eight PIEs. Alternatively, assay PIEs loaded with sample buffer or with an external control can be used to bring the number of PIEs to eight. On completion of a run, the user removes the processed PIEs from the instrument and discards them according to normal biological waste management procedures. The results are displayed on the touchscreen user interface or transmitted to HIS/LIS (laboratory information system) where result outcomes are reported as Positive, Negative, Indeterminate, or Unresolved.

2. Principles of Operation:

a. Device Features Controlled by Software:

The GenePOC System Software works in conjunction with other software components, such as the firmware control, power firmware, and assay software that contribute to the functioning and results reporting by the instrument. The revogene software is responsible for instrument interaction with the user, assay workflow, traceability management, data analysis/storage, and communication with a LIS. The firmware manages the critical processes of the instrument and performs the required steps to obtain the diagnostic results, such as heating, cooling, centrifugation, and detection. The GenePOC System Software utilizes assay definition files that contain assay-specific parameters to run/report sample results. The PIE can be identified by the revogene software from its barcode.

The final software version reported for K170557 submission was V3.1.5 and 0.3.4 for the firmware. GenePOC reported that biological validation tests were conducted to confirm equivalency between the IUO version and IVD (commercial) version of the revogene.

b. Operational Environment (Off-the-Shelf Software):

The revogene system software uses a number of commercial Off-the-Shelf (OTS) software components. The sponsor provided detailed documentation for the OTS used, including validation studies.

3. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes x or No _

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No x

4. Specimen Identification:

The instrument has two barcode readers to identify reagents and patient specimens. It provides traceability of the sample ID to the PIE ID, SBT ID, and assay ID.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Samples are manually prepared according to the assay manufacturer’s suggestions and are transferred to an assay specific PIE for analysis. Briefly, the user is required for pipetting the patient specimen into the SBT, transferring the sample into the PIE, and loading/unloading the PIEs into the instrument.

6. Calibration:

The system is factory calibrated by the manufacturer, and will undergo performance qualification testing on-site during annual preventive maintenance. If qualification testing results determine significant drift, the instrument will be returned to the manufacturer for re-calibration.

# 7. Quality Control:

Each PIE contains an internal process control that helps monitor for amplification inhibition, quality of assay reagents, and sample processing effectiveness. External controls must be created by the user. See K170557 for details.

8. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes for this line of product types:
