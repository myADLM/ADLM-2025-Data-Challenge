# I. Device Description:

On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are identical (and differ only by the tradename) and consist of a plastic strip to which a reagent pad is affixed. The reagent pad reacts with the urine and provides a visible color reaction.

On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are packaged along with a drying agent in a canister bottle. Each strip is ready to use upon removal from the canister. The entire reagent strip is disposable. Results are obtained by direct comparison to the test strip with color blocks printed on the bottle label. No calculations or laboratory instruments are needed.

The devices are over-the-counter versions of a previously cleared professional device for urine ketones (k061559-ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips). The strips are identical, except that the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips contained test pads to evaluate 10 analytes (including ketones), and the On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for Urinalysis strips each contain a single reagent pad (to evaluate ketones).

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) GP16-A3 “Urinalysis; Approved Guideline - Third Edition”

# L. Test Principle:

The On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are for the qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of ketones (acetoacetic acid) in urine. The On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are based on ketones reacting with nitroprusside and acetoacetic acid to produce a color change ranging from beige for negative results to a dark purple color for positive results. Ketones are normally not present in urine.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The ketones pad of the On Call Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healthy Me Ketone Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are identical to the ketones pad in the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips evaluated in k061559 (see device description).

# 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The ketones pad is identical to the ketones pad in the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips evaluated in k061559, therefore precision/reproducibility studies were not repeated.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The ketones pad is identical to the ketones pad in the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips evaluated in k061559, therefore linearity studies were not repeated.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their device.

The recommended storage temperature conditions and claims are unchanged and are the same stability claims described in k061559.

# d. Detection limit:

The ketones pad is identical to the ketones pad in the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips evaluated in k061559, therefore sensitivity studies were not repeated.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP7-A2, “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry” to determine the effect of potential interfering substances commonly found in human urine on the strips. Pooled human urine was divided into three samples; a negative sample with no ketones, a sample spiked with lithium acetoacetate for a ketone concentration of $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and a sample spiked with lithium acetoacetate for a ketone concentration of $1 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Potential interfering substances and target concentrations evaluated are shown below. Interferences were initially evaluated at concentrations listed; if interference was observed, serial dilutions of the substance were tested until no interference was observed:

No interference was observed with potentially interfering substances at the concentrations listed (i.e., all results were an exact color block match to control solutions lacking interferents).

Blood at a concentration of $5 \%$ caused false positive results for the proposed device. Since blood concentration $\geq 1 \%$ may cause false positive results for the proposed device, the sponsor’s labeling states that blood in urine can lead to false positive results.

The sponsor additionally evaluated the performance of the proposed device under different light sources (incandescent, fluorescent, sunlight, mercury vapor, and sodium vapor) and determined that these sources provided adequate lighting for use since the test results (of urine samples with ketone concentrations of 5, 15, 40, 80 and $1 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) were not impacted by the different lighting conditions evaluated.

The effect of pH and specific gravity was also evaluated. Five normal fresh urine samples were pooled and split into aliquots spiked to contain ketone concentrations of 0, 5, 15, 40, 80, and $1 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . To evaluate the effect on device performance, aliquots with pH of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, as well as aliquots with specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, 1.035, and 1.040 were prepared. Five replicate measurements were taken of each sample concentration at each condition. For all specific gravity and $\mathsf { p H }$ conditions evaluated, results were an exact color block match with the spiked sample concentrations prior to pH or specific gravity adjustment. Neither pH nor specific gravity were observed to impact device performance across the range of pH and specific gravity evaluated.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: The sponsor included the following information in the package insert:

Normal urine will not have any ketones present. If your results are positive, you should immediately consult your health care provider. A positive ketone level in urine is called ketonuria. This can occur in the following instances:

· When a person is on a very low carbohydrate diet   
· When diabetes mellitus is out of control.   
· As a result of fasting, dieting, starvation, eating disorders, high protein diets and isopropanol ingestion.   
· Ketonuria may be noted in normal pregnancy.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

Additionally, the sponsor performed a readability assessment which showed that the package insert had a Flech-Kincaid Grade Level Score of 7.9. A survey of the voluneers who participated in the lay user study indicated that over $90 \%$ of users described the overall instructions as clear and easy to undersand, and no users described the instructions as difficult to follow or understand.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
