Dear Joon Ho Jung:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

# Comparison to the Cleared Device

The modifications are as below:

1. Change in the housing case of the meter Button positioning from the sides to the front of the meter (PC to Silicone Rubber). The material of the meter screen changed from PC to PMMA. Addition of ejection button (new material: POM). The material of the foot of the meter from TPU to TPE. Meter shell color Addition of backlight to meter screen

2. Trade name of the system changed from NoCoding1 Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System to CareSens N Premier and CareSens N Premier BT Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

3. Addition of Bluetooth module to the meter for wireless data transfer to mobile devices (applies to GM01AAB only). The CareSens N Premier BT (GM01AAB) meter can communicate with smart devices such as a smart phone or a tablet by SmartLog App. The unmodified device K160742

already had the data transfer function of transmitting the stored information to PC via a USB cable.

Other than these modifications, the following remains the same to the cleared device:

Has the same intended use,   
Uses the same operating principle,   
Utilizes the same use environment and calibration method.

# Performance Data

# Non-clinical

Verification, validation and testing activities were conducted to establish the performance, functionality and reliability characteristics of the modified devices. The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

# Cleaning and Disinfection

The device is intended for single patient home use. Disinfection studies were performed on the meter and lancing device by an outside commercial testing service to evaluate effectiveness of disinfectant, CLOROX GERMICIDAL Wipes (EPA Reg. No: 67619-12), in preventing the spread of blood-borne pathogens, using hepatitis B virus (HBV). The results demonstrated complete inactivation of live virus inoculated on the materials of the meter and lancing device. We have also demonstrated that 260 each of pre-cleaning and disinfection cycles for meter with the same disinfectant designed to simulate 5 years (260 each of pre-cleaning and disinfection cycles for meter and lancing device) of single patient device use has no effect on the performance or the external materials of the meter and lancing device.

# Conclusion

Based on the submitted information in this premarket notification, the candidate devices are substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
