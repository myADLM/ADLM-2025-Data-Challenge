# 3. Device Description

# Instrument name, manufacturer, models and accessories

The ABL90 FLEX and ABL90 FLEX PLUS analyzers are two models of the same portable, automated system intended for in vitro testing of samples of whole blood for the parameters pH, $p { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 } ,$ , $p C O _ { 2 }$ , potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride, glucose, lactate, neonatal bilirubin, and co-oximetry parameters (total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and the hemoglobin fractions $F O _ { 2 } H _ { 2 }$ , FCOHb, FMetHb, FHHb and FHbF).

The manufacturer of the ABL90 FLEX and ABL90 FLEX PLUS is Radiometer Medical ApS.

The ABL90 FLEX and ABL90 FLEX PLUS consist of an instrument with a sensor cassette and a solution pack as the main accessories. Multiple models of sensor cassettes are available.

The various sensor cassette models include models for different parameter combinations. For each parameter combination, models allowing for different test load are available.

The solution pack is available in two models differing in the number of tests available.

# Technology

The ABL 90 FLEX and ABL90 FLEX PLUS electrochemical sensors are miniaturized, manufactured by film technology and integrated in a common sensor cassette. Likewise, the ABL90 FLEX and ABL90 FLEX PLUS optical oxygen sensor is integrated in the sensor cassette. A 256-pixel array spectrophotometer is used for the co-oximetry parameters and bilirubin.

# Clinical Utility ctBil

For newborns up to an age of one month the method's reportable range covers the entire reference range. Neonatal Bilirubin test is intended for use to aid in assessing the risk of kernicterus in newborns.

The ABL90 FLEX and ABL90 FLEX PLUS analyzers with neonatal bilirubin on arterial and venous whole blood described above are substantially equivalent in Intended Use, fundamental scientific technology, and characteristics to the predicate ABL800 FLEX (K050869) regarding the measurement of neonatal bilirubin.

# 6. Performance Characteristics

Substantial equivalence between the ABL90 FLEX PLUS analyzer and ABL90 FLEX analyzer has been demonstrated in K160153.

Verification of the ABL90 FLEX PLUS has demonstrated that the performance of the ABL90 FLEX PLUS is equivalent to the performance of ABL90 FLEX.

Since meaurements conducted on ABL90 FLEX PLUS and ABL90 FLEX are equivalent, the neonatal bilirubin testing on arterial and venous whole blood samples conducted on ABL90 FLEX represent both ABL90 FLEX and ABL90 FLEX PLUS.

The purpose of this submission is to include arterial and venous whole blood sample types to the neonatal bilirubin assay using the ABL90 FLEX and ABL90 FLEX PLUS Analyzers. Precision, linearity, detection limits and analytical specificity performance were previously established in k132691 in support of substantial equivalence for capillary whole blood, and are also applicable for arterial and venous whole blood. Consequently, only method comparison studies have been performed on arterial and venous neonatal whole blood to support substantial equivalence for these sample types.

# 6.1 Method Comparison

Method comparison study versus the predicate device has been conducted at two point-of-care sites, samples were analyzed by 4 to 5 operators per site. Bilirubin measurements were performed on 44 arterial, 42 venous and 17 spiked cord blood samples.
