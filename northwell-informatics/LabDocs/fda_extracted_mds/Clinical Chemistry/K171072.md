# 5.4 Device Description / Test Principle

The N Latex Cystatin C is an in vitro diagnostics kit containing reagents for the quantitative determination of cystatin C in human serum and lithium heparinized plasma by means of particle-enhanced immunonephelometry using the BN II and BN ProSpec® Systems. Used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings, N Latex Cystatin C measurements are used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases.

Used in conjunction with the assay reagents, N Protein Standard UY is for use in the establishment of reference curves for the determination of cystatin C on the BN II and BN ProSpec Systems. N Cystatin C Control 1 and 2 are included with N Latex Cystatin C kit and are for use as assayed accuracy controls and precision controls in the determination of cystatin C by immunonephelometry with the BN II and BN ProSpec Systems.

The N Latex Cystatin C test system is based upon the principles of particle-enhanced immunonephelometry. Polystyrene particles coated with specific antibodies to human cystatin C are aggregated when mixed with samples containing human cystatin C. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

The N Latex Cystatin C subject of this $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ is materially the same as the assay cleared in K041878. The reason for the submission is for a new standardization to ERM-DA471/IFCC. This is being accomplished solely by changing the calibrator value assignment process.

# 5.7.1.2 Measuring Range (Linearity and LoQ)

A linearity study was performed according to CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. One N Latex Cystatin C reagent lot, one BN II and one BN ProSpec instrument were used.

A concentrated Cystatin C stock solution was used to spike pooled human serum to a Cystatin C concentration between $1 0 \pm 0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ which is just above the upper limit of the measuring interval of $9 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . This high pool was serially diluted with human serum containing undetectable levels of Cystatin C down to the minimum measuring range. Each dilution was tested in replicates of five using an individual aliquot. The N Latex Cystatin C assay demonstrates acceptable linearity over the range of 0.27 to $1 0 . 3 \ : \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) testing was performed according to CLSI Guideline EP17- A2: Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures. LoQ was demonstrated to be $0 . 0 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ at $< 8 \%$ CV.

The measuring range of the N Latex Cystatin C assay is 0.27 to $9 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$

# 5.7.1.3 High Dose Hook Effect (Antigen Excess)

A serum sample was spiked with purified cystatin C to obtain a sample with a calculated concentration higher than $2 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . A series of dilutions was prepared using cystatin C deficient serum. Each dilution was run five times. The analyte concentration of the high sample was determined using the mean of at least two manual dilutions that recovered within the measuring range of the assay. The results of the dilutions are compared to the upper limit of the calibration curve. Based on the results, Cystatin C concentrations up to $4 2 . 9 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ did not exhibit any high dose hook or prozone effects.

# 5.7.2 Clinical Studies

# 5.7.2.1 Reference Interval Study

A reference interval was performed according to CLSI EP28-A3C, ‘Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory’.

Two hundred three (203) serum samples from a US population of apparently healthy adults or patients with diseases not linked to renal disease or failure, between the ages of 21 and 72 and evenly distributed across gender were measured. The data analysis within the $2 . 5 \%$ and $9 7 . 5 \%$ percentile resulted in a range of Cystatin C from 0.49 to 1.19 $\mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ .

The sponsor recommends that each facility should determine its own reference intervals since values may vary depending on the population studied.

# 5.7.2.2 Method comparison

A method comparison study designed according to CLSI EP09-A3: Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline-Third Edition was conducted at one external site in the United States.

Serum samples (186) were measured on both the predicate device, Roche Tina-quant Cystatin C Gen.2 assay as well as on the N Latex Cystatin C assay. Results were compared by Passing-Bablok regression analysis. Results met the pre-established acceptance criteria for slope, intercept and Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The following summary of Passing-Bablok regression analysis proves substantial equivalence between the N Latex Cystatin C assay and the predicate device.
