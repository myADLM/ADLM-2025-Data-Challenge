# 4. Interference

Interferent testing of the BUN and TCO2 measurements on the epoc System was performed as recommended in the CLSI guideline EP07-A2. In each of these tests, human serum specimens were aliquoted into two (2) samples. The test sample was spiked by addition of interferent, while the control sample was spiked by the addition of the solvent of the interferent. The bias between the mean of six (6) replicates on both the control sample and the test sample with added interferent was calculated. Unacceptable interference bias was defined as producing a significant error more than $5 \%$ of the time.

Clinically significant interfering substances for BUN measurements are itemized below:

• Samples contaminated with benzalkonium salts used as coatings for in-dwelling lines may cause elevated BUN results. For proper line-flushing procedures refer to CLSI H11-A4.   
• Citrate will have no significant effect up to $6 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ( $\mathrm { 1 7 6 . 5 \ m g / d L } ,$ after which it will decrease the BUN concentration by up to $0 . 2 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ BUN per mmol/L citrate.   
• EDTA will have no significant effect up to $4 . 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 1 6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) after which it will decrease the BUN concentration by up to 0.43 mg/dL BUN per mmol/L EDTA.   
• Glutathione reduced will have no significant effect up to $1 . 7 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ (52.2 $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , after which it will increase the BUN concentration by up to $1 . 9 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ BUN per mmol/L glutathione reduced. Blood glutathione (GSH) in human subjects is $\mathrm { \sim 0 . 7 9  – 1 . 0 5 m m o l / L }$ . Long term oral glutathione reduced supplementation $( 2 5 0 - 1 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d } { \it \Omega }$ ay administered for 6 months) increases glutathione plasma levels by ${ \sim } 0 . 2 { \cdot } 8 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ $( \sim 0 . 0 1 \mathrm { - } 0 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Short-term, oral intake of glutathione reduced does not affect plasma glutathione levels.   
• $\beta$ -Hydroxybutyrate will have no significant effect up to $1 7 . 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ (216.9 $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , after which it will decrease the BUN concentration by up to $0 . 1 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ BUN per mmol/L hydroxybutyrate. The reference range for $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate in plasma is $< 0 . 4$ to $0 . 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate concentration over $3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ are indicative of ketoacidosis; in very severe diabetic ketoacidosis the concentration may exceed $2 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . Hydroxyurea will have no significant effect up to $1 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 9 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), after which it will increase the BUN concentration by up to $1 . 6 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ BUN per $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ hydroxyurea. The recommended dose of hydroxyurea for patients range from $1 5 \mathrm { m g / k g / d a } _ { \mathrm { . } }$ y to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / k g / d a y }$ . A treatment dose of $2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d a y }$ $( { \sim } 3 0 \mathrm { m g / k g } )$ results in maximum plasma concentration of ${ \sim } 8 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ with oral administration and ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ with intravenous method.

# e p o c a l I n c.

N-acetylcysteine will have no significant effect up to $9 . 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ( $1 5 0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , after which it will increase the BUN concentration by up to $0 . 1 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ BUN per $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ N- acetylcysteine. It has been reported that $1 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ N-acetyl cysteine is therapeutically unattainable in plasma. The therapeutic level for N-acetyl cysteine is $0 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

• Nithiodote will have no significant effect up to $4 . 1 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $\mathrm { \hbar \mathrm { 6 4 . 8 \ m g / d L } }$ ) after which it will decrease the BUN concentration by up to $0 . 4 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ BUN per $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ Nithiodote. The expected peak sodium thiosulfate plasma concentration following a $1 2 . 5 \mathrm { g }$ of Nithiodote is $1 6 . 7 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

The following levels of exogenous interferences were tested and found to be clinically insignificant for BUN measurements: $1 . 3 2 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ ) acetaminophen, 2 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $2 1 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) Li acetoacetic acid, $3 . 6 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 6 5 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) acetyl salicylic acid, $1 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 5 . 3 4 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ammonium chloride, $3 4 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { L }$ $\left( 6 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } \right)$ ) Na ascorbate, 37.5 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $\mathrm { 3 8 6 \ m g / d L }$ ) Na bromide, $2 . 6 4 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ( $1 2 5 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Na cefazolin, 1.46 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $9 6 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) Na ceftriaxone, $5 . 8 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ $( 0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) dopamine $\mathrm { H C l } ,$ , 86.8 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) ethanol, $5 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ( $4 . 4 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ (Flaxedil™) gallamine triethiodide, $2 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L } )$ glucose, $2 . 5 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 1 5 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ oxidized glutathione, $5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 3 8 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ glycolic acid, $2 0 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ heparin, $2 . 4 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ (50 $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ibuprofen, $( 0 . 5 \% ) 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ intralipid, $1 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $\mathrm { 1 9 . 4 \ m g / d L }$ ) Na iodide, 1 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $\mathrm { \Omega _ { \mathrm { 1 2 \ m g / d L } } }$ ) L-cysteine, $2 5 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ $\mathrm { \sim } 0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) L-Dopa, $3 . 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ (13.5 $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ lithium chloride, $6 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ( $2 1 0 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) Na metamizole, $2 \mathrm { m m o l } / \mathrm { L }$ $( 9 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ methotrexate, $0 . 2 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 4 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ oxalate (K) monohydrate, $2 4 8 \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { L }$ $( 6 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ Na pentothal, $1 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $1 2 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ Na perchlorate, $4 . 3 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 6 9 . 5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ ) Na salicylate, $1 . 7 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 1 6 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ K thiocyanate.

The following levels of endogenous interferences were tested and found to be clinically insignificant for BUN measurements: $3 4 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { L }$ $2 8 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ bilirubin conjugated, 428 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ( $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ bilirubin unconjugated, $3 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ bicarbonate, Hct $2 0 \%$ to $6 0 \%$ PCV, $6 . 6 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ( ${ 7 4 \mathrm { m g } } / { \mathrm { d L } } )$ ) lactate, $\mathrm { p H } 6 . 8$ to 8, $3 . 5 \%$ to $1 0 \%$ total protein, $1 . 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 2 3 . 5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ ) uric acid.

Clinically significant interfering substances for TCO2 measurements are itemized below:

Samples contaminated with benzalkonium salts used as coatings for in-dwelling lines may cause significant decrease in TCO2 results. For proper line-flushing procedures refer to CLSI H11-A4. • Citrate will have no significant effect up to $1 1 . 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $( 3 4 7 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) after which it will increase the TCO2 concentration by up to $0 . 2 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ TCO2 per mmol/L citrate.

# 5. Clinical Field Precision

The external precision study was conducted to evaluate the precision of the BUN and TCO2 quantitation on the epoc System in the hands of the intended users. The study was evaluated based on CLSI guideline EP05-A3 at three different clinical sites using a different lot of epoc test card at each site. All testing was performed by existing or potential POC operators. Testing was comprised of three parts: 1) aqueous control precision using syringes, 2) whole blood precision using syringes, 3) whole blood precision using capillary tubes.

# 7. Matrix Comparison: Anticoagulant

A method comparison approach was used to compare the epoc BUN and TCO2 results in venous blood samples, collected from over 60 volunteer donors into evacuated tubes containing no additive, and further aliquoted into three (3) vacutainers containing noadditive, Li-heparin and Na-heparin to create 3-way matched samples. It was concluded from the analysis that there was no significant difference between BUN and TCO2 results in Li-heparinized, Na-heparinized and non-anticoagulated blood samples on the epoc System.

# CONCLUSION

The information provided in this pre-market notification demonstrates that the epoc BGEM Test Card and Blood Analysis System is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device for its intended use.
