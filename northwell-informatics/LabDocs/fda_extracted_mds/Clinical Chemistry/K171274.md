# 10.3 Dilution Recovery

Eight (8) native AMI samples (4 lithium heparin plasma and 4 serum) measuring above the analytical measuring range (i.e. $> 2 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L } )$ were diluted to 1:2 and 1:5 with Multi-Diluent 11. Recoveries for individual samples were all within $20 \%$ . The mean of all 1:2 dilutions was $1 0 2 . 6 \%$ . The mean of all 1:5 dilutions was $91 . 8 \%$ .

# 10.4 Hook Effect

A study was performed to evaluate hook effect. There is no hook effect with the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay up to $5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ~ { \mathsf { p g / m L } }$ .

# 10.5 Detection Limit

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined as described in CLSI protocol EP17-A2. The ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay has an LoB of $0 . 5 0 \ p \mathsf { g / m L }$ , an LoD of $1 . 6 0 \ : \mathsf { p g / m L }$ , and an LoQ of $2 . 5 0 ~ { \mathsf { p g / m L } }$ .

The LoB is defined as the highest measurement result that is likely to be observed for a blank sample. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of cardiac troponin I that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. The LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration of cardiac troponin I that can be detected at a total CV of $20 \%$ .

# 10.6 Endogenous Interference

Endogenous interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. These sample pools $( { \sim } 6 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ cTnI) were spiked with potential interferents.

# 10.9 Heterophile Interference

Heterophile interference studies were performed using lithium heparin plasma and serum spiked with high RF samples, and serum spiked with high HAMA samples. Control samples were prepared by spiking sample pools with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance stock. No interference with HAMA or RF was observed.

# 10.10 High-Sensitivity Designation

The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) Task Force on Clinical Applications of Cardiac Bio-Markers defines a high-sensitivity troponin test as one that meets the following analytical criteria:1

1. $\%$ CV at the ${ 9 9 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile value should be $\leq 1 0 \%$   
2. Measurable concentrations should be attainable at a concentration above the LoD for at least $50 \%$ of healthy individuals

The ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay meets both of these criteria.

# 10.11 Method Comparison with Predicate Device

Not applicable.

# 10.12 Matrix Comparison

Not applicable. All performance studies were performed in all applicable matrices (lithium heparin plasma and serum).

# 10.13 Clinical Studies

A clinical performance study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay in terms of the clinical concordance between the $9 \dot { 9 } ^ { \mathfrak { m } }$ percentile cutoff and the presence or absence of an adjudicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) diagnosis. Specimens were collected at 29 sites from different regions across the United States. Testing of specimens was performed at 3 sites.

In this study, the sites enrolled all patients who presented to the emergency department, or ambulatory care center equivalent, with signs or symptoms suspicious for a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. The diagnosis of AMI was performed by an independent adjudication committee which included cardiologists. The adjudication was based on the Third universal definition of myocardial infarction consensus guideline endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the World Heart Federation (WHF).

The clinical concordance study evaluated clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay in terms of its correlation to the the diagnosis of AMI.

Results were analyzed according to time from presentation to the emergency department.

Using the female-specific $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles for lithium heparin plasma $3 6 . 9 9 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ and serum $( 3 9 . 5 9 \ p 9 / \mathrm { m L } )$ , the following results were obtained.

# 510(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

# 10.14 Traceability and Value Assignment

The ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay is standardized to an internal standard manufactured using human heart homogenate. Assigned values for calibrators are traceable to this standardization.

# 10.15 Stability

The ADVIA Centaur TNIH Reagents and Calibrators are stable until the date printed on the box label when stored at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ .

The onboard stability of the ADVIA Centaur TNIH Reagents is 28 days with a calibration interval of 28 days.

# 11. Conclusions

The new ADVIA Centaur High-Sensitivity Troponin I (TNIH) assay (Reagents and Calibrators) is substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the currentlymarketed predicate device, the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT Immunoassay, cleared under 510(k) K162895.
