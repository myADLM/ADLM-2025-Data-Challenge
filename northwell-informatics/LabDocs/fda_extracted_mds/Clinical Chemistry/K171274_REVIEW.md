Additional precision studies evaluated lot-to-lot imprecision using 3 reagent lots for 6 serum and 4 plasma samples over 20 days on two instruments and provided similar results to those reported above.

Site-to-site reproducibility was evaluated on the ADVIA Centaur TNIH across 3 sites, 1 lot of reagents, for 5 days with 2 samples a day and 3 replicates a day in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. The precision reported in the site-to-site variability study was similar to the results reported above in the instrument-to-instrument study.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Two linearity studies were performed according to CLSI EP06-A ranging from 0 to $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and 2 to $2 5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . High serum and lithium heparin plasma pools were prepared by diluting native cTnI samples from AMI patients with negative samples from healthy subjects. Low pools were prepared from negative samples from healthy subjects. Each dilution series comprised of 9 levels that were prepared by mixing the high and low pools. The mean was taken from each sample tested in duplicate. Test results did not deviate from linearity by more than $10 \%$ .

Representative results for weighted linear regression are shown below:

Li Hep Plasma $\mathrm { y = 1 . 0 1 6 x - 0 . 0 2 8 p g / m L }$

Serum $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 4 3 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 3 3 9 \mathrm { p g / m L }$

The measuring range is $2 . 5 { - } 2 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ with the upper end of the measuring range being defined by the linear range of the assay. See detection limits in M. item d. below for information supporting the lower end of the measuring range.

Hook Effect:

A study was performed to evaluate hook effect. There was no hook effect with the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay up to $6 1 1 { , } 8 9 9 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ in lithium heparin plasma and up to $5 7 8 { , } 4 5 2 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ in serum.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable. The Centaur hs-TnI primary standards are traceable to a commercially available troponin assay.

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol

Limit of Blank was determined for the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay as described in CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was performed using three lots of ADVIA Centaur TNIH reagents, each on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument. 240 determinations per matrix per lot were obtained by testing four serum negative basepools or four lithium heparin plasma negative basepools in twenty replicates a day for three days. LoB was calculated non-parametrically. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-matrixinstrument combinations tested was taken as the LoB estimate for the measurement procedure

Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol

Limit of Detection studies were performed using 3 lots of ADVIA Centaur TNIH reagents, each on two ADVIA Centaur XP instruments. 640 determinations per matrix per lot were obtained by testing four low analyte serum samples or four low analyte lithium heparin plasma samples on two instruments in two replicates in two runs each day for twenty days.

The Limit of Detection was determined as the dose at which $9 5 \%$ of the measurements would be greater than the LoB. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-matrix-instrument combinations tested was taken as the LoD estimate for the measurement procedure.

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol

Six low troponin lithium heparin plasma pools and seven low troponin serum pools across three lots and two instruments were used in these studies.

For each reagent lot, the within-laboratory precision over twenty consecutive working days for each sample, expressed as $\% \mathrm { C V }$ , was plotted against the mean concentration obtained for each sample. LoQ was determined by this precision profile as the concentration where the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ was less than $20 \%$ . The largest estimate across all reagent lot-matrix-instrument combinations tested was taken as the LoQ estimate for the measurement procedure.

The sponsor claims an LoB of $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , an LoD of $1 . 6 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , and an LoQ of $2 . 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Two sample pools per matrix were tested. One sample pool had $2 0 { \cdot } 6 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ cTnI. The second sample pool had $1 0 0 0 { - } 2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ cTnI. These sample pools were spiked with potential interferents. Control samples were prepared by spiking sample pools with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance stock. Test results from samples spiked with the potential interferent were compared to test results from the control samples. At the tested concentrations, these compounds caused $< 1 0 \%$ interference on the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay.

There is no significant interference from endogenous substances listed above.

Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) Interference: The interference study was designed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 to evaluate the performance of the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay in samples containing high levels of HAMA and RF. Interference was tested at a troponin concentration near the 99th

percentile (i.e. $3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ . A total of three serum and three lithium heparin plasma samples were used in this study. The high RF $\mathrm { 1 1 0 0 \ : I U / m L } )$ sample and the high HAMA $( { \sim } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ sample were spiked into serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. Interference was $< 1 0 \%$ using the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay at all combinations of HAMA/RF and troponin tested.

Therapeutic drug interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Two sample pools per matrix were tested. One sample pool had $2 0 { \cdot } 6 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ cTnI. The second sample pool had $1 0 0 0 { - } 2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ cTnI. These sample pools were spiked with potential interferents at low and high levels. Control samples were prepared by spiking sample pools with the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance stock. At the tested concentrations, all drugs caused $< 1 0 \%$ interference on the ADVIA Centaur TNIH assay.

The following limitations are included in the labeling:

Specimens from some individuals with pathologically high gamma globulin levels may demonstrate depressed troponin values. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.

Heterophilic antibodies and rheumatoid factor in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.

Samples from patients receiving preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for therapy or diagnosis may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such samples may show either falsely elevated or falsely depressed values when tested with this method.

An unknown interference was observed in analytical spiking and dilution studies causing negative bias that may affect interpretation of patient results. The unknown interference may be due to the presence of troponin autoantibodies, which have been reported in up to $10 \%$ of patients with or without AMI and up to $20 \%$ of patients positive for rheumatoid factor. If the cTnI result is below the 99th percentile value at the first blood draw, at least two additional blood samples should be drawn before results are interpreted as negative for AMI.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable. See section 4, Clinical cut-off, below.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable. All performance studies were performed in all applicable matrices (lithium heparin plasma and serum).

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

A clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical performance of the device at the different clinical cut-offs (see section 5, Expected values/reference Range, below). A multicenter prospective study enrolled 2495 patients from Emergency

Departments presenting with chest pain or equivalent ischemic symptoms suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndromes. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an independent panel of expert physicians using criteria consistent with the 2007 Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI). Serial samples were collected from patients within 24 hours of presentation to the Emergency Department. The number of patients adjudicated with an MI was $1 3 \%$ (329/2495). The sample collection times were at $0 -$ 1.5 hours from time since presentation) and at the following timepoint relative to the time from presentation: 1.5 to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 3.5 hours, 3.5 to 4.5 hours, 4.5 to 6 hours, 6 to 9 hours, 9 to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours after presentation to the Emergency Department. Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed device’s results. Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results presented below were based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Clinical performance was estimated at overall (male and female combined across both matrices) and male- and female-specific $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile upper reference limit (URL) cut-offs for each matrix type, calculated as described in Section 5, Expected values/reference Range, below. The results are summarized below.

The following statements about cutoffs are included in the labeling:

“Using the higher male-specific 99th percentiles instead of the overall 99th percentile of $4 7 . 3 4 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { n g / L } )$ may result in a higher proportion of negative test results for males that are MI. For males that are MI, data analyzed using the male-specific cutoff versus the overall cutoff increased the false-negative rate by up to $2 . 9 \%$ .”

“Using the lower female-specific 99th percentiles instead of the overall 99th percentile of $4 7 . 3 4 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L ( n g / L ) }$ may result in a higher proportion of positive test results for females that are non-MI. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval, in the worst-case scenario (lithium-heparin plasma drawn at ${ \ge } 4 . 5 \mathrm { - } < 6 $ hours after presentation) up to $71 \%$ of positive test results for females may be non-MI.”

$b$ . Clinical specificity:

See section M.3.a., Clinical sensitivity, above.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off:

The cut-offs for this assay were determined based on the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile upper reference limit in apparently healthy adults. Please see section 5, Expected values/Reference range, below for the determination of the clinical cut-offs.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile in a population of apparently health adults with no known diseases of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or infections. Serum and lithiumheparin plasma specimens were collected from 1990 apparently health adults with no known diseases of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or infections from the United States who ranged in age from 22–91 years of age.

Both male and female subjects were included in the reference range study to determine the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile URL using a non-parametric empirical univariate distribution function. Results are as follows:

Two female subjects had troponin values of approximately $4 0 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and $5 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and were considered to be outliers. These results were not included in the 99th percentile determination. The sponsor demonstrated that the change in the cut-off values (either for women or overall) were not impacted by this exclusion.

Overall (combination of all cut-offs for both serum and plasma): $4 7 . 3 4 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
