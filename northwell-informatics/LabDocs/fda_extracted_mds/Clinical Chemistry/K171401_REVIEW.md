# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

No standard or guidance documents were referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL $4 { + } 1$ :

Sulphanilic acid reacts with sodium nitrite to form diazotized sulphanilic acid. In the presence of accelerator (cetrimide), conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin react with diazotized sulphanilic acid to form azobilirubin. The increase of absorbance at $5 4 6 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the total bilirubin concentration.

ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN DIRECT $4 { + } 1$ :

Sulphanilic acid reacts with sodium nitrite to form diazotized sulphanilic acid. In the absence of accelerator (cetrimide), only conjugated bilirubin reacts with diazoted sulphanilic acid to form azobilirubin. The increase of absorbance at $5 4 6 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the direct bilirubin concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated using one serum control material, one human serum pool, and one spiked human serum pool sample. Within-run and total imprecision results were obtained by performing two runs per day, two measures per run, for 3 concentrations of samples on two instruments for twenty days. The results are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL $4 { + } 1$ :

The linearity of total bilirubin was studied by mixing a patient serum pool sample with a high bilirubin value $2 5 . 1 3 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and a sample with low value $\mathrm { 0 . 2 5 \ m g / d L } )$ to obtain 11 levels with equidistant concentration, and then measuring the total bilirubin concentration of each of the 11 levels. All samples were assayed in triplicates. Data was analyzed using $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ , $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ and $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order least square regressions. A first order linear regression was generated as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 1 0 6 7 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 2 3 7 8 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 4
$$

The results of the study support the measuring range of 0.25 to $2 5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$

A study evaluating the 1:5 auto-dilution used several spiked samples with total bilirubin concentrations between 32.80 to $1 1 5 . 6 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The $\%$ recovery between the expected value and observed values were within $10 \%$ for samples with total bilirubin concentrations up to $6 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Therefore the sponsor claimed that samples with total bilirubin concentration greater than the assay claimed measuring range and up to $6 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ can be auto-diluted and assayed.

ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN DIRECT $4 { + } 1$ :

The linearity of direct bilirubin was studied by mixing a sample with high value ( $1 0 . 5 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and a sample with low value $( 0 . 0 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ to obtain 11 levels with equidistant concentrations and then measuring the direct bilirubin concentration of each of the 11 levels. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd and 3rd order least square regressions. A first order linear regression was generated as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 9 4 3 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 2 2 4 4 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 5
$$

The results of the study support the measuring range of 0.08 to $1 0 . 5 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

A study evaluating the 1:5 auto-dilution study using several spiked samples with direct bilirubin concentrations between 10.86 and $4 7 . 4 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The $\%$ recovery between the expected value and observed values were within $10 \%$ . Therefore the sponsor claimed that sample with total bilirubin concentration greater than the assay claimed measuring range and up to $5 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ can be auto-diluted and assayed.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The calibrator for the assay is ELITech Clinical Systems ELICAL 2 (cleared in k110780).

Controls recommended for the assay are ELITROL I and ELITROL II (cleared in k110780).

Stability:

An On-board stability study was performed for 30 days. Protocols and acceptance criteria for the stability study were reviewed and found acceptable. The study results support an on-board stability for 28 days for both total and direct bilirubin reagents.

A real time shelf-life stability study has been performed for 24 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ . Protocols and acceptance criteria for the stability study were reviewed and found acceptable. The study supports a real time stability for both products at 24 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The limits of blank (LoB), detection (LoD) and quantitation (LoQ) studies were conducted on two Selectra Pro Analyzers with two lots of reagents. The LoB was determined by analyzing a blank sample 60 times. LoD and LoQ studies each used 4 serum pools measured 15 times for both assays for a total of 60 measurements for each. The serum pools for LoD had concentrations approximately 4 times the LoB. LoQ was determined by analyzing 4 serum pools with analyte concentrations near the expected LoQ. Results are summarized below:

The ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL $4 { + } 1$ assay has a measuring range of 0.25 to $2 5 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN DIRECT $4 { + } 1$ assay has a measuring range of 0.08 to $1 0 . 5 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Testing for interfering substances was performed on different concentrations for each interfering substances on both total and direct bilirubin assays. Samples with increasing amounts of triglycerides, hemoglobin, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic, and ascorbic acid were tested in triplicates and compared to the same sample without the interfering substances. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does not cause $> 1 0 \%$ change between the tested samples and the control sample. Results are summarized in the tables below.

ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL $4 { + } 1$ :

The two levels of serum pool samples with a low and high concentrations of (1.0 and $1 5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ of total bilirubin were tested and yielded the following results.
