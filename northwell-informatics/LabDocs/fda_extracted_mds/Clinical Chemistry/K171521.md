# c. Detection limit

A sensitivity study was performed to evaluate the lower limits of detection for each the analytes on the DUS strips (DUS 10, DUS 2AC) utilizing the DUS R-50S analyzer. Negative urine was spiked with standard materials to obtain the desired concentrations. 90 replicates were obtained for each concentration. Sensitivity was defined as the cutoff in which $2 9 5 \%$ of the contrived pooled measurements were trace or the first positive result. The $\mathsf { p H }$ , specific gravity and creatinine were not evaluated for the lower limits of sensitivity.

# e. Analytical specificity / Limitation

As with all laboratory tests, definitive diagnostic or therapeutic decisions should not be based on any single result of method. Substances that cause abnormal urine color may affect the readability of test pads in urinalysis reagent strips. Urinary ascorbic acid concentrations as low as $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ can cause interference in specimens with low concentrations of glucose, blood, nitrite and bilirubin.

Urobilinogen: The absence of urobilinogen in the specimen can’t be determined. The test area will react with interfering substances known to react with Ehrlich’s reagent, such as p- aminosalicylic acid. Drugs containing azo gantrisin (sulfamethoxazol) or high Bilirubin may give a masking golden color. Preservative Formaldehyde may cause false negative. The test is not reliable method for the detection of porphobilinogen.

Glucose: Ascorbic acid (more than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ ) may cause false negative result at the low level of glucose. Ketones reduce the sensitivity of the test. Moderately high ketone level $\mathrm { ( > 4 0 m g / d l ) }$ may cause a false negative for specimen containing small amount of glucose $( 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l } )$ . Chlorine Bleach $( \geq 1 \% )$ , low SG and formaldehyde urine may cause false positive result at the low level.

Bilirubin: Metabolites of drugs, such as selenium $( \geq 2 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , phenazopyridine $( \geq 3 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ may cause false positives. p-Amino salicylic acid $\mathrm { \ } ( \geq 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ can produce a yellow-orange to red color response, which may interfere with the interpretation of false positive bilirubin readings. Ascorbic acid $\mathrm { ( { \ge } 4 0 m g / d L ) }$ may cause false negative.

Ketones: Low level false positive reactions may be seen in highly concentrated urine specimens (high specific gravity) or in specimens containing large amounts of levodopa metabolites drug such as captopril. The uroprotective drug mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) and other free-sulfhydryl compounds produce false-positive results in ketone methods that are based on the Legal reaction (alkaline sodium nitroprusside).

$\mathbf { p H }$ : If the excessive urine remains on the strip because of improper test procedure, it is possible that the acidic buffer in protein portion comes out and affect the pH portion, then pH result may be decreased than the actual. This phenomenon is called” run-over effect.”

Blood: Elevated specific gravity or protein in urine may reduce the reactivity of the blood test portion. Microbial peroxidase associated with urinary tract infection may cause false positive results. Ascorbic acid concentrations $( > 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d l } )$ may cause false negatives at the low level of blood. Substances that cause abnormal urine color, such as drug containing azo dyes, nitrofurantoin and riboflavin may cause false positive result. Strong oxidizing cleaning agents such as chlorine bleach cause false positive results.

Specific Gravity (SG): High-buffered alkaline urine may cause diminished result, whereas high- buffered acidic urine may cause slightly elevated result.

Protein: False positive results may be found in strongly basic urine $\left( \mathrm { p H } 9 \right)$ ). The interpretation of results is also difficult in turbid urine specimens. Metabolites of drugs, such as acetaminophen, hemoglobin may cause false positives. Pigments such as bilirubin and azo-containing compounds cause false result with the color reaction.

Nitrite: Ascorbic acid $\mathrm { ( { > } 4 0 m g / d L ) }$ ) may cause false negative result with low level of nitrite containing $( < 0 . 0 3 \mathrm { m g } )$ urine. The negative result does not always mean that the patient is free from bacteriuria. Pink spots or pink edges should not be interpreted as a positive result. Medication such as phenazopyridine or other azocontaining compounds or other dyes cause false positive results.

Leukocyte: The test result may not always be consistent with the leukocyte cell number by the microscopic examination. Strong oxidizing agents such as chlorine bleach and formaldehyde may cause positive reactions. Decreased results may be seen with elevated glucose $\left( \geq 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l } \right)$ , high specific gravity, oxalic acid and high level of albumin $\mathrm { ( \ge 1 0 0 0 m g / d L ) }$ . Drugs causing decreased or false negative results include tetracycline, captopril. Substance that color urine, such as a nitrofurantoin, riboflavin, selenium and bilirubin, may cause false positive results.

Microalbumin: The following substances may cause false positive results; a large amount of hemoglobin $( \geq 5 \mathrm { m g / d l } )$ , visibly bloody urine, highly alkaline urine $\mathrm { ( p H } { \ge } 9 \mathrm { ) }$ , disinfectant including quaternary ammonium compound. Substances that cause abnormal urine color, such as drug containing nitrofurantoin, riboflavin may affect the results (false positives).

Creatinine: Nitrofurantoin $\scriptstyle \left( \geq 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } \right)$ , Riboflavin $( { \geq } 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ and a large amount of hemoglobin $( \geq 5 \mathrm { m g / d l } )$ cause false positive results. Visibly dark brown color urine may affect the results (false positives). Substances that cause abnormal urine color, such as drug containing nitrofurantoin, riboflavin may affect the results (false positives).

Microalbumin to Creatinine Ratio: A low microalbumin result $\mathrm { { ( 1 0 m g / L ) } }$ in combination with strongly diluted urine (creatinine result of $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d l } )$ could indicate a microalbumin concentration below the sensitivity limit. In that case, consider testing a new specimen, preferably a first morning collection, for greater confidence in the result.

# f. Method Comparison study

The method comparison study was conducted at three clinical sites with a total of 867 samples. The results from the DUS R-50S urine chemistry system (DUS R50S instrument, DUS10 and DUS2AC reagent strips) was compared to the predicate device (Siemens Clinitek Status $^ +$ urine chemistry instrument using Multistix 10SG and CLINITEK Microalbumin 2 test strips).

All of the coefficient of correlation estimated among (MultiStix 10SG vs DUS10 / CLINITEK Microalbumin $2 \ : \mathrm { V s }$ DUS 2AC) is statistically significant at $1 \%$ level. A comparison results between DUS R-50S and CLINITEK Status urinalysis analyzer revealed a very high concordance of between $90 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 \%$ . It results were obtained by 867 samples at 3 hospitals.

The majority of analysis display $90 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 \%$ concordance over all blocks on comparing the results of primary diagnosis. When the results, which fall between neighboring blocks, are taken into account, concordance increases to around 95- $100 \%$ .

# G. Expected values/Reference range:

Urobilinogen: The normal urobilinogen range is 0.1 to 1.0 Ehrlich unit /dl. If results exceed the concentration of $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d l }$ , the patient and the urine specimen should be evaluated further.

Glucose: The kidney normally excretes small amounts of glucose. Concentrations of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ may be considered as abnormal if found consistently.

Bilirubin: Normally no bilirubin is detectable in urine by even the most sensitive methods. Even trace amounts of bilirubin are sufficiently abnormal to require further investigation.

Ketones: Ketone bodies should not be detected in normal urine specimens with this reagent.

pH: Urine values generally range from pH 4.5 - 8.

Blood: Normally, no hemoglobin is detectable in urine. When hemoglobin appears in urine it may indicate kidney disease or a urinary tract disorder. Blood may often be found in the urine of menstruating females.

Specific Gravity (SG): The normal SG of urine ranges from 1.001 to 1.035.

Protein: Normal urine specimens ordinarily contain some protein $( { < } 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ therefore only persistent elevated levels of urine protein indicate kidney or urinary tract disease. The persistent results of trace level or over indicate significance proteinuria and thus further clinical testing is needed to evaluate the significant of results.

Nitrite: Normally no nitrite is detectable in urine.

Leukocyte: Normally no leukocytes are detectable in urine.

Microalbumin: Normal albumin excretion in urine is under 30 mg/day.

Microalbuminuria is indicated with results of $> 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / }$ day.

Creatinine: The urine of healthy individuals contains creatinine. Generally, healthy individuals excrete $1 \mathrm { g }$ creatinine per day. Very low creatinine results can be caused by adulteration of the urine specimen or by severe renal failure.

Microalbumin to Creatinine Ratio: Microalbumin is normally present in urine at concentrations of less than $3 0 \mathrm { m g }$ albumin/g creatinine. Microalbuminuria is indicated -Levey AS, Coresh J, Balk E, et al. National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, stratification.

# Conclusion

DUS R-50S (Urine Chemistry System) has the same device characteristics as the predicate device. The results of the testing show that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
