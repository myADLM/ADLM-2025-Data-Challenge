Fig. 1 WowGoHealth, Model GSH-BGM902 with its components annotated

 Test principle

When glucose reacts with the reagents on the test strips, an electrical current is produced. The current is proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The meter will calculate glucose concentration based on the current measured.

$\bullet$ Format of results The device can show results either in $" \mathrm { m g / d L } ^ { \prime \prime }$ or “mmol/L”. The factory set default for the meter is mg/dL.

 Composition and levels of control material The control solution is made up of D-glucose, Viscosity Modifier, and Preservatives. Control solution Level 1, Level 2 or 3 are available and sold separately.

 User maintenance needs The device is recommended to be stored in its case, in a clean dry place at 35.6 to $8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$

(2 to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).

Replacing the battery will not reset the stored testing results; however users need to reset the device’s date and time after installing or replacing the batteries.

 Features of device

Apart from the existing measurement features and user interface of the device’s predicate, the device is featured with Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality which wirelessly transfers the latest test result to an APP run on a mobile device every time when a test is performed successfully. In this operational scenario, the user needs to install an APP to his/her mobile device to receive the test result transmitted from the meter; in case the data transmission fails, user can still manually enter the test result to the APP. The meter does not play any message during the data transmission, but user can check the APP on his/her mobile device to confirm if the test result is received. The meter still keeps the test results in the memory after transmitting.

 Features designed to minimize the risk of bloodborne pathogen transmission among patients

Users are recommended to clean and disinfect the meter and lancing device at least once per week following the Cleaning and Disinfection Instructions in device’s user guide to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Clorox® Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No. 67619-12) have been shown to be safe for use with the meter and lancing device and that these wipe should be used for both cleaning and disinfection.

# Device features controlled by the software:

Fig. 2 Meter’s Displays and user messages

 Error messages

The meter is featured with the following error messages for users to understand the device’s status so as to take appropriate measures.

E_1: The temperature is too low. E_2: The temperature is too high. E_3: Battery Low. E_4: Memory damaged. E_5: The strip is wet or used. E_6: Error in meter or strip. E_7: The blood sample is not sufficient. HI: The glucose level is too high. LO: The glucose level is too low.  User prompts

To perform a test, a glucose test strip is inserted into the top of the meter (meter). When a small drop of blood is applied to the end of the test strip, glucose reacts with the reagents on the test strips, producing an electrical current that is proportional to the blood glucose concentration in the blood sample. The blood glucose concentration is calculated by the glucose meter and is based on the electrical current measured. The quantitative glucose concentration (in mg/dL or mmol/L) is displayed on the meter’s LCD screen.

 Alarms and other feed back The meter is featured with an alarm clock which can be used as a reminder to users for time to measure his/her blood glucose.

# Modified Device and Comparison:

The test strips, control solutions, lancing device, and lancets are identical to previously cleared devices. The fundamental scientific technology of the WowGoHealth, Model GSH-BGM902 remains unchanged from the legally marketed predicate device, SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351).

For the proposed WowGoHealth, Model GSH-BGM902 device, the modifications from the cleared SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351), are minor and include the following:

 Reposition of the control test flag (“cotr”) on meter display (see Fig.2) This original control test flag $( ^ { \prime \prime } \mathsf { C } ^ { \prime \prime } )$ was displayed via a 7-segment font to the right of the three large 7-segment fonts for glucose reading display. This difference is concretely illustrated in Fig.3.

Fig.3. Meter display while performing the control test

 Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality to replace the original RS232 cable Owing to the meter ‘s Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality supporting Bluetooth 4.0 and BLP, the WowGoHealth, Model GSH-BGM902 has the capability to wirelessly transfer the latest test result to an APP run on a mobile device every time when a test is performed successfully. In this operational scenario, the user needs to install an APP to his/her mobile device to receive the test result transmitted from the meter; in case the data transmission fails, user can still manually enter the test result to the APP. During the wireless data transmission, the “bLE” and test time on meter’s display would flash alternately (see Fig. 4). The meter does not play any message during the data transmission, but user can check the APP on his/her mobile device to confirm if the test result is received. The meter still keeps the test results in the meter.

# Summary of design control activities/testing: 21 CFR 807.92(b)(1)

The WowGoHealth, Model GSH-BGM902 was developed and documented within Biotest Medical Corporation’s design control procedures in compliance with 21 CFR 820.30, as with the cleared SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351). We believe that the modifications to the device did not necessitate any new requirements for review and testing above those of the predicate product for except the usability study on the modified device’s Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality and the required bench study on the modified device’s robustness to the cleaning and disinfection procedure cleared in SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351) after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles. In addition, the safety and reliability testing, EMC testing, and FCC testing were adequately executed in the qualified outsourced labs using the protocols following applicable CDRH guidelines and related standards.

The risk analysis and verification and validation activities conducted are described below.

# Risk Analysis:

The risk analysis was conducted in accordance with the most updated EN ISO 14971 standard, which specifies the process for identifying hazards, estimating and evaluating associated risks, controlling the risks, and Monitoring the effectives of the controls.

All the risks for the identified potential hazards caused by the proposed device modifications were identified and evaluated for severity and occurrence probability. Controls were identified and, where risks were deemed unacceptable, mitigations were identified and implemented. Verification and validation testing showed the risk control to be acceptable. None of the proposed modifications to the SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351) presented unacceptable risks or raised new issues regarding the safety and/or effectiveness of the device, evidenced by the device’s risk management summary report.

# Verification and Validation Activities:

Verification and Validation (V&V) activities were identified by assessment of their impact of the modifications, per the risk analysis in the device’s risk management summary report. The analyses revealed that the modifications required similar V&V testing to the predicate SuperCheck Plus device, with similar acceptance criteria, as testing revealed no significant additional risk from the modifications. Testing was performed to establish that design outputs met pre-established design inputs as per design specifications (verification), specifically for the Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality feature. Design validation ensured that the design meets user needs, and validation activities were conducted as necessary (per 21 CFR820.30). The design change verification and validation activities for all the changes, including software-related changes are described in the Software V&V report in this submission. All the documents, including test reports, referenced are on file at Biotest Medical Corporation.

# Conclusions: 21 CFR 807.92(b) (3)

The modified WowGoHealth, Model GSH-BGM902 has the same intended use and fundamental scientific technology as the previous version of the device, which received 510(k) clearance K141351).

Modifications to the cleared device include reposition of the control test flag (“cotr”) on meter display, Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality to replace the original RS232cable, and the meter’s housing color change. The modifications maintain the integrity of the SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351) as described in the original clearance in terms of the intended use of the device (i.e., the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary blood), and the fundamental scientific technology employed. For the reason outlined above, the WowGoHealth, Model GSH-BGM902 is eligible for Special 510(k) in accordance with the relevant FDA guidance.

Biotest Medical Corporation has conducted a risk analysis and has performed the necessary verification and validation activities to demonstrate that the design outputs of the modified device meet the design requirements.
