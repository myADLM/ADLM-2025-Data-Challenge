# Device Description: 21 CFR 807.92(a)(4)

# General device description:

 Physical components of the system The NuvoMed Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Model BGM-6/0352) is a product kit consisting of a blood glucose meter, test strips, a lancing device, sterile lancets, instructions for use, and a carrying case. No control solution is included in the kit; however, user may purchase NuvoMed Control Solution Level 1, 2 or 3 from his/her system provider if needed. The NuvoMed Blood Glucose Meter uses NuvoMed Blood Glucose Test Strips. Neither the meter nor the test strips will work when used with any other brand of glucose products.

Fig. 1 provides an image of the device, showing the front front/side angle and the back of the device and with the meter’s components annotated.

# Appearance and Key functions of the meter

Fig. 1 NuvoMed Wireless, Model BGM-6/0352 with its components annotated

1.Test strip slot- When the strip is inserted into the slot, the meter will automatically turn on.   
2. LCD Display - Guide you through the test using symbols and simple messages.   
3. M Button - Power ON/OFF, also for memory recalling mode, please refer to manual for detailed function description.   
4.C Button - Setting mode, please refer to manual for detailed function description.   
5.Battery Compartment - Where batteries are located.   
6.Ejector - Remove used strip

 Test principle

When glucose reacts with the reagents on the test strips, an electrical current is produced. The current is proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The meter will calculate glucose concentration based on the current measured.

The device can show results either in $" \mathrm { m g / d L ^ { \prime \prime } }$ or “mmol/L”. The factory set default for the meter is $\mathsf { m g / d L }$ .

 Composition and levels of control material The control solution is made up of D-glucose, Viscosity Modifier, and Preservatives. Control solution Level 1, Level 2 or 3 are available and sold separately.   
 User maintenance needs The device is recommended to be stored in its case, in a clean dry place at 35.6 to $8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (2 to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). Replacing the battery will not reset the stored testing results; however users need to reset the device’s date and time after installing or replacing the batteries.

 Features of device

Apart from the existing measurement features and user interface of the device’s predicate, the device is featured with Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality which wirelessly transfers the latest test result to an APP run on an iOS device every time when a test is performed successfully. In this operational scenario, the user needs to install an APP to his/her iOS device to receive the test result transmitted from the meter. The meter does not play any message during the data transmission, but user can check the APP on his/her iOS device to confirm if the test result is received. The meter still keeps the test results in the memory after transmitting.

 Features designed to minimize the risk of bloodborne pathogen transmission among patients

Users are recommended to clean and disinfect the meter and lancing device at least once per week following the Cleaning and Disinfection Instructions in device’s user guide to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Clorox® Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No. 67619-12) have been shown to be safe for use with the meter and lancing device and that these wipe should be used for both cleaning and disinfection.

# Device features controlled by the software:

$\bullet$ Displays and user messages Refer to Fig. 2 for details.

Fig. 2 Meter’s Displays and user messages

 Error messages

The meter is featured with the following error messages for users to understand the device’s status so as to take appropriate measures.

E_3: Battery Low.

E_4: Memory damaged.

E_5: The strip is wet or used.

E_6: Error in meter or strip.

E_7: The blood sample is not sufficient.

E_8: Fail to reset date and time after installing or changing batteries in device’s “Start Up” mode.

HI: The glucose level is too high.

LO: The glucose level is too low.

 User prompts

To perform a test, a glucose test strip is inserted into the top of the meter. When a small drop of blood is applied to the end of the test strip, glucose reacts with the reagents on the test strips, producing an electrical current that is proportional to the blood glucose concentration in the blood sample. The blood glucose concentration is calculated by the glucose meter and is based on the electrical current measured. The quantitative glucose concentration (in mg/dL or mmol/L) is displayed on the meter’s LCD screen.

# Modified Device and Comparison:

The test strips, control solutions, lancing device, and lancets are identical to previously cleared devices. The fundamental scientific technology of the NuvoMed Wireless, Model

BGM-6/0352 remains unchanged from the legally marketed predicate device, SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351).

For the proposed device device, the modifications from the cleared SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351), include the following:

 New PCB with new MCU (micro controller unit) providing the same excitation voltage (bias voltage applied to the test strip) and the same reaction current sensing mechanism as those of the device’s predicate (K141351). Change to positive display LCD and reposition of the control test flag (“cotr”) on meter display (see Fig.3) The device’s LCD is changed from negative display LCD to positive display LCD. This original control test flag $( " \mathbf { C } ^ { \prime \prime } )$ was displayed via a 7-segment font to the right of the three large 7-segment fonts for glucose reading display; for the proposed device, the control test flag (“cotr”) is used instead.

![](images/eaf780435c8045045394ce359cc3aef664d9546bf165fd82019e1e329afb8998.jpg)  
Fig.3. Meter display while performing the control test

Change to Bluetooth mediated data transmission and removal of RS232 phone jack port for cable data download to PC   
Owing to the meter ‘s Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality supporting Bluetooth 4.0 and BLP, the NuvoMed Wireless, Model BGM-6/0352 has the capability to wirelessly transfer the latest test result to an APP run on an iOS device every time when a test is performed successfully. In this operational scenario, the user needs to install Samico Health APP to his/her iOS device to receive the test result transmitted from the meter. The meter does not play any message during the data transmission, but user can check the APP on his/her iOS device to confirm if the test result is received. The meter still keeps the test result in the meter.   
With this new feature, the original RS232 phone jack port for cable data download to PC is therefore removed.

 Addition of an Error message, E_8 The proposed device requires that when users first install the batteries or every time they replace the device’s batteries, the device (meter) will enter “Start Up” mode. Users will see an $" { \mathsf { S } } ^ { \prime \prime }$ in the center and the “SET” at the right upper corner of meter screen. Users must set up correct date, time and measurement unit in “Start Up” mode before they can use the meter. As a result of this new feature, an Error message, E_8 is added to indicate the state when users fail to reset date and time correctly after installing or changing batteries.

# Summary of design control activities/testing: 21 CFR 807.92(b)(1)

The NuvoMed Wireless, Model BGM-6/0352 was developed and documented within Biotest Medical Corporation’s design control procedures in compliance with 21 CFR 820.30, as with the cleared SuperCheck Plus ,Model 5228-S (K141351). We believe that the modifications to the device did not necessitate any new requirements for review and testing above those of the predicate product for except the usability study on the modified device’s Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality and the required bench study on the modified device’s robustness to the cleaning and disinfection procedure cleared in SuperCheck Plus ,Model 5228-S (K141351) after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles. In addition, the safety and reliability testing, EMC testing, and FCC testing were adequately executed in the qualified outsourced labs using the protocols following applicable CDRH guidelines and related standards.

The risk analysis and verification and validation activities conducted are described below.

# Risk Analysis

The risk analysis was conducted in accordance with the most updated EN ISO 14971 standard, which specifies the process for identifying hazards, estimating and evaluating associated risks, controlling the risks, and Monitoring the effectives of the controls.

All the risks for the identified potential hazards caused by the proposed device modifications were identified and evaluated for severity and occurrence probability. Controls were identified and, where risks were deemed unacceptable, mitigations were identified and implemented. Verification and validation testing showed the risk control to be acceptable. None of the proposed modifications to the SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351) presented unacceptable risks or raised new issues regarding the safety and/or effectiveness of the device, evidenced by the device’s risk management summary report.

# Verification and Validation Activities

Verification and Validation (V&V) activities were identified by assessment of their impact of the modification, per the risk analysis in the device’s risk management summary report. The analyses revealed that the modifications required similar V&V testing to the predicate SuperCheck Plus device, with similar acceptance criteria, as testing revealed no significant additional risk from the modifications. Testing was performed to establish that design outputs met pre-established design inputs as per design specifications (verification), specifically for the Bluetooth mediated data transmission functionality feature. Design validation ensured that the design meets user needs, and validation activities were conducted as necessary (per 21 CFR820.30). The design change verification and validation activities for all the changes, including software-related changes are described in the Software V&V report in this submission. All the documents, including test reports, referenced are on file at Biotest Medical Corporation.

# Conclusions: 21 CFR 807.92(b)(3)

The modified NuvoMed Wireless, Model BGM-6/0352 has the same intended use and fundamental scientific technology as the previous version of the device, which received 510(k) clearance K141351).

Modifications to the cleared device include new PCB with new MCU (micro controller unit), change to positive display LCD and reposition of the control test flag (“cotr”) on meter display, change to Bluetooth mediated data transmission and removal of RS232 phone jack port for cable data download to PC, addition of an Error message, E_8, and the meter’s housing color change. The modifications maintain the integrity of the SuperCheck Plus, Model 5228-S (K141351) as described in the original clearance in terms of the intended use of the device (i.e., the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary blood), and the fundamental scientific technology employed. For the reason outlined above, the NuvoMed Wireless, Model BGM-6/0352 is eligible for Special $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ in accordance with the relevant FDA guidance.

Biotest Medical Corporation has conducted a risk analysis and has performed the necessary verification and validation activities to demonstrate that the design outputs of the modified device meet the design requirements.

In summary, the NuvoMed Wirelss, Model BGM-6/0352 described in this submission is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
