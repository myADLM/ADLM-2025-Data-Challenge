Dear Dr. Claire Dora:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

Device Name: ADVIA Centaur® Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) (AB12) Assay

# Reagents:

Classification Name: Vitamin B12 test system   
Trade Name: ADVIA Centaur® Active-B12 (Holotranscobalmin) (AB12) assay   
Common Name: B12 test   
Governing Regulation: 21CFR 862.1810 Device   
Classification: Class II   
Classification Panel: Clinical Chemistry   
Product Code: CDD

# Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed:

ADVIA Centaur Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) (AB12) assay, K160757

# Intended Use of Device:

The ADVIA Centaur Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) (AB12) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative measurement of holotranscobalamin (holoTC) in human serum using the ADVIA Centaur XP system. Active-B12 (holotranscobalamin) is used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency.

# Description of Device:

The ADVIA Centaur AB12 assay is a fully automated, two-step direct immunoassay using chemiluminescent technology. The assay utilizes an acridinium ester-labeled anti-transcobalamin antibody as the Lite Reagent. The Solid Phase consists of biotinylated anti-holotranscobalamin antibody coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic latex microparticles.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The modified ADVIA Centaur AB12 assay is being compared to the cleared ADVIA Centaur AB12 assay (k160757) for the quantitative measurement of holotranscobalamin (holoTC) in human serum.

# Modification of Device:

The special ${ \tt5 1 0 k }$ modification ADVIA Centaur AB12 assay consisted of a change to the calibration to be traceable to the WHO International Standard for Holotranscobalamin.

# Comparison of the subject device with the predicate device:

The modified ADVIA Centaur® AB12 assay is being compared to the cleared ADVIA Centaur® AB12 assay (k160757).

# Summary of Non-Clinical Performance

Based on the risk analysis, the modifications to the Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) (AB12) assay could affect the accuracy, linearity, precision, and detection limits of the assay as well as the reference range.

Verification, validation and testing activities were conducted to establish performance of the modified device, which included:

Accuracy by correlation   
Dilution Linearity   
20-day precision – repeatability and within-run   
Detection capability - Limit of blank / detection / quantification   
Dilution recovery of WHO IRP (NIBSC 03/178)   
Proficiency sample testing   
Reference range / expected value for asymptomatic population

The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

# Conclusion:

The results presented in this 510(k) premarket submission demonstrate that the candidate assay (ADVIA Centaur® Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin)(AB12) assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Substantial equivalence of the modified device, ADVIA Centaur AB12 assay is claimed to the predicate device cleared in k160757. The modification to the assay calibration has not changed the intended use, as described in the labelling, nor has it altered the fundamental assay technology of the device.
