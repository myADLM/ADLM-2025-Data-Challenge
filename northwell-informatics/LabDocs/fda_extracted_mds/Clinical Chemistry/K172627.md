# G. Test Principle:

The test is a qualitative, solid phase, double antibodies sandwich immunochromatographic assay. Each test device contains mouse monoclonal anti- $\cdot \beta$ - hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate pre-dried on a pad. Mouse monoclonal anti$\mathfrak { a }$ -hCG antibody (on the Test Line) and goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (on the Control Line) are coated and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane.

For the cassette device, the sample is pipette onto the sample well.

During the test, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti- $\cdot \beta$ -hCG antibody- colloidal gold conjugate specific to the beta subunit of hCG) and forms a complex. The complex migrates along the membrane to the mouse anti- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ -hCG antibody test region (T), and remains captured in the T line.

J．Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance a. Precision/Reproducibility

The study was conducted in three（3） sites by a total of 9 operators with 3 lots of proposed device over 5 non-consecutive days. The samples were used with hCG spiked at the concentrations of 0, 16, 18.75, 20, 25, 27.5 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ in urine. The result demonstrated that all the test results of samples with the HCG concentration higher than 25 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ are positive, and $9 8 \%$ of the test results of samples with the HCG concentration lower than $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ are negative. The colour of test line should keep consistant for each concentration sample.

According to the consistency of test results of the same sample, it can also be determined that the reagent has good repeatability between lots and within lot.

# b. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The test is calibrated against the WHO International Standard 5th WHO Chorionic Gonadotrophin （NIBSC code: 07/364）

# Stability:

The applicant claims a 24-month shelf life for the test when stored at 36-86ºF (2- $3 0 \mathrm { ‰}$ .

# Expected values :

1. Negative results are expected in healthy non-pregnant women 2. The amount of hCG will vary greatly with gestational age and between individuals.

# c. Detection limit:

The study was conducted in three（3） sites by a total of 3 operators and by 30 volunteers with 3 lots of proposed device over 5 non-consecutive days. The samples were used with hCG spiked at the concentrations of 0, 12.5, 16, 18.75, 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5, 50 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ in urine.

Each concentration was detected for 90 times totally in each test sites, 60 times by professionals using professional test kit and Home use test kit for either 30 times respectively, and 30 times by lay users in total. The comprehensive test result statistics demonstrated that the positive ratio of samples containing more than 25 mIU/mL HCG are more than $9 5 \%$ , so the minimum detection limit of the reagent is HCG $2 5 \mathrm { \ m I U / m L }$ ; about $50 \%$ of the test results of samples containing 22.5 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ HCG are positive.

# Effects of urine pH：

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pH. Negative and positive hCG urine samples $( 2 5 \mathrm { \ m I U / m L }$ ) were tested across a pH range of 3-10. The results demonstrate that $\mathsf { p H }$ ranging from 3 to 10 in urine samples does not interfere with the performance of the test.

# Specific Gravity:

A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine specific gravity on the device. The device was challenged with negative urine and positive urine with specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.050. The results demonstrate that specific gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.050in urine samples does not interfere with the performance of the test.

# High dose hook effect study:

The test was evaluated for high dose hook effect. Negative urine specimens were spiked with high hCG concentration of of ranging from $5 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ to 2000,000 mIU/mL.All samples yielded the expected positive results. This study demonstrates that this device shows no hook effect up to 2,000,000 mIU/mL hCG.

# Effects of hCG β-core fragment:

Interference testing was performed to evaluate whether high levels of beta core fragment interfere with the device. Negative urine hCG （containing $0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG,16mIU/mL HCG）and positive urine samples (containing $2 7 . 5 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L \ h C G } )$ were spiked with hCG beta core fragment standard (traceable to WHO reference reagent 99/708) at several different concentrations up to $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The samples were tested using 3 different lots. Samples of each concentration were tested 10 times with the professional and lay-user respectively. However, the results demonstrated that no hook effect was observed at an hCG $\beta$ -core fragment concentration up to $1 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

# 2. Comparison Study:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Totally 360 fresh women urine samples were tested at 3 sites. According to synchronous test results by the predicate device and candidate device by professionals, there were153 positive samples and 207 negative samples and all the test

results were the same as expected. The test results obtained by the lay-users and by the professionals with predicate device were exactly the same, which means the total agreement rate was $100 \%$ .

All lay users tested their own urine by themselves with David Home Pregnancy Test Cassette according to the instructions for use in English.

# b.Lay-user study:

After finishing the comparison study, 40 female volunteers aged from 18-45 and of different occupation and education were selected from each of the three sites, for a total of 120 volunteers to participate in the lay-user study and and fill-out questionnaires to evaluate the users comprehension of the instructions for use. Lay users conducted the test according to the English instructions for use for the David Home Pregnancy Test Cassette without any assistance. After finishing the test on their own samples, all the 120 volunteers were asked to test 3 other samples spiked with HCG of different concentrations, ( HCG $0 \mathrm { m I U / m L } .$ , $\mathrm { H C G 2 0 m I U / m L }$ , and $\mathrm { H C G 2 7 . 5 m I U / m L }$ ). Every volunteer randomly selected one set of double-blind numbered samples to test. The results showed that all the test results of samples containing $2 7 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ of HCG are positive and $9 9 \%$ of the test results of samples containing $2 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ of HCG are negative.

Every lay-user participant was asked to answer the Likert scale style questions in the questionnaire after finishing the above test. The respondents specified their level of agreement or disagreement to a statement on a scale of 1 to 5,for example, 1-strongly disagree, 2-disagree, 3-neither agree or disagree, 4-agree, and 5-strongly agree. The results of the questionnaire reflected that the lay-users found the test to be easy to use and that they did not have trouble understanding the labeling or interpreting results. The Flesch-Kincaid software was used to assess the readability of the packaging labels for lay-user use and the results show that the labels can be understood by people with no more than 8th grade education.
