Dear Tracey Wielinski:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR

Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (http://www.fda.gov/DICE) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Device Name Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indications for Use (Describe)   
The Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Dario LC Blood Glucose Meter, Dario Glucose Test Strips, Dario Glucose Control Solutions and the Dario App as the display component of the Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

The Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.

The Dario Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the Dario LC Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip.

# Trade Name:

Dario $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# Common Name:

Glucose Test System

Regulation:

21 § 862.1345

Product Code:

NBW

Classification Name:

System, Test, Blood Glucose, Over The Counter

# Predicate Device:

Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System K150817

# Device Description:

The Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a compact, all-in-one blood glucose meter that is used in conjunction with a smart mobile device (SMD). The Dario LC meter is connected to a SMD through an Apple Lightning $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ connector in order to provide the glucose meter with power. The SMD also provides an external display for the user to review blood glucose testing results via a mobile application downloaded to the SMD. The full process of blood glucose measurement is done on the glucose meter; the SMD does not provide any diagnostic or clinical analysis function. When connected to a SMD, the Dario LC glucose meter is agnostic both to the platform of the smart mobile device and to the model of the individual SMD within a platform.

# Statement of Intended Use:

The Dario LC Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood. The Dario is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home to monitor the effectiveness of their diabetes control.
