# Summary of Studies

99th percentile URL: A multicenter prospective study was conducted to establish the 99th percentile URL in a population of apparently healthy adults. Lithium heparin plasma and samples were evaluated. Subjects ranging from 21 to 99 years of age were enrolled at five geographically diverse locations throughout the United States. Forty five percent of the subjects were $\ge 6 0$ years of age.

Subjects were surveyed and were excluded if they met any of the following criteria:

Disease(s) of/or affecting the cardiovascular system Currently taking a medication for cardiovascular disease Diabetes Chronic kidney disease  Other serious chronic disease(s) (e.g. cancer, COPD, HIV, lupus erythematosus, etc.) Acute bacterial or viral infection Pregnancy

The $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile URL values determined for lithium heparin plasma (females, males, and overall), and serum (females, males, and overall) are shown in the following table. All values were determined using the non-parametric statistical method.

Clinical performance: A multicenter prospective study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Access hsTnI assay using the established $9 9 ^ { \mathfrak { t h } }$ percentile URLs. The study was designed to establish the clinical performance of Access hsTnI as an aid in the diagnosis of MI.

The study included 1,854 evaluable subjects from ED patients presenting with chest pain or equivalent ischemic symptoms suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS). A total of 14 geographically diverse, primary care hospital‐associated emergency departments participated, reflecting regional, urban, suburban, and rural patient populations.

True MI statuses of all subjects were adjudicated by an independent panel of expert physicians using criteria consistent with the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Adjudicators were blinded to the assay results and the attending physicians’ diagnosis. All results presented below were based on the adjudicated diagnoses. The MI incidence was $13 \%$ (238/1854).

Samples were tested at three independent clinical laboratories on DxI 800 systems. Testing was performed using serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. Study results are shown in Tables below. Results are presented for the following time intervals between ED presentation and specimen collection:

• Time of presentation (baseline), ≥1 - 3 hours, $\ge 3 - 6$ hours and $\geq 6 - 9$ hours after admission

# Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity

Diagnostic sensitivity $( \%$ MI correctly diagnosed) and specificity $( \%$ Non‐MI correctly diagnosed) were calculated per CLSI Guideline I/LA21‐A2. Estimates of sensitivity and specificity were determined by dividing the number of patients correctly diagnosed by the Access hsTnI assay (n) by the total number of patients with an adjudicated diagnosis (N).

# Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV)

PPV (probability of MI diagnosis in patients with elevated cTnI) and NPV (probability of non‐MI diagnosis in patients with non‐elevated cTnI) were calculated per CLSI Guideline I/LA21‐A2. Estimates of PPV were determined by dividing the number of patients with elevated cTnI values and adjudicated MI diagnoses (n) by the total number of patients with elevated cTnI values (N). Estimates of NPV were determined by dividing the number of patients with non‐elevated cTnI values and adjudicated non‐MI diagnoses (n) by the total number of patients with non‐elevated cTnI values (N).

Predictive value analysis is directly related to the prevalence of disease in the intended use population. The overall MI prevalence of $13 \%$ in this study is consistent with literature and public health findings, and indicates that the study population is representative of the intended use population. Since predictive value analysis is prevalence dependent; results will vary by region and facility.

Imprecision: The within-laboratory (total) $\%$ CV ranged from $2 . 8 \%$ to $10 \%$ for hsTnI concentrations $\ge ~ 1 1 . 5 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ for serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. The within-laboratory (total) SD ranged from 0.22 to 0.75 for hsTnI for concentrations $< 1 1 . 5 \mathsf { p g / m L }$ for serum and lithium heparin plasma samples.

High-dose Hook Effect: The Access hsTnI assay demonstrated no high-dose hook effect up to at least $2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \ p \mathsf { g / m L }$ .

Linearity: The Access hsTnI assay has demonstrated to be linear across the range of the assay (2.1 to approximately 27,027 pg/mL) in both serum and lithium heparin plasma samples.

Limit of Blank (LoB): The highest measurement result observed with no analyte present in the samples is $1 . 2 \ : \mathsf { p g } / \mathsf { m L }$ .

Limit of Detection (LoD): The lowest concentration of analyte in both serum and lithium heparin plasma that can be detected is $2 . 1 \ p \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { m L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The lowest concentration of analyte in both serum and lithium heparin plasma samples that can be quantitatively determined with within-laboratory imprecision of $\mathrm { C V } \leq 1 0 \%$ is $4 . 6 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ and with within-laboratory imprecision of $C V \leq 2 0 \%$ is $2 . 1 \ p \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { m L }$ .

Analytical Specificity: Potential cross-reactive substances were added to lithium heparin plasma and serum samples at two concentrations of cTnI (approximately $1 0 \ p \mathsf { g / m L }$ and one containing approximately $1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L } )$ Stock solutions of potential cross-reactants were prepared volumetrically using calibrated pipettes and the appropriate solvent. This stock solution was added directly to the lithium heparin plasma and serum samples in no more than $5 \%$ (v/v) final concentration. Control samples were prepared in the same manner using the solvent, without the cross-reactant added. Control and test samples were tested on the UniCel DxI 800 instrument within 24 hours of preparation, using three reagent lots. Of the compounds tested, none were found to cause significant cross-reactivity, as defined by a shift in concentration within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for samples $> 1 1 . 5 \mathsf { p g } / \mathsf { m L }$ . For sample concentrations $\leq 1 1 . 5 \ : \mathsf { p g / m L }$ , the change in concentration between diluent control and test sample must be within 2SD, where 2SD is defined as $2 . 3 0 ~ { \mathsf { p g / m L } }$ .

Interfering Substances: Potential interferents were tested at one concentration within the reference interval or the therapeutic concentration range as directed by EP7-A2 (Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry-Approved Guideline, Second Edition). Lithium heparin plasma and serum samples containing cTnI concentrations of approximately, ${ 1 0 \ p g / \mathsf { m L } \left( \mathsf { n g / L } \right) }$ and $1 0 0 \ p \mathsf { g / m L \left( n g / L \right) }$ were spiked with the substances below and run on a single DxI Immunoassay System. Interference was determined by testing controls (no interfering substance added) and matched test samples (with interfering substance added). Of the compounds tested, none were found to cause significant interference, as defined by a shift in concentration within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for samples $> 1 1 . 5 \ : \mathsf { p g / m L }$ . For sample concentrations $\leq 1 1 . 5 \ : \mathsf { p g / m L }$ , the change in concentration between diluent control and test sample must be within 2SD, where 2SD is defined as 2.30 pg/mL.
