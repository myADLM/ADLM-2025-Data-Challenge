Dear Julie Zhou:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (http://www.fda.gov/DICE) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

# Description:

VivaChek™ Ino Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Model: VGM04) is designed to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is achieved by using the amperometric detection method. The test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of the glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the test strip. The blood sample is pulled into the tip of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose enzyme and the mediator. Electrons are generated, producing a current that is positive correlation to the glucose concentration in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is displayed.

Clinical (user evaluation) studies were conducted with intended user, lay persons using the VivaChek™ Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek™ Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek™ Ino Plus (VGM22), and VivaChek™ Ino Sound Simple (VGM26) Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems. The study data were presented evaluating the system accuracy of the VivaChek™ Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek™ Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek™ Ino Plus (VGM22), and VivaChek™ Ino Sound Simple (VGM26) Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems per the VivaChek User Evaluation Study Protocols for these Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems. Study results indicated that non-professional, inexperienced lay persons were able to obtain blood glucose readings when using the VivaChek™ Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek™ Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek™ Ino Plus (VGM22), and VivaChek™ Ino Sound Simple (VGM26) Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems. In addition, the participated lay persons were questioned and responded as satisfied with the ease of operation by following the Instructions for Use in the User’s Manual and the overall performance of the VivaChek™ Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek™ Ino

Section T8

Sound (VGM09), VivaChek™ Ino Plus (VGM22), and VivaChek™ Ino Sound Simple (VGM26) Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems.

The VivaChek™ Ino Sync (VGM05) has the same intended use, fundamental scientific technology and performance characteristics as VivaChek™ Ino Smart (VGM04). Therefore, the safety, effectiveness and performance are same as the predicate device.

The VivaChek™ Ino Sound Bright (VGM27) has the same intended use, fundamental scientific technology and performance characteristics as VivaChek™ Ino Sound Simple (VGM26). Therefore, the safety, effectiveness and performance are same as the predicate device.

# Conclusion:

The laboratory testing and user evaluation study results demonstrate that the VivaChek™ Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek™ Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek™ Ino Plus (VGM22), and VivaChek™ Ino Sound Simple(VGM26) Blood Glucose Monitoring System are safe, effective and easy-to-use. It also demonstrates that the VivaChek™ Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek™ Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek™ Ino Plus (VGM22), and VivaChek™ Ino Sound Simple (VGM26) Blood Smart Glucose Monitoring Systems meet FDA SMBG Guidance and are substantially equivalent to the VivaChek™ Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K160179). Based on same intended use and technology characteristics, and the test results on user friendly functionalities on bluetooth or talking, the other two subject devices (VGM05, VGM27) are also substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
