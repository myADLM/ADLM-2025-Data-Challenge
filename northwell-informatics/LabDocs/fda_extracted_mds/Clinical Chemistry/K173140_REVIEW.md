# I. Device Description:

The six systems in this submission, the VivaChek Ino Smart, the VivaChek Ino Sync, the VivaChek Ino Sound, the VivaChek Ino Plus, the VivaChek Ino Sound Simple, and the VivaChek Ino Sound Bright Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are intended to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is achieved by using the amperometric detection method. The test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of the glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the test strip. The blood sample is pulled into the tip of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose enzyme and the mediator. Electrons are generated, producing a current that is positive correlation to the glucose concentration in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is displayed. The meter is calibrated to display plasma-like concentration results.

The same test strips, the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Test Strips (VGS01) are used with each of the meters in this submission, the VivaChek Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek Ino Sync (VGM05), VivaChek Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek Ino Plus (VGM22), VivaChek Ino Sound Simple (VGM26), and VivaChek Ino Sound Bright (VGM27) Blood Glucose Meters to measure the glucose level in fresh capillary whole blood. VivaChek Control Solutions are aqueous solutions containing glucose and are available at three levels (level 1, level 2 and level 3) and are compatible for use with each system.

All of the devices in this $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ submission employ the same device technology and have the same intended use. The devices differ in minor design features and certain user functions. For example, the VGM04, VGM05, VGM09, and VGM22 meter models contain Bluetooth functionality for transferring glucose results to a compatible mobile device, and the VGM09, VGM26, and VGM27 meter models contain a talking functionality. Other

features that differ between meters are minor features such as presence or absence of a backlight, strip ejector port, or rechargeable batteries.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose Test Systems for Over-the-Counter Use, Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff. October 11, 2016.

# L. Te st Principle :

The VivaChek Ino Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System, VivaChek Ino Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System, VivaChek Ino Sound Blood Glucose Monitoring System, VivaChek Ino Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System, VivaChek Ino Sound Simple Blood Glucose Monitoring System, and VivaChek Ino Sound Bright Blood Glucose Monitoring System are systems for the quantitative detection of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip. Amperometric technology is used for the detection of glucose from testing the strip (with whole blood sample) on the meter. Reagent consisting of glucose oxidase and mediator is deposited onto the reaction cell section of the test strip with printed electrodes. When a drop of whole blood sample is applied to the reaction cell on the test strip, glucose in the blood sample reacts in the presence of glucose oxidase and mediator, and the reaction yields electrons. Thus, a current signal is produced from the reaction and detected by the meter. The detected current signal is then calculated by the meter, and glucose concentration reading is then displayed on the meter display.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Unless otherwise noted, the analytical studies detailed below were performed with the VivaChek Ino Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System. As the only differences between the six meters in this submission are minor design features, as described above in Device Description (Section I), the analytical studies performed with the VivaChek Ino Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System are representative of the performance for all devices in this 510(k) submission.

Repeatability (within-run precision):

The sponsor performed repeatability (within-day) precision studies using venous whole blood adjusted to 5 different glucose concentration levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } ) }$ ). Each glucose concentration level was analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots, and 10 meters, for a total of 300 tests per glucose level for each meter. Results are summarized below:

# Intermediate Precision:

Intermediate (day-to-day) precision was evaluated using 3 levels of glucose control solutions over 10 days with 3 test strip lots. For each level, on each day, 10 meters were used for testing, with 1 replicate collected per meter for a total of 10 replicates per day for each glucose level. Results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed using venous whole blood samples. Samples with the following glucose concentrations were prepared and confirmed by the laboratory comparator method YSI 2300: 21.7, 77.7, 135.7, 196.3, 250.8, 308.6, 368.1, 425.9,

481.0, 541.6, $5 9 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was measured in replicates of four using each of three lots of test strips and the mean was used in the regression analysis. The regression analysis results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R{2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9983</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0150</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9986</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9852</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4035</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9974</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0052</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-2.2806</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9982</td></tr></table>

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20 $- 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample is less than $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If a sample result exceeds $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as HI. The LO and HI functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The system is traceable to NIST SRM #917b glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed using the candidate device and YSI 2300 as the reference method. The meter provides plasma-equivalent results.

# Test Strip Stability:

Test strip stability was assessed using accelerated and real time stability studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. The labeling includes claims that the VivaChek Ino Test Strips are stable for 4 months after opening and 24 months unopened when stored between of $3 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $\left( 2 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C } { - } 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C } \right)$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity.

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range for the VivaChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 to $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ supported by the linearity assay study above (M.1.b).

# e. Analytical specificity:

To assess potential interferences, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to 3 glucose concentration ranges: 50-70, 110-130, and $2 2 5 { - } 2 7 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool, with each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances added to the test pool. The $\%$ difference between the test sample and the control sample was calculated using mean of 10 replicates for each of the 3 strip lots tested. The compounds at the concentrations listed below did not have significant interference (defined by the sponsor as average bias between spiked and control sample glucose results within $\pm$

$10 \%$ with glucose ${ > } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ with glucose ${ \bf \Sigma } ^ { < } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . The highest concentrations at which no significant interference was observed are presented in the following table:

User Performance Study:

To assess the performance of the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed four independent studies that each included a minimum of 350 lay users with the VivaChek Ino Smart (VGM04), VivaChek Ino Sound (VGM09), VivaChek Ino Plus (VGM22), and VivaChek Ino Sound Simple (VGM26) Blood Glucose Meters (see Section I Device Description for a description of the minor differences between each meter). Each study included lay users that were provided with the device labeling, collected their own fingerstick sample, and obtained results on a VivaChek Ino meter. After the tests were completed by the lay user, additional blood samples were collected from each subject by a professional for testing with the comparator method, YSI 2300. There were no significant differences demonstrated in performance between the four lay user studies completed. As representative performance, the results from the most complex system (e.g. presence of talking feature, bluetooth function, backlight, strip ejector etc.), the VivaChek Ino Sound Blood Glucose Monitoring System (VGM09), are summarized in the tables below:

# Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Study:

To assess the performance of the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems at extreme glucose concentrations, a study was conducted using blood from 105 study participants where blood was either aged to lower glucose concentrations or spiked to raise glucose concentration. The results were compared to the YSI 2300 comparator method. Results demonstrate that the meter has acceptable accuracy at extreme glucose values.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study:

To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples with hematocrit levels of $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $65 \%$ , and $70 \%$ were tested at 5 glucose concentrations (50, 90, 130, 200, and $3 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 test strips per strip lot, with a total of 3 lots of testes strips tested. Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300). The evaluation of bias relative to the comparator method demonstrated acceptable performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of $20 \mathrm { - } 7 0 \%$ .

2. Altitude Study:

To evaluate the effect of altitude on the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring System, meters were tested at sea level and 13,123 feet. The evaluation included 3 test strip lots and the glucose range tested was 52 to $5 3 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Results at each altitude were compared to the comparator method, YSI 2300. Results demonstrated that altitudes up to 13,123 feet above sea level have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements.

# 3. Sample Volume Study:

The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume for the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples were tested at 0.6, 0.7, and $0 . 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ at thee glucose levels (60, 110, and $2 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ as established by the YSI 2300 comparator method. Each sample was tested in duplicate on two meters using 3 test strip lots. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 8 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that with blood volumes below $0 . 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ , the insufficient sample volume error message functioned as intended.

# 4. Operating Conditions Study:

The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples with three glucose levels (60-70, 100-120, and $3 0 0 – 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Temperatures ranging from $4 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } \cdot 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 5 . 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ were tested. Meter results were compared to the YSI 2300 comparator analyzer. Four temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of $4 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } \cdot 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 5 . 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ .

# 5. Flex Studies:

Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, drop/shock testing, and vibration testing was completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the VivaChek Ino Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are robust to intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop/shock, and vibration, and that an error message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.

# 6. EMC Testing:

The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed for each device in this 510(k) submission and that they were compliant.

# 7. Infection Control Studies:

The six VivaChek Ino systems in this submission are intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes, $0 . 5 5 \%$ sodium hypochlorite (EPA Registration # 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 608 cleanings and disinfection cycles with the Clorox Germicidal

Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol: The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
