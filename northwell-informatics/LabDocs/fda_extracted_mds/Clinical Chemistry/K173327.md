# Summary of Performance Data

Healthy.io conducted both bench and clinical studies to test the accuracy of the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System and its agreement with the predicate device. Healthy.io conducted several studies to characterize the analytical and clinical performance of the DIP | U.S Urine Analysis Test System Two method comparison studies were conducted – one study included 429 subjects (500 samples including spiked sample) and a second study that included 250 subjects (289 samples including spiked samples). Analytical performance characteristic testing was also conducted for each analyte measured by the device. Software validation testing was also conducted. Performance of the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System based on this testing is summarized below.

# Analytical Performance Testing:

The performance characteristics of the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System were evaluated by the following analytical performance tests:

Precision. This study was comprised of two separate sub-studies, including: 1) Repeatability; and 2) Reproducibility. The precision studies were designed and executed in accordance with guidance provided by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute document EP05-A3 – Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Third Edition.

The Repeatability study was conducted at three sites over the course of one day. Each operator tested two spiked levels of urine using twenty sticks from three lots on a Nexus phone. For each analyte, 360 total tests were taken during the Repeatability study (360 $= 3$ sites X 2 solutions $\textsf { X 3 }$ lots X 20 sticks). The DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System recorded an exact match of $9 9 . 3 \%$ during the course of the study.

The Reproducibility study was conducted at three sites over the course of 20 days, with test operators switching locations every six-to-seven days. For each run, every operator tested three spiked levels of urine using one stick from three lots respectively on a Nexus device. For each analyte, 1,080 total tests were taken during the Reproducibility study (3 sites x 3 solutions X 3 lots x 2 runs x 20 days). The DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System recorded an exact match of $9 8 . 5 \%$ during the course of the study.

Interference. Testing of potential interfering substances with the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System was designed and executed in accordance with guidance provided by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute document EP7-A2 – Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.

Interference was defined as a change in output of $\pm 2$ color block between spiked and unspiked (control) samples. Once interference was detected at one or more analytes, a dose-response study was carried out at three decreasing intervals to determine the lowest concentration level that causes interference. Both the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System and the predicate device recorded similar results during their respective interference testing.

Limit of Detection. Testing of the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System detection limits was designed and executed in accordance with guidance provided by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP17-A2 – Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.

The Detection of Limit study was based on validated spiked urine solutions at known concentrations for each analyte. The samples were divided into four separate and equal intervals between the theoretical cut-off points between each semi-quantitative level. The sponsor tested each of these solution, with the cut-off point defined as the lowest concentration at which at least $5 5 \%$ of the results tested positive for the desired color block. The study demonstrated the ability of the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System to

accurately detect the limits concentration of every analyte measured by the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System

Linearity. The linearity study of the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System was designed and executed in accordance with guidance provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP6-A – Evaluation of Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline.

The Linearity study tested the ability of the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System to provide results that were directly proportional to the concentrations of analytes within each test sample. The study tested the entire range of values that the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System is designed to measure. For every value of analyte, the DIP | U.S. measured at least an $89 . 4 \%$ exact match and a $100 \% + - 1$ color block accuracy. There were no detectable biases disrupting the overall pattern of linearity for any of the analytes. This study successfully demonstrates linearity for the DIP | U.S Urine Analysis Test System's device.

# Stability:

The stability study was designed:

1. To provide evidence of the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System's performance over time under the influence of environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.

2. To establish DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System's shelf life and recommended storage conditions, under which it maintains stable performance.

The DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System was tested according to International Electrotechnical Commission standards, IEC TR 60721-4- $1 : 2 0 0 1 + A 1 : 0 3$ , Class 1K2 and IEC TR 60721-4- $1 : 2 0 0 1 + A 1 : 0 3$ , Class 1M2). The DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System successfully passed these examinations at 6-, 12-, and 14- month time intervals.

Additional Studies: Healthy.io designed and conducted two additional studies concerning the effects of: 1) light (Illumination Study); and 2) physical boundaries (Boundary Study) on the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System. Both of these studies demonstrated the device's ability to measure accurate levels of analytes under different lighting settings and boundary conditions as described below:

Illumination Study: Healthy.io designed a study to test the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System under ten common lighting conditions (spectral properties were measured with standard devices). The device measured multiple levels of all six analytes under different lighting conditions. The device measured a total exact match of $9 9 . 5 \%$ when compared to the predetermined reagent values.

Boundary Study: Healthy.io designed a study to evaluate the physical boundary conditions (angle, distance, lighting) that guide a user when scanning the dipstick – while still receiving accurate results. The DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System measured all six analytes at the angular, distance, and lighting limits of the device. At these boundaries, the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System measured a total exact match of $9 9 . 5 \%$ when compared to the predetermined reagent values.

# Method Comparison Study:

Two method comparison studies were conducted to demonstrate the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System's degree of agreement with its predicate device, when operated by a lay-user in a simulated home-use environment. These studies were both designed and executed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP9-A2 - Method Comparison and Bias Using Estimation Samples, Approved Guideline, Second Edition.

The primary acceptance criteria for the study were the percent exact match and $\pm 1$ color block match between DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System and the predicate. Throughout the testing, the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System demonstrated high-levels of accuracy as measured by its percent of agreement with the predicate device.

The first study enrolled 429 subjects and collected 500 total samples from two U.S. clinical sites. Subjects were able to choose which device to use, based on their level of familiarity with either phone. Samples were analyzed comparing subject results using the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System and results of aliquots of the same samples measured by a laboratory professional using the predicate (ACON Mission U500 Urinalysis System).

#  Study Results - Usability

Of the 429 tests conducted, 424 tests were successfully completed, meaning that the user completed the test and results were sent to the physician, demonstrating a very high success rate $( > 9 9 \% )$ for the product usability among lay users. Subjects also filled out usability evaluation surveys to rank different aspects of the product’s usability. The average result from these surveys was 4.9 out of 5 demonstrating overall positive feedback from subjects using the product.

#  Study Results – Accuracy

The overall $\pm ~ 1$ color block $\%$ agreement between the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System and the ACON Mission U500 Urinalysis System was above $9 9 \%$ across the board for all analytes during the initial Method Comparison study. Exact match levels for Nitrites and Protein were $9 9 \%$ and $8 5 \%$ , respectively. The pH and SG analyte exact match levels are $7 5 . 7 \%$ and $6 3 . 4 \%$ , respectively. (The performance data in this submission only uses the 284 results from the LG Nexus 5 smartphones used in the experiment.)

The second study enrolled 250 subjects and collected 289 total samples from a U.S. based clinic. Samples were analyzed comparing subject results using the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System and results of aliquots of the same samples measured by a laboratory professional using the predicate (ACON Mission U500 Urinalysis System).

#  Study Results - Usability

249 patients, out of the 250 enrolled were able to successfully complete the test with the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System device.

#  Study Results – Accuracy

The exact match for Blood was $91 . 4 \%$ ( $1 0 0 \% + 1 - 1$ color block) and $89 . 6 \%$ for Glucose ( $100 \%$ $+ / - 1$ color block). Moreover, there were zero instances of False Negative measurements for Blood and Glucose during this study.

In conclusion, the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System, when used by a lay person, demonstrated a high degree of agreement with the predicate device for every parameter.

# Software Validation:

Validation of the Dip.io device software was performed according to the clause 14 of IEC 60601-1 (third edition) Software requirements, IEC 62304:2004 to IEC 62304 – 2006/AC 2008, Medical device, and Software life-cycle processes standards. The software related documents were composed according to the specific IEEE standards and the FDA Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices. The Software Validation documents summarize the validation assessment and demonstrate that the software meets the design requirements and all potential risks have been mitigated.

In accordance with the FDA’s guidance for management of cyber-security in medical device, the OCR’s HIPAA regulation and ISO 27001, Healthy.io conducted a comprehensive hazard analysis. The cyber security analysis report, together with the cyber security validation test report summarizes the assessment process for cyber security and demonstrates that the software meets the required level of cyber security protection.

# Conclusions:

The clinical and analytical performance study results demonstrate that the DIP | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device ACON Mission U500 Urinalysis System (FDA 510(k): K111221).
