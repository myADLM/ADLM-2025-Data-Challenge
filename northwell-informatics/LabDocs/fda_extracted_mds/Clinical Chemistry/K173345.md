Dear Anne Kuo:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR

Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

# 7. Test Principle

Glucose measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using the enzyme Glucose Dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are produced. The electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and correlated to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the

concentration of glucose in the sample. The test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow comparison of results with laboratory methods.

Using the same technology, $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate ( $\beta$ -ketone) is converted by $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and the magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate present in the sample.

The measurement result is transmitted to a compatible mobile device via headphone jack. The App within this system is used for analysis and storage of the data for personal healthcare.

# 8. Performance Characteristics

Clinical and non-clinical studies were conducted to test, verify and validate with respect to the predicate device to establish the performance of this system. The data demonstrates that this system is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

The $\beta$ -ketone test strip shows acceptable precision and no variation among lots.

# Linearity/assay reportable range

The linearity of a blood $\beta$ -Ketone system is the degree to which its results (y-axis) form a straight line when plotted against the defined concentrations of samples (x-axis). The reportable range of a system may be established by demonstrating the linearity of its results with samples of known $\beta$ -Ketone concentration. The system was validated when $\beta$ -Ketone concentrations are $( { < } 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ and $\mathrm { ( { > } 8 . 0 m m o l / L ) }$ ) displaying “Lo” and “Hi” symbol respectively. The system shows a high linearity over a blood $\beta$ -Ketone range of 0.1 to $8 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .
