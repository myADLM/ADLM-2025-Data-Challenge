Dear Anne Marie Whalen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (http://www.fda.gov/DICE) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Device Name NeoBase™ 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit

Indications for Use (Describe)   
The NeoBase™ 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit is intended for the measurement and evaluation of amino acid,   
succinylacetone, free carnitine, acylcarnitine, nucleoside and lysophospholipid concentrations (Table 1) with a tandem mass spectrometer from newborn heel prick blood specimens dried on filter paper. Quantitative analysis of these analytes and their relationship with each other is intended to provide analyte concentration profiles that may aid in screening newborns for metabolic disorders.

# Summary of Clinical Studies:

The 3044-0010U NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit was compared to 3040-001U NeoBase Non-derivatized MSMS kit by measuring analyte concentrations with a tandem quadrupole detector (TQD) in two CLIA-certified state laboratories responsible for routine newborn screening. Using data from routine newborn screening, the cut-offs for both methods were determined by calculating the 99.5th and 99th percentile for all analytes except C2. For C2, C3, C16, C18, C18:1 and Cit the low cut-off applied is based on 1st percentile. For C0, the low cut-off applied is based on 10th percentile. Please note that the cut-off values used in evaluating screening performance only apply to these studies.

The disorders and amount of confirmed positive specimens included in the studies 1 and 2 are listed in Tables A and B (study 1), and Tables C and D (study 2). In total, there were 37 specimens included in the group of amino acid disorders, 26 in the group of fatty acid oxidation disorders and 28 in the group of organic acid conditions. In addition, the group of other disorder contains adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) of which 8 specimens, 4 of each disorder, were included.

The results for the screening performance data including confirmed positive specimens tested with TQD in the study 1 are presented in Table A.

The screening performance for adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) was done by comparing the result of NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit to the clinical condition. Results of the study 1 are presented in Table B.

# Substantial Equivalency:

The proposed device and predicate device utilize similar design shown to produce equivalent screening performance in a clinical setting. Both devices are intended for the measurement and evaluation of multiple metabolite concentrations from newborn heel prick blood samples dried on filter paper. Quantitative analysis of these analytes and their relationship with each other is intended to provide analyte concentration profiles that may aid in screening newborns for metabolic disorders.

# Conclusion:

The NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit demonstrates analytical and screening performance that supports its substantial equivalency with the predicate device, NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit (K093916).
