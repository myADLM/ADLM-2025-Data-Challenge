# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity assessment was performed using venous whole blood samples adjusted to 14 glucose concentrations ranging from 12.2 to $6 1 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (12.2, 27.4, 52.2, 108, 132.5, 196.5, 271 , 322, 345.5, 420.5, 455.5, 511.5, 572.5, and $6 1 4 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } ) }$ ) and three test strip lots and three meters. The results were compared to values obtained from duplicate sample measurements using the comparator method (YSI 2300 Analyzer). The following are the results from the regression analysis:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R{2$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9838</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.4412</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9996</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9827</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.052</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9995</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9832</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.5748</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9996</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3 Lots Combined</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9833</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.3229</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9996</td></tr></table>

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 10 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for this device. The meter displays “LO” with glucose values below 10 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and “HI” with glucose values over $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The LO and HI functions were validated and were demonstrated to function as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The system is traceable to the certified glucose reference material NIST SRM 917b.

# Test Strip Stability

Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the Rightest/GE Test Strips Max were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support closed-vial stability of 26 months and open-vial stability of 4 months when test strips are stored at 39 to $8 6 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ (4 to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ), $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range is $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b above).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed by spiking 31 exogenous substances, endogenous substances into venous whole blood with three glucose levels (50-70, 110-130, and $2 2 5 { - } 2 7 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ as measured on the YSI 2300 Analyzer. Interfering substances were tested at each glucose level in replicates of 10 using three test strip lots and three meters. The difference between the test sample (with interferent) as measured on the meter and the control sample (without interferent) as measured on the meter were calculated. The sponsor defined no significant interference as $\leq 1 0 \%$ between test and control mean. The highest tested concentration of each substance tested with no significant interference are summarized in the following table:

# 6. Quality Control:

Three levels of glucose control solutions (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 4) are available with this system, but are sold separately. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The user is instructed to repeat testing with a new strip, or run a quality control test, or contact their healthcare profession if test results are unusually high or low. If quality control test results are out of range, the user is advised to repeat the test. If problems continue, the user is cautioned not to use the meter and to contact the distributor.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study:

To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max/Max Plus, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of $10 \%$ , $1 5 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $65 \%$ and $70 \%$ . Each hematocrit level was tested at five glucose concentration intervals ( $3 0 { \cdot } 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 50-110 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 111- $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 5 1 { - } 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $2 5 1 { - } 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } $ ). Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator measurement (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the labeled hematocrit claim of $10 \mathrm { - } 7 0 \%$ .

# 2. Altitude Testing:

To evaluate the effect of altitude on the Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max/Max Plus, meters were tested at 0 ft $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ , 3280 ft $( 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m } )$ , 6561 ft $( 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m } )$ , and 10,745 ft $( 3 2 7 5 \mathrm { m } )$ above sea level. Venous blood samples from 5 healthy volunteers were each prepared at three glucose concentration levels $\mathrm { \hbar \langle 5 0 - 7 5 \ m g / d L }$ , $8 0 - 1 2 0 \log { \mathrm { d } }$ L, and $2 7 0 { - } 3 3 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and tested at each altitude. Results were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator measurement (YSI 2300 analyzer) and demonstrated that altitudes from 0 up to 10,745 ft $( 3 2 7 5 \mathrm { m } )$ above sea level have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements.

# 3. System Operating Conditions Testing:

Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated using venous blood samples at 2 glucose concentration ranges, $( 6 0 - 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and1 $5 0 { - } 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ to evaluate temperatures ranging from $6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $4 2 . 8 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F } )$ to $( 1 1 1 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and relative humidity from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ . Six temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the sponsor’s claimed operating conditions in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of $4 3 . 1 1 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 6 { - } 4 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity from $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ .

# 4. Infection Control and Robustness Studies:

The Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max/Max Plus are intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy testing on the surface materials of the meter demonstrated complete inactivation of duck hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA Registration Number 46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 520 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use for the Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max/Max Plus. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 5. Sample Volume Study:

To verify the minimum sample volume claim, venous whole blood samples with nine volumes (0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, 2.00, and $3 . 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) were tested. Sample concentrations included three glucose levels $\mathrm { \hbar } \mathrm { \hbar } 5 0 { - } 7 5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , $8 0 { - } 1 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and 270-330 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ and were tested at each volume. Values obtained with the candidate device were compared to values obtained using a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The meter displays and error message when insufficient sample volume is applied to the test strip. The sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that this error feature functions as intended.

6. Used Strip Error Functionality Test:

A study was performed demonstrating that the Rightest/GE Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max/Max Plus displays an error rather than a measurement result when a used strip is inserted for testing.

7. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and Electrical Safety: The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic (EMC) testing was performed and the systems were found to be compliant.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:
