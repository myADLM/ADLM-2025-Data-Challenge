Dear Jigar Shah:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part

801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

# 6. Device Description:

The Confidence™ BGMS consists of test strips stored in a vial with desiccant lining, a hand held blood glucose meter and a control solution. To perform blood glucose test a test strip is removed from the vial and inserted into Confidence™ meter. On inserting the strip meter gets activated and displays a code, user must select a code corresponding to their strip vial using meter’s interface, after selecting correct code, meter will be ready to apply sample by showing a droplet on the LCD display. On applying blood on the end of the test strip a countdown starts and meter LCD displays the plasma equivalent value in the blood sample within 10 seconds in mg/dL unit. The user can validate the operation of the system by using provided known algorithm, where generated current is directly proportional to glucose concentration.

# 7. Intended Use:

The Confidence™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip.

The Confidence™Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

# 10. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

A system accuracy evaluation was performed by comparing glucose value obtained by trained person using Confidence™ BGMS from finger stick blood of the 265 subjects with the scaled glucose value obtained by FDA cleared reference method (YSI 2300). The study was performed at two sites using three strip lots and eleven meters. The results demonstrated that Confidence™ BGMS is substantially equivalent in its performance with YSI.

A user study was performed to demonstrate that lay users could use the Confidence Glucose Monitoring Systems and obtain accurate results. The study was performed by 181 users; they never have used the candidate device before. The results obtained by using candidate device were compared with the scaled glucose values obtained by YSI. The results demonstrated the Confidence™ BGMS is substantially equivalent in lay users’ hand to its performance with YSI.
