# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Elecsys Tacrolimus immunoassay uses the principle of electrochemiluminescence for detection and measurement. Before testing with the Elecsys Tacrolimus assay, the specimen, calibrators and controls are pretreated with the Elecsys ISD Pretreatment Reagent. The reagent lyses the cells, extracts Tacrolimus and precipitates virtually all of the blood proteins. The pretreated samples are centrifuged, and an aliquot of the resulting supernatant containing Tacrolimus is then assayed using the Elecsys Tacrolimus assay.

Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

The supernatant is decanted into a Transplant Pretreatment Tube, which is placed onto the ARCHITECT System Sample, assay diluent, and anti-tacrolimus coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined to create a reaction mixture. Tacrolimus present in the sample binds to the anti-tacrolimus coated microparticles. After a delay, tacrolimus acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to the reaction mixture.

# 4. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The assay employs a competitive principle using electrochemiluminescence technology.

# 5. NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

# 5.1. Precision

Non-clinical performance evaluations for the Elecsys Tacrolimus executed with the study briefly summarized.

Precision of the Tacrolimus assay was evaluated on the cobas e 411 analyzer. Within-run precision (repeatability) and total imprecision (intermediate precision) were determined according to the CLSI EP5-A2 precision evaluation experiment.

A seven-member panel consisting of four pooled patient and single donor spiked human whole blood samples and three controls (PreciControl ISD Level 1, 2 and 3) were measured. The protocol consisted of testing the samples in single determination in four separate aliquots (divided in two runs per day) for 21 operating days. The measurements were performed on the cobas e 411 with one reagent lot, performing rack pack calibration according to instruction for use.

All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria for repeatability and intermediate precision.

# 5.2. Limit of Blank (LoB)

LoB of the Tacrolimus assay has been determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The Limit of Blank was determined as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the measurement of blank samples. The distribution of values for five analyte-free whole blood samples was determined with one reagent lot on two cobas e 411 analyzers with six runs distributed over a period of 5 days. The sample was measured in one-fold determination in each run. In summary, 30 measuring points were collected per instrument, for a total of 60 measured values.

Acceptance criterion: $\mathrm { L o B } \le 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# 5.3. Limit of Detection (LoD)

LoD of the Tacrolimus assay has been determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with a $9 5 \%$ probability. The distribution of values for five spiked human whole blood samples with low analyte has been determined with one reagent lot on two cobas e 411 analyzers with six runs distributed over a period of 5 days. Samples were measured in one-fold determination in each run. In summary, 30 measuring points were collected per instrument, for a total of 60 measured values. The sum of standard deviations (SD total) of the five samples was calculated. The LoD was determined according to the following EP17-A2 calculation: $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 3 \mathrm { \bf ~ x }$ SD total (of low analyte samples).

Acceptance criterion: $\mathrm { L o D } \le 0 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# 5.4. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

LoQ of the Tacrolimus assay has been determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte which can be quantified with a total error of no more than $2 5 \%$ . The distribution of values for 14 spiked human whole blood samples each diluted to concentrations which covered the range between LoB and 2x LoQ has been determined with three reagent lot on two cobas e 411 analyzers with six runs distributed over six days. Each run was calibrated separately using a two-point calibration. Samples were extracted separately and measured in one-fold determination in each run. In summary, a total of 84 measuring points were collected per instrument, for a total of 168 measured values per lot. A separate extraction was performed with the ISD Sample Pretreatment reagent for each sample measurement. The total error (TE) was calculated based on the following equation:

$$
T E = { \sqrt { \mathbf { s } ^ { 2 } + \mathbf { b i a s } ^ { 2 } } }
$$

Since the $\%$ CV and $\%$ bias are a function of the concentration, LoQ was calculated individually for each member of the Low level sample set.

The LoQ samples are sorted according to the concentration of their measured mean value. LoQ is defined as the mean value of that sample which is the first that fulfills specifications for $\mathrm { T E } _ { \mathrm { r e l } }$ and for which no sample with lower concentration exists that exceeds this specification.

A graphic is generated that plots the measured mean values of the LoQ samples (x) against the relative total error $\mathrm { ( T E _ { r e l } ) }$ (y).

Acceptance criterion: $2 5 \%$ total error at $\mathrm { L o Q } \leq 0 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# 5.5. Recovery (Accuracy)

The measure of accuracy study included the ISD free and patient samples. ISD-free human blood is spiked with known concentration of tacrolimus (USP or other suitable reference material). Each level will be spiked independently (no dilution series). The patient derived samples (from patients taking Tacrolimus) were measured prior spiking, to evaluate the ‘endogenous’ concentration. The samples were then divided into at least four aliquots. Each of this aliquot is spiked with a defined concentration of analyte ( $5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) to obtain at least four different ‘spiking’ levels for each patient sample. Each level will be spiked independently (no dilution series). The samples were measured on cobas e 411.

Acceptance criterion:

$\leq \pm 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for samples LoQ to $3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $\pm 1 0 \%$ for samples > 3 ng/mL

Based on data, the recovery (accuracy) meets the specifications.

# 5.6. Linearity

The linearity of the Tacrolimus assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer; three dilution series were prepared from three different spiked human whole blood samples. Each dilution series included 22 dilutions. Each sample was measured 4-fold within one run and the measured concentrations were plotted against the expected sample concentration. A separate extraction was performed with the ISD Sample Pretreatment reagent for each sample measurement. The linearity data was determined in accordance with CLSI EP6-A. In a first step, a linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic).

Acceptance criterion:

$\leq \pm 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for samples LoQ to $2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $\pm 1 0 \%$ for samples > 2 ng/mL

Linearity was confirmed in the range from 0.75 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# 5.7. Dilution

To demonstrate the Tacrolimus assay dilution study, three ISD-free human whole blood samples were spiked separately with a known concentration of gravimetrically weight tacrolimus. These samples were used to prepare a dilution series of nine respective dilutions. Each sample was measured in duplicates $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 2 )$ ).

The dilution factor for samples outside the measuring range is 1:3. The samples prepared above were diluted with the Elecsys Diluent Universal prior to the manual pre-treatment procedure. Testing was performed on two cobas e 411 analyzers. The percent recoveries were calculated between the expected and the measured concentrations.

# 5.8. Analytical Specificity

The specificity was determined using the cross-reactant compound. Each cross-reactant compound was spiked into two human whole blood samples (analyte-free and slightly elevated analyte level). Testing was performed with one reagent lot in one run. The spiked samples were evaluated at four dilutions.

# 5.9. Endogenous Interferences

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances using the Tacrolimus was determined on the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer for the following 10 interfering substances Intralipid, Biotin, Bilirubin, Rheumatic Factor, Human Serum Albumin, IgG, Cholesterol, HASA, Uric Acid and Hematocrit using three spiked human whole blood samples (one low and one high concentration) to prepare dilution series of 10 dilutions that were tested with one reagent lot.

For each interfering substance the following protocol was followed:

One low and one high analyte containing sample were divided into two aliquots each. One aliquot was spiked with the interfering substance up to a concentration given in the table below (sample b) while the other was treated without interferent to mimic the dilution effect (sample a). The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference sample.

# For Hemotocrit interfering substance the following protocol was followed:

ISD-free human EDTA blood is split into two equal volume fractions. A sample is taken to measure the initial hematocrit using a hematocrit centrifuge. Cellular constituents of each fraction are separated from the plasma either by centrifugation at approximately $1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { g }$ for about 15 minutes or overnight sedimentation in the fridge. Blood plasma of the two fractions is then blended in a way that hematocrit concentrations of $1 5 \%$ resp. $65 \%$ are achieved. Afterwards the samples are homogenized for at least $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ on a roller mixer at room temperature. After homogenization the two sample preparations are spiked with equal amounts of analyte (USP or other suitable reference material) to reach desired concentrations and again homogenized overnight on a roller mixer at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Thereafter the two stocks ( $1 5 \%$ and $65 \%$ hematocrit) are blended in a way to obtain 11 hematocrit dilutions ranging from $1 5 \%$ to $65 \%$ , roller mixed for at least 30 minutes at room temperature and then measured. The recovery for every single sample was calculated based on the mean result of the respective first 10 replicates. Acceptance criterion:

• LoQ to $\leq 3 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ must be $\leq \pm 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ absolute deviation • $> 3$ to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ must be $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ recovery to the reference

# 5.10. Exogenous Interferences — Drugs

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of drugs was determined by using 16 common and 25 additional pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into each two spiked human tacrolimus containing human whole blood samples. The spiked samples (single donor samples spiked with $3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ tacrolimus) were evaluated at drug concentrations greater than the daily dose and tested for interference by the Elecsys Tacrolimus assay on cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer. Acceptance criterion is recovery within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of initial value. All drugs met the predetermined criterion except for Itraconazole. The Itraconazole (INN international non‑proprietary name) recovery was found to interfere at $1 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } \left( 1 1 4 \% \right)$

# 5.11. Biotin interference

Biotin interference was tested up to $1 { , } 2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ in whole blood samples at low and high concentrations of Tacrolimus. Mean concentration of Biotin dilution sample divided by mean corresponding sample without Biotin. The results are summarized in the table below:

The labeling states:

Specimens with biotin concentrations up to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ demonstrated $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias in results. Biotin concentrations greater than $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ led to higher positive bias Tacrolimus results. Some studies have shown that serum concentrations of biotin can reach up to $3 5 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ within the first hour after biotin ingestion for subjects consuming supplements of $2 0 \mathrm { m g }$ biotin per day and up to $1 1 6 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for subjects after a single dose of $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ biotin.

Do not test samples from patients who are taking biotin.

# 6.1. Reagent Stability

To test reagent stability, the reagent stability was performed in three different studies.

6.1.1. Study 1: Reagent Stability after First Opening $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$

Reagent stability after first opening for the Elecsys Tacrolimus assay was determined on a cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer by comparing the reagent stability for four kits of the same lot. All reagent kits were opened on day 0. One kit was placed on the analyzer and calibrated and reference values for the samples tested were determined. The other three kits were stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After 36, 64 and 92 days, one of the stored kits was placed on the analyzer and calibrated, and the original test samples were measured. Samples tested include five human whole blood samples (pooled patient samples and single donor samples spiked with tacrolimus) and three controls. Acceptance criterion for recovery was compared to day 0 value.

# 6.1.2. Study 2: On-board Reagent Stability

On-board reagent stability for the Tacrolimus assay was tested on one cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer. A fresh kit was placed on the analyzer and calibrated. Reference values for the samples tested were determined. After measurement, the kit was closed and kept at $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 9 weeks (64 days) to simulate on-board conditions. Measurements were repeated every week for nine weeks (64 days). The kit was placed on the analyzer again utilizing the calibration curve from seven days earlier for determinations of stability, and the original test samples were measured. The recovery was compared to the measurements from day one. Samples were tested with one reagent lot in one run per day on one cobas e 411 analyzer in duplicate. Samples tested included five human whole blood samples (pooled patient samples and single donor samples spiked with tacrolimus) and three controls (PreciControl ISD). Acceptance criterion for recovery was compared to day 1 value.

# 6.1.3. Study 3: Shelf Life Stability

In the real-time stability study, the Tacrolimus assay material was stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stored assay reagents were tested at time point $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ and at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device up to the planned shelf life plus one month. Testing was performed using PreciControl ISD 1, 2 and 3 (stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). For the production lots 171852, 172226 and 173556 data for the time-points at 0, 8, 10 and 16 months were tested in duplicates.

The average on-test recovery was calculated as percent recovery compared to the reference value (Assigned value for PreciControl ISD 1, 2 and 3).

The acceptance criterion for PreciControl ISD 1 is recovery of $7 5 - 1 2 5 \%$ of the reference value. The acceptance criterion for PreciControl ISD 2 and 3 are recovery of $8 0 - 1 2 0 \%$ of the reference value.

# 6.2. Sample Stability

The sample stability was performed with six different studies and they are:

Study 1. Sample stability before pre-treatment at room temperature (15 to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) Study 2. Sample stability before pre-treatment at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Study 3. Sample stability before pre-treatment at ${ } _ { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ Study 4. Stability through freeze/thaw cycles • Study 5. Sample stability after pre-treatment on-board in Hitachi sample cups Study 6. Sample stability after pre-treatment at room temperature in closed Hitachi sample cups

The stability claims to be tested are:

• 5 days storage at room temperature before pretreatment   
• 7 days storage before pretreatment at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$   
• 1 time freeze/thaw before pretreatment   
• 4 hours storage at room temperature after pretreatment in closed tube   
• 30 minutes on the analyzer after pretreatment   
• 1 month storage before pretreatment at $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

The percent recovery was calculated based on reference T0 (fresh sample) values.

The data collected in house supported the short stability claims. Literature reference is use to support 1 month stability claim.
