# Product Code: CGA

# Predicate Device:

K110648 - Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System

# Device Description:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is designed to be a low cost, low maintenance analyzer for the hospital laboratory setting. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Optionally, it provides for reading of barcode labels (such as operator badges and data sheets).

The system architecture and user interface for this proposed device is based on the previously cleared Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer System (K131703). The primary predicate for this proposed device is the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648).

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not reporting them) will also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards:

# Primary Sensor Card Port:

There are two options for the primary sensor card:

• Primary Sensor Card 1 shall enable and report the following listed analytes: o $\mathsf { P O } _ { 2 }$ , $\mathsf { P C O } _ { 2 }$ , pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl, K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO2, O2Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb   
Primary Sensor Card 2 shall enable and report the following listed analytes: o PO2, PCO2, pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl, K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO2

# Auxiliary Sensor Card Port:

The reporting of Creatinine and BUN parameters (Or not reporting them) shall be determined by the selection of the Auxiliary Sensor Card

Auxiliary Sensor Card 1 enables Creatinine and BUN parameters Auxiliary Sensor Card 2 is a “dummy” sensor card, and will not report any parameters.

Similar to the primary predicate device, the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is a blood gas/cooximetry/electrolyte/chemistry and hematology analyzer with an enhanced test menu and multiple quality control options. Both traditional internal and external quality control will be used, as well as an on-board Quality Management System (QMS), an electronic monitoring approach that insures the analyzer is working properly at all times.

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer accepts samples from syringes, open tubes, and small cups.   
The minimum sample size for analysis is $1 3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

Sample collection, preparation and application to the analyzer are the same as for the previously cleared predicate. The end user can select which analytes are to be tested in the panel.

# Summary of the Technological Characteristics:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared for market Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648) in intended use. It uses the same sensor technology and measurement algorithms, and the formulations of the internal and external controls and the calibration cartridge are the same for the tested parameters. The External Control solutions for use with the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer are substantially equivalent to those cleared for use with the predicate Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648). See Table 1 for comparison of the predicate and proposed devices.

# Principles of Measurement:

# Glucose:

Glucose measurement is based on the level of ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ produced during the enzymatic reaction between glucose and oxygen molecules in the presence of the glucose oxidase enzyme. At a constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ is oxidized at the surface of the platinum anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum electrode is proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample.

# Creatinine:

The Prime Plus Creatinine sensor uses 3 enzymes. These 3 enzymes catalyze the conversion of Creatinine, ultimately forming formaldehyde, glycine, and hydrogen peroxide.

At a constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ is oxidized at the surface of the platinum anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum electrode is proportional to the Creatinine concentration of the sample.

# BUN:

The Prime Plus Analyzer uses urease, which has been chemically bonded to a membrane, to catalyze the conversion of urea present in the sample to ammonia and ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ .

At the pH of the sample, ammonia converts predominantly to the ammonium ion. An ammonium ion selective electrode is used to detect the ammonium formed by the above reactions. This measurement is then related to the concentration of urea present in the original sample via the Nernst equation.

# Summary of Performance Testing:

Performance testing was completed to demonstrate that the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is substantially equivalent in performance, safety and efficacy to the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System. The performance testing included:

# Method Comparison Studies:

A study was performed to compare the Stat Profile Prime Plus to the Nova Stat Profile pHOx Ultra analyzer to assess the equivalence of the analyzers in the measurement of Glucose, Creatinine, and BUN in heparinized whole blood in a clinical laboratory setting.

The blood comparison data for Glucose, Creatinine, and BUN, for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers meet the acceptance criteria.

# Precision/Reproducibility - Within Run and Run to Run Studies:

Within Run and Run to Run precision was evaluated by replication studies performed on three Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

Within Run Precision testing consisted of one run of each of the following sample types and levels was performed, 20 replicates per run:

• Stat Profile Prime Plus Internal Controls: Levels 1- 5 • Stat Profile Prime Plus Ampuled Controls: Levels 1- 5 • Two whole bloods, sampled from syringes

To assess Run to Run Precision for whole blood, triplicate analyses were performed on a single whole blood sample in ten separate runs during a single day. The systems were recalibrated before each triplicate run.

The precision data for all parameters meet the within run imprecision specifications for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

The precision data for all parameters meet the between analyzer run to run imprecision specifications for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

# Linearity Testing:

The study assessed the linearity of all parameters to establish and/or verify the Analytical Measurement Range (AMR) for the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer on whole blood. The linearity was measured using method comparison. The evaluation of the linear range included lower and upper limits of the AMR and various medical decision limits.

All Stat Profile Prime Plus results were compared to the reference analyzer and/or the product specifications.

The linearity comparison data for all parameters for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers shows good correlation and linearity to the reference analyzers across the claimed measurement range for all parameters and met the acceptance criteria.

# Specificity / Interference Testing:

The purpose of this study was to identify substances that may interfere with the Stat Profile Prime Plus sensors. If interference was identified, a dose response study was performed to determine the concentration where the interfering substance may alter results.

This Interference Testing study was performed using whole blood collected in lithium heparin vacutainers. The possible interfering substances were tested at two analyte concentrations.

Many substances were screened as potential interferents through analysis on the Prime Plus analyzers. Substance screening was completed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. The interfering substances identified during the screening process are listed in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Parameter</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interfering Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration of interferingsubstance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=6 colspan=1>Glucose</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Hydroxyurea</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No interference observed</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.4 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bias of 19.2%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Oxalate</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>125 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No interference observed</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bias of -13.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Thiocyanate</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.4 mmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No interference observed</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.1 mmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bias of 13.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=4 colspan=1>Creatinine</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Hydroxyurea</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No interference observed</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.08 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bias of 15.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Thiocyanate</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.7 mmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No interference observed</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.4 mmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bias of 42.9%</td></tr></table>

# Conclusion:

The results of software validation and performance verification testing confirmed that the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is substantially equivalent to that of the predicate Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648).
