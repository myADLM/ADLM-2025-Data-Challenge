Predicate Device: K110648 - Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System

# Device Description:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is designed to be a low cost, low maintenance analyzer for the hospital laboratory setting. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Optionally, it provides for reading of barcode labels (such as operator badges and data sheets).

The system architecture and user interface for this proposed device is based on the previously cleared Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer System (K131703). The primary predicate for this proposed device is the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648).

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which sensor cards are installed.

# Primary Sensor Card Port:

There are two options for the primary sensor card:

Primary Sensor Card 1 shall enable and report the following listed analytes: o sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, and ionized magnesium   
Primary Sensor Card 2 shall enable and report the following listed analytes: o sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, and ionized magnesium

Similar to the primary predicate device, the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is a blood gas/cooximetry/electrolyte/chemistry and hematology analyzer with an enhanced test menu and multiple quality control options. Both traditional internal and external quality control will be used, as well as an on-board Quality Management System (QMS), an electronic monitoring approach that insures the analyzer is working properly at all times.

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer accepts samples from syringes, open tubes, and small cups. The minimum sample size for analysis is 135 μL.

Sample collection, preparation and application to the analyzer are the same as for the previously cleared predicate. The end user can select which analytes are to be tested in the panel.

# Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System Components:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is comprised of the following components.

Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System   
• Primary Sensor Cartridge   
• Auxiliary Sensor Cartridge   
• Stat Profile Prime Plus Auto-Cartridge Quality Control Pack Stat Profile Prime Plus Calibrator Cartridge Stat Profile Prime Plus External Ampuled Control IFU/Labeling

# Sample Types:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System accepts lithium heparinized arterial and venous whole blood.

# Measured Parameters:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer measures:

• Sodium   
• Potassium   
• Chloride   
• Ionized Calcium Ionized Magnesium

# Calculated Parameters:

The following parameters are calculated by the Prime Plus Analyzer based on results of the directly measured parameters.

nCA to nMg Ratio (nCa/nMg) • Normalized Calcium (nCa) Normalized Magnesium (nMg)

# Intended Use:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is indicated for use by healthcare professionals in clinical laboratory settings for quantitative determination of sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, and ionized magnesium in heparinized arterial and venous whole blood.

Sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease, dehydration, or diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.

Potassium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high potassium levels.   
Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.   
Ionized calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany (intermittent muscular contractions or spasms).

Ionized magnesium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of hypomagnesemia (abnormally low levels of magnesium) and hypermagnesemia (abnormally high levels of magnesium).

# Summary of the Technological Characteristics:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared for market Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648) in intended use. It uses the same sensor technology and measurement algorithms, and the formulations of the internal and external controls and the calibration cartridge are the same for the tested parameters. The External Control solutions for use with the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer are substantially equivalent to those cleared for use with the predicate Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648). See Table 1 for comparison of the predicate and proposed devices.

# Principles of Measurement:

Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, ionized Magnesium, and ionized Calcium

The parameters are measured by an Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE) that selectively measures the activity of ionic species. When the ISE is contacted with a sample, potential is developed. The potential is proportional to the logarithm of the ionic activity and is measured versus a reference electrode.

# Method Comparison Studies:

A study was performed to compare the Stat Profile Prime Plus to the Nova Stat Profile pHOx Ultra analyzer to assess the equivalence of the analyzers in the measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, and ionized magnesium in heparinized whole blood in a clinical laboratory setting.

The blood comparison data for sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, and ionized magnesium for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers meet the acceptance criteria.

# Precision/Reproducibility - Within Run and Run to Run Studies:

Within Run and Run to Run precision was evaluated by replication studies performed on three Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

Within Run Precision testing consisted of one run of each of the following sample types and levels was performed, 20 replicates per run:

• Stat Profile Prime Plus Internal Controls: Levels 4 - 5 • Stat Profile Prime Plus Ampuled Controls: Levels 4 - 5 • Three whole bloods, sampled from syringes

To assess Run to Run Precision for whole blood, triplicate analyses were performed on four whole blood sample in ten separate runs during a single day. The systems were recalibrated before each triplicate run.

The precision data for all parameters meet the within run imprecision specifications for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

The precision data for all parameters meet the between analyzer run to run imprecision specifications for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

# Linearity Testing:

The study assessed the linearity of all parameters to establish and/or verify the Analytical Measurement Range (AMR) for the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer on whole blood. The linearity was measured using method comparison. The evaluation of the linear range included lower and upper limits of the AMR and various medical decision limits.

All Stat Profile Prime Plus results were compared to the reference analyzer and/or the product specifications.

The linearity comparison data for all parameters for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers shows good correlation and linearity to the reference analyzers across the claimed measurement range for all parameters and met the acceptance criteria.

# Specificity / Interference Testing:

The purpose of this study was to identify substances that may interfere with the Stat Profile Prime Plus sensors. If interference was identified, a dose response study was performed to determine the concentration where the interfering substance may alter results.

This Interference Testing study was performed using whole blood collected in lithium heparin vacutainers.   
The possible interfering substances were tested at two analyte concentrations.

Many substances were screened as potential interferents through analysis on the Prime Plus analyzers. Substance screening was completed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. The interfering substances identified during the screening process are listed in the table below:
