# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended Use: See Indications for Use below.

2. Indications for Use:

The StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System is intended for point-of-care, in vitro diagnostic, multiple-patient use for the quantitative determination of glucose in capillary finger stick, venous whole blood, arterial whole blood, neonate arterial whole blood and neonate heel stick specimens throughout all hospital and all professional healthcare settings including patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy.

The system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices when performing a capillary finger stick or neonate heel stick. It is not intended for use with neonate cord blood specimens. It is not intended for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is indicated for use in determining dysglycemia.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only   
For in vitro diagnostic use only   
The system has not been evaluated for use with neonate venous blood.   
Temperature and humidity extremes - Test results may be inaccurate when test strips are stored outside of the storage and handling conditions.   
Altitudes above 15,000 feet (4500 meters) above sea level have not been evaluated. Specimens - Only fresh whole blood or whole blood collected in lithium heparin collection devices should be used for arterial and venous specimens.   
Fluoride, EDTA, Sodium, and Ammonium blood collection devices should not be used.   
Use only whole blood. Do not use serum or plasma.   
Should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices   
Caution should be exercised when testing capillary whole blood due to potential pre-analytical variability in capillary specimen collection.   
A capillary whole blood specimen relies upon an adequate, non-compromised capillary blood flow. The healthcare provider must be aware that a capillary whole blood specimen glucose result may not always be the same as an arterial or a venous whole blood glucose result, especially when the patient’s condition is rapidly changing.   
If a capillary whole blood glucose result is not consistent with a patient’s clinical signs and symptoms, glucose testing should be repeated with either an arterial or venous specimen on the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System.

# L. Test Principle:

The Nova StatStrip Hospital Meter System is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

In this submission, additional comparison studies were performed using fingerstick capillary samples at three hospital sites as follows:

# Study 1

For Study 1, 568 capillary whole blood fingerstick specimens were obtained from patients within three different critical care units including the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU), medical intensive care unit (MICU), and the operating room (OR). This study included 80 unique patient conditions receiving a total of 3,785 medications representing 17 parent drug classes. All testing with the StatStrip Blood Glucose Hospital Meter (StatStrip Meter) was performed by CLIA waived operators (non-laboratory personnel, typically nursing staff) within each of these three critical care settings. Capillary whole blood glucose results on the StatStrip Meter were compared to matched arterial or venous plasma results obtained on a comparator method, the Roche Cobas Modular P800 Hexokinase System, located in a central laboratory. The glucose ranges of the samples, according to the comparator method, ranged from $7 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $3 7 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose. The results from the capillary fingerstick samples obtained from the StatStrip Hospital Meter compared to the results from the comparator method are summarized below:

# Study 2

Over 16,000 paired critical care capillary glucose specimens were retrospectively identified and met the following criteria:

Within critical care departments, a capillary fingerstick specimen, and a venous/arterial glucose result were measured at the bedside by a CLIA Waived operator using the BGMS.

Subsequently a plasma glucose test was performed on the same subject on the central laboratory hexokinase method within 15 minutes.

Capillary whole blood glucose results on the StatStrip Meter were compared to matched arterial or venous plasma results obtained on a comparator method, Roche Cobas Modular P800 Hexokinase System. The glucose ranges of the samples, according to the comparator method, ranged from $2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $6 6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose. The results from the capillary fingerstick samples obtained from the StatStrip Hospital Meter compared with the results from the comparator method are summarized below:
