# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (iHealth Gluco $^ +$ ) consists of the iHealth Wireless Smart Glucose Meter (BG5S) and the iHealth Blood Glucose Test Strips (EGS-2003). The iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (iHealth Gluco+) is intended to be used for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, or thigh. The iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (iHealth Gluco $^ +$ ) is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (iHealth Gluco+) is intended for selftesting outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The iHealth Wireless Smart GlucoMonitoring System (iHealth Gluco+) should not be used for the diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady - state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

The iHealth system is not intended for use on neonates or for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes. For over-the-counter use For single-patient use   
· Patients undergoing oxygen therapy may yield falsely lower results.   
· The meter and lancing device are for single patient use. Not for use on critically ill patients. This device is not for use on people who are severely dehydrated, on people who are severely hypotensive, or people who are in shock. Use only fresh capillary whole blood samples to test your blood glucose. Very low or very high red blood cell count (hematocrit) can lead to incorrect test results. If you do not know your hematocrit level, please consult your healthcare provider. For self-testing only. Do not perform alternate site testing (AST) if you think your glucose is low, you are unaware that you might have hypoglycemia, you are testing for hyperglycemia, your AST results do not match the way you feel, of ir your routine glucose results fluctuate

often.

Do not use AST results to calibrate a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or for insulin dosing calculations. AST should only be used during times when blood sugar is not fluctuating rapidly, (i.e. within 2 hours of eating, exercising or taking medication).

4. Special instrument requirements: iHealth Wireless Smart Glucose Meter (BG5S)

# I. Device Description:

The iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System(iHealth Gluco+) consists of the iHealth Wireless Smart Meter (BG5S) and the iHealth Blood Glucose Test Strips (EGS-2003). The iHealth BG5S Meter displays the test results and the test results can also be transmitted wirelessly to a compatible mobile device using the iHealth Gluco+ App. When used with this meter, the iHealth Gluco $^ +$ App is used to identify a control solution test in the meter memory. The App can transfer data from the device's memory, manage, and share the data.

The iHealth Glucose Control Solutions Level I, Level II, and Level III were previously cleared in k123935.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

IEC 61010-1:2010, Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use Part 1: General requirements.

IEC 60601-1-2:2014, Medical Electrical Equipment, Part 1-2: General Requirements For Basic Safety And Essential Performance.

# L. Test Principle:

The iHealth Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System (iHealth Gluco+) measures glucose amperometrically. The reaction of glucose dehydrogenase and an electron mediator in the EGS-2003 test strip with glucose in the sample produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration, which is displayed by the meter and the iHealth Gluco $^ +$ mobile App.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Established in k170231 and not impacted by the modifications.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using eleven venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 51.1, 64.9, 85.9, 120.3, 150.5, 170.8, 225.5, 279.5, 328.3, 488.8, and $5 9 5 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300. Each sample was tested with 9 BG5S meters for 9 measurements per glucose concentration. The linear regression results are presented below:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 4 5 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 7 4 9 ; \mathrm { R 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 5 4
$$

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of $5 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . If a sample is less than $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or greater than $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ an error message is returned to the user. The error messages were validated using blood glucose samples outside the measuring range of the device and demonstrated that the error messages function as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The system is traceable to NIST SRM #917c reference material and calibrated to be plasma-equivalent.

Stability (open- and close-vial) of the EGS-2003 test strips were evaluated in k170231 and support the claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored at 39 to $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of $10 \%$ and 5 month stability after opening when stored at the same conditions.

d. Detection limit:

See linearity study in M.1.b above.

e. Analytical specificity:

Potential interference from common endogenous and exogenous substances was evaluated in k170231 and not impacted by the modifications. Based on this testing, the labeling includes the following limitations:

If you take acetaminophen or acetaminophen containing medications (Tylenol, certain cold and flu remedies, or certain prescription drugs) this medication might affect the reliability of your blood glucose results (blood concentrations ${ \tt > } 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). If you are unsure, then ask your healthcare professional.

Certain conditions may cause your blood level of uric acid to rise. These conditions include gout or kidney disease. You should know that if your blood level of uric acid is high $( \ge 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ then your blood glucose results may be not reliable. If you are unsure, then ask your healthcare professional. · Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid $\mathrm { ( > 4 ~ m g / d L ) }$ ) naturally in your blood or from food or taking Vitamin C supplements might cause inaccurate blood glucose results when using this blood glucose monitoring system. Do not use this device during or shortly after receiving xylose absorption therapy since xylose may cause inaccurate blood glucose results.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: See M.3.c. below.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Accuracy in the hands of the intended user was established in k170231, however, the sponsor performed a supplemental usability study to demonstrate whether the minor modifications to the predicate device (BG5 meter, k170231) that resulted in the candidate device (BG5S meter) impacted usability. The lay users (341 subjects) were provided the BG5S meter with a test strip vial (EGS-2003 test strips) and labeling. Approximately half of the users were provided a iPhone 6S mobile device while the other half were provided a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge mobile device. These mobile devices were selected as representative mobile devices based on the user interface as well as hardware and software functionalities The lay users performed their own finger stick and blood glucose test, followed by a trained technician obtaining a sample for testing on the comparator method, YSI 2300. The study participants were asked to complete a usability questionnaire regarding ease of understanding of information in the user manual and the ease of use when performing a blood glucose test. The study demonstrated that users of the device were able to understand and follow the instructions provided in the labeling to perform tasks involved in blood glucose testing.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The following expected values for people without diabetes are provided in the labeling:
