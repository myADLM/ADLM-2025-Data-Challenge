# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification OIR Decision Summary

RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER k181316

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable (delete/add items as necessary):

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device. (For a preamendments device, a statement to this effect has been provided.)

# POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System (k162203)

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

This change was for the following items:

a. Addition of Bluetooth Low Energy capability   
b. Addition of a pixelated display screen   
c. Changed protective hard coat finish for the display lens   
d. Addition of graphical elements, settings and alerts to the display   
e. Changed from a buzzer to a speaker   
f. Changed silicone rubber “feet” on back of meter to a slip resistant label on the back of meter   
g. Updated the labeling

4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and specifications.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis   
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.

The POGO Automatic Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single patient home use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside commercial laboratory testing services demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with Clorox Germicidal Wipe (EPA Reg. No: 67619-12). The sponsor also conducted robustness studies and demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 730 cleaning and disinfection cycles representing 3 years of single patient use. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
