# 6) Device Description

The Extended Lipid Panel Assay involves the acquisition of a $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { M H z }$ proton NMR spectrum of serum or plasma, passing the spectral information through a Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression model, and deriving analyte concentrations from the spectrum based on the trained PLS model. The proton NMR spectrum of serum and plasma is replete with information from the lipids packaged in lipoproteins. The spectrum consists of multiple proton signals emanating from the TG, cholesteryl esters and free cholesterol present in chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL and HDL, out of which the methylene and methyl proton signals are the most abundant. NMR spectra were recorded for several hundred to several thousand representative serum specimens for which the TG, TC, HDL-C and ApoB were chemically measured. Using a PLS regression routine, the spectral information in the combined methylene and methyl region $( 0 . 5 6 - 1 . 4 0 \mathrm { p p m } )$ was trained against the chemical measurements where the information is connected through latent variables. Cross-validation was performed with PRESS statistics to optimize the regression model with an appropriate number of latent variables. Once trained with sufficient number of specimens, for any test specimen spectrum, the spectral information is then converted into lipid or ApoB concentrations through the optimum number of 24 to 27 latent variables for which the regression coefficients were known from the predictor matrix.

# 7) Indications for Use

The Extended Lipid Panel Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for quantitative determination of Total Cholesterol, High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Triglycerides in human serum and plasma, and Apolipoprotein B in human serum.

# Linearity

Reference serum pools were prepared from patient specimens with low to high values of TC, TG, HDL-C and ApoB as determined by the Extended Lipid Panel Assay. Each were mixed and diluted in different proportions to produce a range of different samples with widely varying target concentrations. Mean values from analysis of four replicates of each pool were compared to the expected target values to determine the percent bias for each sample. The serum pools were analyzed according to EP6-A. Regression plots of the linearity data for TC, TG, HDL-C and ApoB are given below:
