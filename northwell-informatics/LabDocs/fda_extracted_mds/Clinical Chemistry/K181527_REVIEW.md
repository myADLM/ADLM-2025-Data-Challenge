# L. Test Principle:

The On Call Sure Sync and On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use electrochemical methodologies that use a reagent system that includes glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and a mediator that reacts with the glucose in the whole blood sample obtained from the fingertip, forearm, and/or palm to produce an electrical current signal. This current is measured using an amperometric detection method. The meter then calculates and displays the blood glucose concentration reading, calibrated to plasma reference.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The only differences between the On Call Sure and On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems in this submission are the presence and absence of Bluetooth functionality and the device names. Therefore, the performance studies presented below were conducted using the On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System as a representative device.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

For evaluation of linearity, venous whole blood was prepare at 11 glucose levels (9.8, 28, 54.5, 81.8, 111.8, 173.5, 227.4, 342, 444.8, 563.8, and $6 7 3 . 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured on the comparator method YSI 2300 STAT PLUS). Each glucose level was measured 10in replicates of using each of 3 lots of test strips. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot was compared to the plasma YSI. The evaluation yielded the following regression equations:

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of $4 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample result is less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as “Lo”. If a sample result exceeds $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as “Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated by the sponsor and were demonstrated to function as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The On Call Sure Blood Glucose Monitoring System and On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System are traceable to the NIST SRM 917b reference material.

Test Strip Stability:

Stability of the On Call Sure Blood Glucose Test Strips was assessed using real time and accelerated studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims shelf life stability of 24 months and open-vial stability of 6 months when stored at the recommended storage conditions of $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ - $9 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 2 \small { - } 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity (RH).

# e. Analytical specificity:

For the evaluation of interference, 38 potentially interfering substances were spiked into venous whole blood. Each potentially interfering substance was tested at 3 glucose levels $\mathrm { 5 0 { - } 7 0 m g / d L }$ , $1 1 0 { - } 1 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 5 0 { - } 2 7 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Test samples were prepared to the specified concentration for each substance. Control samples were prepared without the potential interferent. Control and test samples were each measured in replicates of 30 and the bias between control and test samples was calculated. The highest interferent concentrations at which measurement bias was $\leq 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (for glucose $< 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } $ or $\leq 1 0 \%$ (for glucose $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ vs. control specimens is presented in the table below.

The sponsor has added the following statements to their labeling:

If you are taking a high dose of vitamin C (blood concentration $> 3 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), the result from your meter may not be correct.

Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing since xylose may cause inaccurate glucose results. Ask your doctor how long to wait before performing a glucose test.

To assess the performance of the On Call Sure/On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the hands of intended users, the sponsor conducted a user evaluation study consisting of 366 participants who collected capillary samples from their fingertip, palm, and forearm on their own and obtained blood glucose measurements on the candidate device using only the On Call Sure/On Call Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System labeling. Three test strip lots were used for this study and results were analyzed against results obtained on the comparator method, the YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer. The glucose concentrations of the samples ranged from $5 3 . 8 \mathrm { - } 5 3 7 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured on YSI 2300 Stat Plus (21 unaltered samples contained glucose $< 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 48 unaltered samples contained glucose $> 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Results are summarized below:

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit: To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of $10 \%$ , $1 5 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $65 \%$ and $70 \%$ . Each hematocrit level was tested at six glucose concentration intervals $( \sim 4 0$ , ${ \sim } 8 0$ , ${ \sim } 1 3 0$ , ${ \sim } 2 0 0$ , ${ \sim } 3 2 5$ , and ${ \sim } 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each sample was tested in replicates of ten using 30 meters and 3 test strip lots. Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator measurement (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer). The evaluation of bias and percent bias relative to values obtained on the YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer support the claimed hematocrit range of $10 \mathrm { - } 7 0 \%$ .

2. Altitude: To evaluate the effect of altitude on the On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System, meters were tested at 16 ft and 10,790 ft on fingerstick capillary blood acquired from 22 subjects at each altitude. Each sample was tested with 2 test strips from each of 3 strip lots on 2 meters. Results were compared to results obtained for venous plasma samples on laboratory-based comparator measurements taken at each altitude (i.e., at sea level YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer was used and at 10,000 ft Beckman Coulter UniCel DxC 800 Synchron Clinical System was used). At sea level, the reference glucose concentration range was $7 4 . 4 - 4 0 6 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $3 3 - 5 2 \%$ hematocrit). At 10,000 ft, the reference glucose concentration range was 59.4 – 282.6 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ( $3 9 - 6 1 \%$ hematocrit). Test results support the claims in the labeling that altitudes of up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on performance of the On Call Sure and On Call Sure Sync systems.

3. Operating Conditions: To evaluate system performance under the extremes of the recommended temperature and humidity conditions, venous samples were prepared at six glucose concentration levels (45.2, 103.0, 130.7, 202.4, 327.0, and $5 2 6 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Test strips from 3 lots were exposed to one of 7 relative humidity (RH) and temperature conditions $( 1 0 \% \mathrm { R H } / 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { : } }$ , $10 \%$ $\mathrm { R H } / 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $0 \% \mathrm { R H } / 4 5 ^ { \mathrm { \circ } } \mathrm { C }$ , $90 \%$ $\mathrm { R H } / 5 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C }$ , $90 \%$ $\mathrm { R H } / 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $90 \%$ $\% \mathrm { R H } / 4 5 ^ { \mathrm { \circ } } \mathrm { C } .$ , or $5 \% \mathrm { R H } / 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The results from the On Call Sure system were compared to results obtained using the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS, and support the claimed operating conditions of $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ RH and $4 1 { - } 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 5 . 4 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } ) }$ .

4. Sample Volume: To verify the minimum sample volume requirement, venous whole blood samples were tested at five volumes (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and $0 . 8 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). Sample concentrations included three glucose levels (50-65, 100-120, and $2 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Values obtained with the candidate device were compared to values obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer). Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 6 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that with blood volumes below $0 . 6 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , the insufficient sample volume

error message functioned as intended.

5. Sample Perturbation: The sponsor demonstrated that, while an error code (E-5: Insufficient sample volume error) was triggered when sample was removed during measurement, perturbation via shaking the meter and test strip, hitting the meter, or flicking the test strip during measurement does not significantly affect meter glucose results.

6. Intermittent Sampling: The sponsor demonstrated that intermittent sample application triggers an error code (E-5) when a short sample is initially applied to the test strip followed by a second sample application to the test strip. The results demonstrated that the device does not provide blood glucose values when samples are intermittently applied. The labeling indicates that the user should apply enough sample to fill the test strip check window within 3 seconds.

7. Testing with Used Test Strips: The sponsor demonstrated that used test strips were accurately detected by the meters when samples were applied to test strips prior to insertion into the meter and when previously used test strips were re-inserted in the meter after drying.

8. A variety of mechanical/durability testing (i.e., drop testing, temperature exposure, humidity exposure, temperature sensitivity and limit testing, test strip connector durability, vibration, packaging, and battery life testing) was performed and the ACON On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System to demonstrate that the meter is robust to environmental and mechanical stresses.

9. Infection Control and Robustness Studies: The ACON On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy testing on the surface materials of the meter demonstrated complete inactivation of duck hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectants, DisCide Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA Registration #10492-4) and PDI Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposal Wipes (EPA Registration #9480-4). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles (a total of 520 wipes) designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use for the ACON On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

10. The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic (EMC) testing was performed and the ACON On Call Sure/Sure Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System were found to be compliant.
