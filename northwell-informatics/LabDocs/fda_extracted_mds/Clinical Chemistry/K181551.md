# 4. Special instrument requirements:

None

# F. Device Description:

DAVID One Step Pregnancy Test is designed in three formats: strip, cassette, and midstream. Each of the devices (strip, cassette and midstream) contains a pouch with the test device and instructions for use, additional test cassette also contains a disposable plastic dropper. The test cassette and test midstream consist of a chromatographic test strip enclosed in plastic housing. The test strip contains mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta$ -hCG antibody, mouse monoclonal anti- $\mathfrak { a }$ -hCG antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody and colloidal gold.

The added plastic housing does not affect the performance of the product, which is determined by the test strip. The only difference between the different formats is test procedure.

The test uses two lines to indicate results. The appearance of two color bands, one at the “Test line” and one at the “Control line” region means the test is “positive”. The appearance of a color band at the “Control line” region but not at the “Test line” region means the test is “negative”. If there are no colored bands in the “Control line” area and “Test line” region or if there is no color band in “Control line” region even there is a band in the “Test line” region; this means “invalid” test result.

# H. Guidance Document:

None were referenced

# I. Test Principle:

The test is a qualitative, solid phase, double antibodies sandwich immunochromatographic assay.

During the test, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti- $\beta$ -hCG antibody- colloidal gold conjugate specific to the beta subunit of hCG) and forms a complex. The complex migrates along the membrane to the mouse anti- $\mathfrak { a }$ -hCG antibody test region (T), and remains captured in the T line.

# J．Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance a. Precision/Reproducibility Dilute HCG standard with negative urine samples from healthy women to different concentrations: HCG0mIU/mL, HCG $3 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , HCG 6mIU/mL, HCG7.5mIU/mL, HCG9mIU/mL, HCG $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , HCG15mIU/mL and HCG25mIU/mL.

In each site of the 3 sites, one format of reagent will be used for detection by 1 investigator. In each day of test, 10pcs of reagents from each lot, totally 3 lots, will be used for detection. Test will be conducted every other day, totally 5 days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The tests is calibrated against the WHO International Standard 5th WHO Chorionic Gonadotrophin （NIBSC code: 07/364）

Stability:

The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf life were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a 30-month shelf life for all three test formats when stored in the sealed foil pouch at $3 6 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 \small { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

# Expected values :

1. Negative results are expected in healthy non-pregnant women. 2. The amount of hCG will vary greatly with gestational age and between individuals.

d. Detection limit:

Select 30 healthy non-pregnant women and collect their urine samples as basic diluted urine. Separate each sample into 10 sets respectively, each of which is spiked with HCG standard to get required concentrations, respectively are ： $\mathrm { H C G 0 m I U / m L }$ , $\mathrm { H C G 3 m I U / m L }$ , HCG $5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , HCG6mIU/mL 2 $\mathrm { H C G 7 . 5 m I U / m L }$ , HCG9mIU/mL, HCG 10mIU/mL, HCG12.5mIU/mL ,

HCG15mIU/mL and HCG25mIU/mL. There are 30 samples for each concentration. All the samples are re-numbered and divided into 4 sets，so each group of samples have 10 different concentrations and each concentration is made with negative urine sample from 30 different women. All the samples are stored below -20 $^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .

There were 3 formats of reagent for assessment: strip, cassette and midstream. There were two test methods for the midstream format: the dip method and the simulated stream method. For each format, 3 lots of reagents would be used for test.

12 laboratory operators were selected to carry out this test based on different test methods. The 12 operators would be separated into 4 groups, 3 for each group, and then respectively test with strips, cassettes , midstreams (the dip method) and midstreams (the simulated stream method).

The results demonstrated that the analytical sensitivity of the new device (the lowest concentration that yields $100 \%$ positive results) was $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and the cut-off level (at which approximately half of the devices yield positive results and the remainder yield negative results) was $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Cross reactivity:

To evaluate cross-reactivity, 20 fresh urine specimens obtained from 10 healthy non-pregnant women and 10 healthy men were spiked with different concentrations of Lutenizing Hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating Hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) into negative $\mathrm { 0 \ m I U / m L }$ ) and positive $\mathrm { 1 0 m I U / m l } )$ samples. The results demonstrated no cross reaction with LH at $5 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m l }$ , FSH at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , and TSH at $1 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# Interference:

Effects of Urine pH：

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pH. Negative and positive hCG urine samples ( $\mathrm { 1 0 ~ m I U / m L }$ were tested across a $\mathsf { p H }$ range of 4-9. The results demonstrate that $\mathsf { p H }$ ranging from 4 to 9 in urine samples does not interfere with the performance of the test.

# Specific Gravity:

A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine specific gravity on the device. The device was challenged with negative urine and positive urine with specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.050. The results demonstrate that specific gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.050 in urine samples does not interfere with the performance of the test.

High dose hook effect study:

The test was evaluated for high dose hook effect. Negative urine specimens were spiked with high hCG concentration of up to $2 0 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . All samples yielded the expected results. This study demonstrates that this device shows no hook effect up to 2,000,000 mIU/mL hCG.

Effects of hCG β-core Fragment:

Interference testing was performed to evaluate whether high levels of beta core fragment interfere with the device. Negative urine hCG and positive urine samples (containing 10 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with hCG beta core fragment at concentrations of62,500, 125,000, 250,000, 500,000, and $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { \ p m o l / L }$ . Concentrations of hCG beta core fragment up to $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ yielded correct results. Interference from hCG $\beta$ -core fragment was demonstrated at concentrations of $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

2. Comparison Study:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Tests were conducted at 3 different sites. In each site, 120 urine samples were simultaneously double-blind tested by professionals using both predicate devices and one format of proposed devices. Simultaneously, two test methods of midstream, the dip method and the simulated stream method, would be compared.

# Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples

A total of 1287 urine samples were collected from 99 different women (20-40 years old) who planned to become pregnant. These women were followed throughout their conception cycles with urine collected from day -10 to day 2 of their expected period. These 1287 samples were then tested by laboratory technicians (one for strip, one for cassette format, and one for midstream for both dip and stream methods). Urine samples were masked and randomized by people who prepared samples but did not participate in the testing. One lot of each test device was used.

# Layuser study

This study was performed at 3 sites on Chinese mainland. Chose women volunteers who had certain English reading ability and were willing to take time to assist the site to complete the test without compensation. These volunteers should have diverse educational and professional background but without corresponding medical background and their age range were between 20 and 40 years old.

Each unit completed the selection of 120 volunteers to conduct this lay user study, of which 50 were pregnant women and 70 were non-pregnant women.

Each site completed a study of a format, and the midstream format was used for test by simulated stream method and dip method.

All volunteers, after reading the English manual of the corresponding format of the product provided by the applicant, independently completed the collection, detection and result judgment of their urine samples without the assistance of professionals. The simultaneously collected urine samples by the volunteers were detected by professionals after blinded (the people who blinded the samples do not participate in the test). The test results of the professional and non-professional were summarized as follows:

The second study is conducted with diluted samples.

120 volunteers at each site detect 4 samples containing different concentration of HCG, HCG $5 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ , HCG 8mIU/mL, HCG $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and $\mathrm { H C G 1 1 . 5 m I U / m L }$ , after collection of their own urine samples. The midstream format will be used for detection in the dip method and the simulated stream method. The testing was performed at 3 intended use sites. One lot of each of the three test formats were used in the study.

The results show that when use the product to detect samples spiked with HCG at concentrations which are above or below the detection limit $\mathrm { ( H C G 1 0 m I U / m L ) }$ , for samples whose HCG concentrations are $5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , 1-2 of the test results is positive, and for samples whose HCG concentrations are $1 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , all the results are positive.

Because this test detects low levels of hCG, it is possible that this test may give positive results even if you are not pregnant. If you test positive, but think you may not be pregnant, you should check with your doctor.

360 volunteers who have finished the study with clinical samples were willing to do a questionnaire survey. All the questions in the questionnaire were in Likert scale style. At the same time, a Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis is performed on each package insert and the score demonstrates a reading Grade Level of 8.The results of the questionnaire reflects that the consumers find the device easy to use and that they do not have trouble understanding the labeling or interpreting results.

# Non-pregnant urine sample analysis :

A total of 900 samples were tested in three clinical trial sites by professionals. In each unit, there were 100 samples for each age group, and one format of device from 3 lots would be used for detection.
