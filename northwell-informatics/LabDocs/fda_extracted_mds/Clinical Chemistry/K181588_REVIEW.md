# L. Test Principle:

The blood glucose testing is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip within the Sensor Module. The system measures the current, calculates the blood glucose level, and displays the result. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample. The final results are communicated to the smart mobile device through a mobile application.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed repeatability (within-day) studies using venous whole blood samples adjusted to five different glucose concentrations (approximately 49, 106, 143, 246 and $3 9 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each glucose level was analyzed in replicates of ten, using sensor modules with test strips from three lots and ten meters for a total of 100 tests per each glucose level. Results are summarized below:

Intermediate precision was evaluated over 10 days using five levels of glucose control solutions with glucose concentrations of approximately 50, 95, 135, 245 and $3 0 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was measured ten times using sensor modules with test strips from three lots and ten POPS! one meters. These tests were performed over ten days, for a total of 100 tests per glucose level. Results are summarized below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using sensor modules with test strips from three lots and 11 mixed pools of venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of approximately 17, 41, 59, 101, 145, 187, 279, 388, 429, 521 and $6 2 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by YSI 2300. Each level was measured in replicates of 15 and the values from the POPS! one meters were compared with those obtained from YSI 2300. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:

Lot 1: $\begin{array} { r l } { \mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 8 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 7 6 \mathbf { } } & { \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 } \\ { \mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 2 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 5 9 9 } & { \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 } \\ { \mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 4 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 5 4 1 } & { \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 } \end{array}$   
Lot 2:   
Lot 3:

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . If a sample is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the meter’s mobile application will display the error message “Your result was less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which is lower than the measuring range of the meter”. If a sample exceeds 600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the meter’s mobile application will display the error message: “Your result was greater than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which is higher than the measuring range of the meter”. These low and high functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

The POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST SRM # 917c glucose reference material.

# Sensor module stability:

The stability of the POPS! one sensor module was assessed using accelerated and real-time studies. The testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the manufacturer’s labeled claims for a shelf life stability of 6 months for a sealed package (sensor module in foil

packaging) and 5 days for an opened package (sensor module outside of the foil package) at the recommended storage temperatures of $3 5 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity.

d. Detection limit:

The reportable range is 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ based on linearity studies above.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed by spiking venous whole blood to achieve three glucose levels $\mathrm { \hbar } \mathrm { \left( 5 0 - 7 0 \ m g / d L \right. }$ , $1 1 0 - 1 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 2 5 - 2 7 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each of these samples was divided into a test sample with the potential interferent added and a control sample with no added interferent. Each sample was measured using ten meters and sensor modules with test strips from three lots, for a total of 30 replicates per sample. Results on the candidate meter from the test samples were compared to results on the candidate meter from the control sample. No interference was defined by the sponsor as $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias at each glucose level. The highest concentrations at which no significant interference was observed are presented in the following table:

To assess the performance of the POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System (TD4142) in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed a study with 362 English speaking participants. The users were responsible for obtaining their own

fingertip capillary sample and performing a blood glucose test using only the instructions from the product labeling. A total of 362 POPS! meters, three lots of sensor modules and 6 iPhones (model 6,6,7, 7 plus and 8) were used. Results were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System against results obtained with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from $5 3 - 5 5 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , as measured by the YSI 2300. The results are summarized below:

# Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Values:

A study to evaluate the performance of POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the extreme upper and lower ends of the claimed measuring range was performed using 50 altered samples with glucose concentrations below $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 50 samples greater than $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were altered by spiking or glycolysis in order to obtain the appropriate glucose concentrations. Samples were tested in replicates of six using two POPS! one meters and sensor modules with test strips from three lots, and compared to the average of two YSI 2300 measurements.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1) Hematocrit Study:

To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the POPS! one Glucose Monitoring System, venous whole blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ and $60 \%$ . Each hematocrit level was adjusted to achieve five concentrations within the following ranges: 30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250 and 251- $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was then tested using 10 POPS! one meters and sensor modules with test strips from 3 lots. The values were compared with the average of 4 glucose measurements obtained from YSI 2300 analyzer. The $\%$ biases relative to the comparator method were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of $20 \%$ to $60 \%$ .

2) Altitude study:

To evaluate the effect of altitude on blood glucose measurement of POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System, a study was conducted using venous whole blood samples adjusted with 7 concentration levels of glucose ranging from 51 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were placed under conditions to simulate 4 different altitude conditions from sea level to 4500 meters (15,000 feet). Each blood sample was tested using 4 POPS! one meters and one lot of sensor modules; the values were compared with the values obtained with the YSI 2300 analyzer outside of the pressurized chamber. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI 2300 to support the claims in the labeling that glucose

measurement performance of the POPS! one System is maintained at altitudes ranging from the sea level up to 4,500 meters (15,000 feet).

# 3) Operating conditions:

The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the POPS! Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to approximately 65 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose. Testing was conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations: $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 4 6 . 4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F ) }$ and $4 2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( 1 0 7 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ at $10 \%$ and $90 \%$ RH each and at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \left( 7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } \right)$ at $60 \%$ RH. Four POPS! one meters and three lots of test strips were used. Values measured by the POPS! one glucose meters were compared to results from the comparator method YSI 2300. The study results support the operating condition claim of 50 to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (10 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) with relative humidity of $1 5 \%$ to $8 5 \%$ .

4) Sample volume study:

The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume for the POPS! one system. Venous whole blood samples with three levels of glucose concentrations (50-65, 100-120, and $2 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } \rangle$ ) were tested at six sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and $0 . 8 , \mu \mathrm { L } )$ ) using 3 lots of test strips and 10 meters. Values obtained were compared to YSI 2300 values. The meter has an error message that is displayed on the mobile application when not enough blood is added to the test strip. This feature was validated and was shown to function as intended. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

# 5) Sample perturbation study:

The sponsor performed sample perturbation studies using venous whole blood samples comparing meter readings to YSI 2300 results. Results were obtained without perturbation of the test strip and with perturbation. The results demonstrate that the performance of POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not affected by perturbed sample.

6) Intermittent sampling

The sponsor assessed the performance of the device when intermittent sampling occurs using venous whole blood samples comparing meter readings to results from the comparator method YSI 2300. Results were obtained by adding samples to the test strip that were less than the required volume followed by a second sample application to the test strip. The results demonstrate that the performance of POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not affected by intermittent sampling.

# 7) Testing with used test strips

The sponsor assessed the performance of the device when used test strips were inserted into the meter . Each test resulted in an error message displayed on the mobile application. The results demonstrate that the error code functions as intended when used test strips are used.

8) Infection Control:

The device is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the meter materials by an outside commercial laboratory, demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Micro$\mathrm { K i l l + T M }$ Disinfecting Wipes (EPA Registration Number 59894-10-37549). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor using the POPS! one Blood Glucose Monitoring System and demonstrating that there was no change in the performance of the system or in the internal and external materials of the meter after 260 cycles of cleaning and disinfection cycles, using the chosen disinfectant, to simulate cleaning and disinfecting the meter once per week over the expected service life of 5 years for a singlepatient use glucose meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

9) A variety of mechanical and durability tests (i.e., drop, vibration, shipping) were performed demonstrating that the meter is robust to environmental and mechanical stresses.

10) Electrical Safety and EMC testing

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was found to be compliant.

11) The test strip and sensor module lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
