# L. Test Principle:

The uric acid measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and utilizes a nonenzymatic detection through the one electron reduction of ferric ion to produce a current directly proportional to the uric acid concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

Analytical performance studies were conducted using the FORA MD6 Uric Acid Monitoring System. The only differences between the FORA MD6 Uric Acid Monitoring System and FORA MD6 Pro Uric Acid Monitoring System are the intended use and labeling.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision performance of the FORA MD6 Uric Acid Monitoring System was established following the recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3.

Internal repeatability study

The repeatability of the system was assessed using heparin venous whole blood prepared with two uric acid concentrations and tested on 10 meters and 3 test strip lots. At each concentration, 10 replicates were tested per meter on each of three lots for a total of 300 measurements. The results are summarized below:

# Within-laboratory

Within-laboratory precision was assessed using one level of a control solution and two levels of heparin venous whole blood. The samples were tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 measurements per level using one test strip lot and 4 meters. After each two day period, the whole blood samples were prepared fresh. The results demonstrated $\% \mathrm { C V }$ levels of less than $4 \%$ .

Multi- site precision study

A precision study was conducted at three sites. At each site, 3 operators and 3 meters assayed samples in five replicates per run with one run per day over 5 days for each of 3 test strip lots for a total of 225 measurements per sample. The samples were venous whole blood with two levels of uric acid. After each two day period, the whole blood samples were prepared fresh. All sites used the same samples and test strip lots. The results demonstrated $\% C V$ levels of less than $4 \%$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the uric acid test system was assessed following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A. Linearity of the test system was established using six venous whole blood samples spanning the claimed analytical measurement range of 3.0 to 13.0 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples with concentrations known relative to each were prepared from a dilution series by combining volumes from a high pool and low pool for uric acid. Each of the samples was measured in replicates of 5 across one run. The measured uric acid concentrations were assessed for a linear response by the polynomial method of CLSI EP06-A. Regression analysis identified that the coefficients for a second or third order polynomial fit were not statistically significant, and therefore the uric acid test system response is not fitted better by a polynomial function, and a linear response was implied. Based on these results, the sponsor concluded that the uric acid test system demonstrate a satisfactory linear response over the claimed range of 3.0 to $1 3 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The linear regression summary is given below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range tested</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.014</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.995</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.5 - 14.8 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

Readings outside of measurement range:

Software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a uric acid measurement was less than the lower end of the analytical measurement range, a ‘Lo’ message is displayed. If a measurement exceeded the upper end of the analytical measurement range a ‘Hi’ message is displayed.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The FORA MD6 Uric Acid Monitoring System and FORA MD6 Pro Uric Acid Monitoring System are standardized using calibrators with values assigned by an isotope dilution-mass spectrometry method for uric acid.

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limit of the FORA MD6 Uric Acid Monitoring System was established by evaluation of the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ).

LoB: The LoB was analyzed non-parametrically as the 95th percentile of the measurements following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.

LoD: The LoD was analyzed by parametric analysis following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.

LoQ: For the LoQ study, 9 venous whole blood samples with varying low levels of uric acid were prepared and tested using two test strip lots in replicates of two per run with 2 runs per day for 20 days. The LoQ estimate for each reagent lot was determined directly from the concentration versus precision plot with LoQ at the intersection with the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ goal of $7 . 5 \%$ . The highest LoQ from the two test strip lots was taken as the overall LoQ. The results of the detection limit studies are summarized as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analytical Measurement Range</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.3 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.7 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.8 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0 to 13.0 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing on the FORA MD6 Uric Acid Monitoring System was evaluated following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-A2.

Interference testing was performed to evaluate exogenous and endogenous substances using venous whole blood spiked to two uric acid levels of 5 and $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The samples were divided into 2 aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test (with added interferent at a toxic level or 10 times the known therapeutic level). Each sample was measured in replicates of four using four meters and one test strip lot.

The sponsor defined no significant interference as bias $< \pm 1 0 \%$ for the test compared to control samples. The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant interference was detected.

The sponsor supplies 2 levels of FORA Uric Acid Control Solution. The controls are sold separately.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The Performance Characteristics Section above:

Hematocrit study:

A study was conducted to verify that the uric acid measurements on the FORA MD6 Uric Acid Monitoring System are not affected by hematocrit levels over the range of $20 \%$ to $60 \%$ In the study, samples at four uric acid concentrations and 6 hematocrit levels from $20 \%$ to $60 \%$ were prepared from sodium heparin whole blood. Each samples was measured in 6 replicates using 6 meters and one test strip lot. The effect of hematocrit on the uric acid measurements was evaluated for bias versus a comparator method. The hematocrit level for each sample was measured by a microhematocrit method. The results demonstrated that hematocrit levels from $20 \%$ and $60 \%$ have no significant impact on the blood uric acid measurements.

# Altitude study:

A study was conducted to demonstrate that uric acid measurements on the FORA Advanced GD40 Uric Acid Monitoring System were not affected by altitudes from sea level to 15,000 feet. Venous whole blood samples were spiked to 4 concentrations of uric acid and each tested at 4 atmospheric pressures using a glove box to simulate changes in altitude (0, 500, 11500, and 15000 feet). Each sample was tested with 4 meters and one lot of test strips. The bias at each condition was calculated relative to a comparator method. The results support the claim that altitudes changes from sea level to 11,500 feet have no significant effect on the blood uric acid measurements.

# Temperature and Humidity Study:

A study was conducted to validate the operating temperature and humidity claims of the system. In this study, sodium heparin venous whole blood samples at two uric acid levels (5 and $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were tested in 4 replicates using 4 meters and one test strip lot. Operating conditions were evaluated at following four combinations temperature and humidity extreme conditions in an environmental chamber:

$5 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \%$ RH $5 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $8 5 \%$ RH $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \%$ RH $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $8 5 \%$ RH $7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $60 \%$ RH

The bias at each condition was calculated relative to a comparator method. The results support the claimed operating temperature range of $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F }$ $( 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) at $10 \%$ to $8 5 \%$ RH.

Electromagnetic Compatibility:

The information to support electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) performance for the FORA MD6 Multi-Functional meter was reviewed and found acceptable.

# Sample Volume Study:

The volume of capillary whole blood required by the test strip is $2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . A study was performed to verify the sample volume and to verify proper reporting of an error message when the volume is below 2.0. For testing, samples were prepared by spiking sodium heparin venous whole blood at two levels of uric acid ( $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each uric acid sample was tested in replicates of 5 using five meters and one test strip lot across 6 different volumes (1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, $2 . 3 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). Results from this study supported the claimed minimum sample volume of $2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The study found that for volumes less than 2.0 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ , the meter displayed an error message “E-F”, and for volumes of $2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and greater the system returned correct results.

# Infection Control Studies:

The FORA MD6 Uric Acid meter is intended for single-patient use, and the FORA MD6 Pro Uric Acid meter is intended for multiple-patient use.

The information in support of disinfection efficacy was reviewed and found acceptable.

Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in external materials of the meters after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles with Micro-Kill Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# Readability Assessment:

A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was conducted by the sponsor which demonstrated that the meter user manual and test strip product inserts were written at or below an $8 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade reading level.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as applicable.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
