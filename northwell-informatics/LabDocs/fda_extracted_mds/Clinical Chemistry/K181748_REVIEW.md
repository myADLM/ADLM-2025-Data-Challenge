# L. Test Principle:

Magnesium present in the sample is a cofactor in an enzymatic reaction with isocitrate dehydrogenase. The rate of increase in absorbance at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , due to the formation of NADPH, is directly proportional to the magnesium concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

Analytical performance for serum and plasma was cleared under k173294. Analytical performance for urine is presented below.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI EP05-A2 guideline. Precision testing included 2 commercially available urine-based controls (Control 1 and 2) and 3 contrived urine pools (A, B, and C). Each sample was tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates per sample. The results from the precision study are summarized in the table that follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Mean (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Within Run</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Control 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.54</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.055</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.058</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Control 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.17</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.114</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.149</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>UrinePool A</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.89</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.036</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.045</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>UrinePool B</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.096</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.102</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Urine Pool C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22.51</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.394</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.394</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8%</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A guideline. The linearity of the Magnesium assay was evaluated by preparing a series of 12 sample pools with analyte concentrations of 0.98, 1.47, 1.97, 3.09, 5.12, 9.27, 13.60, 18.04, 22.51, 27.02, 31.95 and $3 6 . 3 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were tested in four replicates with 2 reagent lots on 1 ARCHITECT c8000 System. The linear regression results of a representative sample set are as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { x } - 0 . 2 0 , \mathrm { r } = 1 . 0 0
$$

The results of the linearity study supports the claimed analytical measuring interval of 1.81 to $2 6 . 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Automatic dilution:

The sponsor evaluated the automatic dilution (auto-dilution) protocol using a 1:3 dilution factor. Two urine pools were prepared to magnesium concentrations above $2 6 . 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and evaluated in replicates of 12 using the on board auto-dilution on the ARCHITECT c8000 System. Results obtained using auto-dilution were found to be less than $10 \%$ difference from the expected values. The results of this study support the sponsor’s labeling claims that, using the Automated Dilution Protocol, samples with magnesium concentrations above $2 6 . 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may be auto-diluted 1:3 on board the analyzer.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The assigned values for Magnesium are traceable to NIST SRM 956 reference material.

# d. Detection limit:

Detection limit studies were carried out in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.

The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by running 4 blank samples in 10 replicates per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots on one ARCHITECT c8000 System. The $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the zero-analyte sample concentration was calculated and considered to the estimated LoB.

The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by running ten low level samples in 10 replicates per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots on one ARCHITECT $\mathbf { c 8 0 0 0 }$ System. LoD was calculated based on the following equation: $\mathrm { L o D = L o B + C p \ x \ S D _ { L } } ;$ where $\mathrm { C p }$ is multiplier to give the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of a normal distribution and $\mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { L } }$ is the pooled SD ).

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined by running ten low level samples in 10 replicates per run and 2 runs per day for 3 days using 2 reagent lots on one ARCHITECT c8000 System. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration that yielded an estimated total error less than or equal to the total allowable error of $2 2 . 0 \%$ .

The results for the urine application of the assay (new claim) are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.04</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.09</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.75</td></tr></table>

The detection limit study supports the claimed measuring range of $1 . 8 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $2 6 . 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

An interference study was performed based on the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. Interference effects were assessed by dose response and paired difference methods. For each potentially interfering substance, 2 base pools were prepared using human urine and magnesium chloride at magnesium levels of approximately $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 14 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Bias is defined as the difference in the results between the control sample (without interference) and the test sample (contains interferent) expressed in percent. Difference exceeding $10 \%$ is considered significant interference by the sponsor.

The highest concentration of substance tested that did not cause significant interference for magnesium samples is summarized in the table below.

The following statements have been included in the Limitations of the Procedure section of the package insert:

• The Magnesium assay is susceptible to interference from hemoglobin.   
• Do not use acetic acid, nitric acid, and sodium fluoride as urine preservatives.   
• Do not use more than 2.5 mL 6N HCl per $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of urine. Excess hydrochloric acid may cause elevated results with this methodology.   
• Do not exceed $1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ boric acid.

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable.

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was conducted by testing a total of 118 patient urine samples (106 native and 12 spiked urine samples) with magnesium concentrations from $1 . 8 2 { - } 2 3 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , as determined on the predicate device. Three aliquots from each sample were prepared to characterize bias under different testing conditions: (a) without acidification to represent random urine samples with no preservative added, (b) with acidification to $\mathsf { p H } < 2$ $\left( \mathsf { p H } 1 . 8 - 1 . 9 \right)$ using 6N HCl to represent samples with added preservative, or (c) with acidification to $\mathsf { p H } \sim 1$ $( \mathsf { p H 0 . 9 - 1 . 1 } )$ using 6N HCl, as per predicate device instructions. Results obtained for each aliquot (a), (b), and (c) on the candidate device were compared to results obtained for aliquot (c) using the predicate device (Roche Magnesium Gen.2).

The results of the regression analyses are summarized in the tables below:
