# G. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 862.1355

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product code: QDK (integrated continuous glucose monitoring system for non-intensive diabetes management)

4. Panel: Chemistry (75)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for use below.

2.	 Indication(s) for use:

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom Glucose Program System) is a real time, continuous glucose monitoring device indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 2 years and older.   
The Dexcom Glucose Program System is intended to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions for persons with diabetes who are not at   
significant risk of severe hypoglycemia. Interpretation of the Dexcom Glucose Program System results should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential sensor readings over time. The Dexcom Glucose Program System also aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating long-term therapy adjustments. The Dexcom Glucose Program System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices. The Dexcom Glucose Program System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices or services for the purpose of managing diabetes.

3.	 Special conditions for use statement(s):

This device is for prescription use only. The Dexcom Glucose Program System, which is intended for use in persons with diabetes who do not have a significant risk of hypoglycemia, does not alert or alarm to tell you when your glucose is low (below your target range), high (above your target range), or rapidly changing. Users shold check readings often if they need to know their glucose level. The components of the Dexcom Glucose Program System (sensor, transmitter, or smart device) must be removed prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The Dexcom Glucose Program System has not been tested in those situations. • This device is not intended for pregnant women, people on dialysis, or patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy. Taking higher than the maximum dose of acetaminophen (e.g. $> 1$ gram every 6 hours in adults) may affect the Dexcom Glucose Program System readings and make them look higher than they really are. Sensor placement is important to ensure system performance. Users should choose a site: o At least 3 inches from insulin pump infusion set or injection site or previous CGM insertion site o Away from waistband, scarring, tattoos, irritation, and bones $\bigcirc$ Unlikely to be bumped, pushed, or laid on while sleeping

•	 Store your sensors only between $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ .

4.	 Special instrument requirements: Not Applicable.

# I. Device Description:

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program System in an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose readings which are updated every 5 minutes providing glucose levels and trends. The System consists of three main components: a sensor, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter and a BLE enabled display device (receiver and/or mobile application). A user must use the Dexcom G6 Glucose Program App (i.e., a mobile medical application) running on a compatible mobile device in order to view glucose data.

# G6 GLUCOSE PROGRAM CGM SENSOR

The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator, plastic base (“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable unit that contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the needle and inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and can be worn for up to 10 days.

The sensor may be worn in the abdomen for adults, and both the abdomen and buttock for children ages 2-17 years old.

# G6 GLUCOSE PROGRAM TRANSMITTER

The transmitter component is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data processing functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver for communication with a compatible display device (i.e., mobile device). The transmitter attaches to the sensor and can be re-used for multiple sensing sessions up to three months.

# G6 GLUCOSE PROGRAM MOBILE APP

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM App for Android is the primary display for the system. The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM App is compatible with specific Android devices. A link to a list of compatible devices is included in the instructions for use.

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic interfaces. The G6 Glucose Program CGM system is designed to communicate with interoperable devices in several ways, such as described below:

· Wireless communication from the transmitter directly to an interoperable device communicating through the same protocol. · The app communicates to another app on a single mobile platform. · The app communicates through the cloud to another software device.

# J.	 Substantial Equivalence Information:

1.	 Predicate device name(s): G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System

2.	 Predicate 510(k) number(s): DEN170088

3.	 Comparison with predicate:

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program System is identical to the predicate device with the exception of the user interface (e.g., a new mobile app and no dedicated hardware receiver), and the population that the device is intended for. The predicate device was intended for use by people with diabetes age 2 years and older, whereas the Dexcom G6 Glucose Program System is only intended for those people with diabetes who have a low risk of experiencing severe hypoglycemia.

# L. Test Principle:

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM System detects glucose levels from the fluid just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using an algorithm to a glucose value read in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which is then transmitted to the receiver for the user to see and use accordingly.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

As established in DEN170088.

The components of the Dexcom G6 Glucose Program System are identical to those of the predicate device except for a new user interface (mobile app) that is specific for the new device.

The analytical and clinical performance of this device is primarily determined by the design of the sensor and transmitter system components, the glucose determination algorithm, and the method of calibration. All of these aspects of the predicate device are unchanged in the candidate device. Therefore the performance characteristics of the candidate device are referenced from the predicate device.

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: As established in DEN170088.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: As established in DEN170088.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): As established in DEN170088.   
d. Detection limit: As established in DEN170088.   
e. Analytical specificity: As established in DEN170088.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a.	 Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable.

b.	 Matrix comparison: Not applicable. Interstitial fluid is the only indicated matrix.

3. Clinical studies:

a.	 Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable.

b.	 Clinical specificity: Not Applicable.

c.	 Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

As established in DEN170088.

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program System has a new user interface (mobile app) compared to the predicate device. The new user interface presents similar information to the user (e.g., glucose values and glucose trend information), and users must perform the same critical tasks when using the interface (e.g., entering sensor calibration codes, pairing the transmitter to the app using Bluetooth, and optionally entering blood glucose calibration values). The information provided was adequate to support the substantial equivalence of the new user interface.

4.	 Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5.	 Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.
