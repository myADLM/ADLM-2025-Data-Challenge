Re: K182046 Trade/Device Name: Tyson Bio HS100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System Tyson Bio HS100-B Blood Glucose Monitoring System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1345 Regulation Name: Glucose test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: NBW Dated: October 31, 2018 Received: October 31, 2018

Dear Feng-Yu Lee:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR

803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (http://www.fda.gov/DICE) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Device Name Tyson Bio HS100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Indications for Use (Describe)   
The Tyson Bio HS100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm, or palm. Alterative site testing should be performed only during steady-state (when glucose is not changing rapidly). Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is intended for self-testing by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It should only be used by a single patient and it should not be shared. It is not indicated for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use.

The Tyson Bio HS100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is comprised of the Tyson Bio HS100 Blood Glucose Meter and Tyson Bio 50H Blood Glucose Test Strip.

# Differences:

# The item list of differences from predicate device:

(1) Meter size change   
(2) Ejection button color change   
(3) Ejection button position change   
(4) Operation button size change   
(5) Removal of USB transfer:   
(6) LCD interface change- "Month" and "Day" are displayed in the upper left corner of the LCD screen   
(7) LCD interface change- Remove one display bar in the upper left corner of the LCD screen   
(8) LCD interface change- Remove “AM” in the upper right corner of the LCD screen.   
(9) User interface change-"Month" and "Day" are displayed on the LCD when user doing: ▪ Date Setup Blood Glucose Measurement Control Solution Measurement View the memory for blood glucose measurement View the memory for control solution measurement

(10) Removal of Bluetooth function

# The rationales of differences from predicate device:

(1) Meter size change: For product portfolio plan, a smaller size with less cost is offered to customer.   
(2) Ejection button color change: Separate the color of the housing to make the ejection button more easily to be seen.   
(3) Ejection button position change: Change the ejection button from the lower half of the meter to the upper half, which is a requirement from potential customers.   
(4) Operation button size change: The three-dimensional raised button design is more noticeable for user to operate.   
(5) Removal of USB transfer: Simplify the data transfer function of meter.   
(6) LCD interface change- "Month" and "Day" are displayed in the upper left corner of the LCD screen: Give the meanings of numbers which are displayed in the upper left corner of the LCD.   
(7) LCD interface change- Remove one display bar in the upper left corner of the LCD screen: Removing this display bar will not affect the date and time display of the instrument and can reduce costs.   
(8) LCD interface change- Remove “AM” in the upper right corner of the LCD screen. Removing “AM” will not affect the date and time display of the meter and can reduce costs.
