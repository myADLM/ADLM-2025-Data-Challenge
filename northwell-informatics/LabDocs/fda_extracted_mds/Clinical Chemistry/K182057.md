Dear Cynthia Hung:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

Device Name EasyMax BT Self Monitoring Blood Glucose system

Indications for Use (Describe)

The EasyMax BT Self Monitoring Blood Glucose System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm, or forearm. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by a single patient with diabetes and should not be shared, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The system is not to be used on neonates, nor for the diagnosis of, or screening for diabetes mellitus. Alternative site testing can be only used during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

The system consists of the EasyMax BT meter and the EasyMax BT test strips. The EasyMax BT meter only is used with the EasyMax BT test strips to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm, or forearm.

# Predicate Device

Proprietary Name: EasyMax MU Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose System 510(k) Number: K121207

# Device Description

The modified device of EasyMax BT SMBGS is derived from the existing device of EasyMax MU SMBGS with the addition of a Bluetooth dongle on the meter. The system consists of a blood glucose meter and test strips which are designed, tested, and verified to work together as a system to produce accurate blood glucose test results. The system also includes the control solution which is used to check the performance of the system.

The electrochemical principle on the test strip is the reaction of FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) with blood glucose and a small electrical current generated proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The meter measures the current and displays the blood glucose result.

# Intended Use

The EasyMax BT Self Monitoring Blood Glucose System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm, or forearm. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by a single patient with diabetes and should not be shared, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. The system is not to be used on neonates, nor for the diagnosis of, or screening for diabetes mellitus. Alternative site testing can be only used during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

3. Change the product name

Other than the above modification, the following remains the same to the predicate device:

Has the same intended use Uses the same operating principle Uses the same meters Uses the same glucose test strips

# Summary of Design Control Activities

Based on the modifications, the risk analysis was assessed and the risks were identified and controlled with verifications and validation activities which mitigated the risk index to acceptability. The risk analysis and design control activities were summarized below:

# Risk Analysis

The risk analysis was conducted according to ISO 14971:2007 standard. The EasyMax BT SMBG system was modified with adding Bluetooth Dongle and a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was assessed to identify potential hazard and unaccepted risks, like transmission/communication problems, safety issues, and operating BT function. The control measures were to mitigate these risks to acceptable level with the Safety and EMC testing, FCC testing, Software function testing and human factor study. The complete analysis was in EasyMax BT SMBGS risk management report in this submission.

The verification and validate (V&V) activities were conducted based on the impact of the modification and detailed in the EasyMax BT SMBGS risk management report. The similar V&V testing with similar acceptance criteria as the predicate was performed and the design outputs met pre-determined design inputs was confirmed in the software validation report in this submission.

# Conclusion

The modified device, EasyMax BT SMBGS, has the same intended use and fundamental scientific technology as the predicate, EasyMax MU SMBGS which received 510 (k) clearance K121207.

After conducting risk analysis and design control activities, the modified device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
