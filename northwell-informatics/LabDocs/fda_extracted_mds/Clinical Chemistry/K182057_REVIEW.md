# SPECIAL 510(K): DEVICE MODIFICATION OIR DECISION SUMMARY

# 510(k) Number: k182057

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own class II or class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:

1. The name and $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ number of the applicant’s previously cleared device: k121207, EasyMax Mu Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose System (For a preamendments device, a statement to this effect has been provided.)

2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

# This changes were for:

1) The addition of a Bluetooth dongle to be used with the meter.   
2) Change in the system name from EasyMax MU Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose System to Easy Max BT Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose System.

4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and specifications.

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis   
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the applicant’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.

The device is intended for single patient home use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside commercial laboratory testing services demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with $\mathrm { P D I @ }$ Super SANI$\mathrm { C L O T H @ }$ Germicidal disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No: 9480-4). The sponsor also conducted robustness studies and demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device (for single patient use only) after 10,000 cleaning and disinfecting cycles to validate cleaning and disinfecting once per week for single-patient use over 4 years.
