# L. Test Principle:

The Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ High-Sensitivity Troponin I TNIH assay is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI technology. The LOCI reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and two biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody fragments. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a third anticardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibodies to form bead-cardiac troponin Ibiotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form beadpair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the cardiac troponin I concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor provided results from precision studies across multiple reagent lots. Native pooled plasma samples and one quality control sample (QC) were tested on one instrument two times a day, each with two replicates, for 20 days, for a total of 80 measurements per sample. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data following recommendations in EP05-A3. This was repeated for 3 reagent lots using the plasma samples. Results from one representative lot of the three lots tested, are described in the table below. The within-lab precision estimate described in the table is a total of within-run variability, within-day, run-to-run variability, and day-today variability.

The sponsor also evaluated site to site reproducibility following the recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3. Imprecision was evaluated using seven samples spanning the measurement range of the assay and comprising of native pooled lithium heparin patient samples across three sites using one lot of reagents. Testing was performed over five days, with two samples a day and three replicates per sample. The reproducibility estimate is a total of within-run variability, within-day variability, runto-run variability, day-to-day variability, and site to site variability. The sample at the upper end of the assay measuring range was prepared by spiking normal human plasma with human troponin complex to desired test levels, as noted in the table below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated following the recommendations in the CLSI Guideline EP06- A with 16 lithium heparin plasma samples ranging in concentrations from $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ to $> 2 5 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The high samples and the low samples were native and the intermediate samples were prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples. At least five replicates were measured for each sample, and the mean of these replicates was used to calculate the reported results. Deviations from linearity within the claimed range were never observed to be greater than $10 \%$ .

The measuring range is $3 – 2 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ with the upper end of the measuring range being defined by the upper linear range of the assay. See detection limits in M. item d. below for information supporting the lower end of the measuring range.

# Hook Effect

The sponsor demonstrated that there is no hook effect with the assay up to 1,223,723 $\mathrm { { \ p g / m L } }$ .

# Dilution Recovery

The sponsor provided dilution studies which supported the measurement of samples above the measurement range diluted by up to a factor of five.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable. The assay is traceable to a commercially available troponin assay.

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol

The LoB was determined as described in the CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was performed using three lots of reagents, each on one instrument. 60 determinations were obtained by testing five samples with no analyte (the zero level calibrator material) four times a day for three days across three reagent lots. LoB was calculated non-parametrically. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested was $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol

The LoD was determined following the recommendations in the CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. Testing was performed using three reagent lots. For the three lots tested,

seven to ten native low analyte lithium heparin plasma samples were tested every day, respectively, with four replicates for each test, for 3 days.

The nonparametric approach described in EP17-A2 was followed to determine the LoD. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested was $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined as the analyte level with a withinlab CV of less than or equal to $2 0 . 0 \%$ following the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline. Testing was completed two times a day $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 )$ for at least 20 days for a total of 80 replicates with eight to 11 native lithium heparin plasma pools measured on one instrument using three reagent lots. For each reagent lot-instrument combination, the within-laboratory precision for each sample, expressed as $\% \mathrm { C V }$ , was plotted against the mean concentration obtained for each sample. LoQ was determined by this precision profile as the concentration where the $\% C V$ was less than $20 \%$ . The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested was $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

The sponsor claims an LoB of $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , and LoD of $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , and an LoQ of 3.0 $\mathrm { { \ p g / m L } }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous interference studies were performed following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-A2. Two sample pools were tested. One sample pool had $2 0 { \cdot } 6 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ cTnI and the second sample pool had $7 0 0 { - } 2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ cTnI. These sample pools were spiked with potential interferents. Test results from samples spiked with the potential interferent were compared to test results from the control samples lacking the potential interferent. At the tested concentrations, these compounds caused ${ < } 1 0 \%$ interference.

Some studies have shown that serum concentrations of biotin can reach $3 5 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ within the first hour after biotin ingestion for apparently healthy subjects consuming supplements of $2 0 \mathrm { m g }$ biotin per day and plasma concentrations of biotin can reach up to $1 1 6 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for apparently healthy subjects after a single dose of $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ biotin.

The following limitations are included in the labeling:

Testing specimens from renal dysfunction patients taking biotin may lead to false negative results. Therefore, do not use this device in patients with renal impairment $( \mathrm { e G F R } { < } 6 0 )$ , unless it is confirmed that the patient is not taking biotin.

Patients taking more than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d a y }$ of biotin may have falsely negative results, and should not use this test. There have been reports of multiple sclerosis patients taking biotin doses exceeding $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d a y }$ . Therefore, do not use this device in patients with multiple sclerosis, unless it is confirmed that the patient is not taking more than 20 mg/day of biotin.

Protein gamma globulin at $6 \mathrm { g / d L }$ increases the troponin result in plasma samples at approximately $4 0 \mathrm { p g / m L \left[ n g / L \right] }$ and $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L \left[ n g / L \right] }$ of troponin. Protein gamma globulin at $2 . 5 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ demonstrates less than $10 \%$ change in results when testing plasma samples at the concentrations stated above.

Dextran 40 at $6 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ increases the troponin result in plasma at $3 5 . 1 \ \mathrm { p g / m L / n }$ g/L] and $1 3 3 7 . 4 \mathrm { p g / m L \left[ n g / L \right] }$ by $22 \%$ and $4 \%$ respectively. Dextran 40 at $1 5 \mathrm { g / L }$ and $4 5 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ demonstrates less than $10 \%$ change in results when testing plasma samples at the concentrations stated above.

Patient samples may contain cardiac troponin-specific autoantibodies that could react in immunoassays to give depressed results. A test result that is inconsistent with the clinical picture and patient history should be interpreted with caution.

Samples from patients receiving preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for therapy or diagnosis may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such samples may show either falsely elevated or falsely depressed values. This assay has been designed to minimize interference from heterophilic antibodies. Nevertheless, complete elimination of this interference from all patient specimens cannot be guaranteed. A test result that is inconsistent with the clinical picture and patient history should be interpreted with caution.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

A clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical performance of the device at the different clinical cut-offs (see section 5, Expected values/Reference range, below). A multicenter prospective study evaluated 2498 patients from emergency departments presenting with chest pain or equivalent symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an independent panel of expert physicians using criteria consistent with the 2007 Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI). Serial samples were collected from patients presenting to the emergency department. The number of patients adjudicated with an MI was $1 3 \%$ (325/2498). The sample collection times were at $0 - 1 . 5$ hours (from time since presentation) and at the following timepoint relative to the time from presentation: 1.5 to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 3.5 hours, 3.5 to 4.5 hours, 4.5 to 6 hours, 6 to 9 hours, 9 to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department. Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed device’s results. Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results presented below were based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Clinical performance was estimated at overall (male and female combined) and male- and female-specific $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile upper reference limit (URL) cut-offs, calculated as described in Section 5, Expected values/Reference range, below. The results are summarized below.

Using the overall $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile $( 5 8 . 9 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ , the following results were obtained for males and females combined:

The following statements about cut-offs are included in the labeling:

Using the higher male-specific 99th percentile instead of the overall 99th percentile of $5 8 . 9 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { n g / L } )$ may result in a higher proportion of negative test results for males that are MI. For males that are MI, data analyzed using the malespecific cut-off versus the overall cutoff increased the false-negative rate by up to $3 . 8 \%$ .

Using the lower female-specific 99th percentile instead of the overall 99th percentile of $5 8 . 9 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { n g / L } )$ may result in a higher proportion of positive test results for females that are non-MI. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval, in the worst-case scenario (samples drawn at ${ \ge } 4 . 5 \mathrm { - } < 6 $ hours after presentation), up to $6 8 \%$ of positive test results for females may be non-MI.

$b$ . Clinical specificity:

See clinical sensitivity section, M.3.a., above.

4. Clinical cut-off:

The cut-offs for this assay were determined based on the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile upper reference limit in apparently healthy adults. Please see section 5, Expected values/Reference range, below for the determination of the clinical cut-offs.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the 99th percentile in a population of apparently healthy adults.

Lithium-heparin plasma specimens were collected from apparently healthy adults with no known diseases of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or infections from the United States who ranged in age from 22–91 years of age.

Plasma samples from 2021 subjects were tested in singlicate. The 99th percentile value for results in apparently healthy subjects was calculated. The 99th percentile values were determined using the non-parametric empirical univariate distribution function. The results are summarized below:
