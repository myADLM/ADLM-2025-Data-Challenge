4. Panel: Chemistry (75)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Dexcom Pro Q Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom Pro Q System) is a factory calibrated continuous glucose recording device indicated for the retrospective discovery, analysis and interpretation of glycemic variability in persons age 2 and older under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The Dexcom Pro Q System collects and processes data for aiding in the management of a disease or condition related to glycemic control.

Interpretation of the data recorded by the Dexcom Pro Q System results should be made only by a qualified healthcare professional based on glucose trends and several sequential readings over time. The Dexcom Pro Q System aids in detecting glucose excursions facilitating care plan adjustments. The Dexcom Pro Q System is also intended to interface with digitally connected devices.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

This device is for prescription use only. Results should be interpreted only by qualified health care professionals.

The components of the Dexcom Pro Q System (sensor and transmitter) must be removed prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, or high frequency electrical (diathermy) treatment. The Dexcom Pro Q System has not been tested in those situations.

This device is not intended for pregnant women, people on dialysis, or critically ill patients.

Although standard dosing of acetaminophen ( $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per every 6 hours) does not appear to cause significant bias, higher supra-therapeutic levels of acetaminophen have shown significant positive bias.

• Sensor placement is important to ensure system performance. Users should choose a site:

o At least 3 inches from insulin pump infusion set or injection site or previous CGM insertion site. o Away from irritated skin, tattoos, near waistband, bones, or scarring. $\bigcirc$ Unlikely to be bumped, pushed or laid on while sleeping.

• Store sensors only between $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ . Do not store sensors in the freezer.

4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable.

# I. Device Description:

The Dexcom Pro Q Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System is a glucose recording device that measures and logs glucose readings at five-minute intervals for up to ten days. The Pro Q System consists of a sensor and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter. The sensor is a small, flexible wire inserted into the subcutaneous tissue where it converts glucose into electrical current. The transmitter, which is connected to the sensor and worn on the body, samples the electrical current produced by the senor and converts these measurements into glucose readings using an onboard algorithm. The system does not have a way to display glucose values in real-time and cannot be authorized to do so. A user must use an authorized extraction device after the sensor session has ended to extract and view data collected by the Pro Q Transmitter.

# Pro Q CGM SENSOR

The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator, plastic base (“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable unit that contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the needle and inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and can be worn for up to 10 days.

The sensor may be worn in the abdomen for adults, and both the abdomen and buttock for children ages 2-17 years old. The sensor is identical to the predicate G6 sensor.

# Pro Q CGM TRANSMITTER

The Pro Q CGM Transmitter is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data processing functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver to enable transmittance of stored data once the sensor session has ended. The transmitter attaches to the sensor and is not reusable. The transmitter hardware is unchanged from the predicate G6 transmitter, with the exception of a firmware (see above). An authorized extraction device must be used to extract and view data collected by the Pro Q Transmitter.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): DEN170088

3. Comparison with predicate:

The Dexcom Pro Q System is largely identical to the predicate device with the exception of aspects related to data storage and display; the device stores glucose data for the entire sensor wear period and data are intended for retrospective analysis by a healthcare provider using an authorized extraction device; by contrast, the predicate device includes a display that provides users with glucose information in real-time. The Dexcom Pro Q System includes only a sensor and transmitter, and patients must see their healthcare provider for insertion and removal of the sensor.

# L. Test Principle:

The Dexcom Pro Q System detects glucose levels from the fluid just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using an algorithm to a glucose value read in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which is recorded and stored on the transmitter until the data is extracted by a qualified healthcare professional for interpretation and use.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The Pro Q CGM uses the same sensor, transmitter, and algorithm as the predicate device, the Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System. Therefore, performance was evaluated under DEN170088. Please see the decision summary for the Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (DEN170088)

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The reportable range for the Pro Q CGM is 40 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Data supporting this claimed measurement range was reviewed under DEN170088. Please see the decision summary for DEN170088.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Pro Q CGM sensor has a storage shelf-life of 12 months and testing is on-going.   
Shelf life was evaluated at $3 2 ^ { 0 } – 8 6 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity.

The Pro Q Transmitter has sufficient battery life to function for 3 months as intended following its maximum storage time of 8 months. Shelf life was evaluated at $3 2 ^ { 0 }$ - $1 1 3 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 { - } 9 5 \%$ relative humidity.

d. Detection limit:

If a glucose measurement is less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is displayed by the system as ‘Lo’. If a glucose measurement exceeds $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , result is displayed as ‘Hi’. Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section L(3) below. Data supporting this was reviewed under DEN170088.
