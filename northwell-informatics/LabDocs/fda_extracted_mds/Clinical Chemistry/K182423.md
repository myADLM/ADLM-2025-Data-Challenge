10. Test Principle

The FT4 assay is a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay using FDA previously cleared MAGLUMI 2000 instrument (k162698).

The sample (or calibrator/control, if applicable), ABEI-labeled anti-T4 monoclonal antibody, buffer and T4 antigen-coated magnetic microbeads are mixed thoroughly and incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Free T4 present in the sample (or calibrator/control, if applicable) competes with T4 antigen immobilized on the magnetic microbeads for a limited number of binding sites on the ABEI-labeled anti-T4 monoclonal antibody, forming immuno-complexes. After precipitation in a magnetic field, decant the supernatant, and then perform a wash cycle. Subsequently, the Starter $1 + 2$ are added to initiate a chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier within 3 seconds as relative light units (RLUs), which is inversely proportional to the concentration of free T4 present in the sample (or calibrator/control, if applicable).

11. Performance Characteristics

b. Linearity

The linearity of the MAGLUMI FT4 method was determined following the CLSI EP6- A procedure. Samples were prepared by spiking T4 USP Standard into T4-free human serum samples to create 11 levels with FT4 concentrations from 0.19 to $1 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . Each sample was measured in quadruple on 3 lots of reagent. Linearity was evaluated using regression analysis based on CLSI EP6-A.

The assays are linear between 0.19 and $1 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ with the following relationship:

Observed $= 0 . 9 8 9 8$ (Expected) + 0.01364, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 1$

c. Stability

Accelerated stability study at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ showed that all controls are stable for 12 months at 2- $8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Accelerated stability study at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ showed all that calibrators are stable for 12 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Accelerated stability study at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ showed that the reagent is stable for 12 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The real time stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going.

d. Detection Limit

Detection limit studies were performed following CLSI EP17-A guidelines.

The limit of blank (LOB) is the 95th percentile value from 80 measurements of T4 free human serum samples using 3 different lots of FT4 reagents over 5 days. The LOB corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free samples are found with a probability of $9 5 \%$ and was determined to be $0 . 0 8 7 { \mathrm { n g / d L } }$ (highest of the 3 lots).

The limit of detection (LOD) is determined based on the LOB and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The LOD corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be detected. Four level of low samples were measured in 80 replicates over 5 days per sample using 3 lots of reagents. LOD was determined to be $0 . 1 4 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ (highest of the 3 lots).

The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was determined by measuring six low serum samples, in six replicates per run, one run per day, over 5 days, using 3 lots of reagents. LOQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that can be reproducibly measured with an intermediate precision CV of $\leq 2 0 \%$ and was determined to be $0 . 1 9 0 \mathrm { n g / d L }$ (highest of the 3 lots).

e. Interference

Clinical serum samples may contain substances that could potentially interfere with the test. The cross-reactivity is defined as the ratio of the amount of T4 required to displace $50 \%$ of the maximally bound labeled T4 from the anti-T4 antibody, and the amount of the cross-reactant to give the same $50 \%$ displacement. Solutions of FT4 and potential cross reactants were prepared by spiking corresponding compounds in

various concentrations. Concentrations of the $50 \%$ displacement were measured for these solutions using 3 lots of reagents. The following table shows cross reactivity of potential cross reactant.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cross Reactant</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%Cross-reactivity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Monoiodotyrosine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;0.02%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L-Triiodothyronine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;0.02%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Diiodotyrosine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;0.02%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3,5-Diiodo-L-thyronine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;0.02%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reverse Triiodothyronine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;0.02%</td></tr></table>

The effect of common drugs and interference substances were evaluated using human serum pools. For each substance, three serum samples containing a low, medium and high concentration of FT4 were analyzed. For all substances tested, no significant interference was defined as recovery $\pm 1 0 \%$ of initial value. The substances and the highest concentration tested which did not cause significant interference are listed below.

The effect of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and human serum total protein was evaluated using human serum samples. Each potential interferent was added to FT4 human serum samples and tested triplicate using 3 lots of reagents. For all substances tested, no significant interference was defined as recovery $\pm 1 0 \%$ of initial value. The potential interferents and the highest concentration tested which did not cause significant interference are listed below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interferent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HAMA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>800 ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>RF</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1240 IU/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total protein</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.5 g/dL</td></tr></table>

2. Comparison Studies

A method comparison study was performed with 224 human serum samples with concentrations ranging from 0.19 to $1 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ . The comparison of the MAGLUMI FT4 assay (y) with the predicate device, ADVIA CENTAUR FT4 assay $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { x } )$ , produced the following linear regression equation:

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 4 5 1 \mathrm { X } - 0 . 0 5 3 7 5 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 1 9
$$

3. Expected values/Reference range:

A total of 157 serum samples from normal, apparently healthy adult (22 years and older) individuals were tested according to the procedure in CLSI C28-A3. The expected normal range is $0 . 8 2 - 1 . 7 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ based on the central $9 5 \%$ of the frequency distribution.

12. Conclusion

Based on the test principle and acceptable performance characteristics including precision, interference, specificity and method comparison of the device, it is concluded that the MAGLUMI $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { F T } 4$ is substantially equivalent to the predicate.
