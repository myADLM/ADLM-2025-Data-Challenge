# L. Test Principle:

The test principle of KET-1 Blood Ketone Monitoring System is based on the amperometry detection of beta-hydroxybutyrate in whole blood. $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate is converted by the enzyme $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to acetoacetate. The magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of $\beta \cdot$ - hydroxybutyrate present in the sample. The result is displayed on the meter in $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Repeatability

Repeatability was assessed using two ketone concentration ranges $( 1 . 2 - 0 . 6 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and $1 . 4 - 2 . 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ and five lithium heparinized whole blood samples and five lithium heparinized whole blood samples spiked with $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate to create concentrations of (0.55, 2.17, 3.76, 6.26, and $7 . 5 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ and tested on ten KET-1 meters. Ten replicates were tested per meter per concentration with each of the three lots of the test strips. The results are summarized below:

# d. Detection limit:

Please refer to Linearity study above, Section M.1.b.

# e. Analytical specificity:

To evaluate interference of exogenous and endogenous interfering substances, three lithium heparinized whole blood samples with ketone concentrations of $0 . 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , $3 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and $5 . 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were divided into two aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test (with assessed interferent). Each sample was tested using 10 KET-1 meters and the difference between meter results obtained with the test sample compared to the control samples calculated. The sponsor defined no significant interference as bias within $0 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ for $\beta$ -ketone $< 1 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and $\leq 2 0 \%$ for $\beta$ -ketone $\geq 1 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study:

The effects of varying hematocrit levels on the measurement of $\beta$ -ketone concentration was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels at $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ and $60 \%$ . Four different with $\beta$ -ketone concentrations of 0.4-0.6 mmol/L, $1 . 5 { - } 2 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , $3 . 5 { - } 5 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , and $5 . 0 { - } 6 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were prepared at each of the four levels with seven hematocrit levels. The $\beta$ -ketone concentration was measured using ten KET-1 meters and three test strips. The $\%$ bias at each hematocrit level relative to the result obtained STANBIO $\beta$ -Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor Test Kit was calculated. The result support the claimed acceptance hematocrit range of $20 \%$ .

# 2. Altitude Study:

An altitude/oxygen dependability study was performed to assess the effect of low oxygen levels when the system is used at elevations above sea level. For testing two levels sea level (0 and 10, 335 feet). Venous whole blood samples at five levels approximately 0.5, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and $7 . 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and two levels of KET-1 control solution were tested at sea level and 10, 335 feet elevation. Twenty ketone readings per ketone level were taken at each of the two elevations. The results demonstrated acceptable bias to support the claim that altitude up to 10, 335 feet have no significance effect on $\beta$ -Ketone measurement when measured with KET-1 monitoring system.

# 3. Operating Conditions Study:

The sponsor performed testing in operating condition studies to evaluate the operating temperature and relative humidity (RH) ranges. Venous whole blood samples with $\beta$ - Ketone concentrations ranges of $0 . 4 7 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , 2.21 mmol/L, 3.76 mmol/L 6.15 mmol/L were tested. Each sample was tested at the combined temperature and humidity conditions shown below using 10 KET-1 meters, and 3 lots of KET-1 test strip. The results obtained on the KET-1 Blood Ketone meter were compared to results obtained using the STANBIO $\beta$ -Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor Test Kit.
