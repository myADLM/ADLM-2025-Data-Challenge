# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP06- A guideline. Linearity testing for serum was conducted using eight dilutions of pooled high serum sample with saline to generate a CK activity range from 0 - 1650 U/L. Linearity testing for plasma was conducted using ten dilutions and admixtures of pooled plasma to generate a CK activity range from $3 - 2 7 0 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ . Testing of all samples was conducted in quadruplicate using two lots of SEKURE CK reagent on one SK500 analyzer. Deviation of the mean observed value from the calculated theoretical value was determined for each sample in the series. The maximum deviation from linearity observed was ${ < } 1 1 \%$ . The linearity study data supports the claimed measuring range for the SEKURE CK Assay of 11 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ for serum and plasma.

# Dilution Recovery Studies:

The sponsor provided data supporting their claim that creatine kinase sample values above the assay measuring range can be accurately determined by diluting $\left( 3 \mathbf { x } \right)$ in saline and assaying with the SEKURE Creatine Kinase-SL Assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The SEKURE Creatine Kinase Assay is traceable to an IFCC reference method.

d. Detection limit:

Limits of detection studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample detected with a $9 5 \%$ probability. Testing was conducted by analyzing low level samples (saline blanks and dilutions of pooled serum or plasma in saline) in quadruplicate for three days (12 replicates per sample) producing 60 measurements total. All samples were assayed on two lots of SEKURE CK reagents and one SK500 analyzer. The LoB and LoD were determined individually for each reagent lot, dilution level, and matrix type.

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) testing was conducted using eight linear serum samples and eight linear plasma samples, ranging from normal $( { \sim } 1 0 0 \mathrm { U / L } )$ to zero on two SEKURE CK reagent lots. Each sample was assayed in quadruplicate on five runs over three days to give 40 replicates per sample. The LoQ was determined as the lowest CK activity value at which the $\% C V$ was $\leq 2 0 \%$ .

The results of the evaluation of the detection limits and final claim are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CK (U/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11</td></tr></table>

# e. Analytical specificity:

An interference study was performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline to assess common or known substances that could interfere with the CK Assay. Interference testing was conducted using two lots of SEKURE CK reagent on one SK500 analyzer. All interferents were evaluated at CK concentrations of 180 and $4 1 5 \mathrm { U / L }$ using serum samples. A minimum of seven concentrations of interferent were assessed. Each sample was tested in replicates of five on each reagent lot and compared to a control sample. Significant interference was defined by the sponsor as a percent difference greater than $10 \%$ from control.

Results are summarized in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 114 serum specimens were tested in duplicate over eight operating days on the candidate and predicate device. Two samples were excluded from the data analysis as they exceeded the reportable range of the assay. The remaining 112 serum specimens had a CK range of 28 to $1 4 0 9 \mathrm { U / L }$ . Five of the samples included in the data analysis were spiked to evaluate the high end of the assay measuring interval. First replicate data collected on the candidate method and mean sample data collected on the predicate method were evaluated using Deming regression analysis and gave the following equation:

$$
y = 0 . 9 6 4 x + 2 . 4 \mathrm { U / L } , \mathrm { ~ \Delta r = 0 . 9 9 9 8 ~ }
$$

b. Matrix comparison:

Matrix comparison testing was conducted to evaluate the suitability of lithium heparin plasma with the SEKURE CK Assay on the SK500 analyzer. A set of 75 matched serum and lithium heparin plasma specimens were assayed in duplicate using two lots of CK reagents on one SK500 analyzer. Thirteen of these samples were contrived samples. The CK activity ranged from 38 to $1 4 8 7 \mathrm { U / L }$ . Deming regression analysis was generated using first replicate data from plasma and mean sample values from serum and gave the following equation:

$$
y = 1 . 0 1 5 x - 3 . 4 \mathrm { U / L } , \mathrm { r = 0 . 9 9 9 1 }
$$
