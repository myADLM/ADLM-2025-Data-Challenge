# E. Device Description

The Pregnancy One Step Rapid Test is a qualitative, solid phase, two-site sandwich immunoassay for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in the early detection of pregnancy. The membrane is pre-coated with anti-hCG antibodies on the test band region and anti-mouse antibodies on the control band region. During testing, the urine sample reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti-hCG antibody-colloidal gold conjugate) which has been pre-coated on the test strip. The mixture then migrates upward on the membrane chromatographically by capillary action to react with anti-hCG antibodies on the membrane and generate a red band. Presence of the red band indicates a positive result, while its absence indicates a negative result. Regardless of the presence of hCG, as the mixture continues to migrate across the membrane to the immobilized goat anti-mouse region, a red band at the control band region will always appear. The presence of this red band serves as verification for sufficient sample volume and proper flow and as a control for the reagents.

There are no differences identified between new device and the predicate device for intended use, clinical cut-off, read time, test principle, test format, etc. The only difference identified is that the assay of the new device is traceable to the WHO $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard reference material, while the assay of the predicate device is traceable to the WHO $3 ^ { \mathsf { r d } }$ International Standard reference material. However, this difference does not have any significant impact on the safety or performance of the device. The Kangzhou One Step hCG Test Strip/cassette/midstream, and the predicate device, Co-Innovation One Step hCG Test Strip/cassette/midstream (K132085) use the same chemistry with essentially the same test design, thus they are substantial equivalent.

# G. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable)

Guidance for Over-the Counter (OTC) Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) 510(k)s

# H. Test Principle

The assay of each device uses a double antibody sandwich method. Each test device contains mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta$ -hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate pre-dried on a pad. Mouse

Add：Room401, Building B, Innovation Entrepreneurship Base, High District, Weihai City,

Shandong, People’s Republic of China

monoclonal anti- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ -hCG antibody (on the Test Line) and goat anti mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (on the Control Line) are coated and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. During the test procedures, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti- $\cdot \beta$ -hCG antibody-colloidal gold conjugate specific to the beta subunit of hCG) and forms a complex. Because of capillary and chromatographic effects of the nitrocellulose membrane, the complex migrates along the membrane to the $\mathfrak { a }$ -hCG antibody line (T), and remains captured in the T line. As a result a red colored band develops in the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine, there is no red band in the test zone, indicating a negative result. The Control line should develop in the control zone regardless of the test result.

# J. Components and Function of Internal Control

The membrane is pre-coated with anti-mouse antibodies on the control band region. During the testing, the mixture continues to migrate across the membrane to the immobilized goat anti-mouse region, a red band at the control band region will always appear. The presence of this red band serves as verification for sufficient sample volume and proper flow and as a control for the reagents. The Control line should develop in the control zone regardless of the test result. A red line appearing in the control region （C）is considered an internal positive procedural control. A clear background in the results window in considered an internal negative procedural control. If the Control (C) line does not give the expected reaction on any sample, the test is invalid, and must be repeated.

# K. Performance characteristic

1. Analytical performance a. Precision/Reproducibility:

30 clinical samples were took from normal, nonpregnant females spiked with the HCG (traceable to WHO $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ IS）at different concentration $0 \mathsf { m l u } / \mathsf { m l }$ , 12.5mIU/ml, 18.75mIU/ml, 25mIU/ml, 50mIU/ml, $1 0 0 m | \mathrm { U } / \mathsf { m } |$ （all the concentration was determined by immunoassay of ELISA). The controls were build coded. Separate sets of the blind coded were assigned. Samples were also randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted 3 runs / day and lasted 10 days and was conducted by 3 hospital laboratories. There are 3 batches Kangzhou One Step HCG Test of three formats and each laboratory should conduct one batch separately. The midstream format were performed with both of these midstream test sample application methods (simulated midstream and dip). the result was recorded as the following:

and spiked with HCG at 25mIU/ml and 0mIU/ml and 3 batches of Kangzhou One Step HCG Test were tested repeatedly. The result demonstrates that varying ranged of PH do not interfere with the performance of the test.

# e.5) Specific gravity

Purified water and specimen with HCG 25mIU/ml were formulated into the solution with specific gravity at 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 1.04 separately. Three lots of Kangzhou One Step HCG Test were tested. The data show that there’s no interference in the test result when the specific gravity is between 1.01-1.04.

# e.6) HOOK effect study

The test was evaluated for high dose hook effect. HCG free specimens spiked with the HCG at different concentration containing 62500mIU/ml, 125000mIU/ml, 250000mIU/ml, 500000mIU/ml, 1000000mIU/ml. Three lot of tests were tested. The result show that Kangzhou One Step HCG Test can get the positive result when the HCG concentration is range from 62,500 to 1,000,000mIU/ml, while the T line get to light as the concentration above 125,000mIU/ml.

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Professional method comparison

Urine samples were collected from 360 women at hospital laboratory to test for pregnancy. Patients included women who suspected pregnancy, and who had late periods, as well as those later in pregnancy. Samples were randomly collected at various times throughout the day. Ages were from 18 to 45 years. Each specimen was blind coded. Separate sets of the blind coded were assigned. Samples were also randomized prior to testing. The tests performed by laboratory professionals were conducted at two laboratories (namely professional A and professional B). Each person tested the candidate device and the predicate device at the same time, but not sequentially. The data show that the agreement of Kangzhou One Step HCG Test with the predicate device was $100 \%$ .

# b. The lay user method comparison:

Urine samples were collected from 360 women at hospital laboratory to test for pregnancy. Ages were from 18 to 45 years. The 360 lay users test their own urine using the English package insert as guide to perform the test. This included 90 lay users using test strip, 90 using test cassette, 180 using actual midstream method and the dip method respectively for test midstream. They were asked to fill out and English questionnaire after finishing the test and collected samples for tests by laboratory professionals using the candidate devices. Each specimen was blind coded. Separate sets of the blind coded were assigned. Samples were also randomized prior to testing. The tests performed by laboratory professionals were conducted at a laboratory.

# c. The performance tested by OTC user:

To evaluate its suitability to be used by the home use consumers (lay persons), spiked urine samples were tested by the lay persons and the results were compared with professional laboratory results. The study was performed at 3 different point-of-care sites in Shanghai, Qingdao and Beijing. HCG free specimens spiked with the HCG (material traceable to WHO $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ IS) at $1 8 . 7 5 \mathrm { m } | \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m } |$ and $3 1 . 2 5 \mathsf { m l U } / \mathsf { m l }$ . Both the concentration was determined by immunoassay of ELISA. Each concentration urine specimens were divided into 120 individual containers for a total of 240 aliquot. All aliquot were blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Samples were also randomized prior to testing. 240 female subjected with various education backgrounds and the ages from 18 to 45 participated in the lay user study. All of the subjects had no the experience of using the test before and were the untrained operators. Each subject conducted 1 test on one test format or one sample application method for the “midstream” using the English package insert as guide. Masked spiked urine were tested by professional laboratory personnel at the manufacturer site. The results show that Kangzhou One Step HCG Test can be used by the untrained operator and get the correct results.
