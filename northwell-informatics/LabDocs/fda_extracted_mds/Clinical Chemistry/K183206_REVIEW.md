# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATIONDECISION SUMMARYINSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE

A. 510(k) Number: k183206   
B. Purpose for Submission: Modification to the CGM Transmitter of the predicate device   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Dexcom, Inc., Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose readings which are updated every 5 minutes providing glucose levels, trends, and alerts. The System consists of three main components: a sensor, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter and a BLE enabled display device (receiver and/or mobile application). The user can view glucose data on the receiver or on the G6 CGM App (i.e., a mobile medical application) running on a compatible mobile device, or on both simultaneously.

The system provides alerts and alarms which warn the user of low or impending low and high or impending high glucose levels. The user may determine their treatment based on the glucose values provided by the system.

# G6 CGM SENSOR

The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator, plastic base (“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable unit that contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the needle and inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and can be worn for up to 10 days.

The sensor may be worn in the abdomen for adults, and both the abdomen and buttock for children ages 2-17 years old. The sensor comes with a calibration code that the user enters into the system upon initializing a new sensor. Once the code is applied, the user does not need to calibrate the system throughout the entirety of the sensor lifetime, which is 10 days. However, the user has the option to manually calibrate the system using selfmeasurements from a blood glucose meter in addition to entering the calibration code. Alternatively, if the user chooses not to enter the calibration code, he or she must manually calibrate the sensor by entering two fingerstick blood glucose values during start up and every 24 hours thereafter.

# G6 CGM TRANSMITTER

The G6 CGM Transmitter is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data processing functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver for communication with a compatible display device (i.e., receiver and/or smart device). The transmitter attaches to the sensor and can be re-used for multiple sensing sessions up to three months.

# G6 CGM RECEIVER

The G6 CGM Receiver is small hand-held device that wirelessly receives glucose information from the transmitter every five minutes and includes a touchscreen display. The 5 receiver displays the current glucose reading and glucose trends to the user. It alerts the user when glucose levels are outside of a target zone and when other important system conditions occur.

# DEXCOM G6 System MOBILE APP

The G6 CGM App for iOS and G6 CGM App for Android provides an alternative display device to the receiver for users with a compatible, BLE-enabled smart device and behaves similarly to the receiver. The G6 CGM App is compatible with certain iOS, Android and Smart Device watches. A link to a list of compatible devices is included in the instructions for use.

The Dexcom G6 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic interfaces; including compatible AID systems. The G6 CGM system is designed to communicate with interoperable devices in several ways, such as described below:

· Wireless communication from the transmitter directly to an interoperable device communicating through the same protocol. · The app communicates to another app on a single mobile platform. − The app communicates through the cloud to another software device.

2. Principles of Operation:

The Dexcom G6 System detects glucose levels from the fluid just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using an algorithm to a glucose value read in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which is then transmitted to the receiver for the user to see and use accordingly.

3. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ___X___ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes ___X____ or No

4. Specimen Identification: Not applicable.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Not applicable.

6. Calibration:

Though the Dexcom G6 System does not require user calibration, users of the Dexcom G6 System have the option to calibrate the device manually (e.g., in situations where users do not have to use the calibration code). An evaluation of calibration stability in DEN170088 demonstrated that the system could be calibrated manually without impacting system performance.

7. Quality Control: Not applicable.

8. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes for

this line of product types: Yes___X____ or No_

# F. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section:   
21 CFR 862.1355

2. Classification: Class II

3 Product code: QBJ

4. Panel: Chemistry (75)

# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

The Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom G6 System) is a real time, continuous glucose monitoring device indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 2 years and older.

The Dexcom G6 System is intended to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions. Interpretation of the Dexcom G6 System results should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time. The Dexcom G6 System also aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments.

The Dexcom G6 System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices, including automated insulin dosing (AID) systems. The Dexcom G6 System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected medical devices for the purpose of managing diabetes.

# 2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

This device is for prescription use only. Remove the Dexcom G6 sensor, transmitter, and receiver before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The magnetic fields and heat could damage the components of the Dexcom G6 System, which may cause it to display inaccurate blood glucose

readings or may prevent alerts.   
• This device is not intended for pregnant women, people on dialysis, or critically ill patients. Although standard dosing of acetaminophen ( $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per every 6 hours) does not appear to cause significant bias, higher supra-therapeutic levels of acetaminophen have shown significant positive bias. Users should adhere to the instructions for sensor insertion site; Adult users should only use the abdomen and pediatric users should only use the buttock or abdomen. Sensor performance has not been evaluated in other insertion sites and may differ from expected iCGM performance.   
• Change your insertion site so it is at least 3 inches from the previous insertion site. Using the same site too often may cause irritation or scarring. Do not insert your sensor over irritated skin, tattoos, near waistband, bones, or scarring and near places that are easily bumped, pushed or laid on while sleeping. Store your sensors only between $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ . Do not store sensors in the freeze
