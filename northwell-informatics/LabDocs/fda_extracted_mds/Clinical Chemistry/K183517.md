Dear Noel Mencias:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Ammonia II (NH3L2) assay is an enzymatic in vitro test for the quantitative determination of ammonia in human plasma on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems. The Ammonia II assay is an enzymatic method, with glutamate dehydrogenase.

# 2. INDICATIONS FOR USE

The Ammonia II assay is an enzymatic in vitro test for the quantitative determination of ammonia in human plasma on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems.

Ammonia measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of severe liver disorders, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and Reye's syndrome.

# 3. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The Ammonia II assay is an enzymatic method, with glutamate dehydrogenase. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) catalyzes the reductive amination of 2‑oxoglutarate with $\mathrm { N H 4 + }$ and NADPH to form glutamate and NADP $^ +$ . The concentration of the ${ \mathrm { N A D P + } }$ formed is directly proportional to the ammonia concentration. It is determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance.

Precision experiments were performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP5-A3. Two aliquots per run, two runs per day for $\geq 2 1$ days were performed on the same analyzer using 3 lots of reagent. Repeatability (within run precision) and intermediate precision (within lab precision) were calculated. The samples were randomized in each run separately. For each sample, the following were calculated: Mean, Repeatability and intermediate precision as CV and SD values, and the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for SD and CV values.

# 4.2. Analytical Sensitivity

LoB, LoD, and LoQ were determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.

# 4.2.1. Limit of Blank (LoB)

Limit of Blank determines the highest observed measurement values for samples free of analyte.

For determination of LoB one analyte free sample was measured with three lots in 10-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. In total, 60 measurements were obtained per lot. Data analysis is based on determination of the 95th percentile of the 60 measured values

# 4.2.2. Limit of Detection (LoD)

The LoD determines the lower limit for samples with analyte. The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with a $9 5 \%$ probability.

For determination of LoD five samples with low-analyte concentration (approximately up to 4 times the LoB) were measured with three lots in two-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, on one cobas c 501 analyzer. In total 60 measurements were obtained per lot.

# 4.2.3. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The limit of quantitation (LoQ), according to EP17-A2 is the lowest analyte concentration that can be quantitatively determined with a stated acceptable precision and trueness under stated experimental conditions.

A low level sample Set was prepared by diluting 7 human plasma samples with water. The low level sample set was tested in 5 replicates per sample on 5 days, one run per day on one cobas c 501 analyzer.

# 4.3. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range

# 4.3.1. Regression Analysis

The linearity study was conducted to demonstrate that measurements across the claimed measuring range for each parameter are linear. The study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP06-A.

A linearity check was performed with first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic).

# 4.4. Endogenous Interferences

# 4.4.1. Hemolysis/Bilirubin/Lipemia/Albumin/IgG

The effects of interference by hemoglobin, lipemia (Intralipid), Albumin, Immunoglobulin (IgG) and Bilirubin on the NH3L2 test system were determined on the cobas c 501 analyzer using pooled human plasma samples spiked with varying levels of interferent. The resulting sample series (10 dilution steps per sample) were tested in triplicate and the median values used to calculate $\%$ recovery, by comparing the measured concentration to the expected concentration (which is the NH3L2 concentration when no interferent was added).

# 4.5. Exogenous Interferences – Drugs

The purpose of this study was to evaluate drugs for potential interference with NH3L2 assay measured on the cobas c 501 analyzer. Two sample pools, containing a low and high concentration of NH3L2 were used. These sample pools were divided into an appropriate number of aliquots. One aliquot was not spiked with the drugs and it was used as the reference sample for NH3L2 concentration. The NH3L2 concentration in the sample was determined with ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 3$ measurements on a cobas c 501 analyzer.

The other sample aliquots, with either the high or low NH3L2 concentrations, are spiked with the respective amount of drug. The NH3L2 concentration of the spiked aliquots are determined in triplicate and the mean of the triplicate determinations is compared to the NH3L2 concentration determined for the reference aliquot (mean of $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ ).

No interference was found at therapeutic concentrations using common drug panels with the exceptions of Cefoxitin, Sulfasalazin, and Temozolomid which were found to interfere.

# 4.6. Sample Matrix Comparison

The effect of the presence of anticoagulants on analyte recovery was determined by method comparison, obtained from samples drawn into different types of plasma collection tubes (K2 EDTA and K3 EDTA). For K2 EDTA and K3 EDTA 52 tubes for Lot 1 and 53 tubes for Lot 2 and 53 tubes for Lot 3 were collected and filled completely.

Method comparison K2 EDTA versus K3 EDTA were calculated. Slope, Intercept and Correlation were calculated.
