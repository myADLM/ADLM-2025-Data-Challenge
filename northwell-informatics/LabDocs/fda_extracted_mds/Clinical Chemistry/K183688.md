# 4. Device Description

The i-STAT CHEM8+ test cartridge contains test reagents to analyze whole blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory for sodium, potassium, chloride and blood urea nitrogen. The test is contained in a single-use, disposable cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which are typically applied to the cartridge using a transfer device.

The i-STAT 1 Analyzer is a handheld, in vitro diagnostic analytical device designed to run only i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts with the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result (within approximately 2 minutes).

The i-STAT 1 System is comprised of the i-STAT 1 analyzer, the i-STAT test cartridges and accessories (i-STAT 1 Downloader/Recharger, electronic simulator and portable printer). The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.

# 5. Intended Use Statement

Precision 20 days (Aqueous Materials)

The precision of the i-STAT Potassium, Chloride, and BUN Tests on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer were evaluated using 5 levels of aqueous materials. This 20-day multi-day precision testing was based on CLSI document EP05-A3: Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline-Third Edition. The study was conducted using multiple instruments and one test cartridge lot over 20 days at one site. Total precision (‘within-laboratory’, ST), within-run, $( \mathsf { S } _ { \mathrm { r } } )$ , between-run, $( \mathrm { S } _ { \mathrm { r r } } )$ and between-day, $( \mathrm { S d d } )$ were estimated for each level.

# Precision (Whole Blood)

The whole blood precision of the i-STAT Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, and BUN Tests on i-STAT 1 Analyzer were evaluated using venous whole blood (native or altered) samples targeted to three levels within the test reportable range.

One test cartridge lot was used across 3 point of care sites. At each site, each sample was tested 3 times on each of 7 i-STAT 1 Analyzers (total of 21 test results per sample per instrument). The results of the whole blood precision using the i-STAT 1 Analyzer are shown in Table 2.

# b. Linearity

The study was designed based on CLSI EP06-A: Evaluation of the linearity of quantitative measurement procedures.

The linearity of the i-STAT Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, and BUN tests on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer was evaluated by preparing whole blood samples of varying analyte levels that spanned the reportable range of the tests. The i-STAT Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, and BUN tests demonstrated linearity over the reportable range as shown in Table 3. Regression summary of the Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, and BUN response versus the concentration of the whole blood samples of varying analyte levels is also provided in Table 3.

# c. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The study was based on the CLSI EP17-A2: Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline–Second Edition.

The LoQs of the i-STAT Sodium, Potassium and BUN tests were evaluated on the iSTAT 1 Analyzer using whole blood that was altered to low sodium $( { < } 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , potassium $( < 2 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , or BUN $( < 3 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ concentrations and two test cartridge lots. For Chloride, plasma samples that were altered to ${ < } 6 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ were evaluated as whole blood samples altered to achieve a chloride concentration ${ < } 6 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ have been found to hemolyze. The LoQs for the i-STAT Sodium Potassium, Chloride, and BUN tests on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer were determined to be 91 mmol/L, 1.5 mmol/L, 56 $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , and $1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , respectively.

# d. Interference

The interference performance of the i-STAT Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, and BUN tests on the i-STAT 1 System was evaluated using whole blood samples based on CLSI EP07 ED3: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Third Edition. The effect of each substance was evaluated by comparing the performance of a control sample, spiked with blank solvent solution, with the test results from a sample spiked with the potentially interfering substance at the toxic/pathological concentration based on CLSI EP37 ED1: Supplemental Tables for Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, First Edition, as applicable. A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference between the control and test samples was outside of the allowed error (Ea) for the i-STAT test.

# Comparison Study

# e. Method Comparison with Predicate Device

Method comparison was demonstrated in a study comparing the i-STAT Sodium Potassium, Chloride, and BUN tests performance on the i-STAT 1 System to the Beckman DxC. The study was based on CLSI guideline EP09c-ED3. Venous and arterial blood specimens were evaluated and analyzed on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer against plasma specimens on the Beckman DxC. A Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis was performed using the first replicate result from the i-STAT 1 Analyzer versus the singlicate result of the comparative method.
