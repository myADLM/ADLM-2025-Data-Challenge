Dear Mick Henderson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97).

# Device Name

Proprietary name: IDS SHBG

Common name: As above   
Classification: 21CFR862.1680 Testosterone test system   
Product Code: CDZ

# Predicate Device

The IDS SHBG is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar uses. We claim equivalency to the currently marketed Siemens ADVIA Centaur SHBG (k151986).

# Device Description

# Description for IDS-iSYS SHBG assay

The IDS SHBG assay is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the quantitative determination of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in human serum and plasma on the IDS-iSYS MultiDiscipline Automated System. Results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory data to assist the clinician in the diagnosis of androgen disorders.

The assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. $5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of patient sample or calibrators are incubated with biotinylated monoclonal anti-SHBG antibody, an acridinium labelled monoclonal anti-SHBG conjugate and streptavidin labelled magnetic particles. The magnetic particles are captured using a magnet and a wash step performed to remove any unbound analyte. Trigger reagents are added; the resulting light emitted by the acridinium label is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the original sample.

The IDS SHBG assay is an in vitro diagnostic device consisting of ready to use reagents provided in individual compartments within the reagent cartridge.

The reagent cartridge contains:

Magnetic particles – magnetic particles coated with streptavidin in a phosphate buffer containing preservatives   
Biotin antibody – monoclonal anti-SHBG labelled with biotin in a buffer containing proteins and preservatives   
Conjugate – monoclonal anti-SHBG labelled with an acridinium ester derivative in a buffer containing proteins and preservatives The calibrators consist of:   
Calibrators A and B are included in the assay kit. The calibrators consist of a human serum matrix with defined concentrations of SHBG and preservatives. Together with a lot specific master

calibration curve, the calibrators will be used to perform the adjustment of the master calibration curve.

# Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was determined in accordance with CLSI EP5-A3, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”. Assessment was made for the following variables: within run precision, total precision.

Fourteen serum-based samples were used, at different SHBG concentration levels ranging from $1 . 6 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ to approximately $1 8 0 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ . This was to ensure that the assay measuring range of the IDS SHBG was covered.

Final claims data reported is representative of one kit lot (MB2) where 21 days were available for analysis.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

For the measuring range, a linearity study was conducted based on guidance from the CLSI EP6-A. A high human serum sample and a low human serum sample (low serum sample diluted in zero matrix) were analysed in addition to 14 evenly spaced dilutions which were created by mixing the high and low sample as indicated below:

The measuring range is defined as the range of values the instrument can report directly without sample dilution. The reportable range is the range of values the instrument can report as a quantitative result with sample dilution.

The IDS SHBG assay is linear over the measuring range from 1.60 to $1 8 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ . The IDS SHBG assay is also linear across the reportable range of the assay which is 0.30 to $7 2 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ when any sample with SHBG concentrations above $1 8 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ is automatically diluted 1:4 by the iSYS System

To support the extended measuring range up to $7 2 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ through the automated 1:4 dilution by the analyzer, the guideline CLSI EP34 $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ ed. was followed.

Nine native samples with known SHBG concentration (obtained on the predicate device Siemens Advia Centaur SHBG assay) were tested on the iSYS using the automated postdilution. Samples were tested in a single replicate on one kit lot.

When testing on the predicate device, samples above $1 8 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ were automatically 1:2 by the automate. If samples were still above the measurement range, the samples were manually diluted 1:5.

The accuracy of the IDS-iSYS system to read samples above $1 8 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ using the automatic dilution is evaluated by calculating the recovery between IDS and Siemens Advia Centaur assays as below:

% Recovery $=$ (SHBG estimate on iSYS / SHBG concentration on predicate) x 100

# Conclusion

A recovery of between $8 7 \%$ to $100 \%$ was achieved.   
IDS SHBG assay shows good accuracy when measuring samples in the range 180 – 720 nmol/L using the automatic dilution.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability of calibrator to a reference material

The standardization of the IDS SHBG assay against the WHO $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ international standard 08/266 was carried out in two phases, value assignment and verification, as described below:

# Value assignment of kit calibrators

This phase includes the value assignment of the secondary standards (Internal reference calibrators, IRs). The candidate secondary standards (IRs) are value assigned directly to the WHO NIBSC $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ international standard for SHBG (IS 08/266) through an internal QC procedure: at least 24 runs are performed using three iSYS instruments, $2 \ \mathrm { k i t }$ lots, 3 replicates for each run. Serial dilutions of the IS 08/266 in SHBG-depleted human serum are used as the reference to assign IR values.

The IDS SHBG kit calibrators A and B and master curve are value assigned off the secondary standards and the IS-08/266 through an internal QC procedure. At least 20 runs (14 runs using the previous IR lot – 6 runs using the international standard as the reference) are performed using one iSYS instrument, 2 replicates for each run.

# Value assignment verification

The kit calibrator A and B values are then verified on three different iSYS instruments following an approved QC procedure by testing internal quality controls in five replicates in one run and on each instrument.

Internal quality controls are at 3 SHBG levels:

• IQC 1 between 5.00 and 8.00 nmol/L • IQC 2 between 45.00 and 65.00 nmol/L • IQC 3 between 80.00 and 120.00 nmol/L

# Acceptance Criteria

The values of the calibrators must fall within specified acceptable ranges:

• Calibrator A between 0.10 to $0 . 3 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L - }$ precision $C V \leq 1 1 \%$ Calibrator B between 110.00 to $1 3 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L - }$ precision $C V \leq 8 \%$

Internal quality controls must be within their respective ranges with a precision $\mathrm { C V } \leq$ $1 1 \%$ for IQC1 and $\leq 8 \%$ for IQC2 and IQC3.

# Traceability to the NIBSC 2nd IS 08/266

A correlation study is also performed between the results obtained when using the 2-point calibration and the results derived from the international standard IS 08/266 curve.

189 samples (139 serum – 50 K2 EDTA plasmas) were tested in two replicates using three lots (MB1, MB2 and MB3) on one iSYS instrument. Their concentrations were derived from the 2-point calibration and compared to the concentration calculated by using a serial dilution of the NIBSC $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ international standard 08/266 (from 180 nmol/L to 0 nmol/L using SHBG depleted human serum). Results were analysed using Passing Bablok analysis on Analyse-it.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined based on guidance from CLSI EP17-A2 “Protocols for the determination of limits of detection and limits of quantitation”.

The statistical approach used when calculating Detection limits are:-

The equations used in Analyse-It are:

$\mathrm { L o B - L c = z _ { ( 1 - a ) } \sigma }$ is the same as $\mathrm { M _ { B } + c _ { p } S D _ { B } }$ $\mathrm { L o D - L o = L c + z _ { ( 1 - b ) } \sigma }$ is the same as $\mathrm { L o B + c _ { p } S D _ { L } }$

EP17-A2 formula:

$$
\begin{array} { r l r l } { - } & { \mathrm { F o r m u l a \left( 2 \right) , p a g e \ 2 5 : } } & & { \mathrm { L o B = M _ { B } + c _ { p } S D _ { B } } } \\ & { - } & { \mathrm { F o r m u l a \left( 5 \right) , p a g e \ 2 7 : } } & & { \mathrm { L o D = L o B + c _ { \beta } S D _ { L } } } \end{array}
$$

For the measurement of LoB, LoD and LoQ three manufacture batches (MB1, MB2B and MB3) were tested.

The LoB sample was run in 12 replicates for each of 5 runs over 3 days, by one operator and on one different instrument for each kit lot for a total of 60 replicates per lot. Where two assays were performed in one day the set-up time between assays start time was at least 2 hours.

Each of the 7 LoD samples was measured in duplicate. For each kit lot, a total of 5 assays were run over 3 days by one operator and on a different instrument, for a total of 70 replicates. Where two assays were performed in one day the set- up time between assays start time was at least 2 hours.

For calculation of The LoQ panel of 9 samples were measured in singlicate two times per day. For each kit lot, a total of 10 assays were run over 5 days by one operator and on a different instrument, for a total of 90 replicates. Where two assays were performed in one day the set- up time between assays start time was at least 2 hours.

Interference and cross-reactivity studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI guidance EP7-A2“Interference testing in clinical chemistry”.

To determine potential interference in the specific detection of SHBG, two serum samples at two different concentrations of SHBG were spiked with the potential interferent. Control samples (blank) for each of the two SHBG samples were spiked with a volume of relevant diluent equal to that of the spiked interferent. The mean concentration of the 26 replicate assays, determined for both the spiked and control samples, were then compared. The differences observed between the mean spiked and control sample values were examined and assessed according to acceptance criteria.

For total cholesterol the interference was tested by dilution of a high cholesterol native serum sample in zero matrix (SHBG depleted normal human serum) and calculation of the observed vs expected SHBG concentration.

$\%$ Interference was calculated using the formula below: $\%$ Interference $=$ (mean spiked concentration – mean un-spiked concentration) x 100

mean un-spiked concentration

$\%$ Observed/Expected $( \% \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { E } )$ was calculated using the formula below:

$\% \mathrm { O / E = }$ (observed mean concentration – expected concentration) x 100 expected concentration The following table provides the levels of interferents tested.

Cross-reactivity testing was performed for alpha fetoprotein, cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, estradiol, testosterone, 5-dihydrotestosterone, thyroglobulin, thyroxin binding globulin, transferrin, TSH, Human IgA, human $\mathrm { I g G }$ , plasminogen, fibrinogen and corticosteroid binding globulin.

Cross-reactants were prepared by manufacturing a ‘top dose’ of the relevant analyte which was then diluted down to a range of stock concentrations in undetectable SHBG matrix (serum based zero matrix). The stock cross reactant or zero matrix was spiked directly into a low sample and a high SHBG sample. The cross reactivity was then determined using the below equation

# 3. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected values were calculated using Analyse-it. Results were analysed to generate a nonparametric $9 5 \ \%$ reference interval using the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles as reference limits.

The package insert recommends considering “the above ranges as guidelines only; it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own expected range based upon its own patient population.

The expected values were assessed by using 671 serum samples from the United States in which the subjects were apparently healthy adults and aged between 21 and 77 years old.
