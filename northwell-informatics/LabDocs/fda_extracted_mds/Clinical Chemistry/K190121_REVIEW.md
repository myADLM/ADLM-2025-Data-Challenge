# I. Device Description:

The IDS SHBG assay is an in vitro diagnostic device consisting of ready to use reagents provided in individual compartments within the reagent cartridge.

The kit reagent components are reagent cartridge (one vial each of MPT1, CONJ, Ab-BIOT and DIL), two concentration levels of calibrators (A & B) – one vial of each, and a mini CD.

The reagent cartridge contains:

MPT1 (Magnetic particles) – Magnetic particles coated with streptavidin in a buffer containing preservative, one bottle, $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ .   
Ab-BIOT (Biotin antibody) – Mouse monoclonal anti-SHBG labelled with biotin in a buffer containing proteins and preservatives, one bottle, $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ .   
CONJ (Conjugate) – Mouse monoclonal anti-SHBG antibody labeled with an acridinium ester derivative in a buffer containing proteins and preservatives, one bottle, $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ .   
DIL (Diluent) – Buffer containing a preservative, one bottle, $1 8 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ .

The calibrators A and B are included in the assay kit. The calibrators consist of a human serum matrix with defined concentrations of SHBG and preservatives. Together with a lot specific master calibration curve, the calibrators are used to perform the adjustment of the master calibration curve.

# L. Test Principle:

The IDS SHBG assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. Patient sample or calibrators are incubated with the biotinylated monoclonal anti-SHBG antibody, an acridinium labeled monoclonal anti-SHBG conjugate and streptavidin labeled magnetic particles. The magnetic particles are captured using a magnet and a wash step is performed to remove any unbound analyte. Trigger reagents are added; the resulting light emitted by the acridinium label is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the original sample.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted for the serum and the $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA plasma matrices following the CLSI EP06-A guideline. A dilution series of sixteen levels per matrix type were prepared using a high-SHBG sample (above the upper limit of the assay, $1 8 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ ) and a low SHBG sample (close to the LoQ, $+ / - 0 . 3 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ ). Each level was assayed in quadruplicate. The summary results are shown below.

Serum: Concentration range assayed: 0.013 to $1 8 5 . 8 0 3 \mathrm { \ n m o l / L } .$

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 0 \mathbf { x } \cdot 0 . 5 4 3 ; ~ \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \colon 0 . 9 9 9
$$

$\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA plasma: Concentration range assayed: 0.022 to 180.921 nmol/L.

$$
y = 0 . 9 6 7 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 4 6 4 ; ~ \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \colon 0 . 9 9 8
$$

Based on the study results, the IDS SHBG assay is linear over the claimed measuring range of 1.60 to $1 8 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

Dilution Recovery Study: The sponsor conducted a recovery study to support an extended reportable range up to $7 2 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

The recovery study was conducted using nine native samples spanning SHBG concentrations from 310.24 to $7 2 6 . 8 4 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ (as measured by the predicate device). The samples were automatically diluted 1:4 onboard of the IDS-iSYS MultiDiscipline Automated System and measured by the candidate device in singlicate. The percent recovery ranged from $8 7 \%$ to $100 \%$ compared to the expected concentration. The results of the dilution study support the sponsor’s claims that samples with SHBG concentrations above the $1 8 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ may be diluted 1:4 ononboard the analyzer to obtain results up to $7 2 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The IDS SHBG assay is traceable to the WHO $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ international standard 08/266.

d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies were conducted per CLSI EP17-A guideline.

The LoB blank sample was run in twelve replicates for each of five runs over three days, by one operator for each kit lot/analyzer for a total of sixty replicates per lot with at least two hours interval between runs. The study was conducted using three device lots on three analyzers. Data was analyzed using the non-parametric approach and LoB was calculated based on type I alpha error of 0.05 $( 5 \% )$ .

Each of the seven LoD samples was measured in duplicate for a total of five assays run over three days by one operator on each kit lot/analyzer, for a total of seventy replicates per lot with at least two hours interval between runs. The study was conducted using three device lots on three analyzers. Data was analyzed using the parametric approach. LoD was determined using the formula $_ { \mathrm { L o D = L o B + 1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } } }$ pooled SD based on the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with type II beta error of 0.05 $( 5 \% )$ .

For calculation of the LoQ, a panel of nine samples were measured in singlicate two times per day for a total of ten assays run over five days by one operator on each kit lot/analyzer, for a total of ninety replicates per lot with at least two hours interval between runs. The study was conducted using three device lots on three analyzers. LoQ was calculated from the regression curve of the plot of $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of measured concentration versus sample concentration as determined from the candidate device. The LoQ is the concentration interpolated from the regression curve at the $20 \%$ CV level.

The summary results for LoB, LoD and LoQ are shown below.

The claimed measuring range of the IDS SHBG assay is from 1.60 to 180.00 nmol/L.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference and cross-reactivity studies were conducted following the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.

Interference Study: Twenty potential interfering substances were tested at two SHBG concentrations (approximately $2 5 { - } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ and $1 0 0 { - } 1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L } \rangle$ ). Control samples (blank) for each of the two SHBG samples were spiked with a volume of relevant diluent equal to that of the spiked interferent. The samples were assayed in 26 replicates. Non-significant interference is defined as bias $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ . The summary results are shown below.

Cross-Reactivity Study: Fifteen cross-reactants were evaluated in the study. Crossreactant solutions were prepared by manufacturing a ‘top dose’ of the relevant analyte which was then diluted down to a range of stock concentrations in undetectable SHBG matrix (serum based zero matrix). The stock cross reactant or zero matrix was spiked directly into a low SHBG sample and a high SHBG sample. The cross reactivity was determined using the below equation, $\%$ cross reactivity $=$ [(Mean SHBG conc. of spiked sample – mean SHBG conc. of un-spiked sample) $\mathbf { x } 1 0 0 \% ]$ / Cross-reactant spiked concentration

High-dose Hook Effect: A hook effect study was conducted using five SHBG levels ranging from 150 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ . Each level was tested in quadruplicate to establish if any hook effect is present between 180 to $1 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ . Results were analyzed by plotting the SHBG concentration (nmol/L) versus the obtained signal (RLU). No hook effect was observed up to $1 1 2 5 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ SHBG.

The data were analysed to generate a nonparametric $9 5 \ \%$ reference interval using the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles as reference limits. The observed ranges were established is summarised in the table below:

The package insert recommends “above ranges should be considered as guidelines only; it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own expected range based upon its own patient population.”

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as applicable.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
