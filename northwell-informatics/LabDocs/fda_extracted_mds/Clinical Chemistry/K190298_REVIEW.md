III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The DxA 5000 is a high-speed, modular, automated sample handling system that performs preanalytical and post-analytical sample processing and storage. The automation system also sorts, routes, and presents sample tubes to analyzers for analysis. The DxA 5000 also consolidates a variety of analytical instruments, such as an Immunoassay analyzer, into a unified workstation on a track system.

The UniCel DxI 800 Access Immunoassay System is a microcomputer controlled, random and continuous access analyzer that includes an external computer. This computer stores the system user interface (UI) software and allows the operator to interface with and direct the instrument software. The UniCel DxI 800 System uses enzyme immunoassays (utilizing paramagnetic particle solid phase and chemiluminescent detection) for the quantitative, semi-quantitative or qualitative determination of various analyte concentrations found in human body fluids. The UniCel DxI 800 System is an in vitro diagnostic device for use in the clinical laboratory.

The Access Ferritin assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent assay for the quantitative determination of ferritin levels in human serum and plasma (heparin) using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Measurements of ferritin aid in the diagnosis of diseases affecting iron metabolism.

The Access Folate assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, plasma (heparin) and red blood cells using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Folic acid measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of megaloblastic anemia.

The Access Access TSH (3rd IS) assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent assay for the quantitative determination of human thyroidstimulating hormone (thyrotropin, TSH, hTSH) levels in human serum using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary are used in the diagnosis of thyroid or pituitary disorders.

The Access Vitamin B12 assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent assay for the quantitative determination of vitamin B12 in human serum and plasma (heparin) using Access Immunoassay Systems.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Access TSH (3rd IS) assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with mouse anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, buffered protein solution and paramagnetic particles coated with immobilized mouse monoclonal antihTSH antibody. The hTSH binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-hTSH antibody on the solid phase while the mouse anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with a different antigenic site on the hTSH. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of TSH in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

The Access Folate assay is a competitive binding receptor assay. For the assay of folate in serum or plasma (heparin), no pre-treatment is required. For the assay of folate in red blood cells, a whole blood sample is first treated off-line with a lysing agent composed of ascorbic acid. This pre-treatment hemolyzes the red blood cells and converts the folate polyglutamic acid forms present in red cells to the monoglutamic acid form predominant in serum. The sample from the pre-treatment of whole blood is defined as a hemolysate.

A serum, plasma (heparin), or hemolysate sample is treated to release folate from endogenous binding proteins. Folate binding protein, mouse anti-folate binding protein, folic acid-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and goat anti-mouse capture antibody coupled to paramagnetic particles are added to the reaction vessel. Folate in the sample competes with the folic acid-alkaline phosphatase conjugate for binding sites on a limited amount of folate binding protein. Resulting complexes bind to the solid phase via mouse anti-folate binding protein. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away'. Then, a chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the concentration of folate in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

The Access Ferritin assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic ("sandwich") assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with goat anti-ferritin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse: mouse anti-ferritin complexes. Serum or plasma (heparin) ferritin binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-ferritin on the solid phase, while the goat antiferritin enzyme conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the ferritin molecules. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of ferritin in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

The Access Vitamin B12 assay is a competitive-binding immunoenzymatic assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with alkaline potassium cyanide and dithiothreitol. This treatment denatures B12 binding proteins and converts all forms of vitamin B12 to the cyanocobalamin form. After neutralization, intrinsic factor-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse IgG: mouse monoclonal anti-intrinsic factor are added to the sample. Vitamin B12 in the sample binds to the intrinsic factor conjugate, preventing the conjugate from binding to the solid phase anti-intrinsic factor. Separation in a magnetic field and washing removes materials not bound to the solid phase. A chemiluminescent substrate, Lumi-Phos 530, is added to the reaction vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the concentration of vitamin B12i n the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined by means of a stored, mufti-point calibration curve.

For comparing the pre-analytical processing of the DxA 5000 to the Power Processor, native samples were evaluated using both the DxA 5000 and the Power processor in conjunction with four representative assays (Ferritin, Folate, TSH, and Vitamin B12).

The paired data sets were obtained by collecting blood into two sample tubes per patient. One sample tube was processed pre-analytically by the Power Processor being analyzed by the DxI800 Access Immunoanalyzer connected to the Power Processor.
