# Intended Use Statement(s) VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slides

Rx Only For in vitro diagnostic use only

The UREA test within the VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slides quantitatively measures urea concentration, reported either as urea nitrogen or as urea (UREA), in serum, plasma, and urine using VITROS XT 7600 Integrated Systems. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain renal and metabolic diseases.

The CREA test within the VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slides quantitatively measures creatinine (CREA) concentration in serum, plasma, and urine using VITROS XT 7600 Integrated Systems. Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other urine analytes.

# Device Description

The new device, the VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slide is a single device that contains both a UREA test and a CREA test multilayered, analytical element coated on a polyester support separated by a plastic barrier sealed within a single slide frame. In this format, individual reactions occur and test results are generated for each analyte independently of the other analyte.

To perform the UREA test, a drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading layer to the underlying layers. Water and nonproteinaceous components then travel to the underlying reagent layer, where the urease reaction generates ammonia. The semipermeable membrane allows only ammonia to pass through to the colorforming layer, where it reacts with the indicator to form a dye. The reflection density of the dye is measured and is proportional to the concentration of urea in the sample.

To perform the CREA test, a drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading layer to the underlying layers. Creatinine diffuses to the reagent layer, where it is hydrolyzed to creatine in the rate-determining step. The creatine is converted to sarcosine and urea by creatine amidinohydrolase. The sarcosine, in the presence of sarcosine oxidase, is oxidized to glycine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide. The final reaction involves the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of a leuco dye to produce a colored product. Following addition of the sample, the slide is incubated. During the initial reaction phase, endogenous creatine in the sample is oxidized. The resulting change in reflection density is measured at 2 time points. The difference in reflection density is proportional to the concentration of creatinine present in the sample.

# Precision

Precision was evaluated with patient pools and quality control materials following CLSI Protocol EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Methods; Approved Guideline—Third Edition, using the VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slides on the VITROS XT 7600 Integrated System. The test included a minimum of 80 observations (2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day over 20 days) for serum and urine. The long term precision analysis is summarized below.

The data presented are a representation of test performance and are provided as a guideline. Variables such as sample handling and storage, reagent handling and storage, laboratory environment, and system maintenance can affect reproducibility of test results.

Repeatability (formerly called within-run precision) was determined using two replicates per run. Within Day precision was determined using two runs per day with two replications per run. Within Lab precision was determined using a single lot of slides and a single calibration.

# Detection Limits

Detection capability studies for the UREA and CREA tests within the VITROS XT UREACREA Slides were evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A2: Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.

The Limit of Quantitation $\left( \mathrm { L o Q } \right)$ for the UREA test within the VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides is $2 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum/plasma and $6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine. The total number of LoQ determinations was 72. The Total Error goal used to accept the LoQ was $\leq 1 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum and $\leq 2 1 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Urea N for urine.

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the CREA test within the VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides is $0 . 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum/plasma and $3 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine. The total number of LoQ determinations was 72 for serum and 64 for urine. The Total Error goal used to accept the LoQ was $\leq 0 . 0 6 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum and $\leq 1 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine.

# Linearity

Linearity studies were performed according to CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach Approved Guideline (2003). VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides were tested on the VITROS XT 7600 Integrated System. A series of twenty proportionally related admixtures of low and high test fluids were tested with to verify linearity of the UREA and CREA serum and urine tests; each sample was tested in quadruplicate. The linearity studies support the claimed measuring ranges for the individual tests within the VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides.

\* After multiplying by 21x dilution factor

Serum and plasma samples with values greater than the measuring range may be diluted up to a maximum dilution of 1 part sample with 1 part diluent. A $7 \%$ BSA solution was found to be an acceptable diluent for serum and plasma specimens assayed using VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slides.

Urine samples with values greater than the measuring range may be diluted up to a maximum dilution of 1 part sample with 1 part diluent. Isotonic saline and reagent-grade water were both found to be acceptable diluents for UREA urine specimens assayed using the VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slides. Reagent-grade water was found to be an acceptable diluent for CREA urine specimens assayed using the VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slides.

# Expected Values

The expected values of the UREA and CREA tests within the VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides are the not changed from those of the predicate assays. Each laboratory should confirm the validity of these intervals for the population it serves.

# UREA Reference Interval

The serum reference interval is the central $9 5 \%$ of results from an internal study of 3160 apparently healthy adults from a working population (612 females and 2548 males).

# Specificity

The UREA and CREA tests within the VITROS XT Chemistry Products UREA-CREA Slide were screened for interfering substances following CLSI document EP07-A3, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. The supplemental tables in CLSI document EP37 were referenced for recommended testing concentrations for analytes and endogenous substances that may interfere in clinical chemistry measurement procedures.

Point estimates of the effects of potential interferents on VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides were made using the paired difference method. Dose-response analysis was conducted to characterize the degree of interference for each substance, and expected bias was reported at the lowest test level which did not meet acceptance criteria for bias as shown in the product claims.

# Known Interferences

Ammonium ions may cause an increase in measured UREA value equivalent to the specimen’s nitrogen content.

# Serum and Plasma

The substances listed in the table, when tested at the concentrations indicated, caused the bias shown. The bias is an estimate of the maximum bias observed.

It is possible that other interfering substances may be encountered. These results are representative; however, your results may differ somewhat due to test-to-test variation. The degree of interference at concentrations other than those listed might not be predictable.

Ninety-six (96) test substances, when tested at the concentrations indicated, as well as serum $\mathsf { p H }$ at 6.8 and 8.8, were found not to interfere, bias $< 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ urea $_ \mathrm { N }$ and bias $< 4 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ urea N, with the UREA test within VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides in serum.

# CREA Test

Creatine: At a creatinine concentration of $1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ( $1 3 3 \mathrm { \ : \mu m o l / L }$ ), creatine greater than $8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 7 0 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { L } )$ will be flagged with a DP code (because highly elevated creatine concentrations may cause excessive background density). For unflagged samples, residual bias because of creatine will be less than $0 . 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 1 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ . At a creatinine concentration of $1 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 1 2 3 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , creatine greater than 1 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 8 8 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L } )$ will be flagged with a DP code. Residual bias for unflagged samples will be less than $2 \%$ . Refer to “Sample Dilution” for dilution instructions.

Proline: Patients receiving hyperalimentation fluids containing proline may show an increase of $0 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 1 8 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ . Do not collect specimens from intravenous fluid lines contaminated with hyperalimentation fluid.

Eighty-eight (88) test substances, when tested at the concentrations indicated, as well as serum $\mathsf { p H }$ at 6.8 and 8.8, were found not to interfere, bias $< 0 . 1 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and bias $< 0 . 4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , with the CREA test within VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides in serum.

# Urine

# UREA Test

Two (2) substances were found to interfere with the UREA test in VITROS XT UREACREA Slides in urine. Both of these substances are urine preservatives containing boric acid, and the use of urine specimens preserved with boric acid is not recommended for use in the UREA test within VITROS XT UREA-CREA Slides.

Nineteen (19) test substances were found not to interfere with the UREA test in urine, bias $< 9 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $9 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ urea $_ \mathrm { N }$ and bias $< 1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ urea N.

# CREA Test

Twenty-three (23) test substances were found not to interfere, bias $< 5 . 8 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and bias $< 1 7 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , with the CREA test in urine.

# Other Limitations

Certain drugs and clinical conditions are known to alter urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations in vivo. For additional information, refer to one of the published summaries.
