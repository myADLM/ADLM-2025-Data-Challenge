# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The two systems in this submission, the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700S and the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB, consist of the following components:

Rightest Blood Glucose Meter (GM700S or GM700SB) Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strips GS700 Rightest Control Solution GC700 (Level 1, Level 2, Level 4)

Both systems employ the same device technology. The only difference between the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700S and the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB is the presence of Bluetooth in the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700S and Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using amperometric technology. The system employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry. Whole blood applied to a test strip initiates a reaction where electrons are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. The detected current signal is then calculated by the meter and glucose concentration reading is then displayed on the meter display. The meter is calibrated to display plasma-equivalent concentration results.

Therefore, the analytical studies performed with the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700SB are representative of the performance for both systems in this 510(k) submission.

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Repeatability (within-run precision):

The sponsor performed repeatability (within-day) precision studies using venous whole blood adjusted to 5 different glucose concentration levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each glucose concentration level was analyzed in replicates of 10, with 5 test strip lots, and 10 meters, for a total of 500 tests per glucose level. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>GlucoseLevel(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average Glucose(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV(%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30-50</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51-110</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>101</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>111-150</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>131</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>151-250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>198</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>251-400</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>370</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4</td></tr></table>

# Intermediate Precision:

Intermediate (day-to-day) precision was evaluated using 3 levels of glucose control solutions over 10 days with 5 test strip lots. For each level, on each day, 10 meters were used, with 1 replicate collected per meter for a total of 10 replicates per day for each glucose level. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>GlucoseLevel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>AverageGlucose(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV(%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>110</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>255</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.0</td></tr></table>

Linearity was evaluated using fourteen venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 15.5, 24.0, 56.6, 89.8, 154.5, 201.5, 266.0, 312.5, 356.5, 422.0, 474.5, 512.0, 576.0, and $6 3 0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300. Each sample was tested with 3 test strip lots. For each lot, 3 measurements with 3 meters were taken per glucose level. The linear regression results are presented below:

Lot 1: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 9 3 6 \mathbf { x } - 1 . 3 3 9 1$ ; $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 4$   
Lot 2: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 7 7 1 \mathbf { x } - 1 . 4 7 4 2$ ; $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 8$   
Lot 3: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 1 4 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 2 0 0 1$ ; $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 2$

The results of the linearity study support the claimed glucose measurement range of 20-600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or greater than $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ an error message is returned to the user. The error messages were validated using blood glucose samples outside the measuring range of the device and demonstrated that the error messages function as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

To assess potential interferences, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to glucose concentrations between 75 and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was divided into a test pool and a control pool, with the potential interfering substance added to the test pool. The difference between the test sample and the control sample was calculated using mean of 10 replicates per each of 3 test strip lots. The compounds at the concentrations listed below did not have significant interference (defined by the sponsor as average bias between spiked and control sample glucose results within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for glucose ${ > } 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for glucose ${ \bf \Sigma } ^ { < } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . The highest concentrations at which no significant interference was observed are presented in the following table:

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

# 1. Hematocrit Study:

To evaluate the effect of hematocrit, venous blood samples with hematocrit levels of $10 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $65 \%$ , and $70 \%$ were tested at six glucose levels (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330, and $2 6 0 { - } 4 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each sample was tested in replicates of 5 test strips per strip lot, with a total of 3 lots of tests strips tested. Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300). The evaluation of bias relative to the comparator method demonstrated acceptable performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of $20 \%$ .

# 2. Altitude Study:

To evaluate the effect of altitude, meters were tested at approximately sea level, 3,280, 6,560, and 10,744 feet above sea level. The evaluation tested 3 levels of glucose (50-75, 80-120, and $2 7 0 { - } 3 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) included 3 test strip lots. Results at each altitude were compared to the comparator method, YSI 2300. Results demonstrated that altitudes up to 10,744 feet above sea level have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements.

# 3. Sample Volume Study:

The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume. Venous whole blood samples were tested at 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.0, 1.25, 2.0 and $3 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ at 3 glucose levels (50-75, 80-120, and $2 7 0 { - } 3 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } \rangle$ as established by the YSI 2300 comparator method. Each sample was tested in triplicate on three meters using 3 test strip lots. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . Blood volumes below $0 . 7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ resulted in an accurate result or an insufficient sample volume error message.

# 4. Operating Conditions Study:

The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples with glucose samples of approximately 90 and $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Temperatures ranging from $4 3 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ - $1 1 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 6 { - } 4 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ were tested. Meter results were compared to the YSI 2300 comparator method. Four temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of $4 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 1 1 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 6 { - } 4 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of 10 to $90 \%$ .

# 5. Flex Studies:

Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, drop/shock testing, and vibration testing was completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust to intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop/shock, and vibration, and that an error message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.

# 6. EMC Testing:

The sponsor provided appropriate documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and that they were compliant.

7. Infection Control Studies:

The two systems in this submission are intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration # 46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 550 cleanings and disinfection cycles with the CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of singlepatient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol:

The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# VIII Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

# IX Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
