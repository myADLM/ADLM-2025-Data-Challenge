# A Device Description:

TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the TD-4183 Blood Glucose meter, TD4183 Blood Glucose test strips, Owners’ manual, Protective Wallet, Warranty card, Daily Log Book, One 1.5V AAA alkaline battery, a Quick Start Guide, TD-4183 Blood glucose Control Solutions, sterile lancets and lancing device.

# B Principle of Operation:

TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the amount of glucose in whole blood quantitative using fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip. Amperometric technology is used for the detection of glucose from testing the strip (with whole blood sample) on the meter. Reagent consisting of GDH-FAD and mediator is deposited onto the reaction cell section of the test strip with printed electrodes. When a drop of whole blood is applied to the reaction cell on the test strip, glucose in the blood sample reacts in the presence of GDH-FAD and mediator, and the reaction yields electrons. Thus, a current signal is produced from the reaction and detected by the meter. The detected current signal is then calculated by the meter and the resulting glucose concentration is then displayed on the meter display.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability (within-run precision):

The sponsor performed a repeatability study (within day) precision study using venous whole blood adjusted to 5 different glucose concentration levels (approximately 44.58, 86.67, 138.58,234.36, and $3 4 5 . 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each glucose concentration level was analyzed in replicates of 10 with 3 test strips lots, and 10 meters, for a total of 300 tests per glucose level. Results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>44.58</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.952</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.38</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>86.67</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.509</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.05</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>138.58</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.894</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.53</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>234.36</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.037</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.43</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>345.35</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.817</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.42</td></tr></table>

# Intermediate Precision:

Intermediate (day to day) precision was performed using 5 levels of glucose control solutions with mean glucose concentrations of (46.05, 66.86, 126.32, 197.57, and 317.36 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ . Testing was performed for 10 days with 3 test strip lots. For each level, on each day, 10 meters were used for testing, with 1 replicate collected per meter for a total of 10 replicates per day for each glucose level, for a total of 300 tests per glucose level. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>46.05</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.014</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.37</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>66.86</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.908</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.35</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>126.32</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.470</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.54</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>197.57</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.954</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.52</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Levels 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>317.36</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10.767</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.39</td></tr></table>

2. Linearity:

Linearity testing was evaluated with test strips from 3 lots and 11 mixed pools of venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 18, 40, 63, 95, 129, 169, 231, 316, 408, 559 and $6 7 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300. Each level was measured in replicate of 15 and the values obtained on TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared with those obtained from YSI 2300. Linear regresion analysis of the results yielded the following:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{}$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0013</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.6521</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9973</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0077</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2259</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9978</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.005</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.5608</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9976</td></tr></table>

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20-650 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If the result is greater than $6 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as HI. This low and high functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference studies were performed by spiking venous whole blood to achieve 3 glucose levels $\mathrm { ( 6 0 - 8 0 ~ m g / d L }$ , $1 2 0 { - } 1 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $2 4 0 { - } 3 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each of these samples were divided into a test pool with the potential interferent added and a control sample with no added interferent. Each sample was measured using 10 meters with 3 lots of the test strips, for a total of 30 replicates per sample. Results on the candidate meter from the test samples were compared to results obtained on the candidate meter from the control sample. The highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference was observed (defined by the sponsor as $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias) are presented in the following table:

# Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Study:

A study to evaluate the performance of TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems in the extreme lower and upper ends of the claimed range was performed using 50 altered samples with glucose concentrations below $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and 50 samples greater than $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were altered by spiking or glycolysis in order to obtain the appropriate glucose concentrations. Samples were tested on TD-4183 Blood Glucose with test strips from 3 lots and compared to the results obtained on YSI 2300 analyzer. The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from $2 3 { \mathrm { - } } 7 6 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on the lower end and $2 7 6 - 6 4 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on the higher end, as measured by the YSI 2300. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=4>For glucose concentrations &lt; 80 mg/dL:</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within ± 5 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within ± 10 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within ± 15 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within ± 20 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>46/50 (92.0%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50/50 (100%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50/50 (100%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50/50 (100%)</td></tr></table>

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

# 1. Hematocrit Study:

To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , $60 \%$ , and $65 \%$ . Each hematocrit level was adjusted to achieve five concentrations of, (42.0, 79.5, 129.5,224.0, and $3 8 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was tested using TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System 10 meters with test strips from 3 lots: The values were compared with the average of 4 glucose measurement obtained from YSI 2300 analyzer. The percent biases relative to the comparator method demonstrated were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to $65 \%$ .

# 2. Altitude Study:

To evaluate the effect of altitude on the TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, a study was conducted using venous whole blood samples adjusted with 7 concentration levels of glucose ranging from $5 1 { \mathrm { - } } 6 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were placed under conditions to simulate 4 different altitude condition from sea level to 4,400 meters (15, 000feet). Each blood sample was tested using 4 TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System with test strips from 1 lot. The values obtained were compared with the values obtained with the YSI 2300 analyzer outside of the pressurized chamber. The results demonstrated acceptable bias to YSI 2300 to support the claim in the labeling that glucose measurement performance of the TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is maintained at altitudes ranging sea level up to 4,500 meters (15, 000 feet).

# 3. Operating Conditions Study:

The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to approximately 65, 125, and $3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Testing was conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations: $4 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C } ( 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and ${ 5 0 } \mathrm { C } ( 4 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ , at $5 \%$ to $90 \%$ RH each and at $2 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C } ( 7 7 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { F } )$ at $60 \%$ RH. Four TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and 3 lots of test strips were used. Values measured on TD4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to results from the comparator YSI 2300. The study results support the operating conditions claim of $4 6 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (8- $4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ .

# 4. Volume Study:

The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ for the TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples with three levels of glucose concentrations (61.9, 114.0, $2 4 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were tested at six sample volumes (0.3,0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and $0 . 8 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) using 3 lots of the test strips and 5 meters. Values obtained were compared to YSI 2300 values. The meter has an error message displayed if enough blood is not added to the test strip. This feature was validated and was shown to function as intended. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$

# 5. Flex Studies:

Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, drop, vibration and shipping testing was completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust to intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop/shock, and vibration, and that an error message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.

# 6. Infection Control Studies:

The TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System in this submission is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the meter materials by an outside commercial laboratory, demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Micro-Kil $+ \mathbf { T M }$ Disinfecting Wipes (EPA Registration Number 59894-10-37549). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor using the TD-4183 Blood Glucose Monitoring System demonstrating that there was no change in the performance of the system or in the external materials of the meter after 260 cycles of cleaning and disinfection using the chosen disinfectant. The robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning and disinfecting over the 5-year single-patient use life of the meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

7. Electrical Safety and EMC testing:

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was found to be compliant.

8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol:

The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
