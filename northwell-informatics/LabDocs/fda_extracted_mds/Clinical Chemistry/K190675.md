# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

![](images/8dcf2b0289bd034833b15198e0cdd7e743a9a4670d5e1b63fc3609b94f1953fb.jpg)

The Dimension EXL TNIH assay is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOC $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ technology. The LOCI reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and two biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody fragments. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a third anticardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibodies to form bead-cardiac troponin Ibiotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the cardiac troponin I concentration in the sample

Lithium heparin plasma specimens may be used. The reagent is stored unopened at 2 – $8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , is stable sealed on system for 30 days and opened on the system for 7 days. Calibration is performed every 21 days for a reagent lot.

# INTENDED USE/INDICATIONS FOR USE

The Dimension EXL High-Sensitivity Troponin I (TNIH) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative measurement of cardiac troponin I in human plasma using the Dimension EXL integrated chemistry system with LOCI module. The assay can be used to aid in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Assay performance results for the Dimension EXL High-Sensitivity Troponin I (TNIH) assay was determined by processing the appropriate body fluids. Summary statistics for each are provided. The following data represent typical assay performance. All data were collected on the Dimension EXL with LM System.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation: Approved Guideline.

Assessment of LoB was the 95th percentile of all values (sorted from lowest to highest), using non-parametric approach. LoB Rank Position $= 0 . 5 + 0 . 9 5 ^ { \star } \mathsf { B }$ , where $\mathsf { B } =$ total reps $\mathtt { - 6 0 }$ ; Rank $\hphantom { 0 } : 5 7 . 5$

The nonparametric approach described in EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Detection. LoD was tested separately for lithium heparin specimens.

The $10 \%$ CV limit for Dimension EXL TNIH of $1 2 . 0 \ : \mathsf { p g / m L }$ is consistent with the data.

# PRECISION STUDIES

Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods: Approved Guideline – Third Edition. Precision was tested ${ \mathsf n } = 2$ replicates, two times a day for at least 20 days for a total of 80 replicates with controls and plasma pools on one instrument. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP05-A3. The data are summarized in the following table. All precision goals were met.

Linearity was evaluated with 16 lithium heparin plasma samples which spanned the assay measuring interval. Each was prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples across the measurement interval as described in CLSI Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedure (EP06-A). The high samples and the low samples for lithium heparin plasma were native. At least five replicates were measured for each sample. The mean of these replicates was used for the calculations.

The assay was considered linear across the measuring interval if the p values of nonlinear terms in the quadratic and cubic fit equations are nonsignificant $( \mathsf { p } \leq 0 . 0 5 )$ . If the p-value is $> 0 . 0 5$ , then the allowable bias is $\leq 1 0 \%$ or $4 \ : \mathsf { p g } / \mathsf { m L }$ , whichever is greater.

The testing confirmed linearity from $4 . 0 - 2 5 , 0 0 0 . 0 \ p { \mathsf { g } } / { \mathsf { m L } } .$

CLSI EP7-A2 was followed for the interference testing. The interference study was conducted using a “paired difference scenario” approach where these compounds were spiked into fresh sample pools containing either low or high levels of troponin in lithium heparin troponin I pools. All exogeneous compounds were spiked into the troponin control pools at two levels. Endogeneous compounds were only tested at elevated levels as they are natively found in specimen samples.

Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference. Dilution studies were conducted to determine the level at which the spiked substance no longer displayed significant interference. Dilution studies were conducted at two analyte concentrations, if both sample pools show significant interference.

No interference was detected at the following analyte concentrations.

# ANALYTICAL SPECIFICITY

Cross-reactivity was determined following the governing standard CLSI document EP07-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline—Second Edition.Cross-reactivity was tested at cTnI concentration of range of $2 0 { \cdot } 6 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ in native lithium heparin pools as well as in the absence of cTnI. The cross-reactants were tested at a single concentration near the upper limit of its therapeutic range. TNIH assay results from the spiked samples were compared with those of unspiked control samples. Percent cross-reactivity is calculated as:

% Cross-reactivity $=$ [measured analyte] - [control analyte] x 100 [cross-reactant]

The high dose hook effect of the TNIH assay was assessed. Normal human lithium heparin plasma were spiked with calibrator antigen. A dilution series was created and tested. No hook effect was found at 1,000,000 pg/mL troponin on the Dimension EXL TNIH assay.

Dilution recovery was evaluated for plasma at 1:2 and 1:5 dilutions using CTNI SDIL as diluent. Native human plasma samples were pooled to obtain at least three unique patient samples with TNIH levels $\ge 7 5 \%$ of the measuring interval and at least two samples above the measuring interval. For samples above the assay measuring interval the expected or neat value was determined using a 1:2 dilution in normal human plasma. Testing supported use of the diluent for over-range samples.

# CALIBRATION STABILITY

The calibration stability for the TNIH assay on the Dimension EXL was determined by reading the recovery of the calibrators, commercial QC, a low patient pool and a high pool over time. The p-value of the regression slope was determined. Passing results were a p-value greater than or equal to 0.05 or drift less than or equal to the LoQ or less than or equal to $10 \%$ for values up to $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ and less than or equal to $13 \%$ for values greater than $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ . Calibration interval was measured to be 21 days.

# OPEN WELL STABILITY

The open well stability for the TNIH assay on the Dimension EXL was determined by reading the recovery of the calibrators and a low patient pool. On the first day of the study reagent packs were opened on the system and analyte was measured over the desired time interval. The p-value of the regression slope was determined. Passing results were a p-value greater than or equal to 0.05 or drift less than or equal to the LoQ or less than or equal to $10 \%$ for values up to $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ and less than or equal to $13 \%$ for values greater than $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ . The stability of the reagents opened onboard the instrument was 7 days per well set.

# SAMPLE STABILITY

Separated samples are stable for 8 hours at room temperature and for 24 hours when stored at $2 . 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . Samples can be frozen at or below ${ } ^ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for up to 40 days in a nonfrost free freezer and at or below $. 7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 1 year. A linear regression analysis of the observed Troponin $\%$ Bias value (Y-axis) versus time (X-axis) was completed for each matrix. The acceptance criteria were the lower bound of the one-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line is $\leq - 1 0 \%$ and all individual data points had a bias of $\leq - 2 0 \%$ when compared to time zero.

# EXPECTED VALUES

Lithium heparin plasma specimens were collected from apparently healthy individuals from the United States who ranged in age from 22–91 years of age. Each specimen

was frozen, thawed and assayed once. The 99th percentile values were determined using the non-parametric statistical method described in   
CLSI Guidance EP28-A3c. Sample type, gender, and age had no statistically significant effect on the 99th percentile.

The combined gender and the more commonly used sample type of lithium heparin were used to determine the overall observed 99th percentile of $6 0 . 4 \ p \mathsf { g / m L \left[ n g / L \right] }$ . Two female subjects had troponin values of approximately $4 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ and $4 7 0 0 ~ { \mathsf { p g / m L } }$ , and were considered to be outliers. These results were not included in the ${ 9 9 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile determination.

The 99th percentile values determined for lithium heparin plasma (female, male, and combined) are shown in the following table. The $90 \%$ confidence intervals demonstrate that there is no statistical basis for using separate 99th percentile values based on gender or sample type.

# CLINICAL PERFORMANCE

A prospective study was performed to assess diagnostic accuracy for approximately 2500 subjects in lithium heparin plasma sample types to evaluate clinical performance. Specimens were collected at 29 emergency departments across the United States, from subjects presenting with symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

All subject diagnoses were adjudicated by panels of certified cardiologists and emergency physicians according to the Third Universal Definition Of Myocardial Infarction - consensus guideline endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the World Heart Federation (WHF). The observed AMI prevalence in this study was $1 3 . 0 \%$ .

The clinical concordance study evaluated clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the Dimension EXL TNIH assay in terms of its correlation to the the diagnosis of AMI. The results were analyzed using the serial sampling time points collected during the emergency department visit. A positive is defined as a sample exceeding the 99th percentile cutoff at the particular time point. The results are presented using serial timed intervals analyzed according to the time of presentation to the emergency department. The pooled gender results based on time of presentation to the emergency department, calculated using the overall ${ 9 9 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of $6 0 . 4 ~ { \mathsf { p g / m L } }$ , are summarized in Table 1.
