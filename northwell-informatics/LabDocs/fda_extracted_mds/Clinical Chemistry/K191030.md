Dear Darcie Baynes:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

Please note that if you modify your IVD in the future to exceed any of the limitations to the exemption found in 21 CFR 862.9(c), your device will require a new 510(k) prior to marketing this device in the United States and will not be exempt from the premarket notification requirements so long as it exceeds the limitations to the exemption found in 21 CFR 862.9.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of

Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

# Non-Clinical Performance Data 21 CFR 807.92(b)(1)

Non-clinical performance of the instrument was evaluated in a reproducibility study using a representative fragment analysis assay. The reproducibility study was performed across multiple sites, using different instruments, multiple operators, and across several days. The pre-established acceptance criteria were met.

# Clinical Performance Data 21 CFR 807.92(b)(2)

Clinical performance studies were conducted across 3 US clinical laboratory sites, with multiple instruments using a representative fragment analysis assay and an appropriate method comparison assay. All pre-established performance criteria were met.

# Conclusion 21 CFR 807.92(b)(3)

The proposed Applied Biosystems $\textbf { M } 3 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { D x }$ Genetic Analyzer and the Applied Biosystems™ 3500xL Dx Genetic Analyzer with fragment analysis and sequencing, and the legally marketed Applied Biosystems $3 5 0 0 \mathrm { D x } / 3 5 0 0 \mathrm { x L }$ Dx Genetic Analyzer and $3 5 0 0 \mathrm { D x }$ Series Data Collection Software with sequencing use the same capillary electrophoresis technology and are the same instrument. The Applied Biosystems™ 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer and the Applied Biosystems™ 3500xL Dx Genetic Analyzer did not require changes to the instrument hardware or firmware to expand the intended use to include fragment analysis. The change was made in the Applied Biosystems $\textbf { M } 3 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { D x }$ Series Data Collection Software to enable the fragment analysis workflow in the Diagnostic mode.

Therefore, the Applied Biosystems™ 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer and the Applied Biosystems™ 3500xL Dx Genetic Analyzer and the legally marketed device, the Applied Biosystems $3 5 0 0 \mathrm { D x } / 3 5 0 0 \mathrm { x L }$ Dx Genetic Analyzer CS2 and $3 5 0 0 \mathrm { D x }$ Series Software, are substantially equivalent based on the study data provided in this 510(k). In addition, the performance of the fragment analysis application has been demonstrated by Clinical and Non-Clinical performance studies using a representative assay.
