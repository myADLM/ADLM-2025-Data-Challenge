Software: The Applied Biosystems™ $^ { 1 } 3 5 0 0 \mathrm { D x }$ Series Data Collection Software 3 IVD v3.2 provides control and monitoring of the instrument, collection of data during an injection, and primary analysis of injection data. The software provides three main functions:

1. Facilitates user entry of specific plate information, including plate and sample IDs, that are used by the instrument to perform the injection, to map the assay to wells on a plate, and to perform data reduction.   
2. Communicates with the instrument to provide injection parameters and retrieve both raw instrument data and general instrument status.   
3. Provides data reduction of instrument data for storage in sample files. These files can then be exported for analysis using a secondary, assay-specific software.

Principle of Operation: DNA, labeled with fluorescent dyes, is transferred to a capillary electrophoresis plate that is used for injection into the instrument. During capillary electrophoresis, fluorescently labeled PCR products are electrokinetically injected into capillaries. High voltage is applied to move DNA fragments toward the positive electrode. Shortly before reaching the positive electrode, the fluorescently labeled DNA fragments, separated by size, move through the path of a laser beam. The laser beam causes the dyes on the fragments to fluoresce. A charge coupled device (CCD) camera detects the fluorescence. The Applied Biosystems™ 3500 Dx Series Data Collection Software 3 IVD v3.2 converts the fluorescence signal to digital data and performs size calling operations on the data. The raw data files are then transferred to a computer with the assay-specific software for downstream analyses.

The Applied Biosystems $\Gamma \mathbf { M } \ 3 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { D x }$ Genetic Analyzer and the Applied Biosystems™ 3500xL Dx Genetic Analyzer were cleared for in vitro diagnostic sequence analysis use in BK110039.

1. Instrument Name:

Applied Biosystems™ 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer and Applied Biosystems™ 3500xL Dx Genetic Analyzer

# 2. Specimen Identification:

The user can use either use a handheld barcode reader or can manually enter the barcodes identified on the test plates. The user manually enters individual sample IDs per well on a plate.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Human genomic DNA, from EDTA-anticoagulated whole human blood (fresh or stored under validated storage conditions) may be isolated using laboratory-validated sample preparation methodologies (precipitation, silica column, or magnetic beads). PCR products from FDA- cleared or approved devices intended to be used with the Applied Biosystems™ $3 5 0 0 \mathrm { D x }$ Genetic Analyzer and Applied Biosystems™ $3 5 0 0 \mathrm { x L }$ Dx Genetic Analyzer may be used immediately or stored under validated storage conditions (protected from light) prior to capillary electrophoresis analysis. The PCR product is plated onto a 96-well plate for use with the analyzer.

# 4. Calibration:

Two calibrations are required to prepare the instrument for sample runs:

1. Spatial calibration: The software uses images collected during the spatial calibration to establish a relationship between the signal emitted by each capillary and the position where that signal is detected by the CCD camera. Spatial calibrations should be performed after removal or replacement of the capillary array. The instrument requires spatial calibration when it detects a newly installed capillary array. During the calibration, the software performs quality checks to ensure that sequence and fragment analysis attributes do not exceed the set thresholds.

2. Spectral calibration: The spectral calibration creates a de-convolution matrix for each capillary that compensates for dye overlap (reduces raw data from the instrument) in the dye data stored in each sample file and this information is used to convert the 20-color data into 4-, 5-, or 6-dye data. Spectral calibration should be performed when a new dye is used, when the capillary is removed or replaced, or when the user observes a decrease in spectral separation in the data peaks of raw or analyzed data. The instrument must be calibrated for the detection of each fluorescent dye used with the assay.

# 5. Quality Control:

Size standards are present in each sample (internal control) and are labeled with the fluorescent dye, LIZ, for quality control. The assay may also include external positive and negative controls in each run for the assay software to interpret sample results correctly.
