# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only For Point-of-Care or clinical laboratory setting

D Special Instrument Requirements:

i-STAT 1 Analyzer

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer, the i-STAT cartridges and accessories (i-STAT 1 Downloader/Recharger, electronic simulator and portable printer) and the i-STAT test cartridges. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.

The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under k103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer) is a handheld analytical device designed to run i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts with the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.

The single-use, disposable i-STAT ${ \mathrm { C H E M } } 8 +$ (blue) cartridge contains test reagents to analyze whole blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory for total carbon dioxide and other analytes. The cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. The cartridges contain the required sensors, a fluid pouch, a sample entry well and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement within the cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which are typically applied to the cartridge using a transfer device, by the trained user before the cartridge is placed within the analyzer.

# B Principle of Operation:

TCO2 is a potentiometric test in the i-STAT CHEM $^ { 8 + }$ Cartridge. Potentiometry is the measurement of difference in potential that exists between an active working sensor and an independent reference sensor. Both these sensors need to be present within the same cartridge for a potentiometric test to give a result. The active working sensor responds to change in the activity (concentration) of the substance to be measured when the sample contacts that active working sensor. The potential of the reference electrode does not change because it is not in contact with patient sample. A potential (or voltage) corresponding to the analyte concentration is generated at the active working sensor and measured by the i-STAT analyzer. The test concentrations are calculated from the measured potential through the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the measured potential to the activity of the ion being measured. The measured TCO2 test method is calibrated to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) TCO2 reference method with an algorithm based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which uses pH, PCO2, and ionic strength (Na) measurements.

# Point of Care precision (aqueous control material)

A three site precision study was performed using a panel of five aqueous control solutions containing different levels of TCO2. Each sample was assayed at each site once per day for five days across each of six analyzers for a total of 90 measurements. At each site, all testing was conducted by three operators with one per site using one lot of i-STAT CHEM $1 8 +$ (blue) cartridges.

# Point of Care precision (whole blood)

A whole blood repeatability analysis was conducted using the data collected across three point of care sites. Two hundred and seventy-nine samples (178 venous and 101 arterial) were measured in duplicate using 3 lots of i-STAT ${ \mathrm { C H E M } } 8 +$ cartridges and 18 i-STAT 1 Analyzers by multiple POC operators at each site. The mean values for each sample were divided into four subintervals for each sample type taking into consideration the medical decision levels of 6, 20, and $3 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

2. Linearity:

The linearity of the TCO2 assay on the i-STAT CHEM $^ { 3 + }$ (blue) cartridge was evaluated based on the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A. For this study, the sample preparation recommended in the CLSI EP06-A guidance was not followed. Due to the sample preparation process and in order to limit degassing, the intermediate levels were prepared individually rather than mixing high and low samples. Nine venous whole blood samples collected in lithium heparin tubes spanning the reportable range for the i-STAT TCO2 were prepared through a process of tonometry and acid/base addition. Each sample was measured in replicates of 15 using five lots of i-STAT CHEM $^ { 1 8 + }$ (blue) cartridges on 39 i-STAT 1 Analyzers. Results of the linear regression analysis are presented in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte(mmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range Tested(mmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{2}$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TCO2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.56 - 52.26</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.028</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.126</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9938</td></tr></table>

The linearity study data supports the claimed measuring range for the TCO2 assay of 5 – 50 mmol/L.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The analytical specificity of the i-STAT TCO2 assay on the i-STAT CHEM $^ { 8 + }$ (blue) cartridge was established following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-A2. Interference testing was conducted using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples prepared by tonometry to high and low levels of TCO2. The effect of each substance at each TCO2 level was evaluated by comparing the performance of a test sample spiked to a high concentration of the substance and a control sample spiked with an equal volume of solvent. A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference between the spiked test sample and the control was greater than the allowable error defined as the greater of $4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ or $10 \%$ of the mean TCO2 result for the control sample.

The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant interference was found.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

See section A.2 Linearity

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

# Traceability

The i-STAT test for TCO2 is metrologically traceable to the IFCC TCO2 reference method1 . Due to direct traceability to this TCO2 reference method, the CHEM $[ 8 +$ is independent of the pH and PCO2 traceability.

1 IFCC Reference Measurement Procedure for Substance Concentration Determination of Total Carbon Dioxide in Blood, Plasma or Serum. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2001; 39(3): 283- 289.

6. Detection Limit:

The detection limits are supported by the linearity study (please see section 2 above). In addition, a limit of quantitation (LoQ) study TCO2 on the i-STAT CHEM8+ Cartridge with the i-STAT 1 Analyzer was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The LoQ for TCO2 was evaluating using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples collected from a healthy subject each day. The samples were altered via tonometry and pH adjustment to levels below the lower limit of the reportable range and the TCO2 concentration was value assigned using a reference method. Each sample was measure in 15 replicates per day for four days across each of two i-STAT CHEM $^ { 8 + }$ (blue) cartridge lots for a total of 120 cartridges. The LoQ was calculated for each of the two lots. The sponsor defined LoQ as the greater of the two lots at which the lowest concentration met the predefined total error goal of $\leq 4 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . The LoQ was determined to be $4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , which is below the lower limit of the reportable range $( 5 - 5 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ .
