Dear Cesidio Tempesta:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

K110648 - Nova Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Blood Gas Analyzer

# Device Description:

The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer is a small, low cost blood electrolyte analyzer. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Optionally, it provides for reading of barcode labels (such as operator badges and data sheets).

The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer has an enhanced test menu and multiple quality control options. External Control Solutions (ampules) shall be offered, as well as an on-board Quality Management System (QMS), an electronic monitoring approach that insures the analyzer is working properly.

The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer can accommodate either of two sensor cards in the sensor card housing. The analyzer will determine the test configuration of the system by detecting which sensor card is installed.

The two options for the sensor card are:

Sensor Card 1 (Basic Electrolyte Panel plus Hct) shall enable and report the following listed analytes: Hct, Na, K, Cl   
Sensor Card 2(Full Electrolyte Panel plus pH & Hct) shall enable and report the following listed analytes: pH, Hct, Na, K, Cl, iCa, iMg

As with the predicates, the Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer is microprocessor-based and incorporates ion selective electrode technology to measure sodium, potassium, and chloride.

The Prime ES Comp Plus can be configured with an optional sample tray, which allows the user to run up to 10 consecutive samples. Tray samples may be any combination of Serum/Plasma or control solutions. Whole Blood samples may only be run in STAT Mode (not tray mode).

Calibration standards are provided in sealed pouches within a calibrator pack. Liquid quality control materials are available as external ampules. Sampling and calibration are fully automated.

The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer accepts lithium heparinized whole blood sample from syringes, open tubes, and small cups. The minimum sample sizes for analysis is $1 0 0 \mu \ L$ .

# Measured Parameters:

The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer measures $\mathsf { N a } +$ , $\mathsf { K } +$ , and Cl-.

# Intended Use:

The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer System is intended for in vitro diagnostic use by health care professionals in clinical laboratory settings for the quantitative determination of Sodium, Potassium, and Chloride in heparinized venous whole blood, plasma and serum.

# Indication for Use:

Sodium measurement is used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease, dehydration, or diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.

Potassium Measurement is used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high potassium levels.

Chloride measurement is used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.

# Summary of the Technological Characteristics:

The Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared for market Nova Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Blood Gas Analyzer System in intended use. It uses the same sensor technology and measurement algorithms, and the formulations of the external controls and the calibration cartridge are the same for the tested parameters. The linearity standards and External Control solutions for use with the Stat Profile Prime ES Comp Plus Analyzer are substantially equivalent to those cleared for use with the predicate Nova Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Blood Gas Analyzer System (K110648).
