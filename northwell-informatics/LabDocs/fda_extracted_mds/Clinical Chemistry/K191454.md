# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

# ATELLICA CH AMYLASE_2 (AMY-2)

The Atellica® CH Amylase_2 (AMY_2) assay is based on the procedure of Jensen and Wydeveld.1 The Atellica CH AMY_2 assay uses ethylidene blocked $p$ ‑nitrophenyl‑ maltoheptaoside as substrate. The indicator enzyme α‑glucosidase, used to release $p \cdot$ nitrophenol (PNP), is also employed in the assay. The terminal glucose of the substrate is chemically blocked, preventing cleavage by the indicator enzymes. The released $p$ ‑ nitrophenol is measured at 410/694 nm.

# Reaction Equation

# SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE TESTING

Assay performance comparison results for the Atellica® CH Amylase_2 (AMY_2) were obtained by processing the appropriate body fluids. Summary statistics for each are provided. These data demonstrate substantial equivalency of the Atellica® CH Amylase_2 (AMY_2) compared to the predicate device. The following data represent typical assay performance.

# DETECTION LIMIT

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.

Assessment of LoB was the 95th percentile of all values (sorted from lowest to highest), using non-parametric approach.

LoB Rank Position $= 0 . 5 + 0 . 9 5 ^ { \star } \mathsf { B }$ , where $\mathsf { B } =$ total reps $\scriptstyle = 2 4 0$ ; Rank $=$ 228.5

# LOQ

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for serum/plasma and urine was determined as described in CLSI EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures. Total Error is calculated using: $\mathsf { T E } = | \mathsf { b i a s } | + 2 ^ { \star } \mathsf { S D }$ .

For both serum/plasma and urine fluids, 4 low samples were processed on three reagent lots for three days, on one instrument for a total of 120 measurements per lot. For serum/plasma, the measured LoQ was $1 8 \cup / \mathsf { L }$ in support of the low end of the measuring interval of $2 0 ~ \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { L }$ for serum and plasma samples. For urine, the measured LoQ was $1 9 \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { L }$ in support of the low end of the measuring interval of $2 0 ~ \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { L }$ for urine samples. The LoQ claim of $2 0 \cup / \mathrm { L }$ for serum/plasma and urine are each based on a total of 120 determinations with a total error goal of $\leq 3 0 \%$ for serum/plasma specimens and $\leq 3 0 \%$ for urine specimens.

# LINEARITY

Linearity was evaluated with 9 samples which spanned the assay measuring interval for serum specimens and 9 samples which spanned the assay measuring interval for urine specimens. Each was prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples across the measurement interval as described in CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures. The high sample was prepared by spiking

native serum or urine pools with amylase. Low pools were created by diluting serum and urine samples with CH diluent. Five replicates were measured for each sample. The mean of these replicates was used for the calculations.

The assay was considered linear across the measuring interval if the p-values of nonlinear terms in the quadratic and cubic fit equations are nonsignificant $( \mathsf { p } > 0 . 0 5 )$ . If any of the aforementioned $\mathsf { p }$ -values are $\le 0 . 0 5$ , then linearity was determined via an allowable bias of $\leq 1 0 \%$ or $\leq 1 0 \cup / \mathrm { L }$ , whichever is greater, for the observed values vs. the linear fit. Linearity of the Atellica CH Amylase_2 (AMY_2) was demonstrated with both serum and urine specimens to encompass the measuring interval of 20 to 1500 $u / L$ for serum, plasma, and urine specimens.

# PRECISION

Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Precision was tested using ${ \mathsf n } = 2$ replicates, two times per day for at least 20 days for a total of 80 replicates per sample with controls, serum, plasma, and urine pools on one instrument. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP05-A3. The data are summarized in the following table.

# INTERFERENCES

CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, was followed for the interference testing. The interference study was conducted using a “paired difference worst case scenario” approach where these compounds were spiked into fresh sample pools containing either low or high levels of measurand in serum and urine pools.

Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference. Dilution studies were conducted to determine the level at which the spiked substance no longer displayed significant interference. Dilution studies were conducted at two analyte concentrations, if both sample pools show significant interference. This study was conducted as needed for both serum pools.

# METHOD COMPARISON

The predicate device selected for the method comparison study was the Roche Cobas Amylase (AMYL2) Reagent. Remnant de-identified samples were tested. No patient history information was obtained on these samples. Inclusion/exclusion data criteria are not applicable. The study included native and spiked samples to properly span the assay measuring interval.

These studies were conducted internally by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic Inc. R&D organization personnel, and externally by a contracted laboratory. The personnel conducting the study were laboratory technicians with training similar to personnel who would conduct the tests in a hospital laboratory setting. They were trained on the operation of both the device and the predicate device. A split sample method comparison, following CLSI EP09-A3, Measurement Procedure Comparision and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples, demonstrated good agreement between the Atellica® CH Amylase_2 (AMY_2) and the predicate Roche Cobas Amylase (AMYL2) assay with patient samples.

The results across the full assay intervals were analyzed using weighted Deming regression. For the serum method comparison, one replicate was processed on the Cobas while two replicates were processed on the Atellica. For the urine method comparison two replicates were processed for each sample on both systems. Only the first replicate results were used in statistical analysis. Indicated samples were spiked with pancreatic amylase to span the assay measuring interval.

# EXTENDED MEASURING INTERVAL

The Atellica® CH Amylase_2 assay parameters support both serum/plasma and urine extended ranges 3x the upper measuring interval.

Using CH Diluent, 3-fold manual dilutions of 5 serum and 5 urine pools were made. Both the undiluted and diluted pools were processed with $\ N { = } 4$ replicates; where the undiluted samples were auto-diluted on the Atellica CH system.

The serum/plasma and urine extended measuring interval is up to $4 5 0 0 \mathrm { \ U / L }$

# STANDARDIZATION

The Atellica® CH AMY_2 (AMY_2) assay is traceable to the IRMM/IFCC-456 reference material and commutable to the IFCC Alpha-Amylase Primary Reference Procedure as established by patient sample correlation.

Assigned values for calibrators are traceable to this standardization.

# CONCLUSION

The Atellica® CH Amylase_2 (AMY_2) is substantially equivalent to the Roche Cobas Amylase Reagent in principle and performance based on the similarity of device designs and function demonstrated through method comparison and other performance attributes.
