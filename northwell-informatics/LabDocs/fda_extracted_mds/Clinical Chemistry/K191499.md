10. Test Principle

The 25-OH VITAMIN D assay is a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay using FDA previously cleared MAGLUMI 2000 instrument (k162698).

The 25-OH Vitamin D assay is a two-incubation chemiluminescence immunoassay for the quantitative determination of total 25-OH vitamin D in human serum. In the first incubation, the 25-OH vitamin D is dissociated from its binding protein by the displacing reagent and binds to the 25-OH vitamin D antibody on the magnetic microbeads forming an antibodyantigen complex. Following a second incubation, the 25-OH Vitamin D labeled ABEI are added. The rest unbound material is removed during a wash cycle. Subsequently, the Starter $1 + 2$ are added to initiate a flash chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs), which is inversely proportional to the concentration of 25-OH Vitamin D present in the sample (or calibrator/control, if applicable).

b. Linearity

The linearity of the MAGLUMI 25-OH VITAMIN D method was determined following the CLSI EP6-A procedure. Eleven levels of linearity samples were prepared by blending a low serum sample pool and a high serum sample pool to span the whole measuring range with 25-OH VITAMIN D concentrations from 4.6 to $1 4 5 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each sample was measured in quadruple on 3 lots of reagent. Linearity was evaluated using regression analysis based on CLSI EP6-A.

The assays are linear between 4.6 and $1 4 5 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with the following relationship:

Observed $= 0 . 9 8 8 5$ (Expected) $+ 0 . 1 1 9 2$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 6$

c. Stability

Accelerated stability study at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ showed that all controls are stable for 12 months at 2- $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Accelerated stability study at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ showed all that calibrators are stable for 12 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Accelerated stability study at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ showed that the reagent is stable for 12 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The real time stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is on-going.

d. Detection Limit

Detection limit studies were performed following CLSI EP17-A guidelines. The limit of blank (LOB) is the 95th percentile value from 60 measurements of 25- OH VITAMIN D depleted serum samples using 3 different lots of 25-OH VITAMIN D reagents over 5 days. The LOB corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free samples are found with a probability of $9 5 \%$ and was determined to be $1 . 9 9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (highest of the 3 lots).

The limit of detection (LOD) is determined based on the LOB and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The LOD corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be detected. Four level of low samples were measured in 60 replicates over 5 days per sample using 3 lots of reagents. LOD was determined to be $3 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (highest of the 3 lots).

The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was determined by measuring six low serum samples, in six replicates per run, one run per day, over 5 days, using 3 lots of reagents. LOQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that can be

reproducibly measured with an intermediate precision CV of $\leq 2 0 \%$ and was determined to be $5 . 3 7 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (highest of the 3 lots).

e. Interference

A cross reactivity study was performed using two base serum samples containing total 25-OH VD $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ respectively. These samples were spiked with various cross reactants and measured for these solutions using 3 lots of reagents. The following table shows cross reactivity of potential cross reactant.

# 2. Comparison Studies

A method comparison study was performed with 241 human serum samples with   
concentrations ranging from 5.371 to $1 4 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The comparison of the MAGLUMI 25-OH   
VITAMIN D assay (y) with the predicate device, LIAISON 25-OH VITAMIN D total assay   
(x), produced the following   
linear regression equation:

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 1 3 \mathrm { X } - 0 . 5 0 4 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 7 3 9
$$

3. Expected values/Reference range:

A total of 302 serum samples from normal, apparently healthy adult (20 years and older) individuals were tested according to the procedure in CLSI C28-A3. The expected normal range is $9 . 9 9 - 4 9 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ based on the central $9 5 \%$ of the frequency distribution.

# 12. Conclusion

Based on the test principle and acceptable performance characteristics including precision, interference, specificity and method comparison of the device, it is concluded that the MAGLUMI 2000 25-OH VITAMIN D is substantially equivalent to the predicate.
