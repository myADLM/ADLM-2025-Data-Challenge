# Substantial Equivalence Information – Comparison of Predicate Device and Modified Device

Both the re-standardized ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) (Modified Device) and the current ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) (Predicate Device cleared under K151986) employ the same prepackaged reagents for use on automated test systems. The Intended Use / Indications for Use, assay principle, and reagent formulations are the same. The major differences between the Modified and Predicate devices are the re-standardization and change in reference interval data. However, despite these differences, the performance and accuracy of the Modified Device are substantially equivalent to that of the Predicate

Device. The method comparison study between the Modified Device and the Predicate Device demonstrate acceptable correlation between these assays. A comparison of these assays is shown in the following table:

# 10.5 Reference Intervals

Reference intervals for the ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII), ADVIA Centaur® SHBG and the Free Androgen Index (FAI) were obtained using samples from apparently healthy, normal adult females and males. The testosterone, SHBG, and FAI results provided in the tables below were obtained using results from the ADVIA Centaur® TSTII and ADVIA Centaur® SHBG. Central $90 \%$ reference intervals were established in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP28-A3c using a non-parametric approach for sample sizes of at least 120. For populations with a sample size of 40–119, the reference interval was calculated using an approach to accommodate the smaller sample size.

Central $90 \%$ reference intervals characterized by age and Tanner stage were established for the ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) for a pediatric population (children and adolescents) in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP28-A3c using a non-parametric approach for sample sizes of at least 120. For populations with a sample size of $< 1 2 0$ , the central $90 \%$ reference interval was calculated using an approach to accommodate the smaller sample size. Samples were collected prospectively from apparently healthy pediatric subjects (good   
endocrinological health) using predefined inclusion criteria.

# Performance Characteristics: ADVIA Centaur® SHBG

The change in reference intervals in the Instructions for Use (Package Inserts) for the ADVIA Centaur® SHBG that was cleared in 2016 under 510(k) K151986 does not require the collection of additional analytical performance data. Therefore, all analytical performance data previously reviewed for the ADVIA Centaur® SHBG continues to apply to this assay, because the assay was not modified. These performance data are cross-referenced to the 510(k) submission for the ADVIA Centaur® SHBG (K151986 and K091867).

Specifically, the following studies are not needed for the purpose of this submission:

• Detection Capability (LoB, LoD, LoQ)   
• Linearity   
• Precision   
• Dilution Recovery   
• Method Comparison   
• Calibrator/Assay Traceability   
• Reagent On-Board Stability and Calibration Interval   
• Cross reactivity   
• Interfering substances   
• Matrix Comparison   
• Shelf Life Stability Onboard Stability Open Vial Stability

# 12. Conclusions

Based on the results of comparative testing, the re-standardized ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) is substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the currently-marketed predicate device, the ADVIA Centaur® Testosterone II (TSTII) cleared under 510(k) K151986.

The ADVIA Centaur® SHBG with the new reference intervals in the Instructions for Use (package insert) is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed ADVIA Centaur® SHBG (K151986). The new reference intervals that will replace the current reference intervals in the Instructions for Use (Package Inserts) for the currently marketed assay do not require collection of additional analytical performance data.
