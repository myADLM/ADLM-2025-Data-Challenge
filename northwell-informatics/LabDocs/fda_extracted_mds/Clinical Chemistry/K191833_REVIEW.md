A Purpose for Submission: New Device   
B Measurand: Glucose in interstitial fluid   
C Type of Test: Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Dexcom G6 Pro Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom G6 Pro System) is a real time continuous glucose monitoring device indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 2 years and older in a home environment while under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The Dexcom G6 Pro System is intended to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions. Interpretation of the real-time Dexcom G6 Pro System results should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time.

The Dexcom G6 Pro System may also be used as a retrospective glucose recording device indicated for assessing glycemic variability in persons age 2 years and older in a home environment while under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Retrospective interpretation of data recorded by the Dexcom G6 Pro System should be conducted solely by a healthcare professional.

The Dexcom G6 Pro System aids in detecting glucose excursions facilitating care plan adjustments. The Dexcom G6 Pro System is also intended to interface with digitally connected devices. The Dexcom G6 Pro System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected medical devices for managing diabetes or assessing glycemic variability.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not Applicable

IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

G6 PRO CGM SENSOR

The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator, plastic base (“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable unit that contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the needle and inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and can be worn for up to 10 days.

The sensor may be worn in the abdomen for adults, and both the abdomen and buttock for children ages 2-17 years old.

# G6 PRO TRANSMITTER

The transmitter component is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data processing functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver for communication with a compatible display device (i.e., mobile device). The transmitter attaches to the sensor and can be re-used for multiple sensing sessions up to three months. The transmitter includes an autostart feature which enables the transmitter to start a session immediately upon attachment of the transmitter to the on-body wearable. The G6 Pro Transmitter can be used for retrospective CGM data logging and it can also send real-time estimated glucose values to a mobile application.

# G6 PRO MOBILE APP

The G6 CGM App for iOS and G6 CGM App for Android is the primary display system for the physician enabled, real-time users with a compatible, BLE-enabled smart device. The G6 CGM App is compatible with certain iOS, Android and Smart Device watches. A link to a list of compatible devices is included in the instructions for use.

The Dexcom G6 Pro CGM System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic interfaces. The G6 Glucose Program CGM system is designed to communicate with interoperable devices in several ways, such as described below:

• Wireless communication from the transmitter directly to an interoperable device communicating through the same protocol. The app communicates to another app on a single mobile platform. • The app communicates through the cloud to another software device.

# B Principle of Operation:

The G6 Pro system detects glucose levels from the fluid just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter then samples the electrical current produced by the sensor and converts these measurements into glucose readings using an onboard algorithm. The transmitter sends glucose data to the receiver and/or mobile app which displays the current glucose reading (updated every 5 minutes) and glucose trends (up to 12 hours) from the transmitter. The receiver and/or mobile app displays the current glucose reading and glucose trends to the user. It alerts the user when glucose levels are outside of a target zone and when other important system conditions occur. The G6 Pro System does not require calibrations using self-monitoring of

blood glucose (SMBG), and the sensor life has an expected wear time of up to 10 days. The system can be used for either a real-time or retrospective CGM session. A users Healthcare Professional (HCP) elects which type of CGM session the patient uses (retrospective vs. realtime). The G6 Pro Transmitter Firmware supports a single-use 10-day sensor session per transmitter.
