# Device Description

# 1.1. System

The cobas pro integrated solutions (cobas pro) is a fully automated, random-access, software controlled system intended for in vitro quantitative analysis of analytes in body fluids. It will typically be used in clinical laboratories with large workload. The system consolidates clinical chemistry, homogenous and heterogeneous immunoassays as well as electrolyte testing within one workplace. It consists of a high throughput sample distribution unit (core unit) and different analytical units for ISE (cobas pro ISE analytical unit), clinical chemistry (c 503 analytical unit) and immunoassay (e 801 analytical) testing. The system hardware is comprised of new or previously cleared members of the Roche/Hitachi cobas c or Elecsys families of analyzers. The instrument software is unique to the cobas pro and was developed from previous generations of Roche/Hitachi instrument systems.

# Instrument Description Information

a. Instrument Name: cobas pro integrated solutions   
b. Specimen Identification: The specimen is in a tube with a barcode label. The system identifies specimen by scanning the barcode.   
c. Specimen Sampling and Handling: The specimen is in a tube with the barcode label facing the side with the open slot of the rack. The rack is assigned with ID number and barcode.

# d. Calibration:

The software of the cobas pro integrated solution automatically recommends calibration for all tests requiring calibration. Calibration may also be ordered manually at any time. The software recommends calibrations according to the application parameters for the assay. The system checks the validity of each calibration automatically. If the calibration was successful, the calibrated tests are valid and the system continues operation. Calibration is specific to each analytical unit, measuring channel, and reagent.

The calibrators are loaded onto a 5-position calibrator rack and loaded onto the system. The system automatically recognizes the specially designated (black) calibration rack. The calibrator solutions are specific to the assay and identified in the method sheet of each assay. Multi-calibrator solutions are available to calibrate multiple applications. The available calibration modes are linear and non-linear full calibration, 1- and 2-point recalibration, and automatic full calibration. The calibration type differs depending on the reagent assay and is coded into the application parameter file for each reagent application and is described in the method sheet for each reagent assay application. The recommended calibration frequency is described in the method sheet for each reagent assay application.

# e. Quality Controls:

The system can be set up to recommend QC measurements based on test-specific timeout intervals. The method sheet for each assay used on the system contains QC recommendations for the specific application. The control intervals and limits should be adapted to each laboratory’s individual requirements. Values obtained should fall within the defined limits. Each laboratory should establish corrective measures to be taken if values fall outside the defined limits. Follow the applicable government regulations and local guidelines for quality control.

# 1.2. Reagent

# Glucose HK Gen.3

Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) specifically oxidizes G6-P to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH). One micromole of NADH is produced for each micromole of glucose consumed. The NADH produced absorbs light at 340 nm and can be detected spectrophotometrically as an increased absorbance.

The reagent working solutions include:

• R1 MES buffer: 5.0 mmol/L, pH 6.0; $\mathrm { M g } 2 +$ , 24 mmol/L; ATP, ≥ 4.5 mmol/L; NADP, ≥ $7 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ; preservative   
• R3 HEPES buffer: 200 mmol/L, pH 8.0; Mg2+, 4 mmol/L; HK (yeast), ≥ 300 μkat/L; G‑ 6‑ PDH (E. coli), $\geq 3 0 0$ μkat/L; preservative

# ISE indirect Na for Gen.2

The ISE module for $\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ employs ion-selective membrane to develop an electrical potential (electromotive force, EMF) for the measurements of ions in solution. Selective membrane is in contact with both the test solution and an internal filling solution. Due to the selectivity of the membrane, only the ions to be measured contribute to the EMF. The membrane EMF is determined by the difference in concentration of the test ion in the test solution and the internal filling solution.

The ISE analytical unit of the Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems is intended for the quantitative determination of sodium in serum, plasma or urine using ion‑ selective electrodes. Sodium is the major extracellular cation and functions to maintain fluid distribution and osmotic pressure. Some causes of decreased levels of sodium include prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, diminished reabsorption in the kidney and excessive fluid retention. Common causes of increased sodium include excessive fluid loss, high salt intake and increased kidney reabsorption.

ISE Auxiliary Reagents include:

• ISE Reference Electrolyte: $1 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ potassium chloride   
• ISE Diluent: HEPES buffer, $1 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ; Triethanolamine, 7 mmol/L; Preservative   
• ISE Internal Standard: HEPES buffer, $1 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ; Triethanolamine, 7 mmol/L; Sodium chloride, 3.06 mmol/L; Sodium acetate, 1.45 mmol/L; Potassium chloride, 0.16 mmol/L; Preservative

Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis IN 46250

• ISE Cleaning Solution: Sodium hydroxide solution, $3 \ \mathrm { m o l / L }$ with sodium hypochlorite solution $< 2 ~ \%$ active Cl   
• ISE Deproteinizer: Sodium hydroxide solution, approximately $1 . 2 \%$ active Cl   
• Electrodes: Sodium, Reference

# Assay Principle of Operation

# Glucose

The Glucose Hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by ATP.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate in the presence of NADP to gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. No other carbohydrate is oxidized. The rate of NADPH formation during the reaction is directly proportional to the glucose concentration and is measure photometrically.

# Sodium

An Ion‑ Selective Electrode (ISE) makes use of the unique properties of ion‑ selective membrane to develop an electrical potential (electromotive force, EMF) for the measurements of ions in solution. Selective membrane is in contact with both the test solution and an internal filling solution. Due to the selectivity of the membrane, only the ions to be measured contribute to the EMF. The membrane EMF is determined by the difference in concentration of the test ion in the test solution and the internal filling solution. The EMF develops and ion concentration is determined according to the Nernst equation.

# TSH

The TSH assay is based on the sandwich principle of competition. The total duration of the assay is 18 minutes.

• $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ incubation: $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample, a biotinylated monoclonal TSH‑ specific antibody and a monoclonal TSH‑ specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex react to form a sandwich complex.

• $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. • The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. • Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically generated by $2 ^ { - }$ point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode or $\mathbf { e } ^ { \scriptscriptstyle - }$ barcode.

# 4. NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The non-clinical performance studies for the Glucose HK, ISE indirect Na and Elecsys TSH are summarized below.

# 4.1. Precision

Precision was performed based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP05-A3. A summary of results for each assay is presented below.

# Glucose HK Gen.3: Repeatability and Intermediate Precision

The precision of the Glucose HK Gen.3 was evaluated on one cobas c 503 analytical unit with one reagent lot. The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each control (PreciControl ClinChem Multi 1 and PreciControl ClinChem Multi 2) and human serum per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days. The samples were run in randomized order on the analyzer. Human serum samples used were all native, single donors as well as pools. The protocol was repeated for urine and CSF applications. The Repeatability and Intermediate precision were calculated according to EP05-A3. All samples met the predetermined acceptance criterion. The data presented in the tables below is the worst precision result of the 3 lots.

# Elecsys TSH: Repeatability and Intermediate Precision

Precision of the Elecsys TSH assay was evaluated on one cobas e 801 immunoassay analyzer with one reagent lot. The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each control (PreciControl Universal and PC Thyro Sensitive) and human sera (HS) per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days. The samples were run in randomized order on the analyzer. Human serum samples used were all native, single donors as well as pools. Repeatability and Intermediate imprecision were calculated according to EP05-A3. All samples met the predetermined acceptance criterion. The following table summarizes the precision data for the Elecsys TSH.

# 4.2. Analytical Sensitivity

Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation were determined in accordance with the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) EP17 A2 requirements.

The Limit of Blank is the 95th percentile value from $\mathrm { n } \geq 6 0$ measurements of analyte‑ free samples over several independent series. The Limit of Blank corresponds to the concentration below which analyte‑ free samples are found with a probability of $9 5 \ \%$ . The Limit of Blank was determined on the respective analytical unit, six runs on $\geq$ three days, with five blank samples with two replicates each per run. In total, 60 determinations for analyte free samples have been obtained.

The Limit of Detection was determined based on the Limit of Blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The Limit of Detection corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be detected (value above the Limit of Blank with a probability of $9 5 \%$ ). The Limit of Detection was determined on the respective analytical unit, five samples with low-analyte concentration was measured in two-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days. In total 60 measurements were obtained per sample type.

LoQ determines the lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively determined with stated accuracy and stated experimental conditions. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte which can be quantified with a total error of no more than $20 \%$ (Glucose and TSH) and $30 \%$ (Sodium).

Samples with low analyte concentration are measured over 3 to 5 days on the respective analyzer $\mathrm { ~ n ~ } { \geq } 6 0$ per sample type). The mean value, SD, and $\% \mathrm { T E }$ (total error) were calculated for each sample. The mean concentration is plotted versus the $\% \mathrm { T E }$ , with LoQ determined at maximum allowable $\% \mathrm { T E }$ .

# Exogenous interference

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of exogenous interfering substances was determined at 125 and $1 5 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ for Serum and at 30 and $2 0 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ for Urine applications. Two sample pools, containing a low and high concentration of ISE indirect Na are used. These sample pools are divided into an appropriate number of aliquots. One aliquot is not spiked with the drugs and it is used as the reference sample for ISE indirect Na concentration. The ISE indirect Na concentration in the sample is determined with $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ measurements on a cobas pro ISE analytical unit.

The other sample aliquots, with either the high or low ISE indirect Na concentrations, are spiked with the respective amount of drug. The ISE indirect Na concentration of the spiked aliquots are determined in triplicate and the mean of the triplicate determinations is compared to the ISE indirect Na concentration determined for the reference aliquot (mean of $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ ).

# Elecsys TSH

The serum samples may contain substances that could potentially interfere with the test. The following compounds were added to human serum samples with a low (approximately 0.462 $\mu \mathrm { I U / m L } ,$ ), a mid (approximately $3 . 9 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) and a high (approximately $7 . 5 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) TSH concentration. One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance, another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic NaCl solution (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked) sample. None of the serum samples showed any deviation from the expected results. No interference was observed for these compounds at the levels indicated below.

# 4.6. Analytical Specificity/Cross-Reactivity

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of potential cross-reacting compounds using the Elecsys TSH was determined on the cobas e 801 analytical unit using a native human serum sample pool. For each potential cross-reacting compound a human serum sample with a low concentration level of TSH was tested. Results from these spiked serum samples were matched against the unspiked references and the $\%$ cross-reactivity was calculated. No cross reactivity was observed at the concentration tested.

# 4.7. Exogenous Interferences – Drugs

The effect on quantitation of TSH in the presence of drugs was determined by comparing values obtained from samples spiked with 17 commonly and 13 specially used pharmaceutical compounds with the reference sample (unspiked). Two human serum samples (native serum pools) with analyte concentration approximately 0.5 and $8 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ were used and tested on the cobas e

801 analytical unit. The drug concentrations tested correspond at least to the three times maximum daily doses (or the one-time maximum daily dose, respectively). Drug interferences are measured based on recommendations given in CLSI guidelines EP07-ED3 and EP37-ED1 and other published literature. For all drugs tested, the specification of $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the reference value was met as each compound was found to be non-interfering at the drug concentration.

# ISE indirect Na

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the ISE indirect Na was determined by comparing values obtained from samples drawn into serum and Li-Heparin plasma tubes. A total of 50 serum/ Li-Heparin plasma pairs per sample material were tested in singleton with one reagent lot on one cobas pro ISE analytical unit. Data were evaluated using a regression analysis according to Passing/Bablok.

# Elecsys TSH

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys TSH immunoassay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples (native human serum samples, single donors as well as pools) drawn into serum and Li-Heparin, $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA, $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma tubes. A minimum of 56 serum/plasma pairs per sample material were tested in singleton with one reagent lot on one cobas e 801 analyzer. Data were evaluated using a regression analysis according to Passing/Bablok. Serum separation tubes from 3 separate manufacturers and blood from five donors were used. Measurements were performed in duplicate with one reagent lot and evaluated on the basis of recovery relative to the serum / plasma tube without separating gel (reference).
