Dear Mari Meyer:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

# 5. Regulatory Information:

LIAISON® Vitamin B12

Regulation Section: 21 CFR 862.1810   
Classification: Class II   
Product Code: CDD   
Panel: Clinical Chemistry (75)

# 6. Predicate Device(s):

The predicate device used to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay is the Beckman Coulter Access Vitamin B12 assay previously FDA cleared under (K140496).

# 7. Device Description:

The LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay is a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for quantitative determination of Vitamin B12 is serum, SST serum and lithium heparin plasma. During the first incubation, Vitamin B12 is dissociated from its binding protein. After the initial incubation of 10.5 minutes, Vitamin B12 binds to an intrinsic factor on the solid phase. After a second incubation of 10.5 minutes, a Vitamin B12 linked to an isoluminol derivative is added to compete with the Vitamin B12 in the sample. After a third incubation of 5.25 minutes, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added to initiate a flash chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely proportional to the concentration of Vitamin B12 present in calibrators, controls, or samples.

# 8. Intended Use:

The DiaSorin LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology for the quantitative determination of Vitamin B12 in human serum, SST serum and lithium heparin plasma. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of anemia’s of gastrointestinal malabsorption. Assay results should be used in conjunction with other clinical or laboratory data to assist the clinician in making individual patient management decisions.

The assay must be performed on the LIAISON® XL Analyzer.

# 9. Indication(s) for Use:

Same as Intended Use

Reference Range   
It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own range of expected values for the population taken into consideration.

Section 5   

<table><tr><td>Population (n=166)</td><td>Median</td><td>Observed Range 2.5th to 97.5th Percentile</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>318.5 (pg/mL)</td><td>107.2 pg/mL - 653.3 pg/mL</td></tr></table>

Prospectively collected serum samples from 166 apparently healthy adults aged 21-59 who had been fasting for at least 8 hours were obtained. Apparently healthy status of the adults were determined by the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria listed below. Samples were collected, centrifuged and removed from cells within 2 hours. Once serum was removed from the cells, the sample was frozen immediately and stored at $\yen 70 ^ { \circ } C$ in order to maintain integrity. Samples were shipped frozen and kept frozen until tested.

To assess the expected reference range for the LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay, a study was performed with serum samples from 166 apparently healthy adults aged 21 - 59 years of age from mixed ethnic backgrounds $3 0 \%$ Caucasian, $31 \%$ African Americans, $39 \%$ Hispanics) who were fasting for at least 8 hrs. Apparently healthy status was determined by subjects who had no history of anemias, Folic acid or B12 deficiency, IBD or suspected IBD, celiac disease, gastrointestinal malabsorption disorders, or eating disorders. No oral contraceptive use within 3 months, and no alcohol within 48 hrs of blood draw or excessive alcohol usage. No pregnant women or anyone taking B12 supplementation were included in the study population.

Based on the $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval, the following values were established following CLSI guideline C28-A3.

# Precision

One (1) lot of kit controls and six (6) serum samples spanning the range of the assay measuring range were tested twice per day in duplicate, over 20 operating days using one (1) reagent lot at DiaSorin Inc. The testing was performed according to CLSI EP5- A3.

# Linearity

One (1) high sample of each specimen type (serum, SST serum, lithium heparin plasma) containing endogenous and/or spiked Vitamin B12 above the measuring range of the assay at $1 5 0 0 ~ { \mathsf { p g / m l } }$ was diluted and tested by the LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay following CLSI EP6-A. The results for each sample were analyzed by regression of observed concentration versus expected concentration.

The resulting equations for each sample type are: Serum: Observed Vitamin $\mathsf { B } 1 2 = 1 . 0 7 6 \mathsf { x } + 6 . 8 9 6$ ; $\mathsf { R } = 0 . 9 9 8$ SST Serum: Observed Vitamin $\mathsf { B } 1 2 = 1 . 0 0 9 \mathsf { x } + 0 . 2 2 4$ ; $\mathsf { R } = 0 . 9 9 9$ Lithium Heparin plasma: Observed Vitamin $\mathsf { B } 1 2 = 1 . 0 2 9 \mathsf { x } - \ 0 . 0 9 5 ; \mathsf { R } = 0 . 9 9 6$

# Recovery Study

Five (5) high concentration (endogenous or spiked) serum samples and five (5) low concentration serum samples were analyzed neat. Recovery samples were then prepared by mixing defined ratios of the high and low samples and tested in replicates of five (5).
