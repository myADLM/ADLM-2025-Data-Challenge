Magnetic particles - coated with Intrinsic Factor in phosphate buffer, stabilizers and preservatives; $2 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$   
• Calibrator 1 - Vitamin B12 free human serum containing cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12), and preservatives; $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$   
• Calibrator 2 - Vitamin B12 free human serum containing cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12), and preservatives; $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ Conjugate - Proprietary polymer conjugated with Vitamin B12 and an isoluminol derivative, in MES buffer with surfactant and preservatives; $1 2 \mathrm { m L }$ Assay Buffer 1 – Glycine buffer containing TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine) and preservatives; $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$   
• Assay Buffer 2 – Potassium hydroxide buffer containing $0 . 0 5 \%$ potassium cyanide and preservatives; $1 2 ~ \mathrm { m L }$

• Assay Buffer 3 – Potassium phosphate with dicyanocobinimide, surfactant and preservatives; $2 2 \mathrm { m L }$

# B Principle of Operation:

The LIAISON® Vitamin B12 assay is a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for quantitative determination of Vitamin B12 in serum, SST serum and lithium heparin plasma. During the first incubation, Vitamin B12 is dissociated from its binding protein. After the initial incubation of 10.5 minutes, Vitamin B12 binds to an intrinsic factor on the solid phase. After a second incubation of 10.5 minutes, a Vitamin B12 linked to an isoluminol derivative is added to compete with the Vitamin B12 in the sample. After a third incubation of 5.25 minutes, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added to initiate a flash chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely proportional to the concentration of Vitamin B12 present in samples.

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A 20-day reproducibility/precision study was performed following CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Testing was performed using a coded panel comprised of 6 serum samples, spanning the assay range was tested, along with the LIAISON® Vitamin B12 kit controls (2 levels). Each sample was tested in duplicate per run in two separate runs per day, over 20 operating days $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ). The results are summarized in the below table.

2. Linearity:

One sample of each specimen type (serum, SST serum, lithium heparin plasma) containing endogenous and/or spiked Vitamin B12 above the measuring range of the assay at $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ was diluted with a low-level sample to create 13 evenly distributed concentrations spanning the measuring range $( < 5 0 \mathrm { \textrm { -- } } 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ ). Each sample was tested in duplicate following CLSI EP06-A guideline. The results for each sample were analyzed by regression of observed concentration (y) versus expected concentration $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { x } )$ . The regression results are summarized below for each sample type:

Serum: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 7 6 \mathrm { x } + 6 . 8 9 6$ ; $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 8$ SST Serum: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 9 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 2 2 4$ ; $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 9$ Lithium Heparin plasma: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 9 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 9 5 ; \mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 6$

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference testing was conducted following CLSI-EP07-A2 guideline. Potential interfering substances were spiked to serum samples with normal and high level of Vitamin B12 (200 and $8 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ). The same samples without interferent but containing the “vehicle” were tested as controls. Interference was defined as more than $10 \%$ difference between the spiked and the un-spiked samples.

The substances and the highest concentrations tested without interference are summarized in the below table:

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Drug/Substance</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Concentration Tested</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hemoglobin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">300 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Bilirubin (conjugated)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Bilirubin (unconjugated)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Triglycerides</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3,000 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Cholesterol</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">500 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Albumin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12 g/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Human IgG</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12 g/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">HAMA</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1387.5 ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Rheumatoid Factor</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1035 IU/mL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Acetaminophen</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Acetylsalicylic Acid</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">65 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ibuprofen</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Biotin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 mg/mL</td></tr></table>

Under the limitations of the procedure in the labeling, the sponsor listed the substances that are known to interfere with the assay:

Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins or other reagent material, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals, animal serum products, or other immunogenic products that may elicit heterophilic antibody production against the assay’s reagents can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed. Approximately $50 \%$ of patients with pernicious anemia have Intrinsic factor antibodies. During the reaction, the denaturation should inactivate intrinsic factor blocking antibodies. However, any remaining anti-intrinsic factor antibody or extremely high titer of the intrinsic factor antibody could cause erroneous results.

# Cross-reactivity

Cross-reactivity was evaluated following CLSI-EP07-A2 guideline. The $\%$ cross reactivity is calculated as follows: $\%$ cross reactivity $=$ (Corrected Assay Value/ Cross-reactant Concentration) $\ast 1 0 0$ .

The result is summarized in the below table.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cross-Reactant</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Spiked Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Cross Reactivity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Dicyanocobinamide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10,000pg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.19%</td></tr></table>

4. Assay Reportable Range: 55-1500 pg/mL

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability   
The LIAISON® Vitamin B12 Calibrators are traceable to an in-house standard preparation of Vitamin B12 $\mathrm { ( p g / m L ) }$ .

6. Detection Limit:

FTo determine the limit of blank (LoB), five blank samples were tested using 2 lots of reagent on 1 analyzer by two operators. Each sample was run in 2 replicates /run for 6 runs on three days yielding 60 results per reagent lot.

LoB was calculated as: $\operatorname { L o B } = \mu \left( \mathrm { B l a n k } \right) + 1 . 6 5 3 \mathrm { \Omega ^ { \ast } \sigma ( B l a n k ) }$

FThe limit of detection (LoD), was determined by testing four samples in the range of approximately 25 to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ on 2 analyzers using two reagent lot by two operators. Each sample was tested in 2 replicates per run for over 6 runs over 3 days (yielding a minimum of 96 results).

LoD was calculated for each lot as: $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 5 ^ { \ast }$ σs (Low Sample)

For limit of quantitation (LoQ), eight samples (4 of which were used in the LoD determination) in the range of 25 to approximately $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ were tested using 2 reagent lots on 2 analyzers by 2 operators. Each sample was tested in 2 replicates per run for 6 runs over 3 days, yielding a minimum of 144 results. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which the regression line crosses the $20 \%$ CV line and was calculated for each of the reagent lots using a curve fit best suited to the data set.

The claimed LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized in the below table using the highest concentration resulted from the different lots tested.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38.7 pg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51.2 pg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>55 pg/mL</td></tr></table>
