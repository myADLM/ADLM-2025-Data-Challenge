# I. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Tosoh ST AIA PACK BNP assay is designed for IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY for the quantitative measurement of BNP in human (K2EDTA) plasma on Tosoh AIA System Analyzers. BNP is used as an aid in the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with clinical suspicion of new onset HF, acutely decompensated or exacerbated HF.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Tosoh AIA System Analyzers

# J. Device Description:

The ST AIA-PACK BNP is a two-site immunoenzymometric assay which is performed entirely in the ST AIA-PACK BNP test cups. BNP present in the test sample is bound with monoclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody. The magnetic beads are washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional to the BNP concentration in the test sample. A standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated using the curve.

# ST AIA-PACK BNP (Cat. No. 025228)

The ST AIA-PACK BNP set consists of 5 trays $\times 2 0$ test cups. Each kit contains plastic test cups containing twelve magnetic lyophilized beads coated with anti-BNP mouse monoclonal antibody and $1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { \mu L }$ of anti-BNP mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase with sodium azide as a preservative.

# M. Test Principle:

The ST AIA-PACK BNP is a two-site immunoenzymometric assay which is performed entirely in the ST AIA-PACK BNP test cups. BNP present in the test sample is bound with monoclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody. The magnetic beads are washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methyllumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional to the BNP concentration in the test sample. A standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated using this curve.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

There is currently no known internationally recognized consensus reference method or reference material for standardization. BNP assay values are expressed as $\mathsf { p g } / \mathsf { m L }$ . The ST AIA-PACK BNP CALIBRATOR SET contains assigned concentrations of BNP. The assigned value is determined on a lot-by-lot basis and is designed to provide an assay calibration range of 4.0 to $2 , 0 0 0 \ p \mathsf { g / m L }$ of BNP. The calibrators in this set are prepared gravimetrically and are compared to internal reference standards.

# Stability:

The stability data supports the current shelf life assignment for the ST AIA-PACK BNP of 12 months.

# Expected Values:

d. Detection limit:

The CLSI Guideline EP17-A entitled: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline was used to design the LoD and LoQ study.

Eleven low level samples selected from concentrations in the range from 1.341 to $1 7 . 0 0 9 \ : \mathsf { p g / m L }$ (LoB to 4x LoB) were prepared by dilution of specimens with known BNP concentrations. The samples were assayed in replicates of two (2) over five (5) days on one instrument for a total of ten (10) replicates per sample. The standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation $( \mathsf { C V } \% )$ were calculated

LoQ was calculated as the functional sensitivity at $20 \%$ CV. To determine the functional sensitivity, a precision profile was plotted using the values of $C V \%$ and the mean concentration of the samples in $\mathsf { p g } / \mathsf { m L }$ from the LoD study.

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \mathsf { L o B } = 0 . 9 \mathsf { p g / m L } } \\ { \mathsf { L o D } = 1 . 9 \mathsf { p g / m L } } \\ { \mathsf { L o Q } = 3 . 5 \mathsf { p g / m L } . } \end{array}
$$

3. Clinical studies:

This study was conducted to determine the performance of the ST AIA-PACK BNP assay at the current cutoff of BNP at $1 0 0 p { \mathsf { g } } / { \mathsf { m L } }$ as recommended in the American Heart Association guidelines for acute heart failure (HF). Additional analysis was conducted to determine performance of the assay by gender and age. Performance was analyzed separately among patients with and without comorbidities. Statistics were performed between these sub-groups to determine if there were any significant differences in performance.

The prospective study enrolled male and female patients from 8 clinical sites comprised of Emergency Departments (ED). The study included patients who were presented to the ED with clinical suspicion of new onset HF, acutely decompensated or exacerbated HF, where a clinician would order a BNP test as part of a differential diagnosis. Patient samples were stored at $\mathsf { - } 2 0 \mathsf { \circ C }$ or colder then sent to a central location for testing at a Tosoh Bioscience lab. A total of 825 samples were assayed for BNP using the Tosoh AIA 2000 Analyzer. Out of the 825 samples, a total number of 724 samples were used for the analysis. 101 samples were excluded from the analysis. Most of these exclusions were due to hemolysis and patients with severe renal insufficiency requiring dialysis (estimated glomerular filtration rate $( \mathsf { e G F R } ) \ < \ 3 0$ $\mathsf { m L } / \mathsf { m i n } / 1 . 7 3 \mathsf { m } 2 )$ : Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 4 and 5.

The participants in this study were categorized into the following races: White $( \mathsf { n } { = } 4 8 3 , \mathsf { 6 6 } . 7 \% )$ , Black $\scriptstyle ( 1 = 1 4 4$ , $1 9 . 9 \% $ ) and other $\scriptstyle { \mathtt { n } } = 9 7$ , $1 3 . 3 \% \AA )$ ). The population tested was fairly balanced with respect to females $\scriptstyle ( \mathsf { n } = 3 2 7 )$ versus males $\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 3 9 7 )$ and older $( \mathsf { a g e } \ge 7 5 $ years, $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { n } } = 2 4 7$ ) versus younger (age $< 7 5$ years, $\mathsf { n } \equiv 4 7 7$ ) subjects. Below is the Age Demographics for Evaluable Subjects.

Diagnosis of HF or non- HF was determined by an independent central adjudication panel in order to ensure standardization and accuracy of diagnosis per 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for Management of HF.

The adjudication panel (comprised of 4 expert cardiologists and 1 ER physician) had access to patient CRFs and clinical information, including but not limited to, echocardiography, and other cardiac and thoracic imaging, and standard of care BNP or B-type Natriuretic Peptide, N-terminal Pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) results, if available.

The adjudication panel was blinded to the attending physician’s final diagnosis and NYHA classification.

# Patients with Heart Failure (HF)

Among the 724 subjects who presented to the ED, 329 patients were determined to have HF by the adjudication panel. All of the patients with HF in the study were categorized utilizing the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification system. The NYHA is a four-stage assessment tool that classifies the stage of heart failure based on the subjective observation of a patient’s clinical signs and symptoms. It is based on the patient’s limitations in physical activity, difficulty with regard to breathing, and angina pain. Below is a description of the classification tool.

# Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)

The utility of BNP as a diagnostic marker for HF is described in multiple reports in the scientific literature. Data from the clinical study was used to generate the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of BNP decision thresholds versus the clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity as shown in Figure 1. The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.881.
