# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

MAGLUMI 2000 HCG/ $\beta$ -HCG assay kit consists of the following:

Magnetic microbeads coated with anti-hCG monoclonal antibody, containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sodium azide.

Buffer containing BSA and sodium azide for sample dilution.

Anti-hCG monoclonal antibody labeled with N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI), containing BSA and sodium azide.

Calibrator Low- HCG antigen, containing BSA and sodium azide.

Calibrator High- HCG antigen, containing BSA and sodium azide.

Control 1- hCG antigen, containing BSA and sodium azide.

Control 2- hCG antigen, containing BSA and sodium azide.

# B Principle of Operation:

The MAGLUMI $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { H C G / \beta }$ -HCG assay is an immunoassay run on the MAGLUMI 2000 Immunoassay Analyzer (cleared under k162698). The assay methodology is a sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay. The sample is mixed with magnetic microbeads coated with anti-hCG monoclonal antibody, and then incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The microbead bound immunocomplex is washed to separate the unbound phase. Labeled anti-hCG monoclonal

antibody is added to form a sandwich complexes. A second wash step is conducted, and followed by addition of a reagent to initiate the chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier tube and is proportional to the concentration of total $\beta$ -hCG (intact hCG and free $\beta$ -hCG) present in the sample.

2. Linearity:

A linearity study was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP6-A.

Low range linearity was established by assaying 11 samples of varying concentration (0.33 to $2 8 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ that were each prepared by a dilution scheme of mixing known volumes of reference material (WHO 5th International Standard) and hCG free serum.

High range linearity was established by assaying 10 samples of varying concentration (260 to $4 6 8 0 \ : \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ that were each prepared by a dilution scheme of mixing known volumes of reference material (WHO $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard) and hCG free serum.

Each sample was measured in replicates of 4 using three instruments and three reagents lots. The recovery at each concentration was calculated relative to the expected concentration based on the dilution. All recoveries ranged from $9 0 . 1 \%$ to $109 \%$ . A regression analysis was conducted with the following linear regression lines supporting the claimed analytical measurement range of $1 . 1 3 - 4 6 8 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

# High Dose Hook Effect

A high dose hook effect study was conducted to assess the highest hCG concentration along the dose response curve where the reported results are not impacted by conditions of antigen excess. In the study, six samples with total $\beta$ -hCG concentrations from 5,000 to 1,000,000 mIU/mL were prepared by spiking reference material (WHO $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard) into hCG free serum. Each sample was measured in duplicates across each of 3 lots. The study found no evidence of a high dose hook effect for total $\beta$ -hCG concentrations up to 1,000,000 mIU/mL.

# Dilution study

A dilution study was conducted to establish a range in hCG concentrations which are accurately reported following dilution. The product labeling identifies that samples with hCG concentrations above the measuring range can be diluted either automatically by the analyzer or manually using diluent (buffer containing BSA and sodium azide from the kit) and the recommended dilution is 1:50. After dilution by the analyzer, the analyzer software automatically takes the dilution into account when reporting the hCG concentration. In the study, 12 serum samples were prepared by spiking reference material (WHO $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard) into hCG free serum and covering an hCG concentration from $4 4 7 5 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ to $2 2 3 , 7 5 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . Each of the 12 sample was individually diluted (manually and automated) samples 5 times and then assayed using 3 reagent lots on 3 instruments in two replicates for each lot and instrument. The results demonstrated that all individual dilution recoveries for both manual and automated dilution were between $9 0 . 0 \%$ and $1 1 0 . 0 \%$ .

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The analytical specificity performance of the MAGLUMI $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { H C G } / \beta$ -HCG assay was established by conducting interference testing. Interference from potentially cross reacting substances, certain exogenous and endogenous substances were assessed using serum samples spiked to three total hCG concentrations of 6.0, 100, and $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . Each sample was divided into two aliquots: test (with added interferent) and control (with no added interferent), and measured in triplicates across each of 3 lots. Bias in the results was analyzed by comparing the test sample quantitation to the control. The sponsor defined no significant interference as a bias within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . The following table lists the concentration of each substance at which no significant interference was found in the study.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability   
The MAGLUMI $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { H C G } / \beta$ -HCG method has been standardized against WHO 5th International Standard 07/364.

6. Detection Limit:

The detection limit of the MAGLUMI $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { H C G } / \beta$ -HCG was established by evaluation of the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ).

LoB

The LoB was estimated following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2 and derived from the 95th percentile from non-parametric distribution of replicate measurements of a blank sample. In the study, a blank sample comprised of hCG negative serum was measured using 3 reagent lots and one instrument. For each lot, the sample was measured in replicates of 16 per run over 5 days for a total of 80 measurements per lot. The higher of the three LoB values from each lot is taken as the LoB concentration; $0 . 3 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

# LoD

The LoD was estimated following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2. In the study four low concentration samples $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ to $1 . 6 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ) were prepared near the expected LoD by spiking reference material (WHO $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard) into hCG free serum. Each of the four samples was measured using three reagents lots. For each lot, the samples were measured in replicates of 16 per run over 5 days using one instruments for a total of 80 measurements per lot. The higher of the three LoD values from each lot is taken as the LoD concentration; $0 . 4 7 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

#

The LoQ was estimated following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2. In the study six low concentration samples $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ to $5 . 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ) were prepared near the expected LoQ by spiking reference material (WHO $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard) into hCG free serum. Each of the six samples was measured using three reagents lots. For each lot, the samples were measured in replicates of 6 per run over 5 days using one instruments for a total of 30 measurements per lot. The LOQ of each reagent lot was derived as the lowest concentration of which percent bias is less than $1 5 \%$ and $C V \%$ is less than $20 \%$ . The higher of the three LoQ values from each lot was taken as the LoQ; $1 . 1 3 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .
