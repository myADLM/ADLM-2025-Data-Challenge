# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur Cortisol (COR) assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2-point calibration and a master curve with the reagent bar code.

The ADVIA Centaur COR reagent kit contains the following: ADVIA Centaur ReadyPack $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ primary reagent pack contains Lite Reagent and Solid Phase Reagent. Lite reagent consists of $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ reagent pack with cortisol labeled with acridinium ester in buffered saline with sodium salicylate $( { \sim } 5 0 \mathrm { \ m g / m L } )$ , sodium azide $( 0 . 1 \% )$ and preservatives. Solid phase reagent consists of $1 2 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ reagent pack with rabbit anti-cortisol antibody $( \mathord { \sim } 1 . 1$ $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ bound to monoclonal mouse anti-rabbit IgG antibody $( { \sim } 5 6 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in buffered saline with sodium azide $( 0 . 1 \% )$ and preservatives.

# B Principle of Operation:

The ADVIA Centaur Cortisol (COR) assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology. Cortisol in the patient sample competes with acridinium ester labeled cortisol in the Lite Reagent for binding to polyclonal rabbit anti-cortisol antibody in the Solid Phase. The polyclonal rabbit anti-cortisol antibody is bound to monoclonal mouse antirabbit antibody, which is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase. An inverse relationship exists between the amount of cortisol present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the instrument.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: Previously established in k142723.

2. Linearity: Previously established in k142723.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference testing was conducted according to CLSI EP07-ed3: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Interfering substances were tested using human K2-EDTA and heparin pools. Various concentration of interferents were spiked into one pool at low and one at high cortisol concentrations for each matrix. The same sample pools with no interferents were used as controls. All samples were run in triplicate using ADVIA Centaur XP instrument and one reagent lot. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as $\leq 1 0 \%$ difference between the spiked samples and control. Results are summarized below.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device: Previously established in k142723.

A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate sample equivalence between serum and plasma (K2-EDTA and lithium heparin). Matched sample sets were tested using one ADVIA Centaur (COR) assay reagent lot and one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument. One replicate was tested for each sample. A total of 83 dipotassium EDTA plasma/serum and 99 lithium heparin plasma/serum sample pairs were tested. Deming linear regression analysis was used to analyze measured values using serum as the comparator. The results are shown in the table below.
