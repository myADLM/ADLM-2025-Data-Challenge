II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: Modification to an existing device   
B Measurand: Not applicable   
C Type of Test: Saliva Collection for DNA testing

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx is intended for use in the non-invasive collection of saliva samples for in vitro diagnostic testing of human DNA. Saliva may be collected by spitting directly into the Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx container or may be transferred into the Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx container using a sponge. Saliva samples may be collected by a healthcare professional or non-healthcare professional, such as a lay user. Saliva samples collected using Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx are stabilized and isolated for use in downstream diagnostic testing applications. Saliva samples collected using Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx can be transported and/or stored long term at ambient conditions.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

OTC - Over The Counter

Device manufacturers must validate the use of Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx for use with their device.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

None.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx (models OGD-500, OGD-510, OGD-575, OGD-600, OGD-610, and OGD-675) consists of a saliva collection tube with a funnel lid attached that contains a stabilizing liquid. Saliva is delivered directly by expectorating into the collection tube. A small cap is provided to close the tube for transport and storage. The difference in the six models is the amount and/or concentrations of the reagents in the tube, which vary because of the difference in the amount of saliva collected. The ratio of final sample to stabilizing liquid volume remains the same. The 600-series (OGD-600 and OGD-610) differs from the 500-series (OGD-510, and OGD-500) in labeling only (600 series labeling is in English only). The OGD-575 and OGD-675 models include a sponge for assisted collection of saliva.

Oragene-Dx can be used with both prescription use only and over-the-counter molecular diagnostic test systems.

# B Principle of Operation:

Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx collects and stabilizes human DNA from saliva; it can also be used for the transportation and long‐term room temperature storage of a sample. Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx is a noninvasive alternative for collecting DNA for use with molecular diagnostic applications.

The collection device (all models) consist of a collection tube with a funnel lid attached that contains a stabilizing liquid. Saliva is delivered directly by spitting into the collection tube. After saliva is collected, the stabilizing liquid is mixed with the sample. A small cap is provided to close the tube for transport and storage (funnel with lid is removed and discarded). Upon contacting saliva cells, the stabilizing liquid lyses cellular and nuclear membranes to release and stabilize nucleic acids. Samples can be immediately processed, transported or stored for future use.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the Oragene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx collection device was established in k110701 and k141410.

2. Linearity: Not applicable.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):

Evaluation of lay user collection and labeling comprehension: A study to evaluate the lay user collection and labeling comprehension of the Oragene•Dx OGD-610 model was performed by over the counter users. The study consisted of 206 subjects 18 years or older and the demographics were representative of the US population. Participants independently collected a saliva sample at home using the instructions for use, answered the user comprehension questionnaire, and mailed both components according to the study instructions. Upon receipt at the testing laboratory, each study sample was assessed for compliance to collection instructions, sample volume, DNA concentration, and sequencing quality control metrics. User comprehension of test instructions, including comprehension of sample collection instructions was also assessed.

Of the samples evaluated, $9 7 . 3 5 \%$ contained the minimum amount of DNA required for testing after DNA extraction. Samples from two individuals were re-extracted from a second aliquot, for a total of $9 8 . 4 1 \%$ containing the minimum amount of DNA required for testing, demonstrating that customers were able to follow sample collection instructions in an over the counter setting to obtain adequate sample for testing.

A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the collection device labeling in k141410. Lay user collection and labeling comprehension for the Oragene•Dx OGD-500.001 device, when used with the over-the-counter 23andMe PGS Carrier Screening Test, was previously evaluated in k141410.
