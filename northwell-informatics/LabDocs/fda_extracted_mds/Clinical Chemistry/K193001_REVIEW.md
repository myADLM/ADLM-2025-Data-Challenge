# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision was determined based on recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3 guideline.

Within run precision was established by testing two human serum-based control samples and one human serum sample pool. Each sample was tested in 20 replicates per run, for 3 runs for a total of 60 replicates per sample. Testing was performed on one AU680 Automatic analyzer using 3 reagent lots. The results for one representative lot are summarized in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean (g/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>21.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.4</td></tr></table>

Within-laboratory precision was established by testing one human serum pool and two human serum-based control samples. Testing was performed for 20 days, 2 runs per day, 2 replicates per run for a total of 80 replicates per sample and a total of 240 total replicates. Testing was performed on one AU680 Automatic analyzer using four lots of reagents.

The results for one representative lot are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean (g/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total %CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>26.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.6</td></tr></table>

2. Linearity:

The linearity studies were performed following the CLSI EP06-A guideline. The studies were performed on one AU680 analyzer using serum samples spiked with human albumin. Low and high concentration pools were mixed and serial dilution samples $( \mathrm { N } { = } 1 2$ ) were prepared and tested in triplicate. The results from each of three reagent lots were compared to expected values. All three lots yielded similar results. The results of the linear regression analysis from one representative lot run are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample range tested(g/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Claimed measuring range(g/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.2 - 78.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.999</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.0 -70.0</td></tr></table>

The linear regression results support the claimed measuring range.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference studies were performed according to the CLSI EP07 guideline.

Two serum pools were created with albumin concentrations of $3 5 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ and $5 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ , which were spiked with potentially interfering substances. Results from the spiked samples were compared to results from the same serum sample pools without addition of the potential interferents (control samples). Significant interference was defined as more than $\pm 1 0 \%$ bias from the test results of the spiked sample when compared to the control sample. The following substances did not cause interference at the concentrations listed below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interferent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Highest concentration tested that didnot cause significant interference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2000 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Unconjugated bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>66 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Conjugated bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>66 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lipids (triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1200 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

The sponsor includes the following limitations for potential interferences in their labeling:

CMPF (3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid) present in sera of patients with renal failure has been reported to give falsely low albumin values. Negative bias of approximately $10 \%$ has been observed on samples from patients undergoing hemodialysis. Samples from patients with elevated serum creatinine levels, or undergoing treatment with peritoneal dialysis, were unaffected.

4. Assay Reportable Range: 6.0 – 70.0 g/L

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): The assay is traceable to ERM-DA 470k Reference Material.

6. Detection Limit:

Detection limit studies for were evaluated based upon CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.

Limit of blank (LoB) studies were performed by testing 4 blank samples. Samples were tested in replicates of 5 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents for a total of 60 results per lot. LoB was defined as the highest result that can reasonably be expected from a blank sample for a given error probability with $\mathtt { q } { = } 0 . 0 5$ . The highest LoB of the three lots is reported as the LoB in the labeling.

Limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed by testing 4 serum pool samples with low analyte concentrations approximately 4-fold higher than the LoB. Samples were tested in replicates of 5 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents, for a total of 60 results per lot. LoD was calculated using the following equation: $\mathrm { L o D } \mathrm { = L o B + ( S D \times 1 . 6 5 2 ) }$ . The highest LoD of the three lots is reported as the LoD in the labeling.

Limit of Quantitation studies were performed using 8 samples which were generated by diluting a sample with an album in concentration of $1 2 \mathrm { g / L }$ . Each of the 8 samples were tested in 10 replicates over 3 days using 3 reagent lots for a total of 240 replicates per lot. The sponsor defines LoQ as the concentration corresponding to a coefficient of variation of $20 \%$ . The highest LoQ of the three lots is reported as the LoQ in the labeling.

The results are summarized in the table below:

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed by testing 128 serum samples spanning the entire claimed assay range. Eight samples were contrived. Each sample was run in duplicate on the predicate device (ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP on the Siemens ADVIA 2400) and singlicate on the candidate device (Albumin BCP on the AU680 Automatic analyzer). The singlicate test result from candidate test system was compared to the average of the results from the comparator method using Passing-Bablok analysis. The results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Correlationcoefficient (r)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sampleconcentrationrangete tested (g/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.94</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.01</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.992</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>128</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.8 - 67.1</td></tr></table>

2. Matrix Comparison:

A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate lithium heparin plasma and K2EDTA plasma equivalency to serum. A total of seventy-seven matched sample pairs were tested. Results obtained with serum samples using Albumin BCP on one AU680 were compared results obtained from either lithium heparin plasma or $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ plasma samples. The table below summarizes the Passing-Bablok linear regression results:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Specimen Type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample rangetested (g/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lithium heparin plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.012</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.3395</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.995</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13.4 - 65.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>K2EDTA plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.200</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13.4 - 65.7</td></tr></table>
