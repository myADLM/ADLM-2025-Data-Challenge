# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

For in vitro diagnostic use only.

The NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit is a screening assay, not intended for confirmatory or prenatal testing. As with any other in vitro screening test, the data obtained using this kit should be used as an aid to other medically established procedures and results interpreted in conjunction with other clinical data available to the clinician. A diagnostic procedure should be used for confirmation of presumptive abnormal amino acid, succinylacetone, free carnitine, acylcarnitine, nucleoside and lysophospholipid profiles. Users should follow local guidelines for follow-up and confirmation testing.

The NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS assay does not screen for rare or newly recognized metabolic disorders whose indicative biochemical markers are not listed in Table 1. above. Patients with CPT-II deficiency typically show elevated blood levels of long-chain acylcarnitine species, especially palmitoyl-carnitine (C16) and/or oleoyl-carnitine (C18:1). With the myopathic form of CPT II primary markers C16 and C18:1 may not be elevated.

Based on limited amount of publications and newborn screening program findings, most infants with SCAD identified through newborn screening programs have remained well and asymptomatic, whereas in children identified clinically demonstrate severe symptoms. Clinically identified children often have only SCAD variants $6 2 5 \mathrm { G } { > } \mathrm { A }$ , $5 1 1 \mathrm { C } { > } \mathrm { T }$ ), which may have C4 concentrations within normal range.

ABCD1 gene variants that are of unknown significance (VOUS) may not be screen positive with primary marker C26-LPC for x-ALD.

In the measurement of C0 as a marker for CUD, it is possible that a cut-off lower than $1 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile may yield a false negative result.

Please note that the $2 5 - 2 6 \%$ recovery of Asa is lower compared to other analytes measured with NeoBase 2 Nonderivatized MSMS assay. Incomplete recovery may cause difference in measured analyte level compared to alternative methods. Therefore, it is important that each laboratory establishes its own reference range and cut-off values with the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS assay.

Known causes for anomalous analytical assay results are:

sample not uniformly saturated with blood

sample disk punched too close to the edge of the blood spot   
poorly collected specimens, e.g. excessive milking or squeezing the puncture may cause hemolysis of the specimen or a mixture of tissue fluids with the specimen. Layering successive drops of blood in the specimen may affect the measured results.   
improperly dried specimens e.g. heating or stacking the specimen collection devices during the drying process   
humidity and moisture or exposure to direct sunlight are detrimental to the dried blood spot sample. Samples and controls can be pre-punched to microplate 2 hours before addition of EWS.   
non-eluting blood spot due to deterioration of sample   
contamination of blood spot filter paper e.g. with fecal material, urine and liquid infant formula.   
disinfectants such as alcohol swabs with a pain killer benzocaine, chlorhexidine digluconate, or lidocaine used to wipe off the heel of newborn in specimen collection ca interfere with the screening analytes. In addition, avoid using other disinfectants (e.g. hexachlorophene or povidone-iodine, or equivalent commercially available products).

Variables such as hematocrit, prematurity, preterm birth, maternal diseases, medications and total parenteral nutrition may affect the interpretation of the values produced. Age-related variations in the amino acid, acylcarnitine and free carnitine concentrations are known. Certain acylcarnitines may tend to be significantly lower in older infants than in newborns and free carnitine can be significantly higher in older children than in newborns.

# B Principle of Operation:

Analyte extraction with the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS assay is accomplished for the amino acids, carnitines, nucleosides and lysophospholipids by adding extraction working solution (EWS) containing NeoBase 2 Extraction Solution and NeoBase 2 Internal Standards to the sample during the incubation step. However, for the extraction and measurement of SA, the compound needs to be derivatized. This takes place simultaneously with the extraction of other analytes by addition of an aliquot of the NeoBase 2 Succinylacetone Assay Solution to the EWS.

SA is a reactive diketone. As such, this analyte tends to react with amine groups of amino acid residues of peptides and proteins present in blood. Therefore, SA is generally bound to proteins in the sample. In the NeoBase 2 assay, SA is derivatized with hydrazine (a stronger base than the amino acid residues). This reaction displaces the interaction of SA with proteins and replaces it with a more stable interaction with the diamine, hydrazine. The reaction creates a very stable pyrazole-like product which is then extracted with the other analytes measured in this assay. In consequence, SA is measured in the MSMS assay as the derivative 3-(5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl) propanoic acid designated here with the acronym MPP. Finally, quantitation of SA is accomplished by including an isotope-labeled analog of MPP as internal standard in the EWS.

In addition to SA, the extraction and measurement of ASA requires the use of NeoBase 2 Succinylacetone Assay Solution.

The measurement of amino acids, succinylacetone, free carnitine, acylcarnitines, nucleosides and lysophospholipids with the NeoBase 2 assay involves extraction of analytes from dried blood spots with a solution containing labeled internal standards and analysis using a tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) system in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode. The response of each analyte relative to its corresponding internal standard is proportional to the analyte concentration.

The analytes present in the sample extract are introduced to the mass spectrometer via the sample delivery system. In the ESI ion source, the analytes acquire a positive or negative charge and are transferred from solution into the gaseous phase. The ions are further transferred into the mass spectrometer, which consists of two sets of quadrupoles (MS1 and MS2) and a collision cell between the quadrupoles. The mass spectrometer sorts and separates the ions according to their mass to charge ratio $( \mathbf { m } / z$ value).

In the MRM acquisition mode, MS1 is set to select a particular precursor ion. After MS1 selection, the precursor ion is sent to the collision cell where collision induced dissociation (CID) takes place and the precursor ion is fragmented to several product ions. Thereafter, only a selected specific product ion is allowed to pass through MS2 to reach the detector and to record an analyte specific precursor-product ion MRM-transition. All non-specified product ions are filtered out.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Dried blood spot samples were prepared from pooled human whole blood from apparently healthy adults. To achieve concentrations of analytes near the lower end of the measuring range, samples were also prepared by diluting human red blood cell concentrate with either charcoal stripped human serum or $0 . 9 \%$ sodium chloride. Hematocrit was adjusted to between $50 \%$ before spiking with analyte stock solutions.

The repeatability and within-laboratory variation for NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit is based on 80 determinations on one instrument: 40 plates measured over 20 working days, each plate having 2 replicates per sample.

Between-lot variation is based on 75 determinations on one instrument: 15 plates measured over five working days using three kit lots, each plate having 5 replicates per sample.

The between instrument variation was determined from 50 total determinations (25 per instrument) on two instruments running 1 plate per day over 5 days. Each plate contained 5 replicates per sample.

Total imprecision was calculated by the sum of the variance of the repeatability, between lot, and between instrument results.

A summary of the results is presented in the tables below.

The reproducibility of the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS assay was determined on the QSight across 2 external sites and one internal site. Dried blood spots were prepared from adult human whole blood adjusted to a hematocrit of between $50 \%$ and spiked with analyte stock solutions . The reproducibility is based on 75 determinations: in each laboratory 5 plates measured over 5 working days using one kit lot and each plate having 5 replicates per sample. The results of reproducibility, between- and within-laboratory precisions are presented in the table below.

# 2. Linearity:

Dried blood spot samples were prepared from pooled human whole blood from apparently healthy adults. To achieve concentrations of analytes near the lower end of the measuring range, samples were also prepared by diluting human red blood cell concentrate with either

stripped human serum or $0 . 9 \%$ sodium chloride. Hematocrit was adjusted to between $50 \%$ before spiking.

Linearity on the NeoBase 2 was determined by testing dried blood spots with 12 analyte levels spanning the ranges defined below in three different linearity studies per analyte. A summary of these studies is presented in the tables below.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Dried blood spot samples representing two different analyte concentrations were tested in an interference study. Samples were prepared from human whole blood adjusted to a hematocrit of $50 \%$ . Two sample pools with different levels of analytes were tested: unspiked whole blood was used for the endogenous analyte level pools and high analyte level pools were prepared from whole blood spiked with analyte stock solutions. Potential interferants were added to sample pools to prepare test samples. Control samples were prepared by adding an equal volume of solvent that was used to dissolve the potential interferants. Sample pools were spotted on filter paper and allowed to dry. The substances tested for interference included endogenous substances and possible sample contaminants. The effect of 24 substances was assessed by the paired-difference method at two analyte concentration levels (both normal and abnormal) with the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit. Results

confirmed that 12 of the 24 substances caused a significant change in the test result. These 12 compounds were further evaluated by dose-response testing.

At the following concentrations, the bias between the test and control samples did not exceed $1 5 \%$ with overall $9 5 \%$ confidence. The sponsor claims that the following substances were found not to interfere with the assay at the concentration indicated.

For the substances that did interfere with the assay, the following was added to the package insert of the device:

Sarcosine: Amino acid derivative Sarcosine was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Ala concentration. Sarcosine concentrations above $3 1 . 3 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ may cause a false positive screening result. Sarcosine concentration in plasma ranges from 0–625 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ in newborns aged 0–1 months. However, Sarcosine does not exist in healthy newborns; it is only found at detectable amount when a newborn is affected by hypersarcosinemia. Therefore, Sarcosine is unlikely to interfere with Ala in routine testing.

Creatine: Non-essential amino acid Creatine was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Ala, Glu and Leu concentrations. Creatine concentrations above 450 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ with Ala, above $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \textmu m o l / L }$ with Leu or above $9 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ with Glu may cause a false positive screening result. The normal expected Creatine level in newborns aged 0–1 months $( 1 0 7 { - } 6 4 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L } )$ in whole blood.

Verapamil metabolite D617: D617 is a metabolite of calcium channel blocker Verapamil. D617 was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Asa concentration. D617 concentrations from $0 . 7 2 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ with Qsight may cause a false positive screening result on Asa. Therapeutic concentration range in plasma for Verapamil is $0 . 1 1 { - } 1 . 3 2 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ . D617 has been found to present approximately $20 \%$ of the given oral dose excreted in to urine, i.e. the D617 level is very unlikely to exceed the concentration of $0 . 7 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ in whole blood. Therefore, Verapamil metabolite D617 is unlikely to interfere with Asa in

routine testing. Nevertheless, newborns given Verapamil or exposed to the compound during pregnancy or breastfeeding could screen positive for Asa.

L-Lysine: L-Lysine was found to interfere with the assay by decreasing the measured Arg concentrations and increasing the measured Gln and Glu concentrations. L-Lysine concentrations above $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { \ : \mu m o l / L }$ caused a decrease in the measured Arg by $1 9 \%$ . Samples with Arg near the cutoff and suspected hyperlysinemia should be tested using a method that shows no interference by L-Lysine. L-Lysine is an essential amino acid and is isobaric to NeoBase 2 analyte Gln. NeoBase 2 assay cannot separate the compounds, and the result of Gln is a sum of Gln and L-Lysine $\mathrm { ( G l n \backslash L y s ) }$ . The reference plasma level of L-Lysine, Gln and Glu in newborns aged 0–1 months are $9 2 { - } 3 2 5 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ , $3 7 6 { - } 7 0 9 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ and 62–620 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ , respectively. L-Lysine may cause a false positive screening result for Gln. The proposed cut-off area measured with NeoBase 2 assay for Gln is generally high (e.g. $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile, $1 2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ ). For Glu, L-Lysine concentrations from $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \textmu m o l / L }$ may cause a false positive screening result. Since the whole blood used in the interference samples contains also endogenous L-Lysine, the sum of spiked and endogenous L-Lysine levels is in the upper part of newborn physiological L-Lysine range. In hyperlysinemia, the concentration of L-Lysine in blood plasma is relatively high. Plasma L-Lysine levels have been reported to exceed $6 0 0 \mathrm { \ : \mu m o l / L }$ and can reach up to $2 0 0 0 { \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } }$ . When blood specimen is taken from a newborn with such a condition, L-Lysine may cause false positive screening results to Gln and/or Glu.

L-Glutamic acid: Non-essential amino acid and NeoBase 2 analyte L-Glutamic acid (Glu) was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Met concentration. Glu concentrations above $2 2 5 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ may cause a false positive screening result on Met. The reference plasma level of Glu in newborns aged 0–1 months is $6 2 { - } 6 2 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ . Therefore, Glu is very unlikely to interfere with Met in routine testing.

L-Asparagine: Non-essential amino acid L-Asparagine was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Orn concentration. L-Asparagine concentrations above 750 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ may cause a false positive screening result on Orn. The reference plasma level of LAsparagine in newborns aged 0–1 months is $2 9 { \mathrm { - } } 1 3 2 { \mathrm { ~ } } \mu { \mathrm { m o l / L } }$ . Therefore L-Asparagine is unlikely to interfere with Orn in routine testing.

L-Ornithine (Orn): NeoBase 2 analyte L-Ornithine $\left( \mathrm { O r n } \right)$ was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Pro concentration. The interference is caused by mass transition overlap between a fragment of Orn formed in the ion source and Pro. Orn concentrations above $9 3 . 8 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ may cause a false positive screening result on Pro.

L-Methionine sulfone: Amino acid derivative L-Methionine sulfone was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured Tyr concentration. L-Methionine sulfone concentrations above $3 1 . 3 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ with may cause a false positive screening result on Tyr. No reference concentration in newborns was found for methionine sulfone. However, because methionine sulfone is an oxidation product of methionine sulfoxide, and methionine sulfoxide is a product of methionine (Met), the highest concentration of methionine sulfone should not exceed the normal level of Met in infants aged 0–1 months (reference plasma level is $1 0 { - } 6 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ . L-Methionine sulfone dose of $6 2 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ increased the endogenous Tyr concentration ${ ( 5 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } ) }$ to $6 9 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ . Since the proposed cut-off area measured with

NeoBase 2 assay for Tyr is higher (e.g. $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile, $1 9 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } $ , L-Methionine sulfone is unlikely to interfere routine testing.

Albumin: High albumin concentrations were found to interfere with the assay. When total albumin is above $3 . 1 6 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ , the interference caused an increase in the measured ADO concentrations. The reference range for albumin in infant plasma/serum aged 0–12 months is $2 . 8 \mathrm { - } 4 . 7 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ corresponding to albumin concentration of $1 . 4 { - } 2 . 4 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ in whole blood. Therefore it is unlikely that albumin interferes with ADO in routine testing.

Intralipid (Triglyceride): High intralipid concentrations were found to interfere with the assay. When more than $0 . 2 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ of intralipid with was added to blood containing $0 . 0 7 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ of endogenous triglycerides (i.e. tested total triglycerides above $0 . 3 2 { \mathrm { g / d L } }$ ) the interference caused an increase in the measured C24:0-LPC concentration. The reference range for triglycerides in newborns aged 0–7 days has been reported to be from 0.02 to $0 . 1 8 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ in serum corresponding to triglyceride concentration in whole blood of 0.01 to $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Therefore it is unlikely that triglycerides interfere with C24:0-LPC in routine testing.

Chlorhexidine digluconate: Chlorhexidine digluconate was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured C24:0-LPC and C26:0-LPC concentrations. Chlorhexidine digluconate is a cationic broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent belonging to the bis(biguanide) family. Its mechanism of action involves destabilization of the outer bacterial membrane. Chlorhexidine digluconate amounts above $0 . 0 3 \%$ may cause false positive screening results on C24:0-LPC and C26:0-LPC with Qsight. If disinfectant pads containing chlorhexidine digluconate are used to wipe off the heels of newborns in preparation for sample collection, there is potential for chlorhexidine digluconate to be carried into the sample. It can be estimated that in the worst case, $1 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the $3 \%$ skin disinfection solution might contaminate a $7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ blood droplet, which corresponds to an amount of $0 . 0 4 \%$ Chlorhexidine digluconate in the sample. Therefore, it is unlikely that Chlorhexidine digluconate will interfere with C24:0-LPC and C26:0-LPC in routine testing.

Hemoglobin: High hemoglobin concentrations were found to interfere with the assay. Total hemoglobin above $2 1 . 7 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ caused a decrease in the measured SA by $20 \%$ with Qsight. The decrease in the measured SA by high hemoglobin occurred as SA concentrations of 8.7 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ . No interference by high hemoglobin (up to $2 2 . 9 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ ) was observed at an SA concentration of $0 . 3 2 { \mathrm { u m o l / L } }$ . Total hemoglobin above $2 1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ caused an elevation in the measured Val by $1 6 \%$ . Total hemoglobin above $2 0 . 4 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ caused a decrease in the measured C24:0-LPC by $1 8 { - } 2 0 \%$ . Total hemoglobin above $1 9 . 2 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ caused an elevation in the measured ADO by $2 1 - 3 6 \%$ .

The effect of hematocrit on Arg was evaluated. Hematocrit values below $43 \%$ increased Arg results by $3 6 \%$ , and hematocrit values above $6 3 \%$ decreased Arg results by $2 8 \%$ and by $30 \%$ Although interference by hemoglobin and hematocrit was observed with concentrations within the newborn reference ranges $( 1 2 . 0 { - } 2 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ for hemoglobin, $3 5 \mathrm { - } 6 5 \%$ for hematocrit), it is concluded based on the external study results that the interferences are not pronounced enough to impair the separation of the affected and un-affected cases. Interference by hemoglobin could cause false negative screening results only if C24:0-LPC would be used as the sole marker for XALD. C24:0-LPC should always be used together with the primary marker C26:0-LPC.

In addition to above findings, following potential interferences have been reported:

Benzocaine: Disinfectants such as alcohol swabs with a topical anesthetic benzocaine should not be used to wipe off the heel of a newborn. Benzocaine and Phe are isomers having the same mass to charge ratio of 166.1. Therefore, benzocaine may cause falsely elevated Phe concentration and a false positive phenylketonuria (PKU) screening result.

C5 isomer pivalylcarnitine: Pivalic acid may cause false positive screening result for Isovaleric acidemia (IVA), whose marker is acylcarnitine C5. Pivalic acid can be liberated from a prodrug containing esterified pivalic acid (such as pivalic-ester containing antibiotics, corticosteroids or other pharmaceuticals) administered to mothers or newborns. Pivalic acid is further metabolized to pivalylcarnitine which is an isomer of C5, and therefore pivalic acid can cause falsely elevated C5 results. Falsely elevated C5 concentrations have been reported in newborns due to pivalylcarnitine interference. Administration of pivalic acid containing prodrugs can lead to carnitine depletion. In addition, falsely elevated C5 concentrations have been connected to cases where pivalylcarnitine originated from neopentanoate esters present in nipple-fissure unguent used by the breastfeeding mothers.

C8 isomer valproylcarnitine: Medication valproic acid administered to mothers or newborns may interfere with the screening of Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) or Medium-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase deficiency (MCKAT), whose diagnostic marker is acylcarnitine C8. Valproic acid is metabolized to valproylcarnitine, which is isomer of C8, and can cause falsely elevated C8 concentration. False positive MCAD results have been measured in newborns due to valproylcarnitine interference.

C3DC\C4OH, C4DC\C5OH and C5DC\C6OH: Analytes in the pairs C3DC\C4OH; C4DC\C5OH; and C5DC\C6OH; are all natural acylcarnitines that can be present in dried blood spots and cannot be separated in the NeoBase 2 assay due to mass transition overlap. The mass to charge ratios of the precursor ions are 248 (for C3DC, C4OH), 262 (for C4DC, C5OH), and 276 (for C5DC, C6OH) and they all have the same identifying product ion $( \mathbf { m } / z$ 85). As a result, the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit reports the results for these analytes in the pair together as a sum, which is very much the same as the case for Leu\Ile\Hydroxyproline, and Gln\Lys. Because of this overlap, the results for these analytes should be reported as the cumulative concentration of the two analytes in the pair.

C16:1OH\C17: C16:1OH is a marker among other hydroxylated long chain acylcarnitines for Long-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHAD) and Trifunctional protein deficiency (TFP). Heptadecanoylcarnitine (C17) has been identified as a marker specific for Propionic acidemia (PROP) and Methylmalonic acidemia (MUT). C17 and C16:1OH are isomers, having the same mass to charge ratio of $\mathrm { m } / \mathrm { z } 4 1 4$ , and are always measured in NeoBase 2 assay as a sum of both analytes. In screening of LCHAD, TFP, PROP and MUT, the cumulative sum concentration of C16:1OH and C17 increases. It is recommended to confirm positive screening result with 2nd tier analysis, which is capable of separating C16:1OH and C17 and identify specifically the disorder.

C26:0-LPC: Elevated C26:0-LPC concentrations have been measured in newborn blood spots and post-natal blood specimens taken from children diagnosed by Aicardi Goutières Syndrome (AGS) leading to false positive results in first tier X-ALD screening.

Interference from $_ { \mathrm { M } + 2 }$ Isotopic Peaks: The analytes and internal standards measured in NeoBase 2 assay not only produce an $\mathbf { M }$ peak (the monoisotopic peak that is used in the measurement), but also $\mathrm { M } { + } 1$ , $_ { \mathrm { M } + 2 }$ , and $\mathrm { M } { + } 3$ peaks. These additional $\mathrm { M } { + } \mathrm { n }$ peaks are due to the naturally occurring heavier stable isotopes such as 13C, 15N or 18O. In tandem mass spectra of complex samples where many analytes are analyzed simultaneously (as is the case of the NeoBase 2 assay) the $\mathrm { M } { + } \mathrm { n }$ peaks of one compound have the potential to overlap with the peaks generated by other compounds of neighbouring $\mathrm { m } / z$ and cause falsely elevated peaks. Potential $_ { \mathrm { M } + 2 }$ peak interferences are as follows: $_ { \mathrm { M } + 2 }$ peak of C5 overlaps with C3DC\C4OH; $_ { \mathrm { M } + 2 }$ peak of C6 overlaps with $\mathrm { C 4 D C } \backslash \mathrm { C 5 O H }$ ; and $_ { \mathrm { M } + 2 }$ peak of C8 13908222- 2 (en) 59 overlaps with C6DC. However, the effect is only significant when C5, C6, and C8 are present in high concentrations. At the endogenous concentrations the risk for false positive result with C3DC\C4OH, C4DC\C5OH and C6DC is negligible. When elevated level of C5, which is a marker for Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) and 2-Methylbutyrylglycinuria (2MBG), is observed, concentration of C3DC\C4OH must be evaluated. When elevated level of C6, which is a marker for Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD), is observed, concentration of C4DC\C5OH must be evaluated. When elevated level of C8, which is a marker for MCAD and Medium-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase deficiency (MCKAT), is observed, concentration of C6DC must be evaluated. Conversely, when elevations are detected on C3DC\C4OH; C4DC\C5OH; or C6DC, it is recommended to evaluate the concentrations of C5, C6, and C8 to ensure these observations are not due to the $_ { \mathrm { M } + 2 }$ effect described here.

Plasticizers and contaminants from other consumables: Plasticizers or other additives may leach from the plastic material used in the sample preparation, storage packages and medical equipment and interfere with the newborn screening results. For example, slip agent Oleamide $( \mathbf { m } / z 2 8 2 )$ is known to interfere with C5DC IS having the same mass to charge ratio. Elevated C5DC IS intensity falsely decreases acylcarnitine C5DC analyte concentration and may cause false negative screening result on C5DC, which is a marker for Glutaric acidemia type I (GAI). Similarly, a common anti-static agent Lauric acid diethanolamide (LDEA, $\mathrm { m } / z 2 8 8 $ ) has been found to interfere with acylcarnitine C8 having the same mass to charge ratio. LDEA can lead to false positive C8 result, which is a marker for disorders Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) and Mediumchain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase deficiency (MCKAT) disorder. In addition, falsely elevated C8 levels in two neonates treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been identified. The C8 interference was traced to PVC tubing used in ECMO and a plasticizer Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) used commonly in the manufacturing of PVC. Interference originated from a DEHP metabolite, 2-Ethylhexanoic acid, which was further metabolized in the exposed neonates to a C8 isomer, 2-ethylhexacosanoylcarnitine, can lead to false positive C8 test result. In the other neonate sample, also falsely elevated acylcarnitine C6DC concentration was detected. Interference was likely because of another plasticizer, di-(2- ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) metabolite adipic acid, which was metabolized to C6DC. If DEHA is metabolized to C6DC, which is a marker for 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acidemia (HMG), the false positive C6DC test result may occur. The NeoBase 2 assay is validated with the specific microplates and plate covers provided with the kit and any other items should not be used to avoid plasticizer or other additive contamination. Diethylethanolamine (DEAE), which is used e.g. in cleaning agents, is known to interfere with amino acid Val and can cause falsely elevated results as observed during the external study. Similarly, dimethylethanolamine and ethylaminoethanol are known to interfere with amino acid Ala and can cause falsely elevated results as observed during the external study.

Carry Over:

The carry-over was measured using two QSights. Whole blood sample replicates close to endogenous levels were measured after enriched high concentration whole blood samples, and potential carry-over was calculated thereafter. No functionally significant carry-over effect was observed with any of the analytes.

Drift:

The possible drift was determined by analyzing 12 identical plates with one QSight using enriched whole blood samples at different concentration levels from endogenous to the upper part of the linear range. No significant drift was detected within the maximum continuous run time of 39 hours with the QSight when the autosampler is fully loaded.

4. Assay Reportable Range: See Section 2. Linearity above.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The traceability of the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit was reviewed in K173568 and found to be acceptable.

# 6. Detection Limit:

To prepare samples, internal standards were serially diluted to 15 levels, which were spiked into undiluted whole blood. Whole blood containing the serially diluted internal standards were pipetted onto filter paper, dried, and dried blood spot extraction was performed according to the NeoBase 2 kit insert. Extracted samples were pipetted onto plates in 6 replicates of each, from the lowest dilution level to the highest dilution level.

A screening performance study was conducted at one routine newborn screening laboratory in the United States. The study samples were punches taken from leftover DBS specimens submitted to the site for routine 1st tier newborn screening and archived, confirmed positive specimens obtained from the California Biobank Program. Study samples were tested in parallel on the QSight 210 MD MSMS platform and the TQD MSMS platform using the same NeoBase2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit lot and cut-off values established in a separate cutoff study. 2580 presumptive negative samples and 52 confirmed positive samples were tested on both the QSight and TQD MSMS platforms.

Disorders, conditions and sample numbers represented in confirmed positive specimen reporting along with the number of confirmed positive samples detected with the QSight and TQD Systems are shown in the table below. The screening performance of the NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit on QSight and TQD was compared in one routine screening laboratory. Using data from routine newborn screening, the cut-offs for both screening systems were determined by calculating the 99.5th and 99th percentile for all analytes except C2. For C2, C3, C16, C18, C18:1 and Cit the low cut-off applied is based on 1st percentile. For C0, the low cut-off applied is based on 10th percentile.

# D Clinical Cut-Off:

The labeling for this device contains the following statement about cut-offs:

The determination of presumptive positives for metabolic disorders in newborn is based on the use of a cut-off value, which distinguishes between presumptive negative and presumptive positive values.

Please note that the values mentioned in this section should only be used as a guideline, and each laboratory shall establish its own reference range and cut-off-values.

Do not use a cut-off value that is based on data collected at another site or using any other product than the 3044-001U NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit.

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

Typical expected NeoBase 2 Non-derivatized MSMS kit results for neonatal populations are presented below for two separate studies performed on the QSight 210 MD Screening System: the cutoff determination study, and the screening performance study. These studies were conducted at the same state screening laboratory. These results were obtained from testing of

leftover routine newborn screening samples at one routine screening laboratory in the United States on the QSight Platform.

Below are results calculated from 2530 presumptive unaffected dried newborn blood sample tested during the cutoff determination study. The population means, medians, $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ percentile and $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile are shown in micromolar $\mathrm  \ [ u m o l / L \} $ quantities.
