Proprietary Name: Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System

Common or Usual Name: Blood Gas Analyzer

Classification Name: Blood Gases and Blood pH System

Product Code: CHL

Predicate Device: k173797 – Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System

# Device Description:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is a low cost, low maintenance analyzer for hospital laboratory and point-of-care settings. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Optionally, it provides for reading of barcode labels (such as operator badges and data sheets).

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which sensor cards are installed.

# Primary Sensor Card Port:

There are two options for the primary sensor card:

Primary Sensor Card 1 shall enable and report the following listed analytes: $\bigcirc$ $\mathsf { P O } _ { 2 }$ , ${ \mathsf { P C O } } _ { 2 }$ , pH   
Primary Sensor Card 2 shall enable and report the following listed analytes: o b $\mathsf { P O } _ { 2 }$ , $\mathsf { P C O } _ { 2 }$ , pH

As with the predicate, the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is a blood gas, co-oximetry, electrolyte, chemistry, and hematology analyzer with an enhanced test menu and multiple quality control options. Both traditional internal and external quality control is available, as well as an on-board Quality Management System (QMS), and an electronic monitoring approach that insures the analyzer is working properly at all times.

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer accepts samples from syringes and open tubes. The minimum sample size for analysis is $1 3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

Sample collection, preparation and application to the analyzer are the same as for the previously cleared predicate. The end user can select which analytes are to be tested in the panel.

# Summary of the Technological Characteristics:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared for market Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer in intended use. It uses the same sensor technology and measurement algorithms, and the formulations of the internal and external controls and the calibration cartridge are the same for the tested parameters.

# Principles of Measurement:

# pH:

pH is measured using a hydrogen ion selective glass membrane. One side of the glass is in contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of unknown pH. A change in potential develops which is proportional to the pH difference of these solutions. This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant potential. The magnitude of the potential difference is a measure, then, of the pH of the unknown solution.

# $\mathsf { p c o } _ { 2 }$

${ \mathsf { p C O } } _ { 2 }$ is measured with a modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the unknown solution makes contact with a gas permeable membrane mounted on a combination measuring/reference electrode. $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ diffuses across the membrane into a thin layer of electrolyte solution in response to partial pressure difference. This solution then becomes equilibrated with the external gas pressure. $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the solution becomes hydrated producing carbonic acid, which results in a change in hydrogen ion activity.

# $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { p } } \boldsymbol { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$

${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the cathode, consuming 4 electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons is then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen.

# Summary of Performance Testing:

Bench testing was previously completed and summarized in k173797 to show that the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer demonstrates substantial equivalence to the predicate submission.

The bench testing included:

Method Comparison Studies   
Precision/Reproducibility – Within Run and Run to Run Studies   
Linearity Testing   
Specificity/Interference Testing

The results of that testing confirmed that the performance of the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is substantially equivalent to that of the Nova Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (predicate device).

# Summary of Point-of-Care Testing:

A Point-of-Care (POC) study was conducted to demonstrate that the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer demonstrates substantial equivalence to the predicate submission. The testing compared results obtained by trained Healthcare Professionals to results obtained by POC personnel on the same specimens using the same analyzer. The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer was evaluated by point-of-care (POC) personnel in 3 POC sites including a Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU), an Emergency Department (ED) and a Respiratory Therapy Lab (RT). A total of 61 Respiratory Care, 12 Nursing, and 1 Exercise Physiology POC personnel participated from the 3 POC settings over the course of the study. The personnel represent trained, qualified staff found in typical POC sites where blood gas analyzers are utilized. All testing was performed using quality control materials or discarded blood gas specimens.

Method Comparison studies on venous and arterial whole blood specimens were conducted using methods described in CLSI “Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Second Edition”, CLSI EP9-A2. Combined method comparison data from all 3 POC settings is summarized in Table 1.

# Total Imprecision Performance:

The estimates for total impression were obtained from different POC personnel running 3 levels of Stat Profile Prime Plus Quality Control Materials in duplicate each day for a total of 20 runs on 3 Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers. The protocol was based upon methods described in CLSI Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline—Second Edition, CLSI EP5- A2T. The total imprecision data from one representative POC site is shown in Table 2 and is representative of the expected total imprecision performance obtainable by POC personnel using the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzer using external quality control materials.

# Within-Run Whole Blood Precision:

Whole blood with-run precision of the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System in the hands of point-ofcare operators was assessed by two (2) point-of-care operators at each of the three (3) POC sites for a total of six (6) point-of-care operators across the 3 testing locations. Each precision run consisted of ten (10) replicate measurements using fresh, native whole blood samples. A total of five (5) different native samples were evaluated at each site. Each whole blood specimen was maintained in a syringe. The POC operator performed all sample analysis steps including sample analysis, removal of resultant air bubble(s) from the syringe, recapping of the syringe and mixing prior to the next sample analysis. The whole blood within-run precision data from one representative POC site is shown in Table 3 and is representative of the expected within-run precision obtainable by POC personnel using the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzer using whole blood samples.
