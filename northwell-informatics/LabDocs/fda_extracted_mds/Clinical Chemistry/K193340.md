Dear Mingzi Hussey:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

GoChek Blood Glucose meter Monitoring System

GoChek Connect Blood Glucose   
meter   
Monitoring System

GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System and GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System ˄also called “GoCheck series”˅ perform quantitative assays of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood obtained from the fingertip. The glucose measurement is achieved by using the amperometric detection method.

Both the systems share the same GoChek Blood Glucose test strips. It has a reagent system in test window that includes glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and a mediator that reacts with the glucose in the whole blood sample. This reaction, in turn produces an electrical current that is measured by the meter’s electronics through test strip contact area. The meter, then calculates and displays the blood glucose concentration reading, calibrated to a plasma reference.

GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System has Bluetooth and serial interfaces that comply with US federal guidelines, Part 15 of the FCC Rules for devices with RF capability.This Bluetooth function will allow user to transfer their test results from BG meter to a specific app which developed by MicroTech. Users can choose to utilize these function by following the instruction to set it up, otherwise these functions will remain shut off.

# Pancares App

The Pancares App is available for both Android phones (through Google Play). The app uses the smartphone'sbluetooth radio to read data from the GoChek Connect meter's onboardmemory. Once the device wireless connection and app are connected, thedevice sends the glucose data and synchronizes the onboard history with theapp and allows the app to display this data for the user. The data that is

transferred to the smartphone is read only, and the smartphone has no way of altering the data residing on the GoChek Connect meter.

# 13.2 Performance Testing

The performance characteristics of the GoChek/ GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System were evaluated by performing the following studies: within-run precision, intermediate precision, Linearity, Interference Evaluation(Endogenous/Exogenous Substances), Hematocrit Effect, Stability, System Operating Conditions Testing Study, Temperature Effect Study for Control Solution , Flex Study using sample Outside the Measuring Range, Sample Volume, Sample Perturbation Study, Intermittent Sampling, software validation testing,

electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety testing, Random vibration test, Shock Testing and usability testing.

# 14.Discussion of Method Comparison/User Evaluation Performed

Method Comparison/User Evaluation were conducted with lay persons (including naïve and non-naïve SMBG users) using the GoChek series. .

The study data were presented evaluating the system accuracy of the GoChek series compared to the YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS per the Microtech Method Comparison/User Evaluation Protocol for the GoChek/ GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

In addition, studies using blood samples in the extreme upper and lower ends of the claimed measuring range (10 to $5 8 0 ~ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ ) altered to achieve glucose concentrations of less than $8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and greater than $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g } /$ dLwas performed in a laboratory setting by trained professionals, wherein samples were measured and compared on both the GoChek series and YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS.

Both above study results indicate that $9 5 \%$ of all SMBG results are within $+ / - 1 5 \%$ of the comparator results across the entire claimed measuring range of the device and that $9 9 \%$ of all SMBG results are within $+ / - 2 0 \%$ of the comparator results across the entire claimed measuring range of the device.

In addition, the participants in Method Comparison/User Evaluation were questioned and assessed the readability grade level of the user manual, test strip insert, and control solution insert prior to study.

# 15. Substantial Equivalence Conclusion

The laboratory testing and Method Comparison/User Evaluation study results demonstrate that the GoChek/GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System is safe, effective and convenient. It also demonstrates that the GoChek/GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System meets the accuracy requirements per Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose Test Systems for Over-the-Counter Use-Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, October 11, 2016, and as such is

substantially equivalent to the On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System.   
currently sold on the U.S. market(K130284).

The information provided in the 510(k) submission is sufficient to demonstrate the substantial equivalence of subject device to the predicate device.
