# D Special Instrument Requirements:

The GoChek Blood Glucose Meter The GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Meter

# IV Device/System Characteristics: A Device Description:

GoChek/GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a glucose meter (GoChek or GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Meter), GoChek Blood Glucose Test Strips (sold in vials of test strips and individually wrapped pouches of test strips; sold separately), carrying case, lancing device, batteries, and two levels of control solution (sold separately). The only difference between the GoChek and GoChek Connect meters is that the GoChek Connect meter has Bluetooth connectivity enabled.

# B Principle of Operation:

The GoChek and GoChek Connect Blood Glucose meters measure the glucose concentration in capillary whole blood. Blood is applied to the end tip of the test strip. The blood is then automatically absorbed into the reaction cell. The reaction takes place in the reaction cell. The enzyme used is a Flavin-Adenine-Dinucleotide-Dependent Glucose Dehydrogenase (FADGDH). FAD-GDH oxidizes glucose to gluconolactone (GDL) and a transient electrical current is formed during the reaction which is detected by the meter. The blood glucose concentration is then calculated based on the electrical current. The result is then shown on the meter display in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the user. The meters are calibrated to display plasma equivalent results.

1. Instrument Name:

GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System

2. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Samples are to be tested immediately upon collection.

4. Calibration:

The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically coded.

# 5. Quality Control:

The sponsor manufactures two (2) levels of GoChek control solutions. Each test strip vial is marked with a control solution range (CTRL1 and CTRL2). The user is instructed to compare the control results with the expected control ranges printed on the strip vial. Users are given instructions on when to conduct control solution testing and to call customer service if repeat testing with control material is out of range. The meter automatically detects that a control solution is being used. When a control solution test is performed, the test results will not be included in the ‘day average’ calculation.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Within-Run Precision

The sponsor performed a repeatability study (within day) precision study using venous whole blood adjusted to five different glucose concentration ranges (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151- 250, and $2 5 1 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each glucose concentration was analyzed in replicates of 10 with three test strips lots, and 10 meters, for a total of 100 tests per glucose level. Results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose Level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.88</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.81</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>128.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.74</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>221.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.31</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>382.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10.05</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.6%</td></tr></table>

# Intermediate Precision

Intermediate (day-to-day) precision was performed using five ranges of glucose control solution concentrations (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, and $2 5 1 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Testing was performed for 10 days with three test strip lots. For each level, on each day, 10 meters were used for testing, with one replicate collected per meter for a total of 10 replicates per day for each control solution level, for a total of 100 tests per control solution level. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose Level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>37.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.61</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.27</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>128.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.01</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>193.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.71</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>346.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.07</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.0%</td></tr></table>

2. Linearity:

Linearity testing was evaluated with test strips from three lots and 11 mixed pools of venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 7.5, 25.2, 43.7, 72.6, 95.5, 152.5, 199.5, 252.0, 300.0, 405.5, 511.5, and $5 7 8 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured with the YSI Model 2300 STAT

PLUS glucose analyzer. Each level was measured in replicates of four and the values obtained on the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to the comparator. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{2}$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9960</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-4.4024</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9997</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9743</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.9445</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9997</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9949</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-3.1076</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9996</td></tr></table>

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 10 – 580 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample is less than $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If the result is greater than $5 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as HI. This low and high functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference testing was conducted using venous whole blood adjusted to a hematocrit of $4 2 \% \pm 2 \%$ and glucose was adjusted to the following levels: $5 0 - 7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 110 – 130 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 5 0 - 2 7 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Control blood samples were prepared by adding solvent with no interferant. Control and test samples were measured using 10 strips on each of 2 meters using 3 strip lots. The highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference was observed (defined by the sponsor as average $\%$ bias $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ ) are presented in the following table:

Lay-user Performance study:

To assess the performance of the GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed studies with 360 English speaking participants. The participants were responsible for obtaining their own fingertip capillary sample and performing a blood glucose test using only the instructions from the product labeling. A total of 360 meters and 20 test strip vials, each containing 25 test strips, from 3 test strip lots were used. The glucose concentrations across all samples ranged from 42.2 to $4 2 0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which includes 34 native samples $< 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 37 samples $> 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by the comparator method. Results were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System against results obtained with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from $4 2 . 2 – 4 2 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , as measured by the YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer. Results are summarized in the tables below:

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

1. Altitude Study

To evaluate the effect of altitude on the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System, a study was conducted using venous whole blood samples adjusted with four concentration levels of glucose ranging from $4 0 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were tested at two different altitude conditions at sea level (65 feet) and 11,410 feet. Blood samples were tested using 10 test strips at each altitude condition for each glucose concentration. Eighty test strips from 3 lots were used. The results obtained on the candidate device were compared with the results obtained with the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer. The results demonstrated acceptable bias to the comparator to support the claim in the labeling that glucose measurement performance of the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System is maintained at altitudes up to 10,000 feet.

# 2. Hematocrit

To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of $10 \%$ , $1 5 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $65 \%$ , $70 \%$ . Each hematocrit level was adjusted to achieve five glucose concentration ranges $( 3 0 { - } 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $5 1 { \mathrm { - } } 1 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 1 1 - 1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 5 1 { - } 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $2 5 1 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Blood samples were tested using the GoChek meter with test strips from three lots and the mean glucose values were compared to the results obtained on the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer. The percent biases relative to the comparator method demonstrated were acceptable to support the claimed hematocrit range of 10 to $70 \%$ .

# 3. Operating Conditions

The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to approximately four glucose concentration ranges (40-50, 100-120, 250-300, and 500-550 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ . Testing was conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations: $5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ at $10 \%$ relative humidity (RH), $5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ at $90 \%$ RH, $2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at $10 \%$ RH, $2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at $90 \%$ RH, $2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at $45 \%$ RH, $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ at $10 \%$ RH and $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ at $90 \%$ RH. Test strips from three lots were used to test the blood samples at each glucose concentration in 10 replicates of 10. Values were compared to results from the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer. The study results support the operating conditions claim of $4 1 { - } 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 5 . 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with relative humidity of $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ .

# 4. Sample volume Study

The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ for the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples with three ranges of glucose concentrations (50-65, 100-120, $2 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) were tested at five sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and $0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). Each sample was tested with 10 test strips from 3 lots. Values obtained were compared to the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS. The meter has an error message that is displayed if insufficient blood is added to the test strip. This feature was validated and was shown to function as intended. The study results support the claimed sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

# 5. Flex Studies

The following additional flex studies were performed with the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System: sample perturbation, sample outside measuring range, intermittent sampling, drop, vibration, and shipping testing were completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust under these conditions.

# 6. Infection Control Studies

The two device systems, GoChek and GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System, are intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration # 46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 7,665 cleanings and disinfection steps with the CaviWipes wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of singlepatient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 7. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and EMC testing had been performed and the system was found to be compliant.
