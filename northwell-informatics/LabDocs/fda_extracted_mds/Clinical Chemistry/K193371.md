The exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could cause incorrect readings.

# 1.5 Device Description

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System (herein referred to as the ‘FreeStyle Libre 2 System or ‘System’) is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide glucose levels, trends and alerts. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System consists of two primary components: a sensor that transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a BLE enabled display device (Reader). User-initiated RFID scanning provides the user with real-time glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose graph). The user may use the sensor glucose results and information provided by the System in making treatment decisions. The System also provides configurable alerts and alarms designed to warn the user of Low Glucose, High Glucose or Signal Loss.

# FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor

The Sensor is single use and disposable. The Sensor is provided as two secondary components, Sensor Applicator and Sensor Pack (sterile device), which are used to assemble and apply the Sensor to the back of the user’s arm. During Sensor application, the sensor tail is inserted about 5.5 millimeters below the surface of the skin through the guidance of a needle. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The Sensor continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid every minute and has an 8-hour memory capacity. The Sensor is factory calibrated, does not require fingerstick calibration, and can be worn for up to 14 days.

# FreeStyle Libre 2 Reader

The Reader is a small handheld device that uses RFID communication to start new sensors, to scan sensors to display and record data and uses BLE communication to issue alarms that notify the user when glucose values pass high or low thresholds, when enabled. The Reader also includes a built-in strip port with blood glucose functionality as a convenience for users (which is intended to work with the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose test strips, cleared under K171941), and a user interface that includes event logging features.

The FreeStyle Libre 2 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic interfaces. This system is not compatible with AID systems, including insulin suspend systems.

# 1.5.1 Test Principle

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System uses an electrochemical sensor to monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor is held in place with an adhesive pad and incorporates both the subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor uses a glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to a metal electrode, producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the subcutaneous space. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) for display to the user on the handheld Reader.

# $b$ . Linearity/Assay Reportable Range

The reportable range for the FreeStyle Libre 2 System is 40 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Control, Calibrators, or Methods)

The FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor has a storage life of 9 months. Shelf-life was evaluated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } -$ $8 2 ^ { \circ }$ Fahrenheit within the humidity range of $1 0 \% - 9 0 \%$ .

# d. Detection Limit

If a glucose measurement is less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result will be displayed by the system as ‘LO’. If the glucose measurement exceeds $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result will be displayed as $\cdot _ { \mathrm { H I } } ,$ . Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section 1.7.3 below.

# e. Analytical Specificity:

Certain endogenous and exogenous substances in the interstitial fluid may interfere with iCGM measurements. The types of potential interference and the extent of bias are dependent on the test principle of the sensor technology. For this technology, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been shown to interfere with the system performance when present in the body at concentrations higher than the recommended daily allowance. During the pivotal clinical studies, all medications and vitamins for which the subject was using or had used over the course of the study along with frequency of use were recorded. Both studies did not include exclusion criteria based on medications or vitamin use.

A clinical study was conducted to evaluate ascorbic acid interference for the FreeStyle Libre 2 System. It is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study that enrolled 60 subjects at 4 sites. The study was designed to evaluate performance of the System in people with diabetes (age 18 and older) taking ascorbic acid. Each subject wore two sensors, one on the back of each upper arm, for a period of up to 10 days.

Subjects participated in one clinic session between sensor wear days 4 and 10. During the inclinic visit, data was collected over a 13-hour period. Each subject had a one-hour baseline phase where venous blood was collected every 10 minutes. After this first hour, a dose of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ ascorbic acid was given with a meal and venous samples were collected every 20 minutes for the next four hours. Subjects then received a second dose of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ ascorbic acid with a meal and measurements were taken every 20 minutes for another 4 hours. Subsequently, a third dose of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { ~ m g }$ ascorbic acid was given with a meal and measurements were taken every 20 minutes for 4 more hours.

Accuracy performance of the System was assessed by the mean difference $\mathrm { ( m g / d L ) }$ between GM and YSI readings pre and post- ascorbic acid doses. For each matched pair of CGM and YSI, the difference, absolute difference, relative difference and absolute relative difference is calculated. The biases for all three doses are calculated by subtracting the baseline bias at pre-dose from the post-dose bias as shown in the ‘Difference from Baseline’ column below.

The figure below shows the mean bias from the baseline at different time points. The results show that the maximum bias was observed at around 3 hours after the intake of each dose of vitamin C, with a maximum average bias of $9 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ after the first $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ dose. The maximum average biases were $1 8 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $1 9 . 7 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ after the second and third doses respectively.

Based on the results of the clinical evaluation, the following statements have been placed in the device labeling:

Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found in supplements including multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies such as Airborne $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Emergen- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { C } \mathbf { \otimes }$ , may contain high doses of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid and should not be taken while using the Sensor. See your healthcare professional to understand how long ascorbic acid is active in your body.

A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid on Sensor performance. Data from 57 adult subjects with diabetes was collected over a 13-hour period. Each subject had a one-hour baseline phase where venous blood was collected every 10 minutes. After this first hour, a dose of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ ascorbic acid was given with a meal and venous samples were collected every 20 minutes for the next four hours. A maximum average sensor bias of $9 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was observed around 3 hours after the $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ ascorbic acid dose. Subjects then received a second dose of 1000 mg ascorbic acid with a meal and the same process was continued for another 4 hours. A third dose of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ ascorbic acid was then given and study subjects were followed for 4 more hours. After the second dose of ascorbic acid the maximum average sensor bias increased, with minimal change in sensor bias after the third dose, suggesting that saturation had occurred by the second $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ dose of ascorbic acid. The maximum average sensor bias after the three $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ doses of ascorbic acid was less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System, two prospective clinical studies (Study 1, adult; Study 2, pediatric) were conducted at five and four centers, respectively. All study centers were located in the United States. Results from these studies are presented concurrently.

Study 1 enrolled 146 adult subjects with diabetes. Of these, $9 1 . 1 \%$ were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, while $8 . 9 \%$ were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. All subjects required insulin to manage their diabetes. Subjects wore 2 sensors for up to 14 days. Subjects took part in up to three ten-hour clinical sessions. Clinic sessions for each subject took place during four distinct periods: days 1, 2 and 3; days 7 and 8; days 9 and 12, and days 13 and 14. During each clinic session, each subject’s glucose was manipulated to achieve sustained periods of either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or both.

Study 2 enrolled 139 pediatric subjects with diabetes. Of these, $9 8 . 6 \%$ were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, while $1 . 4 \%$ with Type 2 diabetes. All subjects required insulin to manage their diabetes. Subjects wore 2 sensors for up to 14 days. Subjects age six and older took part in up to two eight-hour clinical sessions. No YSI comparator measurements were obtained for subjects 4-5 years of age, and performance for these subjects was compared against self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) tests. Clinic sessions for each subject took place during four distinct periods: days 1, 2 and 3; days 7 and 8; days 9 and 12, and days 13 and 14. During each clinic session, each subject’s glucose was manipulated to achieve sustained periods of either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or both.

In Study 1 and Study 2, accuracy of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated by comparing iCGM glucose values to reference glucose values. Glucose values were obtained from the system and from the comparator at the same or similar time. In both studies, absolute differences in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ of values compared to the comparator method were calculated for all values below $7 0 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ . For values of $7 0 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ and above, percentage differences compared to the comparator method were calculated.

# Trend Accuracy

Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose and is characterized by slopes, such as from $> 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to ${ < } { - } 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Trend accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change (changes in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ of glucose per minutes) determined by the iCGM trend arrow and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

# Agreement When iCGM Reads ‘LO’ or ‘HI’

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Glucose Monitoring System reports glucose readings between 40 and $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . When the system determines that the glucose reading is below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘LO’ whenever the sensor is scanned. When the system determines that the glucose reading is above $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned. Because the system does not display glucose values below $4 0 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ or above $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator) when the iCGM value is classified as ‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are evaluated separately. The cumulative percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’) and when comparator values were more that certain glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in the tables below.

# Alarm Performance

The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms. The Alarm Rate tells you how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells you how often the System recognizes and notifies you about a low or high glucose event.

# Low Glucose Alarm Performance

True Alarm Rate

Tells you: When you got a low glucose alarm, were you actually low?

Definition: Percentage of time the alarm issued and blood glucose was below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

False Alarm Rate

Tells you: Did you get a low glucose alarm that you shouldn’t have?

Definition: Percentage of time the alarm issued and blood glucose was not below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

Detection Rate

Tells you: When you were low, did you get a low glucose alarm?

Definition: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm issued within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

Missed Detection Rate

Tells you: When you were low, did you miss a low glucose alarm?

Definition: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm didn’t issue within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

For example, the Adult study found that for a Low Glucose alarm level set to $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ : $8 6 . 0 \%$ of the time a low glucose alarm was received when blood glucose was below the alarm level but $1 4 . 0 \%$ of the time a low glucose alarm was received when blood glucose was not below the alarm level.

$8 9 . 3 \%$ of the time blood glucose was below the alarm level and a low glucose alarm was appropriately issued but $1 0 . 7 \%$ of the time the glucose event was missed and no alarm was issued.

The FreeStyle Libre 2 System provides significant benefits to users (including glucose readings, trends, real time alerts, a short sensor warm-up period, factory calibration, and the ability to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices where the user manually controls actions for therapy decisions) that outweigh any potential risks associated with iCGM technology. Clinical studies in adult and pediatric patients have demonstrated that the FreeStyle Libre 2 System provides accurate and reliable glucose readings in accordance with the iCGM special controls relating to accuracy and does not post any clinically significant risks not seen with the predicate device. Accordingly, based on this and the data provided in this pre-market notification, the subject device and predicate device have been shown to be substantially equivalent.
