II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New device   
B Measurand: Glucose in Interstitial Fluid   
C Type of Test: Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System is a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device with real time alarms capability indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 4 and older. It is intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions, unless otherwise indicated.

The System also detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments. Interpretation of the System readings should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time.

The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices. The System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices where the user manually controls actions for therapy decisions.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin suspend systems.

Taking ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Inaccurate sensor readings due to ascorbic acid interfernce may be clinically significant and result in harm if relied on to make treatment decisions. Taking more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event.

The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could cause incorrect readings.

Do not use this system if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.

Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care professional.

Do not use the Sysetm in people less than 4 years of age.

Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the "check blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours or wearing a Sensor. In additoin, use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions if your Sensor glucose reading does not match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a number.

Wash application site on the back of your upper arm using a plain soap, dry, and then clea with an alcohol wipe. This will hep remove any oily residue that may prevent the sensor from sticking properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Carefully preparing the site according to these instructions will help the Sensor stay on your body for the full 14-day wear period and help prevent it from falling off early.

Store the Sensor Kit between $3 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ and $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ . If you suspect that the temperature may exceeed $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (e.g., an un-airconditioned home in the summer), you should refridgerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.

You must scan the Sensor to get your real-time current glucose level as the Reader will not provide this information without a scan.

The Readers's built-in meter is not for use on people who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock, or for individuals in hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis.

The Reader's built-in meter is not for use on neonates, in critically-ill patients, or for diagnosis or screening of diabetes.

Take standard precautions for transmission of blood borne pathogens to avoid contamination.

Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed by the manufacturer as compatible with the System may cause inaccuracte glucose readings.

If a Sensor breaks inside a user’s body, they should call their healthcare professional.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System (hereon referred to as the ‘FreeStyle Libre 2 System or ‘System’) is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide glucose levels, trends and alerts. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System consist of two primary components: a sensor which transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and a BLE enabled display device (Reader). Userinitiated scanning provides the user with current glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose graph). The user may determine their treatment based on the glucose values provided by the

System. The Reader does not provide glucose values, arrows, or graph information to users in the absence of a user-initiated action (a sensor scan). The Reader only monitors glucose values in real-time to provide alerts and alarms which, when enabled, warn the user of Low Glucose, High Glucose or Signal Loss and prompt the user to scan the Sensor.

FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor

The Sensor is single use and disposable. The Sensor is provided as two secondary components, Sensor Applicator and Sensor Pack (sterile device) which are used to assemble and apply the Sensor to the back of the user’s arm. The Sensor continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and has an 8-hour memory capacity. The Sensor is factory calibrated, does not require fingerstick calibration and can be worn for up to 14 days.

FreeStyle Libre 2 Reader

• The Reader is a small handheld device, which uses RFID communication to start new sensors and to scan sensors to display and record data. It also uses BLE communication to issue alarms that notify the user to perform a user-initiated scan when glucose has passed a high or low glucose threshold. The Reader also has a builtin strip port with blood glucose meter functionality (that is intended to work with the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose test strips, cleared under K171941), and a user interface which includes event logging features. Modifications to the blood glucose meter functionality include the addition of a BLE chip. (The modifications would not impact the blood glucose meter performance, therefore new performance data was not evaluated in this submission.)

The FreeStyle Libre 2 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic interfaces. The System is intended to be used where the user utilizes CGM information to manually control actions for therapy decisions. The device is also designed, and has been validated, to be able to provide real-time glucose information to other digitally connected devices that are authorized to be used in that manner. The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including full closed loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin suspend (e.g., threshold suspend and predictive low glucose suspend) systems.

# B Principle of Operation:

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System uses an electrochemical sensor to monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor incorporates both the subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor uses a glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to a metal electrode, producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the interstitial fluid. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for display on the handheld Reader.

2. Linearity:

The reportable range for the FreeStyle Libre 2 System is 40 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Certain endogenous and exogenous substances in the interstitial fluid may interfere with iCGM measurements. The types of potential interference and the extent of bias are dependent on the test principle of the sensor technology. For this device, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been shown to significantly interfere with system performance.

A clinical study was conducted to evaluate ascorbic acid interference for the FreeStyle Libre 2 System. This was a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study that enrolled 60 subjects at 4 sites. The study was designed to evaluate performance of the system in people with diabetes (age 18 and older) taking ascorbic acid. Each subject wore two sensors, one on the back of each upper arm, for a period of up to 10 days.

The interference effect of ascorbic acid on the Freestyle Libre 2 System was assessed by the difference $\mathrm { ( m g / d L ) }$ between CGM and comparator method (CM), in this case the Yellow Springs Instrument Life Sciences 2300 STAT PlusTM Glucose and Lactate Analyzer, readings at baseline and after each ascorbic acid doses. In this study, maximum bias was observed approximately 2 to 3 hours after each ascorbic acid dose.

The maximum average bias was $+ 9 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ after one $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ dose. The maximum average total biases were $1 8 . 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $1 9 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (vs. baseline) after the second and third 1000 mg doses (given every 4 hours), respectively. Based on the clinical study to assess vitamin C interference and the bench studies, the expected positive bias from a single dose of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was estimated to be approximately $4 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The sponsor’s bench dose response studies demonstrated that ascorbic acid interference is proportional to ascorbic acid concentration and is independent of the background glucose concentration. Therefore, there is significant risk that a positive bias of $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 2 0 \ m g / d L }$ when true glucose values are low (e.g., 65-70) could lead users to miss clinically important low glucose values. This bias is also in the context of an additional positive systemic bias in the Sensor in the low glucose range. In the absence of high dose vitamin C supplementation, information in the public domain suggests that the mean vitamin C intake (dietary intake and low dose supplement combined) of the intended use population is less than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per day. However, high dose vitamin C supplements (e.g., $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per dose) are common, and may be taken sporadically (e.g. at times of air travel or illness). In addition, some people take high dose supplements more than once per day. Finally, vitamin C levels not always clearly understood by lay users. For example, one gram may seem smaller than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ to users who do not completely understand the metric system.

The Benefit/Risk Analysis completed at the time of the De Novo request for evaluation of automatic class III designation for the predicate device that resulted in the iCGM regulation states that “risks of this device include … Use of an iCGM as part of another digitally connected medical device system, such as an AID system, when the iCGM has inadequate analytical or clinical performance to support the intended use of the digitally connected device”. The Special Controls proposed mitigating this risk by stating that “(4) The device must demonstrate clinically acceptable performance in the presence of clinically relevant levels of potential interfering substances that are reasonably present in the intended use population, including but not limited to endogenous substances and metabolites, foods, dietary supplements, and medications.”

iCGM systems have multiple types of uses. They are generally used to generate glucose readings for the management of diabetes, to send alarms as a safety feature, and provide the convenience of digital connection to many devices. One of the proposed uses of the Freestyle Libre 2 System is to replace most blood glucose readings that users would need to make treatment decisions. We considered that some blood glucose meters have interference from vitamin C and other compounds, and labeling language has been frequently used to mitigate those risks. Labeling in the case of certain interferences for blood glucose meters is adequate mitigation because the user evaluates each reading prior to using it to make a treatment decision to determine whether it matches the way they feel and their current activities/actions. We determined that when the Freestyle Libre 2 system is for a use similar to a blood glucose meter, where users make decisions themselves for each reading, labeling is also adequate to mitigate the risks of this high bias due to vitamin C. For example, if a user sees sensor readings that look incorrect to them, they may realize that they took vitamin C, or take a blood glucose reading, and take safe action to adjust their response to the sensor readings.

The following statements have been placed in the device labeling to inform users of the risk of falsely high glucose results when taking vitamin C containing supplements:

User Manual Warning: Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found in supplements including multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies such as Airborne $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Emergen- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { C } \mathbf { \otimes }$ , may contain high doses of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid and should not be taken while using the Sensor. See your healthcare professional to understand how long ascorbic acid is active in your body. Reader Screen Warning: Do not take high doses of vitamin C (more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per day). This may falsely raise your Sensor readings. Supplements like Airborne or

Emergen-C have high doses of vitamin C. Read labeling for all supplements to determine vitamin C content.

However, when values from the Freestyle Libre 2 system are used automatically by an AID system to start or stop insulin or other medications, the user has less opportunity to recognize the interference prior to erroneous treatment. The risks introduced by this interference when used with an AID system are greater than for similar iCGM devices, yet the benefits are largely equal. Therefore, the benefits do not outweigh the risks for that use. Thus, the Freestyle Libre 2 system must not be used with AID systems.

# 4. Assay Reportable Range:

The reportable range for the FreeStyle Libre 2 System is 40 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): The FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor has a storage shelf-life of 9 months. Shelf-life was evaluated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } - 8 2 ^ { \circ }$ Fahrenheit within the humidity range of $1 0 \% - 9 0 \%$ .

6. Detection Limit:

If a glucose measurement is less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result will be displayed by the system as ‘LO’. If the glucose measurement exceeds $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result will be displayed as ‘HI’. Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.

To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System, two prospective clinical studies were conducted in the United States at five and four centers, respectively.

Study 1 enrolled 146 adult subjects with diabetes $( 9 1 . 1 \%$ with Type 1 diabetes and $8 . 9 \%$ with insulin-requiring Type 2 diabetes). Subjects wore 2 sensors for up to 14 days but accuracy analysis is based on the first applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects took part in up to three ten-hour clinical sessions that took place during four distinct periods: Days 1-3; Days 7- 8; Days 9-12, and Days 13-14. During each clinic session, each subject’s glucose was manipulated to observe data spanning the measuring range.

Study 2 enrolled 139 pediatric subjects with diabetes $9 8 . 6 \%$ with Type 1 diabetes and $1 . 4 \%$ with insulin-requiring Type 2 diabetes). Subjects wore 2 sensors for up to 14 days and accuracy analysis is based on the first applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects age six and older took part in one or two eight-hour clinical sessions. Self-monitoring blood glucose meter (SMBG) was used as the comparator method for subjects 4-5 years of age. Clinic sessions for each subject took place during four distinct periods: Days 1-2; Days 7-8; Days 9- 12, and Days 13-. During each clinic session, glucose levels were manipulated in Subjects 11 years and older to observe data spanning the measuring range. Subjects 10 years and younger underwent observation only without glucose manipulation.

In both studies, accuracy of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated by comparing iCGM glucose values to an FDA-cleared laboratory grade comparator method (YSI 2300) for subjects 6 years and older, and to SMBG in subjects 4-5 years old.

Glucose values were obtained from the system and from the comparator at the same or similar time. In both studies, absolute differences in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ of values compared to the comparator method were calculated for all values below $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For values of $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and above, percentage differences compared to the comparator method were calculated.

# Trend Accuracy

Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose and is characterized by slopes, such as from $> 2 \mathrm { m g / d L / m i n }$ to ${ < } { - } 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L / m i n }$ . Trend accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

When the system determines that the glucose reading is below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘LO’ whenever the sensor is scanned. When the system determines that the glucose reading is above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned. Because the system does not display glucose values below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator) when the iCGM value is classified as ‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are evaluated separately. The cumulative percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’) and when comparator values were more that certain glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in the tables below.

# Alarm Performance

The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms. The Alarm Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells the user how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high glucose event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).

# Low Glucose Alarm Performance

True Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

False Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was not below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm issued within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

Missed Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm didn’t issue within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

# Sensor Stability

Sensor stability describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can be worn for up to 14 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the absolute relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of device readings within $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $1 5 \%$ $( 1 5 / 1 5 \% )$ , $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $20 \%$ $( 2 0 / 2 0 \% )$ and 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ or 405 $( 4 0 / 4 0 \% )$ of the comparator values during the beginning, early middle, late middle, and end of the wear period. These times were defined as follows:

Beginning (Adult Days 1-3, Pediatric: Days 1-2) • Early Middle (Adult: Days 7-8, Pediatric: Days 7-8), • Late Middle (Adult: Days 9-12, Pediatric: Days 9-12), and End (Adult: Days 13-14, Pediatric: Days 13-14).

The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and agreement rates with the comparator method were evaluated over 14 day life of the sensor.

# Sensor Life

The Sensor can be worn for up to 14 days. 146 Sensors were evaluated in the Adult Study and 139 Sensors were evaluated in the Pediatric Study to determine how many days of readings each Sensor provided. Of the 146 Sensors in the Adult study, $7 1 . 1 \%$ lasted until the final day of use. Six (6) Sensors $( 4 . 1 \% )$ had “early sensor shut-off” where the Sensor algorithm detected that the Sensors did not function as intended and presented the user with a “Replace Sensor” message. In the Pediatric study, $7 8 . 1 \%$ of the Sensors lasted until the final day of use. Three (3) Sensors $( 2 . 2 \% )$ had “early sensor shut-off” and presented the user with a “Replace Sensor” message.

A separate analysis was done regarding early sensor terminations due to sensor knock-offs (when a sensor falls off due to being forcibly pushed off). All adult and pediatric subjects wore two sensors (one on each arm) and all sensors worn within the study were included in the sensor survival rate analysis. It was observed that sensors worn on the patient’s dominant arm were more likely to be knocked off than those worn on the non-dominant arm.

In a previously conducted adult sensor wear study, participants cleaned the sensor application site with soap and water prior to sensor application. It was observed that those subjects who cleaned the application site appropriately were able to achieve the full 14-day sensor wear time. To mitigate the risk of early sensor termination due to sensor knock off and failure to clean insertion site, the following information was provided in the User Guide:

Wash application site using a plain soap, dry, and then clean with an alcohol wipe. This will help remove any oily residue that may prevent the Sensor from sticking properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Note: The area MUST be clean and dry following these instructions, or the Sensor may not stay on for the full 14-day wear period.

A third clinical study was also conducted to further evaluate wear duration in subjects who first washed the insertion site with a plain soap and water, according to the full instructions in the labeling and wore only a single Sensor. Of the 39 Sensors evaluated in this study, 38 sensors $( 9 7 \% )$ lasted until the final day of use (14 days).

# Glucose Reading Availability

The System is designed to show a Sensor glucose reading after each scan that is performed throughout the wear period after the start-up time. As such, the capture rate characterizes the reliability of the communication between components of the system.
