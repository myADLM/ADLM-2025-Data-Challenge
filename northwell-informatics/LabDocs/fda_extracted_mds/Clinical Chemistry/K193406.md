Dear Margo Enright:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

# 5. Device Description:

The CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Plus Home analyzers are professional $\mathbf { \Gamma } ( \operatorname { R x } )$ use (CardioChek Plus) and home use/OTC (CardioChek Plus Home) in vitro diagnostic systems to measure various analytes in capillary fingerstick whole blood for both home and professional use and in venous whole blood for professional use only for glucose, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

The system includes a small analyzer and test strips. The analyzers utilize PTS Diagnostics brands of dry strip chemistry test strips. The test strips are singleuse and utilize one of two types of technologies: reflectance photometry and amperometric/electrochemical technology.

The test strips are used with the CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Plus Home analyzers to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose in whole blood. The test strips utilize enzymatic methods on dry colorimetric test strips that are read by reflectance photometry or amperometric/electrochemical test strips that measure the current produced when blood is applied to the test strip. These test strips are for in vitro diagnostic use only.

The analyzer has software that converts the reflectance or current produced into an analyte concentration by comparing the reading to a lot-specific calibration curve that is programmed into a EEPROM MEMo chip that is inserted into the analyzer. Each vial of test strips includes a lot-specific MEMo chip, thus eliminating any need for the user to calibrate the system.

The analyzer is powered by 4 AA alkaline batteries.

# 7. Purpose of Submission

This 510(k) submission is for a modification of the CardioChek Plus Test System and CardioChek Home Test System, originally cleared May 22, 2015, under K140068. The modification for which this 510(k) is being submitted is a modification to the battery compartment of the analyzer case back. The CardioChek Plus/ Home test systems are the same as that described in the 510(k) Summary for K140068 and more recently cleared under K162282.

The modification is a redesign of the battery compartment in the back of the analyzer case. This modification prevents the negative terminal of the battery from contacting the positive terminal of the case when batteries are accidently inserted with the polarity reversed. This user error (reversed polarity) could result in the batteries overheating in the current design if replacement batteries from one manufacturer are incorrectly inserted. The modification prevents any battery overheating.

# 8. Predicate:

K140068 CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Home Test System

# 9. Reason for 510(k): Device Modification

The CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Plus Home test systems are modified to include a modification to the battery compartment of the analyzer case back. The modification is a design change that eliminates the potential for battery overheating if batteries are accidently inserted with the polarity reversed (incorrect insertion). Test strips used with these systems have been cleared under twenty-five 510(k)s since 1998, including most recently: K162282 and K151545.

# Statement of Substantial Equivalence;

The modified CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Plus Home analyzers and modified CardioChek Plus System and CardioChek Plus Home System are modifications of the same devices as previously cleared and are substantially equivalent.
