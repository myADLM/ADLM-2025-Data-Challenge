# D Special Instrument Requirements:

CardioChek Plus Analyzer CardioChek Plus Home Analyzer

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Plus Home Test Systems consist of the analyzer and analyte specific test strips. The CardioChek Test Systems consist of both a reflectance photometer and amperometer. Test strips for measuring cholesterol, lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, and glucose by reflectance are available for use with the systems. Additional glucose test strips (eGlu test strips) are available to determine glucose amperometrically. The test strips are packaged in a vial with a MEMo Chip (contains lot specific test strip information) and instructions. The analyzer is provided with analyzer check strips to use as a check of the electronic and optical components of the analyzer. Certain test strip box configurations may include a single-use only blood lancet (previously cleared under k920562). Quality control materials are available for purchase separately: PTS Panels multi-chemistry controls (Level 1 and Level 2) and PTS Panels HDL cholesterol controls (Level 1 and Level 2).

# B Principle of Operation:

The CardioChek analyzers employs both light reflectance and electrochemical biosensor technology to measure an enzymatic chemical reaction. When a blood sample is applied to a reflectance test strip, a chemical reaction occurs that produces a color change on the test strip. When blood is applied to an electrochemical test strip, an electrical current is produced. The resulting color or current is measured and compared to a calibration curve stored in the lotspecific MEMo Chip. The analyzer converts this color or current reading into a test result (the darker the color or greater the electrical current, the higher the analyte concentration) that is displayed on the meter.

1. Instrument Name:

CardioChek Plus Analyzer CardioChek Plus Home Analyzer

2. Specimen Identification:

Test results are automatically stored in the CardioChek analyzer’s memory. The analyzer can store up to 50 results of each analyte and 10 results for control tests. The analyzer allows review of the results in order from the most recent to the oldest. Each result is displayed with time and date.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The CardioChek Plus Test System is intended to be used with venous whole blood and capillary whole blood from the fingertip and the CardioChek Plus Home Test System is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

4. Calibration:

Each package of test strips contains a MEMo Chip that contains lot specific test strip information such as the calibration curve, test strip lot number and the measuring range for each test. The MEMo Chip must be inserted into the meter to run a test with blood or quality control material. The labeling instructs the user to match the lot number code on the test strip vial, MEMo Chip and analyzer.

# 5. Quality Control:

Liquid quality control materials for use with the systems can be purchased separately: PTS Panels multi-chemistry controls (Level 1 and Level 2) and PTS Panels HDL cholesterol controls (Level 1 and Level 2). Recommendations on when to perform a control test are provided in the labeling. The analyzers have a Control Test setting for the user to select when performing the test so that Control results will be stored in the meter separately from the patient results. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control results fall outside the ranges provided on the range card provided with the controls.

Analyzer check strips are provided for use with the analyzers to check that the analyzer’s electronic and optical systems are functioning properly. It is recommended that the check strip verification be performed: daily, if the analyzer has been dropped, or if a result is inconsistent with expected results.

# A Analytical Performance:

The CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Plus Home Test Systems consist of the same physical analyzer and test strips. The differences between the systems include the intended use setting (prescription use in professional healthcare settings vs. over-the-counter), the claimed sample types and the names.

1. Precision/Reproducibility: See k140068, k151545 and k162282 for the candidate systems and test strips.

2. Linearity: See k140068, k151545 and k162282 for the candidate systems and test strips.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

See k140068, k151545 and k162282 for the candidate systems and test strips.

The following are included in the labeling for both systems:

- Dopamine and methyldopa decreased the results of HDL cholesterol.   
- Extremely high doses of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) may decrease HDL results. Normal concentrations of Vitamin C did not affect the glucose results.   
- Grossly lipemic samples may interfere with some methodologies.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

The reportable ranges have not changed. The reportable ranges are listed in the package insert for each test strip as:

Glucose: $4 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ Cholesterol (total): $1 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Lipoprotein (HDL): $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Triglyceride: $5 0 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$
