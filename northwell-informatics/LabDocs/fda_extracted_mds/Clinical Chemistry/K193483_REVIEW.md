# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

New Device

# B Type of Test:

Not applicable

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

Basal-IQ technology is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps to automatically suspend delivery of insulin based on iCGM readings and predicted glucose values.

Basal-IQ technology is intended for the management of diabetes mellitus in persons six years of age and greater.

Basal-IQ technology is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.

Basal-IQ technology is indicated for use with NovoLog or Humalog U-100 insulin.

The bolus calculator is indicated for the management of diabetes by people with diabetes by calculating an insulin dose or carbohydrate intake based on user entered data.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The pump is not intended for anyone unable or unwilling to:

• Test blood glucose (BG) levels as recommended by a healthcare provider   
• Maintain sufficient diabetes selfcare skills   
• See a healthcare provider(s) regularly

The user must also have adequate vision and/or hearing in order to recognize pump alerts.

The t:slim X2 pump, transmitter, and sensor must be removed before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or diathermy treatment. Exposure to MRI, CT, or diathermy treatment can damage the components.

ONLY use U-100 Humalog or NovoLog with your pump.

Only U-100 Humalog and NovoLog have been tested and found to be compatible for use in the pump. Use of insulin with lesser or greater concentration can result in under delivery or over delivery of insulin. This can cause hypoglycemia (low BG) or hyperglycemia (high BG) events.

ALWAYS use cartridges manufactured by Tandem Diabetes Care. Use of any other cartridge brand may result in over delivery or under delivery of insulin. This can cause hypoglycemia (low BG) or hyperglycemia (high BG) events.

DO NOT reuse cartridges. Reuse of cartridges may result in over delivery or under delivery of insulin. This can cause hypoglycemia (low BG) or hyperglycemia (high BG) events.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Device Description

Basal‐IQ technology is a Predictive Low Glucose Suspend (PLGS) algorithm for the management of diabetes mellitus and is compatible with an Alternate Controller Enabled Infusion Pump (cleared under 21 CFR 880.5730)(ACE pump). Basal-IQ technology is only compatible with the Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump (DEN180058). The Basal-IQ software and algorithm can receive interstitial sensor glucose values from a compatible iCGM system (cleared under 21 CFR 862.1355), via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. Compatible iCGM systems are cleared and marketed separately from the Basal‐IQ algorithm and are identified in device labeling.

Basal‐IQ assesses glucose information provided by a paired iCGM and sends commands to a compatible ACE pump to temporarily suspend insulin delivery in cases of impending or detected low blood glucose. Every 5 minutes, the Basal‐IQ feature assesses glucose information provided by the iCGM to predict whether glucose values will fall below $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in the next 30 minutes or detect if glucose levels are currently below $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Under these conditions it will command the compatible pump to suspend insulin delivery; otherwise insulin delivery continues as normal. After insulin delivery is suspended, insulin delivery resumption is commended when the system detects glucose values begin to rise. A sustained suspension period when blood glucose is above the sensor suspend threshold is mitigated by a maximum suspend time where Basal‐IQ will command resume insulin delivery after 120 minutes of suspension within a 150 minute window. The Basal‐IQ technology uses CGM sensor readings to send commands to a compatible insulin pump to stop and resume insulin based on the current sensor value and a 30 minute future predicted value along with the following rules:

1. Insulin delivery is suspended if the current CGM sensor reading is less than $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
2. Insulin delivery is suspended if the glucose value is predicted to be less than $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in 30 minutes.   
3. Basal insulin delivery is resumed once the current CGM sensor reading increases compared to the previous reading.   
4. Basal insulin delivery will also be resumed if the 30 minute predicted CGM reading is above $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , even if the CGM reading has not increased compared to the previous reading.   
5. Basal insulin delivery is resumed if insulin delivery has been suspended for 2 hours in a 2.5 hour window.

The software comprising the Basal‐IQ algorithm also includes an insulin bolus dose calculator. This calculator is for assisting patients with Type 1 diabetes who use insulin pumps as their insulin delivery therapy. It is used to calculate insulin bolus doses of rapid acting U‐100 insulin analogs (Humalog and Novolog). The bolus calculator is used with manually-inputted glucose values and pump insulin delivery data to generate bolus size recommendations.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

Basal-IQ technology algorithm was previously approved as part of the T-slim X2 Insulin Pump with Basal-IQ Technology under P180008. Basal-IQ technology described in this submission consists of an identical insulin delivery algorithm and capacity for compatibility with an ACE pump and iCGM. No new non-clinical laboratory studies were conducted to validate the BasalIQ technology separately from the system approved in P180008, in order to enable compatibility with and Alternate Controller Enabled (ACE) Infusion Pump (cleared under 21 CFR 880.5730) or integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM, under 21CFR 862.1355). The BasalIQ technology is the same algorithm as reviewed in P180008, therefore no additional testing was conducted.

Software modifications were made to the Tandem insulin pump to add the Basal-IQ technology algorithm. Comprehensive verification and validation testing was conducted to confirm that the software used in the pump with Basal-IQ technology met all specified requirements and performed as intended.

# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

Summary of Clinical Testing:

A total of 107 subjects with Type 1 Diabetes were enrolled at 4 sites in the United States (US). The study was a multi-center, randomized, at home, crossover design evaluation of subjects with type 1 diabetes. Study subjects enrolled were either insulin pump users, multiple daily injection of insulin (MDI) users, CGM naïve users (may be pump or MDI users), or experienced CGM users (may be pump or MDI users). Of the 107 subjects enrolled (over the age of 6 years old) five subjects did not complete the study.

The 102 study subjects participated in a crossover design study, consisting of two 3- week periods with the t:slim X2 Insulin Pump with Basal-IQ (Basal-IQ enabled) used during one period and Sensor Augmented Pump (SAP) used during the other period. The crossover design study was preceded by a run-in phase in which participants received training using the study devices.

The performance data presented demonstrates that the Basal-IQ technology of the already approved t:slim X2 Insulin Pump paired with the Dexcom G5 CGM (P140015/S020) can be used safely and that it functions as intended. The analysis of input specifications is adequate to assure reasonable safety and effectiveness when iCGM sensors are used with the system as well. Additionally, the performance data demonstrates that the Basal-IQ technology functions as intended to stop and resume insulin delivery in response to low and high glucose levels, respectively.
