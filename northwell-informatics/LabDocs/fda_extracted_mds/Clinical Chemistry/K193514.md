# Device Description

The AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System is a fully automated urine analyzer that provides a semi-quantitative or qualitative measurement for glucose, protein, bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrites, leukocytes, specific gravity, turbidity, and color tone. The AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System consists of AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer and AUTION Sticks 9EB test strips.

The AUTION Sticks 9EB test strips consist of a plastic strip containing 9 dry chemistry reagent pads impregnated with chemical substances for the determination of the above analytes in urine. These substances if present in urine leads to a chemical reaction that results in a color change, which is measured by the AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer based on spectrophotometry. In addition, three additional parameters, specific gravity, turbidity, and color tone are directly measured based on reflectance refractometry, transmitted and scattered light measurements.

# Substantial Equivalence

AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System was developed as the successor to the predicate device AUTION MAX AX-4030 Urinalysis System. The device uses the same intendeduse claims as the predicate. The AX-4060 system utilizes the same principles and technology and shares the identical 9EB test strips for measuring the same urine analytes in a semiquantitative or qualitative manner similar to the predicate device. Some important device parts such as LED and Nozzle dispensing units were changed in the AX-4060 System due to a change in manufacturing source and the device was optimized to generate similar performance to the predicate device.

As described in the Performance Characteristics Section below, the verification and validation (bench and clinical) testing demonstrated substantial equivalence for the AX-4060 System with AUTION Sticks 9EB test strips to the predicate device. Bench testing supports that the AX-4060 System performs to meet specifications for precision, linearity, limits of detection (LOD), sensitivity, carryover and interference. Additionally, software testing, electrical safety testing and EMC testing also met performance criteria.

A list of similarities and differences between the proposed device and the predicate device is provided in Table 2.

# Test Principle:

The AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer measures analyte-specific test strips (AUTION Sticks 9EB) by dual-wavelength reflectance measurement (single wavelength for blood [BLD]). The AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System detects urine analytes based on chemical reaction on each test pad relative to the concentration of measured analytes present in the urine sample. The chemical reaction leading to the color change that occurs on each chemical test pad is listed below.

# Performance Characteristics

# Precision

Precision study included repeatability and reproducibility testing in accordance with the CLSI standard EP5-A3. Three (3) levels of quality controls were used to attain results at negative, mid-level positive and high-positive analyte ranges. Two (2) levels of commercial controls were used to obtain the 3 levels by mixing as needed to obtain the highest and midlevel controls for testing of all the analyte ranks. Each analyte was tested using 4 operators on 3 devices combined with 3 lots of reagents for a minimum of 20 days. Results for each level are presented in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5.

# Method Comparison

A method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the agreement of results from AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System to the FDA-cleared predicate device AUTION MAX AX-4030 Automated Urinalysis System. Testing was performed at two (2) clinical laboratories by using two (2) instruments and two (2) different lots of test strips. A total of 1374 samples, consisting of 1333 natural patient samples and 41 spiked samples, were tested across the sites.

The data from each site was combined and are presented in Table 6 showing percentages of Exact Match and within $+ / - 1$ Color Block Match for all analytes on test strips. Non-test strip items for turbidity and color tone are in the same templates of Table 7 and Table 8 as the test strip analytes.

# Interfering Substances

Evaluation of interfering substances influencing the accuracy of results on AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System was conducted with AUTION Sticks 9EB.

A list of interfering substances for a given analyte is provided in Table 9 below. The interfering substances and their highest concentrations tested with no interference are listed in Table 10 below.

Based on the interference testing, following limitations have been included in the labeling:

1. Elevated hematuria $( 6 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L ~ H b }$ , approximately $2 , 1 5 6 ~ \mathrm { R B C / \mu L } )$ ) has been shown to cause falsely lowered Leukocyte readings and should be considered when interpreting Leukocyte results.   
2. Samples from patients taking methyl dopa may be falsely elevated for blood, negative to trace at 67 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and negative to $+ 1$ at $2 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Patients taking the maximum daily dose of methyl dopa may have approximately $2 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ methyl dopa excreted in the urine.   
3. Patients taking SGLT2 or similar inhibitors may have extremely high urinary glucose values. Due to a hook effect on the glucose pad, if a patient’s urine glucose level is greater than $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , then falsely decreased glucose results may be obtained with the test.   
4. When acidic or alkaline compounds, such as ascorbic acid and sodium bicarbonate are taken internally for treatment or as supplements, they may affect urine pH.

\*\* Not all of the substances tested for interference demonstrated no significant interference for all analytes. For those substances that on initial screening were found to interfere with certain analytes, dose-response testing was conducted to establish the concentration limit below which no significant interference is expected. The results are given in Table 10 above.

# Limits of Detection and Sensitivity

Limits of detection and Minimum detection sensitivity were determined based on three instruments, and three reagent lots. Listed below in Table 11-14 are the quantitative values indicating the lower limit of the rank in which $50 \%$ or more of the results are falling into the specific rank.

# Proposed Labeling

Labeling adequately communicates the device’s intended use, safety precautions and directions for use. It satisfies 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices.

# Conclusion

The information provided in this 510(k) premarket notification supports that the AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System is substantially equivalent to the AUTION MAX AX-4030 Fully-Automated Urinalysis System.
