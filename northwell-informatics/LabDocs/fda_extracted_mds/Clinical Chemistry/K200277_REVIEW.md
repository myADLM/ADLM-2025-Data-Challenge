# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability (within-run precision):

The sponsor performed a repeatability (within-run) precision study using venous whole blood samples adjusted to six different glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400, and $4 0 1 { - } 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } $ ). Each of the six samples was analyzed in replicates of 10 with three test strips lots and 10 meters for a total of 300 test results per glucose level. The results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>45.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.49</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>78.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.33</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>126.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.37</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>192.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.13</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>337.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>491.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.37</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.5%</td></tr></table>

# Intermediate Precision:

Intermediate (day to day) precision was performed using six levels of glucose control solution samples with target glucose concentrations of 40, 80, 130, 200, 325, and $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each of the six samples was tested in one run per day for 10 days using three test strip lots and 10 meters, with 1 replicate per meter for a total of 300 test results per glucose level. The results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>46.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.41</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>89.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.6%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>141.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.08</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>229.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.37</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>359.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.88</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>546.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.15</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2%</td></tr></table>

2. Linearity:

Linearity was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to 10 concentrations spanning the measurement range with glucose concentrations of 25, 50, 80, 110, 170, 220, 330, 450, 550, and $6 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300. Each sample was tested with 10 meters in replicates of 10 per meter using 3 test strip lots for a total of 100 results per sample and test strip lot. The linear regression results are presented below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.988</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9968</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.980</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9984</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.976</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9974</td></tr></table>

The results of the linearity study support the claimed glucose measurement range of 40-600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

If a sample has glucose less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ an error message is displayed by the meter which reads: Severely Low: $< 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample has glucose greater than $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ an error message is displayed by the meter which reads: Severely High: $> 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . These error messages were validated using blood glucose samples outside the measuring range of the device to demonstrated that the error messages functioned as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The information to support the analytical specificity performance was provided and found to be acceptable.

The following statements are listed in the product labeling.

• If you are taking a high dose of vitamin C (blood concentration $> 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), the result from your meter may not be correct.

• Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing since xylose may cause inaccurate glucose results. Ask your doctor how long to wait before performing a glucose test.

4. Assay Reportable Range: The assay reportable range is $4 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability:

The system reports plasma-equivalent glucose values, and is calibrated by using the YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose Analyzer, which is traceable the NIST SRM 917b glucose reference material.

Test Strip Stability:

For the test strips, the labeling indicates a shelf life of 24 months and an open vial stability of 6 months when stored at the recommended storage conditions of $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } – 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (2- $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the labeled shelf life and open vial stability claims.

Method Comparison/Lay User Evaluation study

To assess the performance of Livongo Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BG1000) in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor conducted a user evaluation study consisting of 383 lay user participants who collected capillary samples from their fingertip and independently self-tested following only the product labeling in English. Greater than $10 \%$ of the participants were identified by questionnaire as a naïve users; i.e. not previously used any self-monitoring blood glucose system. Three test strip lots were used in the study. The results were analyzed by comparing the capillary blood glucose value obtained by the lay user with their system against a plasma glucose value measured in duplicate with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose Analyzer). The glucose concentrations across all samples ranged from 54 to $5 7 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which includes 20 native samples $< 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 50 samples $> 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by the comparator method. The results were analyzed for differences with the comparator, and by regression analysis, and are summarized below:

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

# 1. Hematocrit Study

To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Livongo Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BG1000), venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of $10 \%$ , $1 5 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $65 \%$ and $70 \%$ . Each hematocrit level was tested at six glucose concentration levels $( \sim 4 0$ , ${ \sim } 8 0$ , ${ \sim } 1 3 0$ , ${ \sim } 2 0 0$ , ${ \sim } 3 2 5$ , and ${ \sim } 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each sample was tested in replicates of ten using 30 meters on each of three test strip lots for a total of 90 measurements per sample. Results were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator measurement (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer). The evaluation of bias and percent bias relative to values obtained on the YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer support that hematocrit concentrations of $10 \mathrm { - } 7 0 \%$ do not impact test results.

# 2. Altitude Study

Information to support the claimed performance of the device at elevations up to 10,000 ft $( 3 , 0 4 8 \mathrm { m } )$ was reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# 3. Sample Volume Study

A study was conducted to verify the minimum sample volume requirement for the test strip. Venous whole blood samples at three glucose levels (50-65, 100-120, and $2 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ were tested at five sample volumes (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and $0 . 8 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) using three test strip lots. Glucose results obtained with the candidate device were compared to values obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer). The results of the study support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 6 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The results also demonstrated that with blood volumes below $0 . 6 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , an error message of insufficient sample volume functioned as intended.

# 4. Operating Conditions Study

The effect of combined operating temperature and relative humidity conditions on the Livongo Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BG1000) was evaluated using venous whole blood samples prepared at six glucose concentration levels (45.2, 103.0, 130.7, 202.4, 327.0, and $5 2 6 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Test strips from 3 lots were exposed to one of 7 relative humidity (RH) and temperature conditions $( 1 0 \% \mathrm { R H } / 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ $10 \%$ $\mathrm { R H } / 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $10 \%$ $, \mathrm { R H } / 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $90 \%$ $\mathrm { R H } / 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $90 \%$ $\mathrm { R H } / 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $90 \%$ $\mathrm { R H } / 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , or $4 5 \% \mathrm { R H } / 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ). The glucose results from the candidate device were compared to results obtained using the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS, and support the claimed operating conditions of $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ RH and 41-113F $( 5 . 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

5. Electrical Safety and EMC testing The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed, and the system was found to be compliant.

# 6. Infection Control Studies

The Livongo Glucose Monitoring System (BG1000) is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the meter materials by an outside commercial laboratory, demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant: PDI Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipe (EPA Registration number: 9480-4). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor using the Livongo Glucose Monitoring System demonstrating that there was no change in the performance of the system or in the external materials of the meter after 260 cycles of cleaning and disinfection using the chosen disinfectant. The robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning and disinfecting over the five year single-patient use life of the meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 7. Flex Studies

Drop testing, vibration testing, intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, and testing with used test strips were completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust

to these common use scenarios, and that the appropriate error messages are returned to the user if one of the situations has occurred.
