# Summary of the Technological Characteristics:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared for market Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer in intended use. It uses the same sensor technology and measurement algorithms, and the formulations of the internal and external controls and the calibration cartridge are the same for the tested parameters.

# Principle of Measurement:

Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Ionized Calcium, Ionized Magnesium:

The parameters are measured by an Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE) that selectively measures the activity of ionic species. When the ISE is contacted with a sample, potential is developed. The potential is proportional to the logarithm of the ionic activity and is measured versus a reference electrode.

# Summary of Performance Testing:

Bench testing was previously completed and summarized in k180428 to show that the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer demonstrates substantial equivalence to the predicate submission.

The bench testing included:

Method Comparison Studies   
• Precision/Reproducibility – Within Run and Run to Run Studies   
• Linearity Testing Specificity/Interference Testing Detection Limit

# Summary of Point-of-Care Testing:

A Point-of-Care (POC) study was conducted to show that the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer demonstrates substantial equivalence to the predicate submission. The testing compared results obtained by trained Healthcare Professionals to results obtained by POC personnel on the same specimens using the same analyzer. The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer was evaluated by point-of-care (POC) personnel in 3 POC sites including a Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU), an Emergency Department (ED) and a Respiratory Therapy Lab (RT). A total of 61 Respiratory Care, 12 Nursing, and 1 Exercise Physiology POC personnel participated from the 3 POC settings over the course of the study. The personnel represent trained, qualified staff found in typical POC sites where blood gas analyzers are utilized. All testing was performed using quality control materials or discarded blood gas specimens.

# Method Comparison Studies:

Method Comparison studies on venous and arterial whole blood specimens were conducted using methods described in CLSI “Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Second Edition”, CLSI EP9-A2. Combined method comparison data from all 3 POC settings is summarized in Table 1.
