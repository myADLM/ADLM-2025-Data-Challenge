c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrator traceability and value assignment

The IDS-iSYS Ostase® BAP kit calibrators are value assigned against in house secondary standard (IRs) using an internal QC procedure. The IR’s are value assigned against the predicate device (Ostase® BAP EIA assay) using the predicate assay procedure. Therefore, the kit calibrators are traceable to the predicate device via the secondary standards.

Calibrator Value Assignment and Verification Method

For kit calibrator value assignment, the kit calibrators are tested as unknowns in a minimum of 20 assay runs on one IDS-iSYS system. The secondary standards (IRs) are assayed in each of the runs, and the values of the Kit Calibrators are assigned with direct reference to the secondary standards (IRs). The assigned kit calibrator values are then verified following the IDS QC procedure; by running the assay on three different IDS systems and analyzing IQCs of known values across the range of the assay.

# Stability

Full kit stability was performed in which the kit calibrators were tested in combination with all kit combination reagents.

The stability based on real time studies determined a shelf life of 12 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined with guidance from CLSI EP17-A, “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation” in three (3) kit lots.

Each LoB sample was measured in duplicate, for a total of five assays in a five-day period, generating a total of 60 replicates per kit lot. Each kit lot was tested on a different instrument. Analyse-It software was used to calculate the LoB.

The LoD was determined using ten (10) samples with very low BAP concentrations. Each LoD sample was measured in duplicate, for a total of five assays in a five-day period per kit lot. Each kit lot was tested on a different instrument. Analyse-It software was used to calculate the LoD.

The LoQ was calculated using ten (10) samples with low BAP concentration. Each LoQ sample was measured in duplicate, for a total of five assays in a five-day period. Each kit lot was tested on a different instrument. Analyse-It software was used to calculate the predicted LoQ. The claim limit for each kit lot is the actual closest value to the AnalyseIt’s precited value.

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined with guidance from CLSI EP17-A, “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation” using 60 replicates of blank and 10 low level samples.

<table><tr><td>Sensitivity</td><td>BAP Concentration (μg/L)</td></tr><tr><td>LoB (Limit of Blank)</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>LoD (Limit of Detection)</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>LoQ (Limit of Quantitation)</td><td>0.5</td></tr></table>

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference and cross-reactivity studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP07-A3 Interference.

To determine potential interference, two serum samples at two different concentrations of BAP were spiked with the potential interferent. Control samples (blank) were spiked with a volume of Phosphate Buffer saline (PBS) $\mathrm { ( 0 \ n g / m L ) }$ or relevant diluent equal to that of the spiked interferent. The mean of 26 replicate assays, for both spiked and control samples, were then compared. The differences observed between the mean spiked and control sample values were examined and assessed according to acceptance criteria.

For Rheumatoid factor (Rf) or total cholesterol, the interference was tested by recovery of BAP from a high serum pool spiked into a serum sample with known Rf levels or cholesterol levels. $\%$ Interference was calculated using below formula:

$\%$ Interference $=$ (mean spiked concentration – mean un-spiked concentration) $\textbf { x } 1 0 0$

mean un-spiked concentration $\%$ Recovery was calculated using the formula below:

# 2. Comparison studies:

The IDS-iSYS Ostase® BAP assay was compared against the IDS Ostase® BAP EIA assay, following CLSI EP-9A2 “Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples”. A total of 150 samples, selected to represent a wide range of BAP concentrations [3.0 to $6 7 . 6 \mu \mathrm { g / L } ]$ , was assayed by each method. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed on the comparative data:

<table><tr><td>N</td><td>Slope</td><td>95% CI</td><td>Intercept (μg/L)</td><td>95% CI</td><td>Corr. Coefficient (r)</td></tr><tr><td>150</td><td>0.99</td><td>0.97 to 1.02</td><td>0.17</td><td>-0.1 to 0.5</td><td>0.99</td></tr></table>

3. Expected values/Reference range:

The BAP concentration was measured in serum samples collected from 419 apparently healthy donors from the United States using the IDS Ostase® BAP assay. The study population included 140 males (35 to 75 years of age), 140 pre-menopausal women (35 to 45 years of age) and 139 post-menopausal women (55 to 75 years of age). The observed ranges (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) were established, according to CLSI guideline C28-A3c, “How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory” are summarized in the below table:

<table><tr><td>Population</td><td>N</td><td>Age (years)</td><td>(μg/L)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>
