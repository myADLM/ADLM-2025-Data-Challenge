# Performance Characteristics: Modified ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D

# 8.1 Detection Limit

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined as described in CLSI Document EP17-A2.31 The ADVIA Centaur VitD assay had an LoB of $1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (4.3 nmol/L), an LoD of $3 . 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (8.0 nmol/L), and an LoQ of $4 . 2 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 1 0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ . The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of 25(OH)vitamin D that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. The LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration of 25(OH)vitamin D that can be detected at a total CV of $20 \%$ .

# 8.2 Linearity

Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI protocol EP6-A.35 A sample containing high levels of total 25(OH)vitamin D was mixed in various proportions with a sample containing low levels of total 25(OH)vitamin D. The resulting sample mixtures were assayed for total vitamin D. On the ADVIA Centaur systems, the VitD assay is linear from 4.2 to $1 5 0 \mathrm { \ n g / m L }$ .

# 8.3 Precision

The ADVIA Centaur VitD assay is designed to have a Within-Run precision CV of $\leq 8 \%$ , and a Total CV of $\leq 1 2 \%$ , with samples $>$ 20 ng/mL.

# 510(k) Summary

Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI protocol EP5-A2.32 Six samples were assayed twice a day in replicates of 2, over 20 days $\mathtt { \Pi } \mathtt { \Pi } \mathtt { \Pi } \mathtt { \tilde { n } } = 8 0$ replicates per sample) using the ADVIA Centaur VitD assay. The following results were obtained:

# 8.4 Method Comparison

For 126 samples (118 native, 8 contrived) in the range of $5 . 9 \ - \ 1 3 0 . 8 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (14.8 - 327.0 nmol/L), the relationship between the ADVIA Centaur VitD (y) and a comparable assay $( \mathsf { x } )$ is described using Deming regression:   
ADVIA Centaur VitD $( \mathsf { y } ) = 1 . 0 3 \ : ( \mathsf { x } ) + 0 . 8 5 \ : \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L } .$ $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 9$

# 8.5 Specimen Equivalence

Specimen equivalency was determined using a Weighted-Deming regression analysis in accordance with CLSI Document EP9-A2.

Sixty-six (66) native and 8 contrived matched set samples (serum, SST, Lithium Heparin, Sodium Heparin, K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA) for a total $\mathsf { n } { = } 7 4$ matched set samples. Weighted-Deming fit was used for regression analysis comparing all tube types to serum. The following results were obtained:

# 8.7 Reference Interval

A study was performed referencing CLSI EP28-A3c confirming that the previously established Reference Interval could be transferred to the modified VitD assay.

Observed reference values were obtained for the ADVIA Centaur VitD assay using serum samples collected from adult and pediatric populations. The adult population consisted of 291 apparently healthy male and female subjects of light and dark skin types ranging in age from 21–93 years. The pediatric population consisted of 237 male and female subjects of light and dark skin types: 32 subjects between the ages of 1–3 years, 114 subjects between 3–12 years, and 91 subjects between 12 and up to 21 years.

The samples were collected in different seasons and from different geographical regions of the United States. Adult samples from subjects not taking supplements containing vitamin $\mathsf { D } > 2 0 0 0$ IU per day, and with normal values for PTH, calcium, and TSH were included in this study.

Pediatric samples with normal values for PTH and TSH were included in this study. Based on the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval, the following values were established following CLSI guideline C28-A2.30

<table><tr><td></td><td>Observed Values, Adult ng/mL (nmol/L)</td><td>Observed Values, Pediatric (12 months up to 21 years)</td></tr><tr><td>Median 25(OH)vitamin D</td><td>22.5 ng/mL (56.3 nmol/L)</td><td>23.8 ng/mL (59.5 nmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td>Observed Range 2.5th to 97.5th Percentile</td><td> 7.4-44.0 ng/mL (18.5-110.0 nmol/L)</td><td>11.4-45.8 ng/mL (28.5114.5 nmol/L)</td></tr></table>

As with all in vitro diagnostic assays, each laboratory should determine its own reference range(s) for the diagnostic evaluation of patient samples.30 Consider these values as guidelines only.

# 510(k) Summary 9. Conclusions

Based on the results of comparative testing, the Modified ADVIA Centau $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Vitamin D Total (VitD) is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed predicate device, the ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Vitamin D Total (VitD) assay (k133156).
