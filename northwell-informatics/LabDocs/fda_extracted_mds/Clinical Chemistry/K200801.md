# D. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Device is intended for the collection, preservation and transport of oral fluid specimens for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine, morphine, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, 6-acetylmorphine, phencyclidine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, buprenorphine, methadone, benzodiazepines and tramadol. This device is for prescription use only.

An oral fluid specimen is collected by placing a cellulose pad affixed to a polypropylene stem (Collector) under the tongue of an individual until a defined volume of saliva has saturated the cellulose pad. The defined volume taken up by the cellulose pads is indicated by coloration (blue) in a window on the stem (volume adequacy). The collector is then transferred into a provided polypropylene tube containing a specific volume of preservative buffer. The tube is stoppered with provided caps. The specimen is ready for storage or transport.

The Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection System collects $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of neat oral fluid and dilutes it with 3 mL of preservative buffer. This results in a 1 to 4 dilution factor.

Immunalysis Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Device is sold as a stand-alone collection device.

# G. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

The following laboratory performance studies were performed to determine substantial equivalence of the Immunalysis Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Devices to the predicate device. Clinical and analytical performances were established using Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

# 1. Sample Volume

Seventy-five oral fluid samples from known drug users were collected using Quantisal collectors (collection pad with plastic stem). After the volume adequacy indicator turned blue on the collector stem, the collector was weighed and compared to the average weight of collector before collection. The difference in weight was noted. Specific gravity of saliva was rounded to 1.000 to compute the volume collection. The results confirmed consistency of sample volume of $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ collected by the Quantisal collector.

# 2. Sample Collection Time

Seventy-five oral fluid samples from known drug users were collected using Quantisal collector (collection pad with plastic stem). The collection time was documented. The results verified the sample collection time for Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Device is within the claimed time of 10 minutes in over $90 \%$ of subjects.

# 3. Drug Recovery

Drug free negative oral fluid spiked with the drug listed in Table 1 at $\pm 2 5 \%$ , $+ 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff were collected and stored in Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Device overnight at room temperature. LC-MS/MS or GC-MS testing was performed the next day to determine percentage recovery. The studies demonstrated the Quantisal Collection Device recovers tested drugs at greater than $80 \%$ of the original concentration.

# 7. Expectorated Oral Fluid Samples Processed Through Quantisal (Dipping Study)

At least sixty deidentified, unaltered drug containing oral fluid samples were collected by expectoration (spitting) at clinical research facility, and analyzed using LC-MS/MS or GC/MS. A minimum of ten samples of each drug were within $\pm 5 0 \%$ of the confirmation cutoffs listed in Table 3. A Quantisal device was introduced into each expectorated sample. The next day, Quantisal samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. 899/900 paired results meet the criteria that Quantisal concentration was within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the expectorated result. This study demonstrated no difference in drug concentrations in oral fluid when expectorated samples are compared to the same oral fluid subjected to Quantisal collection regardless of drug class. The Quantisal oral fluid collection device does not introduce bias to quantitative and qualitative results of expectoration neat oral fluid sample (clinical truth).

# 8. Drug Free Clinical Specimens

At least forty deidentified, unaltered drug free clinical oral fluid samples collected by expectoration (spitting) and Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Devices were obtained from clinical research facility, analyzed for drug listed in Table 3 using LC-MS/MS or GC/MS. The results of all expectorated samples and Quantisal samples are negative for each drug. The study demonstrated the accuracy of the Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Device when collecting drug free clinical specimens.

# H. CONCLUSION

The information provided in this premarket notification demonstrates that the Immunalysis Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Device is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device.
