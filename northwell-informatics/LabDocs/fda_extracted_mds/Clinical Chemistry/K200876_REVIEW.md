# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

For both the Dexcom G6 System and the Dexcom Glucose Program System:

• Remove the Dexcom G6 sensor, transmitter, and receiver before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The magnetic fields and heat could damage the components of the Dexcom G6 System, which may cause it to display inaccurate blood glucose readings or may prevent alerts.

When wearing the device, ask for hand-wanding or full-body pat-down and visual inspection instead of going through the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) body scanner. Also avoid putting any part of the device through baggage x-ray machine.

This device is not intended for pregnant women, people on dialysis, or critically ill patients.

• The device should not be used to make diabetes treatment decisions when

o The user has not used the iCGM before or is unfamiliar with the Dexcom G6 System. (It may take days, weeks or months for a user to gain confidence in using the iCGM to make treatment decisions.)   
$\bigcirc$ The user’s symptoms do not match the glucose values displayed by the device.   
$\bigcirc$ The device does not show a glucose value or a trend arrow.   
o During the first two hours of sensor warm-up period, the user should use a blood glucose meter to make treatment decisions.

Although standard dosing of acetaminophen ( $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per every 6 hours) does not appear to cause significant bias, higher supra-therapeutic levels of acetaminophen have shown significant positive bias.

Sensor glucose readings will be falsely higher if the user is taking hydroxyurea. Do not use your Dexcom CGM System for diabetes treatment decisions if you are taking hydroxyurea.

Adult users should only use the abdomen and pediatric users should only use the buttock or abdomen. Sensor performance has not been evaluated in other insertion sites and may differ from expected iCGM performance.

• If a sensor wire breaks or detaches from the sensor, it could remain under the user’s skin. The user should contact their healthcare practitioner if this occurs.

• The transmitter should not be shared to avoid transmission of bloodborne illnesses.

When using the smart device as a receiver, the user should follow the user manual instructions to ensure that all glucose values, important alarms and alerts can be seen and heard. Do not use headphones will using the smart device as a receiver. The app must always be running in the background of the smart device to ensure the user receives glucose values, alarms and alerts.

Before updating the smart device hardware or operating system, verify the compatibility of the updated hardware/software with the device system.

# For the Dexcom Glucose Program System Only:

The Dexcom Glucose Program System does not alert or alarm the user when the glucose is low (below the target range), high (above the target range), or rapidly changing. Users should check readings often if they need to know their glucose level.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not applicable.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

DEXCOM G6 CONTINOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM (called the DEXCOM G6 SYSTEM hereafter)

The Dexcom G6 System in an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose readings which are updated every 5 minutes providing glucose levels, trends, and alerts. The System consists of three main components: a sensor, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter and a BLE enabled display device (receiver and/or mobile application). The user can view glucose data on the receiver or on the G6 CGM App (i.e., a mobile medical application) running on a compatible mobile device, or on both simultaneously.

The system provides alerts and alarms which warn the user of low or impending low and high or impending high glucose levels. The user may determine their treatment based on the glucose values provided by the system.

# G6 CGM Sensor

The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator, plastic base (“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable unit that contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the needle and inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and can be worn for up to 10 days.

The sensor may be worn in the abdomen for adults, and both the abdomen and buttock for children ages 2-17 years old. Sensor comes with a calibration code that the user enters into the system upon initializing a new sensor. Once the code is applied, the user does not need to calibrate the system throughout the entirety of the sensor lifetime, which is 10 days. However, the user has the option to manually calibrate the system using self-measurements from a blood glucose meter in addition to entering the calibration code. Alternatively, if the user chooses not to enter the calibration code, he or she must manually calibrate the sensor by entering two fingerstick blood glucose values during start up and every 24 hours thereafter.

# G6 CGM Transmitter

The G6 CGM Transmitter is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data processing functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver for communication with a compatible display device (i.e., receiver and/or smart device). The transmitter attaches to the sensor and can be re-used for multiple sensing sessions up to three months.

The G6 CGM Receiver is small hand-held device that wirelessly receives glucose information from the transmitter every five minutes and includes a touchscreen display. The receiver displays the current glucose reading and glucose trends to the user. It alerts the user when glucose levels are outside of a target zone and when other important system conditions occur.

# Dexcom G6 System Mobile App

The G6 CGM App for iOS and G6 CGM App for Android provides an alternative display device to the receiver for users with a compatible, BLE-enabled smart device and behaves similarly to the receiver. The G6 CGM App is compatible with certain iOS, Android and Smart Device watches. The G6 CGM App for Android now includes a mechanism to ensure that mobile device operating system settings for Do Not Disturb cannot prevent the user from receiving auditory Urgent Low Glucose Alarms; this safety risk was present in previous versions of the Dexcom G6 Android Mobile App. A link to a list of compatible devices is included in the instructions for use.

The Dexcom G6 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic interfaces; including compatible AID systems. The G6 CGM system is designed to communicate with interoperable devices in several ways, such as described below:

• Wireless communication from the transmitter directly to an interoperable device communicating through the same protocol. • The app communicates to another app on a single mobile platform. • The app communicates through the cloud to another software device.

# DEXCOM G6 GLUCOSE PROGRAM CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM (called the DEXCOM GLUCOSE PROGRAM SYSTEM hereafter)

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program System is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose readings which are updated every 5 minutes providing glucose levels and trends. The System consists of three main components: a sensor, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter and a BLE enabled display device (receiver and/or mobile application). A user must use the Dexcom G6 Glucose Program App (i.e., a mobile medical application) running on a compatible mobile device in order to view glucose data.

# G6 Glucose Program CGM Sensor

The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator, plastic base (“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable unit that contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the needle and inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and can be worn for up to 10 days.

The sensor may be worn in the abdomen for adults, and both the abdomen and buttock for children ages 2-17 years old.

G6 Glucose Program Transmitter

The transmitter component is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data processing functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver for communication with a compatible display device (i.e., mobile device). The transmitter attaches to the sensor and can be re-used for multiple sensing sessions up to three months.

G6 Glucose Program Mobile App The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM App for Android is the primary display for the system. The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM App is compatible with specific Android devices. A link to a list of compatible devices is included in the instructions for use.

The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic interfaces. The G6 Glucose Program CGM system is designed to communicate with interoperable devices in several ways, such as described below:

• Wireless communication from the transmitter directly to an interoperable device communicating through the same protocol. • The app communicates to another app on a single mobile platform. • The app communicates through the cloud to another software device.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Dexcom G6 System and Dexcom Glucose Program System detect glucose levels from the fluid just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using an algorithm to a glucose value read in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which is then transmitted to the receiver/mobile application for the user to see and use accordingly.

# Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Dexcom G6 Glucose Program Continuous Glucose Monitoring System

2. Specimen Identification: Not applicable.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Not applicable.

# 4. Calibration:

Though the Dexcom G6 System and the Dexcom Glucose Program System do not require user calibration. Users have the option to calibrate the device manually (e.g., in situations where users do not have to use the calibration code). Therefore, a calibration stability evaluation was completed to demonstrate that the system could be calibrated manually without impact to system performance. Subjects were instructed to calibrate their CGM devices according to the explicit system requirements. Beginning two hours after sensor insertion, calibration prompts were provided on the receiver twice the first day and every 24 hours for the remainder of the study. To demonstrate the performance of the System over a calibration cycle, the CGM-laboratory comparator percentage agreement was evaluated in 4- hour increments after calibration. Results were similar to the results obtained using the factory calibration codes.

5. Quality Control: Not applicable.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

The optimized joint probability algorithm in the modified Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System and the Dexcom G6 Glucose Program Continuous Glucose Monitoring System was developed independently from the clinical validation dataset. Because the two systems use the same modified glucose algorithm, the following sections represent the performance for both Systems. iCGM performance was previously evaluated in clinical studies described in DEN170088. The raw data was reprocessed using the updated algorithm in K200876.

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

iCGM performance was evaluated in clinical studies described in Section C(3) below. A subset of randomly selected subjects $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 6 7 }$ ) wore two devices concurrently (blinded and unblinded iCGM Systems) at the same sensor insertion site (two in abdomen or two in buttock) to evaluate the device precision. A table of the sensor site distribution is provided below.

Another subset of randomly-selected pediatric subjects $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 2 8 )$ ) wore one device in the abdomen and a second device in the buttock concurrently to evaluate agreement of device measurements between different sensor insertion sites.

2. Linearity:

The reportable range for the System is 40 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference was previously assessed in DEN170088 and was not impacted by the algorithm modifications.

4. Assay Reportable Range: See Linearity section above.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The sensor has a storage shelf-life of 12 months. Shelf life was evaluated at $3 2 ^ { \mathbf { 0 } } – 8 6 ^ { \mathbf { 0 } } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. Sensors should be stored at $3 2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ .

The Dexcom G6 CGM System and the Dexcom Glucose Program System transmitters have sufficient battery life to function for 3 months as intended following its maximum storage time of 8 months. Shelf life was evaluated at $3 2 ^ { \circ } { - } 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 { - } 9 5 \%$ relative humidity.

# 6. Detection Limit:

If a glucose measurement is less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is displayed by the system as ‘Lo’. If a glucose measurement exceeds $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , result is displayed as $^ { \bullet } \mathrm { H i } ^ { \bullet }$ . Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.

# Trend Accuracy

Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose and are characterized by slopes, such as from ${ \mathrm { > } } 2 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ to ${ < } { - } 2 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Trend accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change (changes in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ of glucose per minute) determined by the iCGM values and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measured pairs (typically collected once every 15 minutes).

# Agreement When iCGM Reads “LOW” or “HIGH”

The Dexcom G6 System and the Dexcom Glucose Program System report glucose readings between 40 and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . When the system determines the glucose reading is below 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it displays “LOW” in the Receiver or Mobile Application Status Box. When the system determines that the glucose level is above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it displays “HIGH” in the Receiver or Mobile Application Status Box. Because the System does not display glucose values below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the laboratory comparator analyzer) when the iCGM value is

classified as “LOW” or “HIGH” is evaluated separately, and the cumulative percentages when laboratory comparator values were less than certain glucose levels (for “LOW”), and when laboratory comparator values were greater than certain glucose levels (for “HIGH”) are presented in the table below.

Alert performance:

The Hypoglycemic Alert Rate shows how often the alert is right or wrong. The True Notification Rate is the $\%$ of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was at or below the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the device alarmed (as confirmed by the comparator method). The False Notification Rate is the $\%$ of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was above the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the device alarmed. The Correct Detection Rate is the $\%$ of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was at or below the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the hypoglycemic event. The Missed Detection Rate is the $\%$ of time the device did not alarm when the blood glucose level was at or below the alert setting within 15 minutes before and after the hypoglycemic event.

# Sensor Stability:

Sensor stability describes the performance over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can be worn for up to 10 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the percentage of iCGM readings within $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $1 5 \%$ $( 1 5 / 1 5 \% )$ , $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $20 \%$ $( 2 0 / 2 0 \% )$ , and $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $40 \%$ $( 4 0 / 4 0 \% )$ of the laboratory comparator values at the beginning (Day 1, 2), middle (Day 4, 5), and end (Day 7, 10) of the System lifecycle. The mean of the absolute relative differences were evaluated over the 10-day life of the sensor within the measuring range.

# Sensor Life:

A total of 374 sensors were evaluated to determine the percentage of sensors that lasted through the 10 day sensor life. Eighty-four percent $( 8 4 \% )$ of the sensors lasted through the end of the entire wear period (e.g., Day 10) (see Figure 1). Among the 374 sensors evaluated, 36 sensors $( 9 . 6 \% )$ had “early sensor shut-off” where the sensor algorithm would have detected sensors that did not function as intended and shut them off.

The capture rate characterizes the reliability of the communication between components of the system. The System provides a sensor glucose reading every 5 minutes, or up to 288 readings per day. The percentage of readings expected to be received from the system over the sensor life was evaluated from 374 sensors and is $9 8 . 6 \%$ . More than $9 7 \%$ of the sensors captured readings at least $90 \%$ of the time. The table below describes the percent of readings received throughout the life span of the sensor (capture rate).
