# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

# Medicon Hellas Albumin:

The BCG method is applied on serum samples, without serum blank. The bi-chromatic photometric determination of albumin is based on albumin binding the anionic dye bromocresol green in mildly acidic $\mathsf { p H }$ . The raise in absorbance at $6 2 0 / 7 5 0 \ \mathrm { \ n m }$ is proportional to the concentration of albumin in the sample. The sample volume used for the assay is $2 \mathrm { u L }$ .

# Medicon Hellas Calcium:

Calcium ions react with Arsenazo III dye in acidic $\mathsf { p H }$ , to form a violet complex. The absorbance at $6 5 0 / 7 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the concentration of calcium in serum or urine samples. The analyzer photometer reads the absorbance at time intervals dictated by the method application stored in the analyzer memory, and the change in absorbance is calculated automatically. The sample volume used by the assay is $2 \mathrm { u L }$ for serum or urine samples.

# Medicon Hellas Creatinine:

Creatinine forms a yellow-orange complex with picrate anions in alkaline medium. The rate of change of absorbance of the complex at $5 0 5 / 7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to creatinine concentration in serum or urine samples. The sample volume used by the assay is $2 2 \mathrm { u L }$ for serum and urine samples.

# Medicon Hellas Glucose: Glucose (Hexokinase)

The determination of glucose is according to the hexokinase method based on the following reactions using 2uL of sample for serum and urine samples. The concentration of glucose is determined bi-chromatically by the absorbance change at $3 4 0 / 3 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

Glucose $^ +$ ATP Hexokinase 6-phosphate glucose $^ +$ ADP 6-phosphate glucose $^ +$ NAD 6-phopshate gluconic acidG-6PDH $^ +$ NADH

# Medicon Hellas Direct Bilirubin :

The modified Malloy-Evelyn method is applied on serum samples. Direct (conjugated) bilirubin reacts with diazotised sulfanilic acid in acidic $\mathsf { p H }$ to form azobilirubin, a colored chromophore. The absorbance of chromophore at $5 5 0 / 6 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the concentration of direct bilirubin in the sample. The free (unbound) bilirubin fraction does not react. The reaction is an end-point type. The sample volume used by the assay is 8uL.

# Medicon Hellas Total Bilirubin:

The DPD method is applied, whereby 3,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium tetrafluoroborate (DPD) binds directly to total bilirubin in acidic medium, forming azobilirubin, whose rate of absorbance at $5 5 0 / 7 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the concentration of total bilirubin in serum samples. The analyzer photometer reads the absorbance at time intervals dictated by the method application stored in the analyzer memory, and the change in absorbance is calculated automatically. The sample volume used by the assay is $2 0 \mathrm { u L }$ .

# Medicon Hellas Urea Nitrogen:

Medicon Hellas Urea Nitrogen is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of urea nitrogen in human serum and urine. Urea Nitrogen is determined according to the following reactions, using $7 \mathrm { u L }$ of sample for serum and urine samples:

![](images/6d80bd6dd01786ffbadab00b5a1e0914f44675f7a645fcb98387ec4d1ee719b0.jpg)

The rate of absorbance change at $3 4 0 / 3 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the urea nitrogen concentration in the sample.

For all assays the analyzer photometer reads the absorbances at time intervals dictated by the method application stored in the analyzer memory, and the change in absorbance is calculated automatically.

# 807.92 (b)(1,2): Brief Description of Nonclinical and Clinical Data

Medicon Hellas (Medicon) has performed a series of studies to confirm the substantial equivalence of their test systems to the predicate devices. Results from each candidate test system were found to be substantially equivalent to their related predicate device. The predicate device used for Medicon Albumin, Medicon Calcium, Medicon Creatinine, Medicon Total Bilirubin and Medicon Urea Nitrogen (BUN) was the Beckman Coulter (BC) AU 2700 analyzer using the corresponding AU reagents. The predicate device for Medicon Direct Bilirubin was the Abbott Diagnostics Architect c8000 analyzer using its corresponding reagent.

Two to three lots of each candidate device were used for the studies. Testing confirmed equivalent performance of the candidate systems to the corresponding predicate devices.

Studies included accuracy (method comparison), reportable range (linearity), sensitivity (limit of quantification), precision including: repeatability, within run, between run and within lab (total), interfering endogenous and exogenous substances, reagent on-board stability and calibration frequency. The following provide performance summary information from the studies for each candidate reagent. The following summarize the type and scope of testing completed for each candidate device. Following this section, the data for each of the candidate devices is provided.

Method Comparison- The protocol followed was according to CLSI EP09c: accuracy testing was run simultaneously in blind fashion with the candidate and the predicate devices. A minimum of 70 clinical specimens, spanning the dynamic ranges, were assayed in singleton and in a blinded fashion on the at least three lots of each candidate system and on a representative lot of each predicate device. Results were tabulated and evaluated using Analyse-it software to generate Deming regression statistics.

Summary: Accuracy studies completed on at least three lots of each candidate reagent confirm that Medicon albumin, calcium, creatinine, glucose, total bilirubin and urea nitrogen are substantially equivalent to the related predicate devices – Beckman Coulter AU reagents used on the AU2700 analyzer. Medicon direct bilirubin reagent used with a Diatron Pictus 500 analyzer is substantially equivalent to its predicate device – Abbott Architect $\mathbf { c 8 0 0 0 }$ direct bilirubin used with the Architect c8000 analyzer.

Reportable Range – Linearity - Statistical analysis is performed at a $5 \%$ level of significance and the evaluation is according to CLSI EP06-A. At least nine levels of each sample types were tested with at least three lots of the corresponding Medicon reagents. The samples were assigned their reference values arithmetically from serial dilutions of the high-level sample. Each level was tested $\mathrm { N } { = } 4$ on the Pictus P500, results from each level were averaged. All statistics were calculated using Analyse-it Software.

Summary: the combined data from various lots of each of the Medicon candidate reagents used with the Pictus 500 chemistry analyzers met statistical acceptance criteria. Reportable ranges were comparable to the predicate device reportable ranges.

Sensitivity (LOD/LOQ) - Medicon completed sensitivity studies following CLSI EP17-A2. LoB was calculated using non-parametrical statistics and LoD was calculated from LoB following equation $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 4 ^ { * } \mathrm { S D }$ :

LoB/LoD were determined using: 5 Blank samples and 5 Low Levels samples respectively which were measured 4 times each day for a total of 60 measurements in 3 days.

LoQ: 10 samples that span the low end of linearity were measured 5 times each day for a total of 150 measurements in 3 days. LoQ was calculated until a specific concentration generated a CV of $< =$ $20 \%$ .

Summary – The lots of each of the candidate reagents of demonstrated acceptable levels of blank, limit of detection and defined the limit of quantification similar to the corresponding predicate devices.

Interferences- at least two lots of each candidate device were tested for interferences from endogenous and exogenous compounds using serum and urine samples, where applicable. Medicon performed comprehensive studies after searching in the bibliography and the FDA database for similar recently cleared devices, to assess and define a list of exogenous substances. The study plan and protocol followed CLSI EP07-A and EP37 guidelines. Serum and urine sample pools at low and high levels were prepared, then spiked with increasing concentrations of the interference compounds. The results define the level at which interferences of the noted compounds will affect results by more than $+ / - 1 0 \%$ .

Summary – for each of the candidate devices, interferences studies determined the levels at which specific substances may interfere with results. These are tabulated in each of the candidate devices’ data tables.

# Stability/Calibration frequency:

Different lots of each candidate device were evaluated for on-board stability and calibration frequency covering specific date intervals and the related sample types. The results were tabulated and the data were analyzed for equivalence between lots. Results means, standard deviations and percent coefficient of variation $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ .

Stability- Reagents were loaded on to the Pictus 500 analyzer’s cooled reagent tray. Each reagent was calibrated at the start of each study. Two fresh serum pools and two control pools were assayed in triplicate on Day 0. Samples were frozen from $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to - $7 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , and then retested at fixed intervals until the reagent failed the acceptance criteria. When a reagent failed acceptance criteria, it was recalibrated. If recalibration did not bring the results within the acceptance criteria, the reagent’s on-board useful life limit was established.

Calibration frequency: The un-capped on-board reagent stability claim is defined as the number of days between the start testing date and the last test day that results were within the acceptance limits without re-calibration. Calibration frequency is defined as the required time interval between calibrations that ensures reagents recover values within the acceptance criteria.

Summary – stability -Each lot of each candidate device, with the corresponding sample types passed acceptance criteria. Studies confirmed the on-board stability and calibration frequency limits defined within each candidate device’s Instructions for Use document (product insert).

Precision $\mathbf { C V \% }$ - (repeatability, between run and within lab (total) precision) – testing precisely followed protocol CLSI EP05-A3. Precision study results from running applicable serum and urine samples (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3) were tested in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days, for a total of 80 results per level on two or three lots of each candidate device. The three precision elements were calculated from the total data for each sample type and lot generated over the evaluation period. Statistics were calculated using Analyse-it software.

Summary - The results were tabulated and the data were analyzed for means, standard deviations and percent coefficient of variation $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ . All lots passed acceptance criteria for each applicable sample type at each level.
