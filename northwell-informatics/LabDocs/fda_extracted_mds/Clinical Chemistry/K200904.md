# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 is an automated High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system that separates and reports stable hemoglobin A1c (sA1c) percentage in venous whole blood. The operational portion of the G8 is composed of a sampling unit, liquid pump, degasser, column, detector, microprocessors, sample loader, smart media card, operation panel, and a printer.

The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 system consists of the following components, which are 510(k) exempt and clearance is not required;

• G8 Variant Elution Buffer HSi No. 1 (S), No. 2 (S), No. 3 (S) TSKgel® G8 Variant HSi (column) Hemoglobin A1c Controls Levels 1 and 2 21 CFR 862.1660, Product Code JJX   
• Hemoglobin A1c Calibrator Set 21 CFR 862.1150, Product Code JIT   
• Hemolysis and Wash Solution 21 CFR 864.8540, Product Code GGK

The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 uses ion-exchange HPLC for rapid, accurate, and precise separation of the stable form of HbA1c (sA1c) from other hemoglobin fractions. The G8 uses a non-porous cation exchange column and separates the hemoglobin

# Section 5 - 510(k) Summary or 510(k) Statement

components in the blood. Separation is achieved by utilizing differences in ionic interactions between the cation and exchange group on the column resin surface and the hemoglobin components in a step gradient elution. The hemoglobin fractions (designated as A1a, A1b, F, ${ \mathsf { L } } { \mathsf { A 1 } } { \mathsf { c + } }$ , SA1c, A0, and, if present, H-V0, H-V1, H-V2 and H-V3) are subsequently removed from the column by performing a step-wise elution gradient using the varied salt concentrations in the Variant Elution Buffers HSi 1, 2 and 3. The peaks, H-V0, H-V1, H-V2 and H-V3 are typically presumptive HbAD, HbAS, HbAC and HbAE respectively.

The software compares the retention times of hemoglobin fractions in a sample to the expected windows of retention" and labels each fraction that correctly elutes within a defined expected window of retention. The software designates a hemoglobin fraction as POX (where X is the order of the peak as it elutes from the column) if it does not match a defined window of retention. All automated processes in the G8 are controlled by internal microprocessors, using software downloaded via a smart media card.

The result report is printed and can be stored on the instrument. The data can be transmitted to a host computer through a bi-directional interface. The result report includes the sample ID, date, percentage and retention time of each fraction of hemoglobin, sA1c percentage and total A1 percentage, along with a chromatogram of the elution pattern of the hemoglobin fractions. If a sample contains a hemoglobin variant, the column elutes the fraction depending upon its charge.

# 10. SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES

# Indications for Use:

The predicate device is cleared separately for the monitoring claim (K122472) and diagnostic claim (K142448). Tosoh seeks clearance for both the monitoring and diagnostic claim combined in this pre-market submission by combining the claims sought and obtained separately for previously cleared Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 submissions; k071132 for the long-term monitoring of people diagnosed with diabetes under 21 CFR 864.7470 as well as the same analyzer cleared in k131580 as a diagnostic HbA1c device under 21 CFR 862.1373. As both clearances are for the same device, with incremental changes, the combination of "Indications for Use" does not raise any additional safety or efficacy questions for the subject device.

# Instrument Platform:

The subject device and predicate device are both automated High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) systems that separate and report hemoglobin A1c percentage in venous whole blood. Aside for the sample volume requirement $3 \mu \iota$ of whole blood and ${ 8 0 \mu \ L }$ of diluted samples for the subject device and $5 0 \mu \ L$ of venous whole blood and diluted samples for the predicate device), both systems use software algorithms to measure HbA1c concentrations, in the presence of variants. The difference in instrument platform does not raise any additional safety or efficacy questions for the subject device.

# Section 5 - 510(k) Summary or 510(k) Statement

# Detection Method:

The subject device allows the analyte to pass through a flow cell where changes in absorbance are measure at 415nm and recorded as a digital chromatogram. An additional filter at 500nm corrects for background absorbance. The predicated device uses the same absorbance wavelength to detect and record the sample as a digital chromatogram. The additional filter, however, uses a wavelength of 690nm, correcting for background absorbance. The difference in background wavelength subtraction does not raise any additional safety or efficacy questions for the subject device.

# Measuring Range:

The subject device has a measuring range of 4.0 to $1 6 . 9 \%$ HbA1c (NGSP), whereas the predicate device has a measuring range of 3.4 to $20 . 6 \%$ HbA1c (NGSP). The difference in measuring range does not raise any additional safety or efficacy questions for the subject device.

# 11. SUMMARY OF NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE TESTING

Non-clinical performance tests were conducted to support the substantial equivalence determination of this 510(k) submission. No clinical performance tests were conducted to support the substantial equivalence determination of this 510(k) submission. The non-clinical performance tests and summary of results are as follows;

# Precision/Repeatability

The precision repeatability study was performed in compliance with CLSI EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline - Third Edition, to verify whether or not the previously established claim of imprecision at $\leq 2 \%$ was affected by the software modification to version 5.24 of the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC723-G8. Four concentrations of $H _ { 0 } \mathsf { A } \mathsf { 1 c } \%$ in K2EDTA venous whole blood were tested. The concentrations were approximately $5 . 0 \%$ . $6 . 5 \%$ . $8 . 0 \%$ and $12 . 0 \%$ A total of seven-hundred and twenty measurements per concentration were measured using the study design; three analyzers over twenty non-consecutive days with three reagent lots. Specimens were run in duplicate, two times per day for a total of seven-hundred and twenty unique results per concentration.

# Matrix Comparison

The data supports the use of K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA blood collection tubes, as they show no clinical or statistical difference and thus may be used interchangeably for testing HbA1c on the G8 HPLC Analyzer.

Traceability and Expected Values (calibrators)

The assigned HbA1c values of the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer are certified with The National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.

# Section 5 - 510(k) Summary or 510(k) Statement

The final reportable result is traceable to both the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation NGSP $\left( \% \right) = \left[ 0 . 0 9 1 4 8 \times \mathsf { I F C C } \left( \mathsf { m m o l / m o l } \right) \right] + 2 . 1 5 2$ HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP equivalent units $( \% )$ and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).

Calibrators (Tosoh A1c Calibrator Set) and Controls (Canterbury Scientific Hemoglobin A1c Control) are recommended for use with this device. The calibrators and controls were previously cleared under 510(k) k071132 and k021484, respectively.

Linearity and Detection Limit

Linearity and Detection Limit was previously established for this assay under 510(k) k071132.   
The reportable range for this device is 4.0 to $1 6 . 9 \%$ HbA1c.

Analytical Specificity

# i. Endogenous Interfering Substances

The endogenous interference study was performed in compliance to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline-Second Edition. Significant interference was defined as percent recovery $\pm 5 \%$ of the expected $100 \%$ recovery. Interference studies were conducted on known concentrations of $H _ { 0 } \mathsf { A } \mathsf { 1 c } \%$ . Specimens were spiked with increasing amounts of the interfering substance.

ii. Drug Interference

The exogenous drug interference study was performed under clearance of k071132. Acetylsalicylic Acid was tested because it does form acetylated hemoglobin, which may interfere with the %HbA1c when measured by HPLC. Acetaldehyde was tested because it can form aldehyde hemoglobin, which can cause an increase in the LA1c fraction.

# Section 5 - 510(k) Summary or 510(k) Statement

With HPLC, the red cells are lysed and eluted across the column for separation of the hemoglobin fractions. Research of the FDA website and others show no contraindication of Levodopa, Methyldopa, Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen when used by pre-diabetic or diabetic patients, and the drugs do not interfere with the HPLC technology as they might during an antigen/antibody reaction. FDA stated that based on the technology of the device, it has been shown that the additional substances do not appear to interfere with this type of device; therefore, the additional interference data on these drugs was not needed.

# iii. Cross Reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives

A cross-reactivity study was performed with potential interferences from Acetylated hemoglobin (Hb), Carbamylated Hb, Aldehyde Hb, and Labile HbA1c with HbA1c values of ${ \sim } 6 . 5 \%$ and ${ \sim } 8 \%$ HbA1c. The following results were concluded as not interfering with the assay.

Acetylated Hb up to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
• Carbamylated Hb up to 25 mg/dL   
• Aldehyde Hb up to 25 mg/dL Labile HbA1c up to 1000 mg/dL

iv. Hemoglobin Variant Interference

The hemoglobin variant interference study was performed in compliance to CLSI EP07- A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline-Second Edition. Interference when measuring %HbA1c in clinical specimens due to certain levels of Hb variants (HbC, HbD, HbE, and HbS) and hemoglobinopathies (HbA2 and HbF) is wellknown. To reduce possible interference and to enhance the performance of the G8 in the presence of these variants and hemoglobinopathies, Tosoh modified the software algorithms. The modified software, version 5.24, reduces interference when measuring %HbA1c.

An interference study was performed to identify the level of Hb variants and hemoglobinopathies likely to cause interference, thus verifying that the G8 software modification (version 5.24) did reduce measurement interference of %HbA1c under these conditions. Non-clinically significant interference was defined as $1 = 6 \%$ relative difference in the results from a comparative method at $6 . 5 \%$ or $8 . 0 \%$ HbA1c.
