o Users with very high triglyceride levels $( > 7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) should not use this device to test their cholesterol level.

o All other users should only check their cholesterol levels first thing in the morning before they have eaten to avoid possible incorrect cholesterol results due to very high triglyceride levels. Triglyceride levels above $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may lead to incorrect cholesterol results. Triglyceride levels may be higher after a meal. If you have questions about your triglyceride level, talk to your healthcare professional.

D Special Instrument Requirements:

Fora ADVANCED GD40 Meter

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, $\beta$ -Ketone and Cholesterol Monitoring System consists of the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Meter, the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Blood Glucose strips, the FORA ADVANCED GD40 $\beta$ -Ketone strips, the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Total Cholesterol strips, and control solutions (3 levels for glucose, 2 levels for ketone, and 2 levels for cholesterol). The test strips and controls are required but not included with the system kit and must be purchased separately. A lancing device and sterile lancets are also required but not included with the system kit and must be purchased separately.

The FORA ADVANCED GD40 glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone strips, and the FORA glucose and $\beta$ - ketone control solutions were previously cleared in k161738. The meter was also previously cleared (k161738) as the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 Blood Glucose and $\beta$ -Ketone meter (now the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 meter). The FORA ADVANCED GD40 Total Cholesterol strips and FORA cholesterol control solutions are new.

# B Principle of Operation:

Glucose measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using the enzyme, glucose dehydrogenase, to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are produced. The electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and correlated to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. The test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow comparison of results with laboratory methods.

Using the same technology, $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate ( $\beta$ -ketone) is converted by $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and the magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate present in the sample.

Cholesterol esters in serum are completely hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to free cholesterol and free fatty acids, whereby liberated cholesterol, plus any endogenous free cholesterol, are oxidized by cholesterol oxidase and the magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of cholesterol present in the sample.

# Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

FORA ADVANCED GD40 Meter

2. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

4. Calibration:

A code strip is provided, and the user is instructed to calibrate every time a new vial of total cholesterol test strips is begun. Coding is similar for $\beta$ -ketone. The code strips contain lot specific test strip information such as the calibration curve and the test strip lot number. Users are instructed to ensure that the code number on the meter display, code strip, and test strip vial are the same before proceeding with testing. Glucose measurements do not require coding.

# 5. Quality Control:

The sponsor provides 3 levels of FORA Glucose Control Solutions, 2 levels of $\beta$ -Ketone Control Solutions, and 2 levels of Total Cholesterol Control Solutions. The controls are used to check that the that the meter, code strips (for cholesterol and $\beta$ -ketones) and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly. Control solutions for glucose and $\beta$ -ketones are recognized automatically by the meter while the user must mark cholesterol control solution as such. Users are instructed to run controls:

• When using the meter for the first time.   
• At least once a week to routinely check the meter and test strips.   
• With a new vial of test strips.   
$\bullet$ If the user suspects the meter or test strips are not working properly.   
• If the test results are not consistent with how the user feels, or if the user thinks the results are not accurate. To practice the testing process If the user has dropped the meter or suspects they may have damaged it.

The acceptable range for the control solutions is printed on the side of the test strip vial.

# 2. Linearity:

The sponsor provided a linearity study using three (3) lots of test strips, five (5) meters, one (1) high level $\mathrm { ( { > } 4 0 0 \ m g / d L } )$ , and one (1) low level $( { < } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ native venous blood samples. The high and low samples were used to prepare nine (9) samples ranging from $9 6 - 4 0 5 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ with a known relationship to each other. For each level, the mean of five (5) measurements was compared to the expected value.

The maximum deviation from linearity that was observed within the claimed measuring interval for all three lots was $2 . 2 \%$ .

The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of $1 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for total cholesterol.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

An endogenous and exogenous interference study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP7, Ed.3: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. The study used four (4) meters and test strips from one (1) lot. Two (2) venous whole blood samples at cholesterol concentrations of approximately $1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ from healthy subjects were used. Samples with native analyte were supplemented with potentially interfering compounds at levels listed in the table below.

Samples were tested in singlicate using four candidate meters. The four meter measurements were averaged and the percent bias between control and test samples was calculated. Noninterference was defined as a difference of $\leq 1 0 \%$ from the control sample. If the percent bias was greater than $\pm 1 0 \%$ , a dose response test was performed to determine the highest concentration of interfering substance that does not interfere with assay performance. The percent bias between control and test samples was calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm { B i a s ^ { \circ } \% = \{ [ M e a n ( t e s t ) - M e a n ( c o n t r o l ) ] / \ M e a n ( c o n t r o l ) \} \ x \ 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \% }
$$

The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling for the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, $\beta$ -Ketone and Cholesterol Monitoring System which were developed to explain the interferences for all three test strips based on the analytical specificity data for the cholesterol strips described above and based on the analytical specificity data for the ketones and glucose strips described in k161738:

Acetaminophen in your blood ${ > } 6 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ might affect the reliability of your blood glucose results. If you are taking Tylenol, your glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, then ask your healthcare provider. If you have a disease or condition that elevates your blood uric acid level $( { > } 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , such as gout, your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, then ask your healthcare provider.   
Xylose: Do not test blood glucose during or soon after a xylose absorption test. Xylose in the blood can give falsely elevated results.   
• Reduced glutathione level to $> 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may affect the glucose results. If you are unsure, then ask your healthcare provider.   
Pralidoxime iodide level to ${ > } 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may affect the glucose results. If you are unsure, then ask your healthcare provider.   
• FOR CHOLESTEROL ONLY (This limitation does not apply to testing glucose or ketones levels.) o Users with very high triglyceride levels $( > 7 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ should not use this device to test their cholesterol level. o All other users should only check their cholesterol levels first thing in the morning before they have eaten to avoid possible incorrect cholesterol results due to very high triglyceride levels. Triglyceride levels above $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ may lead to incorrect cholesterol results. Triglyceride levels may be higher after a meal. If you have questions about your triglyceride level, talk to your healthcare professional.

# 4. Assay Reportable Range:

The sponsor claims a measuring range of $1 0 0 - 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for cholesterol. This range was supported by the results from the linearity, precision, limit of detection, and accuracy studies.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability

FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, $\beta$ -Ketone and Cholesterol Monitoring System is CRMLN certified for total cholesterol using whole blood samples.

# Stability

The FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, $\beta$ -Ketone and Cholesterol strips are provided packaged in vials and as individually wrapped single strips.

The study protocol and acceptance criteria for test strips in vials were reviewed and found acceptable to support the product stability claims:

Cholesterol Test Strips in Vials:

Closed-vial (shelf-life) – 18 months at the recommended storage conditions of $3 5 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ to $8 6 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $1 0 \% { - } 8 5 \%$ relative humidity   
Opened-vial – 180 days at the recommended storage conditions of $3 5 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ to $8 6 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ - $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and $1 0 \% { - } 8 5 \%$ relative humidity

Individually Wrapped Cholesterol Test Strips • Sealed Wrapper (shelf-life) - 24 months under the recommended storage conditions of $3 5 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ to $8 6 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 \% { - } 8 5 \%$ relative humidity

The detection limits studies of the candidate device’s cholesterol assay were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.

LoB: To estimate the LoB, the sponsor used four (4) meters, two (2) cholesterol strip lots, and five (5) different analyte-free (blank) venous blood samples. Each blank sample was analyzed in replicates of four (4) on three (3) different days. The limit of blank was estimated by interpolation from the ranked values to be $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

LoD: To estimate the LoD, the sponsor used four (4) meters, two (2) cholesterol strip lots, and venous blood samples at five (5) different concentrations. Each sample was analyzed in replicates of four (4) on three (3) different days. The data was evaluated using the parametric analysis recommended in CLSI EP17-A2 and the LoD was estimated to be $2 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

LoQ: To estimate the LoQ, the sponsor used two (2) meters, two (2) cholesterol strip lots, and venous blood samples at nine (9) different concentrations. Each sample was tested in replicates of two (2) on twenty (20) different days. The LoQ estimate for each lot was determined as the measurand concentration at the intersection of its power function model fit line with the imprecision goal of a $10 \%$ CV. The LoQ of total cholesterol was $9 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The sponsor chose $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as the lowest reportable cholesterol concentration.

Not applicable.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was conducted to determine the accuracy performance of the candidate device’s cholesterol test. The study included 408 participants at three (3) sites (136 subjects per site).

Of the participants, 223 $( 5 4 . 7 \% )$ were male and 185 $( 4 5 . 3 \% )$ were female. The ages of the participants were from 22 to 74 years with a mean age of 55.5 years and adequately represented the intended use population.

Participants self-collected a capillary blood sample for cholesterol testing. After testing, nursing staff collected a venous blood sample for comparison on the comparator method. Total cholesterol levels were between $1 0 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $3 8 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Three (3) reagent (strip) lots were used in the study.

The differences between the self-collected results and the comparator method were estimated according to the following equation:

Meter Value (mg/dL/mmol/L) – Comparator Method (mg/dL/mmol/L)

X $100 \% = \%$ Diff

Comparator Method Value (mg/dL/mmol/L)

Results are summarized in the following table:

# C Clinical Studies:

1. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable. 2. Clinical Specificity: Not applicable.

A “mock” study was conducted to evaluate the lay user’s ability to understand and distinguish glucose and cholesterol results obtained with the same meter. The study included 500 participants at 3 sites. Participants were randomly divided into five groups and were provided with samples with varying levels of cholesterol and glucose combinations. Observers noted whether participants could correctly identify and distinguish between cholesterol and glucose results.

Analysis of the number of participants who correctly differentiated glucose and cholesterol measurements, as compared to the result observed by the observer, showed $100 \%$ correct results across all 3 sites.

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

1. Hematocrit Study:

A hematocrit study was performed to verify that the total cholesterol measurement is not affected by hematocrit levels between the range of $10 \%$ to $70 \%$ over a wide range of total cholesterol levels. Ten (10) meters, (one) 1 lot of test strips, and venous blood samples at concentrations of $1 5 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 8 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $2 6 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $3 3 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were used in the study. Hematocrit was adjusted to $10 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $60 \%$ , and $70 \%$ . The $\%$ bias at each hematocrit level relative to the nominal hematocrit level of $40 \%$ was calculated. The acceptance criterion was that the total cholesterol bias be within $\pm 1 0 \%$ compared to the nominal condition of hematocrit at $40 \%$ . The data provided supports the claimed hematocrit range of $20 - 7 0 \%$ .

# 2. Altitude Effect Evaluation:

An altitude effect study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different altitudes on cholesterol measurements. A glove box system, which simulates three altitude conditions from sea level to 3500 meters (11,484 feet), was used. Venous whole blood samples from healthy donors at five (5) different levels of cholesterol (119, 182, 228, 262, and $3 4 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were tested at various atmospheric pressures which simulate different altitudes. Four (4) candidate devices were used to measure cholesterol and the results were compared to the comparator method and to the results at sea level. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was that the bias to the comparator method and to sea level be $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ . The acceptance criteria were satisfied and supported the sponsor’s claimed altitude of 10742 feet (3274 meters).

# 3. Temperature and Humidity Studies:

The operating conditions for the glucose and $\beta$ -ketones test system were established in k161738. The operating conditions for the cholesterol functionality were assessed in the current submission and demonstrated that the cholesterol assay functions as intended within the labeled operating conditions of ${ 5 0 } { - } 1 0 4 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { F } }$ ( $\mathrm { 1 0 - 4 0 ^ { o } C ) }$ and relative humidity of $10 \%$ .

# 4. Sample Volume Study:

A sample volume study was conducted on the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, $\beta$ -Ketone and Cholesterol Monitoring System to verify the robustness of the system to variations in the intended five (5) $\mu \mathrm { L }$ sample volume and to test the meter’s functionality at detecting insufficient volumes. Five (5) meters and three (3) different venous blood samples at different levels of total cholesterol (140, 240, and $3 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ were used in the study. Sample volumes from $4 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ to $5 . 2 \mu \mathrm { L }$ were tested under normal operating conditions $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \ : ( 7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ at $60 \%$ RH). Reported results were within $\pm 5 \%$ bias and sample volumes between $4 . 7 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and $4 . 8 \mu \mathrm { L }$ provided an error for insufficient volume in $100 \%$ of the readings. Sixty percent of the $( 6 0 \% )$ readings for the $4 . 9 \mu \mathrm { L }$ volume provided a result and $40 \%$ provided and error for insufficient volume. The results support the recommended $5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ volume.

# 5. Infection Control Studies:

The FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, $\beta$ -Ketone and Cholesterol Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were previously performed (k161738) on the exterior materials of the meter by an outside commercial laboratory service to demonstrate complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with Micro-Kill Wipes (EPA Reg. No. 59894-10-37549). Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor (in k161738 for glucose and ketones and in the current submission for cholesterol) demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in external materials of the meters after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles with Micro-Kill Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. The labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the cleaning and disinfection procedures.

# 6. Readability Evaluation:

A readability study was conducted on the system manual, test strip manuals, quick user guide, and controls package inserts demonstrating that they are written at an 8th grade reading level or less.

# VIII Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
