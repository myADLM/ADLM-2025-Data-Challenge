# 1.5 Device Description

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System with the FreeStyle Libre 2 App (herein referred to as the ‘FreeStyle Libre 2 System’ or ‘System’) is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide glucose levels, trends and alerts. The System requires a prescription and is intended for home use. The System consists of the following components: a sensor which transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a BLE enabled display device (Reader), and an iOS mobile app (FreeStyle Libre 2 App) downloaded to a compatible smartphone. Scanning of the sensor via Reader or App provides the user with real-time glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose graph). The user may make treatment decisions based in part on the sensor glucose results provided by the System. The System also provides configurable alarms designed to warn the user of Low Glucose, High Glucose or Signal Loss.

FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor

• The Sensor is single use, disposable, and powered by a silver oxide battery. The Sensor is provided as two secondary components, Sensor Applicator and Sensor Pack (electron beam sterilized device) which are used to assemble and apply the Sensor to the back of the user’s arm. During Sensor application, the sensor tail is inserted about 5.5 millimeters below the surface of the skin through the guidance of a needle. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion, and the Sensor remains attached to the skin with a medical grade adhesive. The Sensor continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and has an 8-hour memory capacity. The Sensor is factory calibrated, does not require fingerstick calibration, and can be worn for up to 14 days.

FreeStyle Libre 2 Reader

The Reader is a small handheld device that is powered by a lithium-ion rechargeable battery and uses RFID communication to start new sensors and to scan sensors to display and record data and uses BLE communication to issue alarms that notify the user to scan his/her sensor when glucose values pass a high or low glucose threshold. The Reader also has a built-in strip port with blood glucose functionality (that is intended to work with the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose test strips, cleared under K171941), and a user interface that includes event logging features.

FreeStyle Libre 2 App (iOS)

The App’s design, functionality and user interface is based on the handheld Reader. When downloaded to a compatible smartphone, the App uses RFID communication to start new sensors and to scan sensors to display and record data and uses BLE communication to issue alarms. As a mobile application, the FreeStyle Libre 2 App allows connectivity with cloud-based applications. The FreeStyle Libre 2 App is an alternative primary display for the System and does not interact with the Reader. The iOS FreeStyle Libre 2 App is distributed using the Apple App Store, and a list of compatible devices is accessible in the App via the Help feature or product website.

# 1.7 Comparison of Technological Characteristics with the Predicate Device

Amperometric measurement of glucose concentration (via glucose oxidase chemical reaction) in the interstitial fluid is the technological principle for both the subject and predicate devices. The electrochemical sensor is held in place with an adhesive pad and incorporates both the subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor uses a glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to a metal electrode, producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the subcutaneous space. The compatible receiver converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) for display to the user.

At a high-level, the subject and predicate devices are based on the following technological elements:

• Compatibility with FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor Use of NFC interface for starting new sensors and scanning sensors to display glucose readings Use of BLE interface to issue alarms Use of software algorithm for conversion of the raw glucose measurements from the Sensor to calculate glucose results

The following technological differences exist between the subject and predicate devices:

The Reader is a dedicated medical device whereas the App is installed on a compatible iOS smartphone, a multifunctional platform that includes other nonmedical device functions (e.g. smartphone OS settings, phone calls, text messages, and other non-medical device mobile apps). The impact of the interface between the smartphone and the FreeStyle Libre 2 App were evaluated as part of System performance testing, and the App incorporates additional software controls to detect variations in smartphone settings and smartphone operating system configurations that may impact alarm delivery. • The App requires a compatible NFC- and BLE-enabled smartphone for wireless communication with the Sensor. The App provides the added functionality to wirelessly communicate with cloudbased application. The App provides the added functionality to share glucose results and screenshots of the glucose reports through the App’s share function.

# 1.8 Summary of Performance Testing

The following performance testing was conducted to support substantial equivalence:

Software Verification and Validation – software verification and validation testing was conducted in accordance with established specifications and IEC 62304 and documentation was provided as recommended by FDA Guidance document “Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices,” May 11, 2005. Results of executed protocols for the met the acceptance criteria and therefore supports that the System’s embedded software is acceptable for its intended use.   
• Human Factors – human factors testing of the System was conducted in accordance with ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62366, IEC 60601-1-6, and FDA Guidance titled Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices,” dated February 3, 2016. Results demonstrated that the System met usability requirements.   
• Wireless Coexistence – the System underwent coexistence testing consistent with AAMI TIR69 and ANSI C63.27 and included test challenges from in-band interference sources defined in ANSI C63.27, as well as other expected wireless interference sources from the intended use environment. Test results showed the System could tolerate interference generated by these RF interfering devices and still meet the target performance criteria.   
• Cybersecurity – ADC has provided cybersecurity risk management documentation for the System that includes analysis of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for data, information and software related to the System. For each identified threat and vulnerability risk event scenario, risk assessment of impact to confidentiality integrity, and availability was performed and documented within the cybersecurity risk management documentation. Appropriate risk mitigation controls have been implemented and tested.   
• Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) – the System underwent electrical safety and EMC evaluation. Results of this evaluation in conjunction with EMC testing completed from the reference device (K202145) demonstrated that the System complies with electrical safety and EMC requirements per IEC 60601- 1:2005(r)2012 and IEC 60601-1-2:2014, respectively.

The following supportive performance characteristics were established in the predicate device in K193371 and are not affected by the introduction of the iOS FreeStyle Libre 2 App in the current 510(k):

• Sterilization   
• Biocompatibility   
• Mechanical Engineering   
• Environmental Testing   
• Shelf-Life Stability   
• Packaging Integrity/Shipping Integrity Interoperability

• Clinical Performance - the App utilizes the identical algorithm and implements the same wireless interfaces with the Sensor as used by the Reader. As the App calculates glucose information identically to the Reader, no additional clinical data beyond that provided in K193371 was used in this 510(k) to support a determination of substantial equivalence.

# 1.9 Conclusion

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System (with FreeStyle Libre 2 App) has the identical intended use and clinical application as the predicate device. The difference in technological characteristics as a result of introducing the iOS FreeStyle Libre 2 App as an alternate primary display option, have been addressed through risk control measures to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the modified System. The Reader and the App utilize the identical algorithm and implements the same wireless interfaces with the Sensor. System performance testing (using Sensors and representative smartphone models with the App installed) confirmed that the device met all specified criteria, which supports that the System provides accurate, secure, and reliable glucose readings in accordance with the iCGM special controls. Based on the performance testing and data provided in this pre-market notification, the subject and predicate device have been shown to be substantially equivalent.
