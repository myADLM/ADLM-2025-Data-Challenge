# II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: Modification to an existing device to use a mobile app as an alternate primary display.   
B Type of Test: Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System (with FreeStyle Libre 2 App) is a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device with real time alarms capability indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 4 and older. It is intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions, unless otherwise indicated.

The System also detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments. Interpretation of the System readings should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time.

The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices. The System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices where the user manually controls actions for therapy decisions.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin suspend systems.

Taking ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Inaccurate sensor readings due to ascorbic acid interference may be clinical significant and result in harm if relied on to make treatement decisions. Taking more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event.

The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could cause incorrect readings.

Do not use this system if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.

Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care professional.

Do not use the System in people less than 4 years of age.

Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the "check blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours or wearing a Sensor. In addition, use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions, if your Sensor glucose reading does not match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a number.

Wash application site on the back of your upper arm using a plain soap, dry, and then clean with an alcohol wipe. This will help remove any oily residue that may prevent the sensor from sticking properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Carefully preparing the site according to these instructions will help the Sensor stay on your body for the full 14-day wear period and help prevent it from falling off early.

Store the Sensor Kit between $3 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ and $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ . If you suspect that the temperature may exceeed $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (e.g., an un-airconditioned home in the summer), you should refridgerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.

You must scan the Sensor to get your real-time current glucose level as the Reader will not provide this information without a scan.

The Readers's built-in meter is not for use on people who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock, or for individuals in hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis.

The Reader's built-in meter is not for use on neonates, in critically-ill patients, or for diagnosis or screening of diabetes.

The Reader's built-in meter is for use by a single person.

Use of the Reader's built-in meter on multiple patients may lead to transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or other bloodborne pathogens.

Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed by the manufacturer as compatible with the System may cause inaccuracte glucose readings.

If a Sensor breaks inside a user's body, they should call their health care professional.

For you to receive alarms, they must be on and your Reader should be within 20 feet of you at all times. The transmission range is 20 feet unobstructed. If you are out of range, you may not receive glucose alarms.

To prevent missed alarms, make sure the Reader has sufficient charge and that sound and/or vibration are turned on.

Alarms you receive do not include your glucose reading so you must scan your Sensor to check your glucose.

For you to receive alarms, your phone should be within 20 feet of you at all times. The transmission range is 20 feet unobstructed. If you are out of range, you may not receive alarms. If you want to receive the App's optional alarms, make sure these are turned on.

Do not force close the App. The App must be running in the background to receive alarms. If you force close the App you will not receive alarms. Re-open the App to ensure you will receive alarms.

Alarms you receive do not include your glucose reading so you must scan your Sensor to check your glucose.

The App will ask for phone permissions which are needed to receive alarms. Allow these permissions when requested.

Check to make sure that you have the correct phone settings and permissions enabled. If your phone is not configured properly, you will not be able to use the App, so you will not receive alarms or be able to check your glucose.

If you adjust the phone ringer volume to silent or use the phone Do Not Disturb setting, keep ‘Override Do Not Disturb’ setting in the App ON for Low Glucose, High Glucose, and Signal Loss alarms to ensure you receive audible alarms.

You should disconnect headphones or speakers from your phone when you are not using them as you may not hear audio for alarms. If using headphones, keep them in your ears.If you are using peripheral devices connected to your phone, such as wireless headphones or a smartwatch, you may receive alarms on only one device or peripheral, not all.

Some operating system features may impact your ability to receive alarms. For example, if you use the iOS Screen Time feature, add FreeStyle Libre 2 to the list of Always Allowed apps to ensure that you receive alarms.

Keep your phone well charged and turned on.

If you are using FreeStyle Libre 2 App, you must have access to a blood glucose monitoring system as the App does not provide one.

FreeStyle Libre 2 app installed on a smartphone is intended for use by a single person. It must not be used by more than one person due to the risk of misinterpreting glucose information.

The App uses all available glucose data to give you readings so you should scan your Sensor at least once every 8 hours for the most accurate performance. Scanning less frequently may result in decreased performance.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The subject device is the FreeStyle Libre 2 (“FSL2”) Flash Glucose Monitoring System (with FreeStyle Libre 2 App) and is modified from the previously cleared system in K193371. This submission adds the FreeStyle Libre 2 App (‘FSL2 App’ or ‘App’), which is an alternative primary reader option for the FSL2 System. No changes are proposed to the previously cleared sensor or reader. When used with the FSL2 Sensor (or “Patch”) cleared under K193371, the proposed mobile app allows the user to:

activate FSL2 Sensors, view important safety information, alarm status, and measured interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose levels, and • connect with cloud-based applications to store and share data (e.g., LibreView).

The device is intended for use in people with diabetes mellitus, age 4 and older. The user downloads the app from the Apple App Store for iOS.

# Principle of Operation

Upon user-initiated scan enabled by near-field communication (NFC) technology, the FSL2 App can wirelessly query glucose data from the sensor by bringing a compatible smartphone in proximity of the sensor. An app can only be paired with one sensor. The FSL2 system uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to transfer glucose data each minute from the Sensor, which allows for alarms to be presented to the user.

Upon scanning, glucose values are calculated by the App using the same algorithm as the previously cleared Reader (K193371). The scan results include glucose measurements, trend information, historic 8-hr glucose results, and any applicable glucose messages. Glucose information is accompanied by background colors, which indicates how a glucose measurement compares with a user-specified range. Before obtaining glucose measurements, a 1-hour warmup period is required after sensor activation. A check blood glucose icon appears notifying the user that a blood glucose test must be used to confirm sensor readings during the first 12 hours of wear before making treatment decisions. The app supports manual entry of blood glucose values as well as event logging. The user may generate and share a range of report types, stratified by 7, 14, 30, or 90 days. The App stores up to 90 days of data.

# System Components and Features

Alarms: The App is designed to issue glucose alarms that notify the user to perform a scan when glucose has passed a glucose threshold. The FSL2 App can issue the following glucose and system alarms:

Optional Alarms: Low Glucose Alarm, High Glucose Alarm, Signal Loss Alarm o For the optional alarms above, the Override Do Not Disturb (DND) setting is turned on by default; therefore, the user receives these alarms regardless of the phone’s sound, vibe or DND settings. If the user wishes to have the optional alarms follow the phone’s sound and vibe settings, the user must turn off Override DND from the App.   
Mandatory Alarms: Urgent Low Alarm, Sensor Termination Alarms, App Stopped (Force Closed) o These alarms cannot be turned off or modified and will always sound regardless of the phone’s sound and vibe or DND settings.

Hardware / Software compatibility: The FreeStyle Libre 2 App is intended for use with NFC and BLE-enabled smartphones running compatible iOS operating systems. The FSL2 App is only compatible with FSL2 sensors.

Secondary Viewers: LibreView and LibreLinkUp (LLU) provide a cloud-based repository for glucose measurement data and mobile app that allows caregivers to receive and view glucose data (including glucose alarms) from users who use the FSL2 App with their sensor. Secondary viewers are not intended to be used for immediate clinical decision making.
