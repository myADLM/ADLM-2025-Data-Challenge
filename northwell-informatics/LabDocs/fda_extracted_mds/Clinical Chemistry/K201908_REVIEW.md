# II Review Summary:

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter's own CLASS I device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable.

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER'S previously cleared device: LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Testosterone (K122793).   
2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).   
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to

demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed. This change was for:

Extending the assay measuring range from $0 . 1 6 - 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $0 . 0 2 4 - 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Extending the open use stability claim for the device from four (4) weeks up to eight (8) weeks when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .   
Extending open use stability of calibrators up to eight (8) weeks after opening when properly stored.   
Extending the calibration curve stability from seven (7) days up to four (4) weeks. Change of proprietary name from the LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Testosterone to LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Testosterone xt.

4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.   
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
