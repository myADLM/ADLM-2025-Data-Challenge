# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted based on guidance from the CLSI EP6-A. A high human serum sample and a low human serum sample were prepared respectively by spiking a serum sample with Cortisol high concentration solution and diluting a serum sample with Cortisol zero matrix. High and a low serum samples were analysed in addition to 12 evenly spaced dilutions which were created by mixing the high and low sample as indicated below:

<table><tr><td>Sample</td><td>Dilution</td><td>Dilution Factor (%)</td></tr><tr><td>1:</td><td>Low (L)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2:</td><td>0.98L + 0.02H</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3:</td><td>0.95L + 0.05H</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>4:</td><td>0.92L + 0.08H</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>5:</td><td>0.90L + 0.10H</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>6:</td><td>0.80L + 0.20H</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>7:</td><td>0.70L + 0.30H</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>8:</td><td>0.60L + 0.40H</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>9:</td><td>0.50L + 0.50H</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>10:</td><td>0.40L + 0.60H</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>11:</td><td>0.30L + 0.70H</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>12:</td><td>0.20L + 0.80H</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>13:</td><td>0.10L + 0.90H</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>14:</td><td>High (H)</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

Results:

Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP-6A, "Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures". Samples were prepared by diluting a high patient sample with a low patient sample prior to assay. The linear regression of the observed concentrations versus the expected concentrations is:

Observed $= 1 . 0 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ (Expected) + 0.01 µg/dL; Regression coefficient $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ : 1.00

The IDS Cortisol assay is linear over the measuring range 0.59 to $4 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability The IDS Cortisol assay is traceable to the LC-MS/MS Candidate Reference Measurement Procedure (cRMP) Total Serum Cortisol. Through analysis of a Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM)-listed panel of higher-order Candidate Reference Materials (CRM), the IDS Cortisol provided metrologically traceable results.

# Stability

The stability based on accelerated stability studies determined a shelf life of 12 months

d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined with guidance from CLSI EP17A2, "Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation" using 60 blank replicates and 13 low level samples.

<table><tr><td>Sensitivity</td><td>Concentration (μg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td>Limit of Blank (LoB)</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>Limit of Detection (LoD)</td><td>0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)</td><td>0.59</td></tr></table>

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference and cross-reactivity studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP07-A3 Interference.

The potential interference of each substance in the specific detection of Cortisol, with the exception of Rheumatoid Factor (see the description of the Rheumatoid Factor interference), was tested using human serum samples with low and high cortisol concentrations. Interference substances were spiked into the serum samples and the results were measured and compared between the spiked and unspiked samples.

$\%$ Interference was calculated using the following formula:

$\%$ Interference $=$ (mean spiked concentration  mean unspiked concentration) x 100 mean unspiked concentration

To determine potential interference of Rheumatoid Factor, a serum sample with low Cortisol and high Rheumatoid Factor concentration was diluted 1:2 and 1:4 in cortisol zero matrix and each dilution was assayed in duplicate. Linearity on dilution was assessed.

$\%$ Observed/Expected $\mathrm { ( \% O / E ) }$ was calculated using the following formula:

$\%$ $\mathrm { { } ^ { \prime } O / E = }$ observed mean concentration x 100 expected concentration

The following compounds were tested and found not to interfere significantly with the test, based on the predefined acceptance criteria of non-significant interference of ${ < } 1 0 \%$ bias between the test and control samples:

A total of 194 samples, selected to represent a wide range of Cortisol concentrations [0.64 to $4 4 . 6 6 \mu \mathrm { g / d L } ]$ , were assayed by each method. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed on the comparative data:

<table><tr><td>n</td><td>Slope</td><td>95% CI</td><td>Intercept (μg/dL)</td><td>95% CI</td><td>Correlation Coefficient (r)</td></tr><tr><td>194</td><td>1.06</td><td>1.04 to 1.07</td><td>-0.10</td><td>-0.39 to 0.04</td><td>0.99</td></tr></table>

# b. Matrix comparison:

The IDS Cortisol matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate the difference across tube types (serum separator tubes (SST), lithium heparin plasma, sodium heparin plasma, K2 EDTA plasma and K3 EDTA plasma) versus the control samples (red top serum, without additive) following the CLSI EP9-A3 guideline. A total of 45 samples (36 native, 9 spiked or diluted) to cover the range of 0.89 to $4 2 . 3 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ .Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed on the comparative data:

# 3. Expected values/Reference range:

The cortisol concentration was measured in serum samples collected from 307 apparently healthy donors using the IDS Cortisol assay. The study cohort included subjects from 21 to 65 years of age, with normal blood pressure (120/80) and normal BMI, (18.5 to 29.0). Individuals who were pregnant, breast feeding, had personal history of chronic disease, under any prescription medication or any doctor prescribed diet were excluded from the study. The $9 5 \ \%$ reference intervals for apparently healthy adults were calculated by a non-parametric method following guidance from CLSI C28-A3 "Defining, Establishing and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory".

The package insert recommends that 'Each laboratory should determine ranges for their local population.
