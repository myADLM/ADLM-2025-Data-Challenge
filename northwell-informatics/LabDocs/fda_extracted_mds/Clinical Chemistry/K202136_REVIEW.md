C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only   
D Special Instrument Requirements: IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated System, i.e. IDS system

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The IDS Cortisol assay consists of a reagent cartridge. The reagent cartridge contains multiple reagents:

MPE1: Magnetic particles coated rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody in a phosphate buffer with Proclin as preservative. • CONJ: Cortisol coupled with an acridinium ester derivative in phosphate buffer with Proclin as a preservative. mAb: Mouse anti-cortisol monoclonal antibody in phosphate buffer with Proclin as a preservative.; • BUF: HEPES buffer containing Proclin as preservative.

# B Principle of Operation:

The assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. $3 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of patient sample, controls or calibrators are incubated with assay buffer. Following the first incubation step, an anti-cortisol monoclonal antibody is added, followed by a subsequent incubation step. An acridinium labelled cortisol conjugate and anti-IgG antibody coated magnetic particles are added prior to a third incubation step. The magnetic particles are captured using a magnet and a wash step performed to remove any unbound analyte. Trigger reagents are added; the resulting light emitted by the acridinium label is inversely proportional to the concentration of analyte in the original sample.

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The IDS Cortisol assay precision was evaluated internally in accordance with a modified protocol based on CLSI EP05-A3, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.” Six samples (two native serum samples and four contrived serum samples) were included in the precision testing at one site. Each of the six samples were tested for 20 days, two runs per day in two replicates using three lots of reagents on three IDS systems, one kit lot per system, with two operators. The IDS Cortisol assay precision was established using samples with concentrations ranging from approximately $0 . 8 0 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ to $4 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

2. Linearity:

Linearity of the IDS Cortisol assay was conducted based on guidance from CLSI EP6-A. A high human serum sample $( { \sim } 4 5 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ and a low human serum sample $( 0 . 4 0 \mu \mathrm { g / d L } )$ were prepared respectively by spiking a serum sample with a high concentration cortisol solution and diluting a serum sample with cortisol-free calibrator matrix. The high and low serum samples were mixed to create a total of 14 concentration levels. Samples were assayed in quadruplicate within a single run.

Statistical evaluation using linear regression showed that the assay is linear from 0.59 to $4 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , yielding a linear regression result of $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0 1$ with a correlation coefficient of $\mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 0$ .

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Endogenous and Exogenous Drug Interference:

Except for Rheumatoid Factor, interference was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP07-A3 on two contrived serum samples at two different cortisol concentrations ${ \sim } 2 \ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ to ${ \sim } 3 0$ $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ . Interference substances were spiked into the serum samples and the results were measured and compared between the spiked and un-spiked samples. Each interferent was tested at two different levels. Both spiked and un-spiked samples were assayed in 26 replicates each. The sponsor defined significant interference as ${ > } 1 0 \%$ bias between test and control samples.

To determine potential interference of Rheumatoid Factor, a serum sample with ${ \sim } 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ cortisol and high Rheumatoid Factor concentration was diluted 1:2 and 1:4 in calibrator matrix and each dilution was assayed in duplicate. The recovery bias compared to the neat sample for each dilution was $< 1 0 \%$ .

The package insert contains the following limitations:

Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed.

Pregnancy, contraceptives and estrogen therapy lead to elevated cortisol concentrations.”

# Cross-reactivity:

Cross-reactivity studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP07- A3. Contrived serum samples were spiked with 13 potential cross-reactants. The analyte concentration of the samples was approximately ${ \sim } 2$ and ${ \sim } 3 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { d L }$ of cortisol. For each serum sample spiked with a cross-reactant, a control (un-spiked sample) was prepared by replacing the cross-reactant with the same volume of cross-reactant solvent. Both spiked and un-spiked samples were assayed in 26 replicates each.

The percentage of cross reactivity was determined using the formula below:

$\%$ cross reactivity $=$

(Mean conc. of spiked sample – mean conc. of un-spiked sample) $\mathbf { x l 0 0 \% }$ Final concentration of cross-reactant added

The package insert contains the following limitations:

“In samples from patients who have been treated with prednisolone, methylprednisolone or prednisone may lead to falsely elevated cortisol concentrations.

Patients suffering from 21-hydroxylase deficiency exhibit elevated 21- deoxycortisol and this can also lead to elevated cortisol levels.”

# 4. Assay Reportable Range:

The reportable range of the assay is $0 . 5 9 - 4 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Any value that reads below 0.59 $\mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ should be reported as $\scriptstyle \mathbf { \mu } \mathbf { e } < 0 . 5 9 \ \mu \mathbf { g } / \mathrm { d L } ^ { \prime }$ . Any value that reads above $4 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ should be reported as $^ { \mathrm { \ e \ e } } { > } 4 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ .” The results of the detection limit, linearity and method comparison studies support the assay reportable range.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability:

The IDS Cortisol assay is standardized against the ERM-DA451/IFCC panel, which is traceable to the LC-MS/MS Candidate Reference Measurement Procedure (cRMP) Total Serum Cortisol.

# 6. Detection Limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined with guidance from CLSI EP17-A2, “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation” using 60 blank replicates and 13 low level samples. The LoB, LoD and LoQ samples were tested with three kit lots.

The limit of blank (LoB) was determined using zero calibrator matrix. Each LoB sample was assayed during a five-day period for a total of 60 replicates (12 replicates per assay, one assay per day, for five days) on one instrument by one operator for each kit lot. A different instrument was used for each kit lot. LoB was calculated according to the parametric function as described in CLSI EP17-A2.

The limit of detection (LoD) samples were prepared by diluting two human serum samples with zero matrix to achieve a panel of samples of six cortisol levels ranging from 0.21 to $0 . 7 1 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Each of the six LoD samples was measured in duplicate. For each kit lot, a total of ten assays were performed over a five-day period by one operator and on a different instrument per kit lot, for a total of ten replicates per sample. LoD was calculated according to CLSI EP17-A2.

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) samples were prepared by diluting two human serum samples with zero matrix to achieve 7 sample levels ranging from 0.21 to $1 . 2 1 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . The LoQ panel of seven samples were measured in duplicate two times per day. For each kit lot, a total of ten assays were run over a five-day period by one operator and on a different instrument, for a total of 20 replicates per sample. The limit of quantitation was defined as the lowest analyte concentration with a within-laboratory precision of $\leq 2 0 \%$ CV.

LoB, LoD and LoQ were calculated according to the parametric analysis described in CLSI EP17-A2. The results support the following detection limits:

<table><tr><td>Sensitivity</td><td>Concentration (μg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td>Limit of Blank (LoB)</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>Limit of Detection (LoD)</td><td>0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)</td><td>0.59</td></tr></table>
