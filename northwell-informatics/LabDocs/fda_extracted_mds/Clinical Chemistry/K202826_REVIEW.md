# B Principle of Operation:

IMMULITE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cortisol is a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-cortisol antibody. The liquid phase consists of alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to cortisol. The patient sample and the reagent are incubated together with the coated bead for 30 minutes. During this time, cortisol in the sample competes with enzyme-conjugated cortisol in the reagent for a limited number of antibody binding sites on the bead. Unbound patient sample and enzyme conjugate are then removed by centrifugal washes. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the test unit containing the bead and the signal is generated inversely proportional to the bound enzyme.

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision/reproducibility information provided was reviewed and found to be acceptable to support that the modified device performs as described in k931409.

2. Linearity:

The linearity information provided was reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the linear range of $1 { - } 5 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { d L }$ (28 to $1 3 8 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ described in k931409.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Cross-reactivity:

A cross-reactivity study was conducted to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of the assay. Potential cross-reactants were spiked at a ratio of 1:19 into an aliquot of a blank sample (charcoal- adsorbed human serum) and blank samples were also prepared which consisted of charcoal-adsorbed human serum spiked 1:19 with the solvents used to prepare the crossreactants. The testing was performed using 1 reagent lot with cross reactant and blank samples assayed in duplicate on 1 instrument. Cross-reactivity was calculated as follows:

$\%$ Cross-reactivity $=$ Observed cross-reactivity mean dose x $100 \%$ Cross-reactant added concentration $( \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$

ND = Not Detected

The labeling includes the following limitation statement;

“Circulating cortisol results may be falsely elevated in samples obtained from patients being treated with prednisolone or prednisone (converted to prednisolone in vivo). Circulating cortisol results may also be falsely elevated due to cross-reactivity with 11- Deoxycortisol during metyrapone stimulation testing and therapy, potentially masking a hypoadrenalism. Caution must therefore be exercised with cortisol determinations for patients undergoing therapy with these and structurally related synthetic corticosteroids.”

# Interference:

The sponsor stated that a study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP07 to evaluate interference for conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin, intralipid and biotin. Working stock solutions of the interfering substances were prepared and spiked into 5 patient samples containing cortisol levels ranging from $3 . 6 - 2 2 . 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Blank control samples

were prepared by spiking an aliquot of the same patient sample with an equivalent volume of the solvent used to prepare the test substance. The testing was performed using 1 reagent lot with interferent and blank samples assayed in triplicate on 1 instrument. Mean percent recovery was calculated as:

$\%$ recovery $=$ mean observed dose (interferent spike) x 100 mean control dose (blank spike)

The interference study results support the following labeling limitations:

<table><tr><td>Hemolysis: Presence of hemoglobin in concentrations up to 384 mg/dL has no effect on results, within the precision of the assay.</td></tr><tr><td>Lipemia: Presence of triglycerides in concentrations up to 3000 mg/dL has no effect on results, within the precision of the assay.</td></tr><tr><td>Bilirubin: Samples spiked with 100 and 200 mg/L of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin were analyzed. Bilirubin may interfere with the assay, causing elevation of values.</td></tr><tr><td>Biotin: Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of 3500 ng/mL demonstrate a less than or equal to 10% change in results. Biotin concentrations greater than this may lead to incorrect results for patient samples.</td></tr></table>

4. Assay Reportable Range: Cortisol: $1 { - } 5 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { d L }$ (28 to 1380 nmol/L).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures.

6. Detection Limit:

The sponsor conducted Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) studies to evaluate the detection capability of the modified IMMULITE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cortisol assay and stated these studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP17- A2.

# Limit of Blank:

Four blank samples were prepared using charcoal-adsorbed human serum matrix and tested on 2 reagent lots, 1 instrument, 1 run per day for 3 days with 6 replicates per day resulting in a total of 72 replicates for each reagent lot. The limit of blank was estimated by the 95th percentile of 72 values for each lot. LoB was taken as the highest LoB from both reagent lots.

# Limit of Detection:

Four low analyte samples (native serum samples diluted with charcoal-adsorbed human serum) were tested using 2 reagent lots, 1 instrument, 1 run per day for 3 days with 6 replicates per day resulting in a total of 72 replicates for each reagent lot. For the low level

samples, parametric LoD equations were applied using the LoB value. LoD was determined for both reagent lots, with the maximum of the two values used to set LoD.

# Limit of Quantitation:

The limit of quantitation was determined using 8 human samples (native serum samples diluted with charcoal-adsorbed human serum) spanning the low end range of the assay (from $0 . 1 6 { - } 3 . 3 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L } )$ and tested with 2 reagent lots for 5 test days, 2 runs per day and 5 replicates per run, for a total of 50 measurements per sample, per reagent lot. For each lot, regression analysis was performed based on within-laboratory precision plotted against the mean concentration obtained for each sample. The LoQ was defined as the largest cortisol concentration having a predicated within-laboratory CV of $20 \%$ .

LoB/LoD/LoQ estimates are summarized below:

Not applicable.

# B Comparison Studies:

# 1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed by comparing the modified device to the predicate device (unmodified IMMULITE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cortisol Assay). The sponsor states the study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP09c. A total of 149 native patient samples were assayed in duplicate split across 4 runs, with each run on a different instrument (40 patients on instrument 1-3, and 30 patients on instrument 4). The first replicate for the modified assay was compared to the mean of the two replicates for the predicate (unmodified) device.
