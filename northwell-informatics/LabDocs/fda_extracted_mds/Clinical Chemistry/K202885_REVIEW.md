# II Review Summary:

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter's own CLASS II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable

1. BGM009 Plus Blood Glucose System, K170267. (For a preamendments device, a statement to this effect has been provided.)

2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed. This change was for:

Dimensions of the meter were changed from 93x58x20.5 (mm) to 96x58x16 (mm) Added strip ejection button. Change of power source from two AAA batteries to two CR2032 lithium batteries. LCD size changed, added new icons and back light. The meter memory capacity was changed from 300 to 500 test results and added 1, 60, 90 day averaging feature. Addition of before meal, after meal, exercise, and event icons. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia warnings were added to the meter. Reorganized the definitions of error codes. Changed the product name from BGM009 Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System to GlucoSure HT Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System. • Added individually wrapped test strips for use with the system.

4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.   
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.

The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were previously performed on the exterior meter materials (k182593) demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 67619-12). A robustness study was performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles to support 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
