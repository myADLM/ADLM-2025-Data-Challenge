C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only D Special Instrument Requirements: ARCHITECT c8000 System

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Albumin BCP2 Reagent Kit contains the Reagent 1 (R1). The active ingredient is Bromocresol Purple $( 0 . 1 5 4 \mathrm { g / L } )$ . Other ingredients are sodium hydroxide/acetic acid $\mathrm { ( p H } 5 . 4 )$ , detergent/surfactant $( 0 . 8 \% )$ , ProClin 300 and ProClin 950 (preservatives).

# B Principle of Operation:

The Albumin BCP2 assay is an automated clinical chemistry assay. The Albumin BCP2 procedure is based on the binding of bromocresol purple specifically with human albumin to produce a colored complex. The absorbance of the complex at $6 0 4 \mathrm { n m }$ is directly proportional to the albumin concentration in the sample.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The Abbott Albumin BCP2 assay was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Testing was conducted using 3 lots of the Albumin BCP2 reagent, 3 lots of the calibrators, 1 lot of controls, and 3 instruments. Samples were prepared by spiking pooled normal human serum to a target concentration of $0 . 4 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $5 . 4 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ , and $8 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ . The samples were tested in 2 replicates, 2 times per day, for 20 days, for a total of 80 measurements.

\*Includes within-run, between-run, and between day variability. \*\*Minimum and maximum SD or $\% \mathrm { C V }$ across all reagent lot and instrument combinations.

# 2. Linearity:

The linearity studies were performed following CLSI EP06-A. Twelve unique samples were prepared by dilution of a high albumin sample (ranging from $0 . 0 - 1 1 . 6 \ : \mathrm { g / d L } )$ and assayed using one lot of the Albumin BCP2 reagent, 1 lot of calibrator, on a single instrument and a single run. Two replicates were tested per sample/pool and all replicates were used in the analysis. The data were analyzed using linear regression as well as second and third order non-linear fitted polynomial regression with the third order model demonstrating the best fit. For all test samples, the absolute value of the degree of non-linearity met the sponsor’s predefined acceptance criteria for deviation from linearity and the results support that the assay is linear across the claimed analytical measuring interval of 0.3 to $9 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# Dilution study:

To support the claimed extended measuring interval (EMI), five samples spanning the extended measuring interval were prepared at target concentration values of $1 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ , 12.5 $\mathrm { g / d L }$ , $1 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $1 7 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ , and $2 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Samples were tested using the 1:2.5 automated and manual dilution protocol (dilution factor $= 1 { : } 2 . 4 9 $ ) on the ARCHITECT c8000 System with one reagent lot for a total of 30 replicates (2 instruments $\textrm { x 3 }$ runs/instrument x 5 replicates/run).

The $\%$ dilution recovery values ranged from $1 0 4 . 8 7 \%$ to $1 0 7 . 2 0 \%$ for the auto-diluted samples and from $1 0 6 . 4 9 \%$ to $1 0 9 . 8 9 \%$ for the manually diluted samples, when compared to expected values. The total $\%$ CV ranged from $1 . 1 \%$ to $1 . 3 \%$ for auto-diluted samples and $0 . 8 \%$ to $1 . 2 \%$ for manually diluted samples. Samples within the EMI demonstrated withinlaboratory imprecision within or equal to $5 \%$ CV. The dilution study results support that samples with concentrations above $9 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ may be diluted 1:2.5 either manually or ononboard the analyzer to obtain results up to $2 2 . 4 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The interference was evaluated using test samples that were prepared by spiking each potentially interfering substance into a human serum pool with low albumin (approximately $3 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ ) or high albumin (approximately $5 . 0 \mathrm { g / d L }$ ) concentrations. Each sample as well as a matched control sample without the interfering substance were tested in replicates of 10. The sponsor stated that interference was considered to be non-significant if the difference between the samples with and without interferent was less or equal to $\pm 1 0 \%$ .

The results of the highest concentration tested without significant interference are summarized in the table below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

The analytical measuring interval of the assay is $0 . 3 - 9 . 0 \mathrm { g / d L }$ . The extended measuring interval of the assay is $9 . 0 - 2 2 . 4 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The Albumin BCP2 assay is traceable to the ERM-DA470/IFCC standard.

6. Detection Limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.

The LoB study was performed by testing 4 blank samples $( 0 ~ \mathrm { g / d L } )$ , using 3 reagent lots over 3 days on 2 different instruments. Each day, for each reagent lot, 5 replicate measurements were recorded (60 results). The LoB was calculated non-parametrically at the 95th percentile for each lot. The higher LoB for both reagent lots was chosen as the assay’s LoB.

The LoD study was performed by testing 6 levels level samples using 3 reagent lots over 3 days on 2 instruments. Each day, for each reagent lot, 10 replicate measurements were recorded (60 results per reagent lot). LoD was calculated non-parametrically. The higher LoD of the 3 lots was chosen as the assay’s LoD.

The LoQ study was performed using 6 low level human sera samples measured over 3 days on 2 instruments using 3 reagent lots. Each day, for each reagent lot, 10 replicate measurements were recorded (60 results total). The sponsor defined LoQ as the LoD or the mean concentration of the samples with the lowest concentration at which the maximum allowable precision of $2 0 \% C \mathrm { V }$ was met, whichever was greater.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Human native serum samples $\mathrm { ( n { = } 1 2 7 }$ ) spanning the analytical measuring interval of the assay were tested. For the candidate device, samples were tested internally using 3 lots of reagents and 1 lot each of calibrator and controls across 2 ARCHITECT c8000 instruments. For the predicate device, samples were tested internally using 1 lot each of reagents, calibrator, and controls across 2 ARCHITECT $\mathbf { c 8 0 0 0 }$ instruments. Each sample was tested in a minimum of 2 replicates using both methods and testing occurred over a minimum of 3 calendar days.

A Passing-Bablok evaluation was performed by comparing the first replicate result from the candidate device versus the mean result from the predicate device.

The results are summarized below:

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

A matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate plasma samples and blood collection tube types suitable for use with the Albumin BCP2 assay. Samples containing $\mathrm { 0 . 7 { - } 9 . 0 \ { g / d L } }$ albumin (as determined in serum samples) were obtained from 40 donors in the control tube type (serum separator tube) and in the evaluation tube types (K2EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, lithium heparin (separator tube)).

All samples were processed according to the blood collection tube manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were evaluated on the candidate device and tested in a minimum of 2 replicates using 1 lot of the Albumin BCP2 reagent, 1 lot of the Consolidated Chemistry Calibrator, 1 lot of commercially available controls, and1 instrument. For the control tube type, all 3 replicates were analyzed. For the evaluation tube types, only the 1st replicate was analyzed.

The results are shown below:
