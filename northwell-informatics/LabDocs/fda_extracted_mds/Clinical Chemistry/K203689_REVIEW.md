# II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New device   
B Type of Test: Not applicable

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

Tidepool Loop, a mobile application with algorithm technology, is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) insulin infusion pumps to automatically increase, decrease, and suspend delivery of basal insulin based on iCGM readings and predicted glucose values. It can also recommend, and with the user’s confirmation, control the delivery of correction boluses when glucose values are predicted to exceed user configurable thresholds.

Tidepool Loop is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons six years of age and greater.

Tidepool Loop is intended for single patient use.

Tidepool Loop is Rx - For Prescription Use Only.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Tidepool Loop should not be used by anyone who is unable to notice alerts, alarms, and reminders because of physical limitations.

Tidepool Loop should not be used by anyone that is unable to monitor glucose as recommended by their healthcare provider.

Tidepool Loop should not be used by anyone that is unable to maintain contact with their healthcare provider.

Tidepool Loop should not be used during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. Components of the Tidepool Loop system may not have been tested in magnetic fields and heat could damage the CGM or insulin pump being used with Tidepool Loop and prevent accurate sensor glucose readings or accurate insulin delivery. This could result in overdelivery or under-delivery of insulin, which can lead to low or high blood glucose. Please follow Healthcare Provider instructions and refer to the individual component manuals for more information.

Do not use Tidepool Loop in children under the the age of six years old. Tidepool Loop is not indicated for use by anyone who is under the age of six years old and the performance of the system in children under six is unknown.

Tidepool Loop is not indicated for use by anyone who is pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. It is not known how different conditions or medications used in these scenarios may affect performance of the Tidepool Loop system. CGM readings being used by the system may be inaccurate in these cases, meaning the Tidepool Loop App will not have accurate information to use for dosage recommendations. This could result in overdelivery or under-delivery of insulin, which can lead to low and high blood glucose.

Do not take external insulin, such as manual insulin injections or inhaled insulins, while the Tidepool Loop app and insulin pump are operational. Tidepool Loop does not receive

information about insulin taken outside the app. If you choose to take additional insulin with another method while the app and insulin pump are working, overdelivery or under-delivery of insulin may occur, which can lead to low and high blood glucose. Consult with your healthcare provider about how long to wait after manually taking insulin before using Closed Loop Mode with Tidepool Loop.

Do not use Tidepool Loop if you are taking GLP-1 agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors, metformin, or DPP-4. Tidepool Loop has not been tested in populations using additional diabetes medications and the performance of the system in conjunction with these medications is unknown.

Do not use Tidepool Loop when using hydroxyurea, a medication used in the treatment of diseases including cancer and sickle cell anemia. CGM readings being used by the system may be inaccurate while taking hydroxyurea, meaning the Tidepool Loop App will not have accurate information to use for dosage recommendations. This could result in overdelivery of insulin, which can lead to hypoglycemia. Talk to your healthcare provider about using your BG meter for treatment decisions instead.

ONLY use NovoLog or Humalog U-100 insulin in your Tidepool Loop-compatible insulin pump. Tidepool Loop is designed to automate dosing of NovoLog or Humalog U-100 rapidacting insulin only.

Speak with your healthcare provider about lifestyle changes that may impact your overall insulin needs and settings, such as weight gain or loss or starting or stopping new activities.

Only the particular iCGM and ACE pump devices specifically designated by Tidepool for compatibility with the Tidepool Loop app may be used with the app.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Tidepool Loop is a software-only device intended for use by people with Type 1 diabetes. The software algorithm resides on a mobile application that can be downloaded to qualified mobile devices (e.g., iPhone) and connects to a compatible Alternate Controller Enabled insulin pump (ACE pump) and a compatible integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) to automatically increase, decrease, and suspend delivery of basal insulin based on readings from the iCGM and glucose values predicted by Tidepool Loop. By design, Tidepool Loop can only be used with compatible iCGM and ACE Pump devices for which the Tidepool Loop has been validated for use with. Tidepool Loop will not allow use of an unvalidated ACE pump or iCGM. There are controls within the software to prevent use of Tidepool Loop in these cases.

Tidepool Loop uses the Tidepool Loop Bolus Recommendation Tool (TLBRT) in closed loop mode, which can recommend, and, with the user’s confirmation, deliver correction boluses when glucose values are predicted to exceed user configurable thresholds. Tidepool Loop predicts glucose levels up to 6 hours in the future based on prior iCGM readings, insulin delivery history, and user input (e.g., carbohydrate intake and exercise), and uses that prediction to adjust insulin delivery. Tidepool Loop requires that users input their specific therapy settings, which are

established with the help of their health care provider before using the device, as part of the prescription process. These settings include:

• Target Correction Ranges for normal operation, pre-meal, and workout presets o Settings can be programmed as low as $8 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and as high as $1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and different ranges can be added for different times of day. Glucose Safety Limit o Settings can be programmed as low as $6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , or as high as $1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or the Correction Range minimum, whichever is lower.   
• Carb to Insulin Ratios   
• Insulin sensitivity factors   
• Basal rates   
• Max basal rate   
• Max bolus

Tidepool Loop can be used to adjust or suspend basal insulin delivery every 5 minutes based on actual CGM sensor and predicted glucose readings. iCGM values are automatically used by the TLBRT when the Tidepool Loop Algorithm technology is active (i.e., when the device is operating in closed-loop mode with an active iCGM sensor session). The TLBRT is disabled when closed-loop mode is off, such as when it is manually disabled, or when there is no active iCGM sensor session. The user will use Tidepool Loop’s simple bolus calculator, into which iCGM values are not automatically populated into the glucose field.

Summary of Clinical Testing:

Tidepool Loop was derived from the open source, community-developed Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Loop project. The Loop Observational Study was a real-world, virtual, observational study conducted to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of Loop in both new and existing users to support this premarket notification for Tidepool Loop. Users were recruited to enroll in the observational study and provide their information related to algorithm use. The protocol allowed enrollment of up to 1,250 participants of any age with Type 1 diabetes with a target of at least 300 participants and a minimum of 150 new Loop users.

The study enrolled subjects diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who were using insulin (either pump therapy or multiple daily injections [MDI]) and currently used Loop or had plans to begin using Loop for insulin delivery.

Participant baseline data were collected on web-based data collection forms including demographic information, glycemic information (via continuous glucose monitoring data, if available), and quality of life/psychosocial and treatment satisfaction surveys. During the study,

CGM and insulin dosing data were collected continuously and uploaded automatically from the Tidepool Mobile app on a user’s own iPhone to the Tidepool cloud, from which it was retrieved by the study coordinating center.

Participants completed weekly web-based surveys about Adverse Events (severe hypoglycemia, DKA, hospitalization) and device issues. Participants were followed for up to 12 months, with updates obtained after 3, 6, and 12 months that included web-based surveys on patient-reported outcomes and psychosocial/quality-of-life aspects related to Loop use. Focus groups were also completed.

# Baseline Demographics

The observational study included participants that are not part of the intended user population (i.e. $\geq 6$ years old, using Humalog or Novolog insulin only, and making use of the Tidepool Loop guardrails (Correction Range $8 7 { - } 1 8 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Glucose Safety Limit $6 7 { - } 1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Cohort A and Cohort B included participants who used settings that are outside of the final Tidepool Loop setting ranges. The table below summarizes these different populations. Due to the observational nature of the study and rolling enrollment, not all participants were eligible to meet the 9-month and/or 12-month follow-ups.

# Primary Study Safety Results

The Loop Observational Study did not exclude subjects with a prior history of severe hypoglycemia (SH) or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The majority of severe adverse events observed during the study were experienced by the minority of participants who also had at least one severe hypoglycemic event in the three months before using DIY Loop. The tables below summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemic events at baseline (i.e., at enrollment) and follow-up by age group in the intended use population.

# Human Factors

Human factors validation tests were conducted with Tidepool Loop installed on an iPhone. A total of 9 formative studies were conducted; after each study, information was fed back into the design of the User Interface. The summative human factors validation study was performed on the final device design with fifty-one representative participants which included adults, and children with their caregivers. All study participants received training that was consistent with the training that patients would receive with the commercial product and interacted with the device in a simulated use environment. Usability evaluations assessed comprehension and usability of the device for critical device tasks. Results of the study demonstrated that the device could be used safely by intended users.

# User and Provider Training

Physician and user training as per the sponsor provided training materials is important to ensure safe use of the device. The sponsor provided training materials for healthcare providers who will prescribe this device and manage patients who use this device. The training covers how the device works, details of the clinical study, setting up the device, and information on how to assess patient results with the device.

A training plan for device users was also provided. The plan provides resources for various types of users including new pump users, users switching from a different pump, and users upgrading from a partner pump without Tidepool Loop to the same or similar partner ACE pump with Tidepool Loop. The training includes initial start-up, troubleshooting, maintenance, and management of the device. Training includes a follow-up 3-5 days after the initial training and subsequent communication with that person’s healthcare provider to ensure ongoing follow-up care.

# Hazard Analysis:

A comprehensive hazard analysis was provided for this device, in which design inputs and outputs, risks, and risk mitigations for software and interoperable hardware components associated with the safe and effective functioning of the device were reviewed. The hazard analysis provided in this submission accounted for the unique design elements, intended use, and risks of the Tidepool Loop System design. In particular, this hazard analysis accounted for the risks associated with interoperability between the software device developed by the sponsor and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware device it was installed on, as well as with other thirdparty interoperable devices. This analysis identified hazards which could reasonably be anticipated to impact the proper use of the device, traced all identified risks to adequate design controls, and demonstrated that design features were appropriately implemented and validated.

# Data Logging

The sponsor provided software and bench testing to demonstrate that the device is able to record critical events, including information related to its state (e.g., commanded delivery rates/volumes, all algorithm calculations, open loop / closed loop mode, power on/off events), user inputs, and device settings. In addition, the sponsor detailed the specific information that they would collect from all interoperable components connected to the Tidepool Loop including the iCGM and ACE pump components and described how Tidepool Loop will collect data from those devices, how it stores that data, and how that data can be shared with the user, with Tidepool, and with health care practitioners and caregivers. All log entries are time stamped, and the logs are either generated when the events occur or every five minutes in the case of recording algorithm calculations. These protocols were reviewed and found to be adequate.

# Interoperability

A plan and approach for interoperability were provided according to the FDA Guidance “Design Considerations and Pre-market Submission Recommendations for Interoperable Medical Devices - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff” and determined to be adequate to support and clearly specify expectations, requirements, and interface specifications for potential interoperable devices. Specifically, the sponsor has established plans for both proprietary and standards-based (leveraging relevant IEEE 11073 and Bluetooth SIG) plug-ins for interfacing with ACE pumps and iCGMs. Further, the sponsor has performed software and bench testing to verify and validate that these interface control specifications meet the special controls and their controller’s requirements for performance, communications, and data logging. In addition, the plans provided by the sponsor covered their approach to working with connected device companies regarding contractual issues, interfaces for data communication and exchange, and post-market reporting procedures and responsibilities (e.g., who is responsible for investigating and reporting complaints, malfunctions, and adverse events). The approach was determined to acceptably align with FDA-recognized ANSI/AAMI/UL 2800-1:2019 Standard for Safety for Medical Device Interoperability.

The sponsor additionally provided software protocols intended to ensure secure, accurate, and reliable communication with digital interfacing devices, as well as failsafe design features to mitigate the risks associated with interruption of communication with digitally connected devices. These protocols were executed in the comprehensive software testing performed by the sponsor which included software test suites, hardware emulators, hardware prototype testing, and software integration testing.

By design, Tidepool Loop can only be used with compatible iCGM and ACE Pump devices with which it has been validated for use. Tidepool Loop will not allow use of an unvalidated ACE pump or iCGM. There are controls within the software to prevent use of Tidepool Loop in these cases. To support the future integration of compatible ACE pumps and iCGMs with Tidepool Loop, the sponsor also provided protocols (SOP-0016, “Tidepool Loop Connected Device Integration and Validation Process and Plan,” and SOP-0018, “Tidepool Loop Regulatory Determination Process”) outlining their validation strategy for determining compatibility of new devices with the Tidepool Loop. The protocols included pre-specified procedures, validation strategies, and acceptance criteria for software, cybersecurity, device interoperability, human factors, labeling, and training materials, with the anticipated features and specifications of ACE pumps and iCGMs as these are anticipated changes foreseen at the time of the submission. These protocols, along with the software testing conducted on software test suites, hardware simulators and hardware emulators, were found to be adequate to support the robustness of the sponsor’s software test protocols to validate future integration of digitally connected devices that meet the pre-specified specifications and acceptance criteria. Tidepool Loop must not be distributed until the pre-specified acceptance criteria in the SOPs are met. FDA has determined that when a modification is made in accordance with SOP-0016, “Tidepool Loop Connected Device Integration and Validation Process and Plan,” and SOP-0018, “Tidepool Loop Regulatory Determination Process” and validation strategy described in this 510(k), then the modification would not significantly affect safety or effectiveness of the device and no new 510(k) would be required. Changes made that are inconsistent with the modifications described in SOP-0016 and SOP-0018 that were reviewed in this submission could be significant modifications that could

significantly affect the safety and/or effectiveness of this device (e.g., such changes could compromise the clinical functionality or performance specifications that are directly associated with the intended use of the device), in which case a new premarket submission would be required (see 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)).

# Cybersecurity

Detailed information on cybersecurity of the device was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor provided detailed information relating to the penetration testing conducted as part of their cybersecurity evaluation. The sponsor provided a software bill of materials, which provided details on all software used in the device and the COTS hardware platform that the Software-asa-Medical-device (SAMD) was installed on. This included all manufacturer-developed, commercially licensed, open source, partner and off-the-shelf software components (including firmware, as relevant), along with an identification of the hardware runtime environment in which each resides, with relevant version and/or model information, as well as details on whether each component was actively supported by its manufacturer or legacy licensed.

# Postmarket Surveillance Study:

There is uncertainty remaining regarding the risk/benefit profile of the device when used in the broader intended use population. While the premarket clinical study provided to support the 510(k) showed some benefits, the study included mostly white device users with relatively high levels of education and income relative to the general use population, and it was not adequately powered to assess differences in the rates of safety events (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia). Furthermore, adolescents were underrepresented in the study. Accordingly, a postmarket surveillance study will be ordered by FDA to confirm understanding of safety.

# VIII Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

# IX Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
