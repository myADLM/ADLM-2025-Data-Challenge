# Device Description Summary [21 CFR 807.92(a)(4)]

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the following components:   
- IWL2020 Meter   
- IWL2020 Blood Glucose Test Strips   
- IWL2020 Control Solutions

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a handheld device that incorporates features to aid in self-monitoring of blood glucose. The blood glucose results are displayed on the screen and stored in the meter's memory, and may also be transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless communication. Our blood glucose monitoring system creates a glucose result from an amperometric reaction. Capillary whole blood from the user's fingertip reacts with the chemicals in the test strip to create a harmless electrical current in the test strip. The blood glucose meter reads the current and gives a blood glucose result.

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is comprised of the IWL2020 meter and IWL2020 test strips.

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to quantitatively measure glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of glucose control.

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for in vitro diagnostic single patient use by people with diabetes at home.

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be shared.

This system is not for use in diagnosis or screening of diabetes mellitus, nor for neonatal use.

# Indications for Use Comparison [21 CFR 807.92(a)(5)]

The indications for use of the candidate device are the same as the predicate with the exception that the Alternate Site Testing (AST) claim will not be made with the candidate device.

# Technological Comparison [21 CFR 807.92(a)(6)]

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System measurement engine, measurement principle, and control solutions are the same as those used in the Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The candidate and predicate devices share the same technological characteristics including design, material, chemical composition, principle of operation, and energy source.   
The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System differs from the cleared Accu-Chek Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System as follows:

- Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System: Palm, Forearm, Upper Arm; - IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System: No AST claim

- Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System: Dot Matrix Display; - IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System: Fixed Segment - Guide Blood Glucose Monitoring System: 1 Button; - IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System: 2 Buttons

<table><tr><td>Strip Lot</td><td>Slope</td><td>Y-Intercept</td><td>R-squared</td></tr><tr><td>All Lots</td><td>1.07</td><td>0.9342</td><td>0.9985</td></tr></table>

Linear regression analysis results are shown below.

The results of the linearity study support the glucose measurement range of 20-600 mg/dL for the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# Interference

Interference testing was performed and all compounds met the acceptance criteria with the exception of abnormally high concentrations $( > 5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ of ascorbic acid and xylose.

The labeling contains the following limitations:

"Abnormally high concentrations (greater than $5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ ) of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may cause inaccurate results. High-dose vitamin C therapy that would result in abnormally high concentrations is typically prescribed by your healthcare professional. If you are not sure if this applies to you, please check with your healthcare professional.”

“Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing since xylose may cause inaccurate results. Xylose absorption testing is performed under the supervision of a doctor. Ask your doctor how long to wait after xylose testing before performing a blood glucose test.”

# Flex Studies

Flex studies were used to validate the insensitivity of the test system to performance variation due to factors that may contribute to erroneous results when used in home use settings rather than in laboratory or professional healthcare settings. The robustness of the system was validated through mechanical vibration and shock testing, operating conditions (temperature and humidity) testing, altitude effects testing, and stability testing. Additional sources of error that were tested included samples outside the measuring range, short sample detection, sample perturbation, intermittent sampling, and testing with used strips. In all of the tests, the system operated within its specified operating ranges even under stress conditions, and errors were correctly displayed when outside the meter's operating ranges.

# Electromagnetic Interference and Electrical Safety

The system passed electrical and safety testing according to national and international standards including IEC 61010-1, IEC 60601-1-2, IEC 61010-2-101, IEC 61000-4-2, IEC 61000-4-3, IEC 61000-4-6, and IEC 61000-4-8.

The system passed EMC testing to national and international standards including IEC 60601- 1-2, and FCC 47 CFR 15 Part B.

# Software

Based on the FDA guidance document "Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices" dated May 11, 2005, testing and documentation for Major level of concern software was completed.

# Clinical Performance

A clinical (user evaluation) study was conducted with IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the intended user population, i.e. lay persons who perform self-testing using capillary whole blood, in the United States. The study data were presented evaluating the system accuracy of the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared to the Roche/Hitachi cobas c 501 PCA-HK reference method. Study results indicated that non-professional, inexperienced lay persons were able to obtain sufficiently accurate blood glucose readings when using the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared to the comparator Roche/Hitachi cobas c 501 PCA-HK blood glucose readings obtained by trained technicians. In addition, the participating lay persons were questioned and responded as satisfied with the ease of operation by following the Instructions for Use in the User Guide and the overall performance of the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Users were able to achieve the following level of accuracy compared to the reference method:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>(within ±20% of laboratory)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>(99%) 346 of 350 results</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Accurate Results (within ±15% of laboratory)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>(96%) 336 of 350 results</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>More Accurate Results (within ±10% of laboratory)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>(88%) 307 of 350 results</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Most Accurate Results (within ±5% of laboratory)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>(63%) 220 of 350 results</td></tr></table>

# Conclusions

The results of nonclinical and clinical performance testing demonstrate that the candidate device has a substantially equivalent safety and effectiveness profile to the predicate device and should perform as intended in the specifi ed use conditions as well as the predicate device per required standards.
