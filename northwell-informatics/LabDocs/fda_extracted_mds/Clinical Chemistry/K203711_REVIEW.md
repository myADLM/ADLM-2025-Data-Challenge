# D Special Instrument Requirements:

IWL2020 Meter

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the following:   
- IWL2020 Meter (with two 3-volt lithium CR2032 batteries)   
- IWL2020 Test Strips (may be sold separately)   
- IWL2020 Control Solutions (Level 1 and Level 2, may be sold separately)   
- Quick Start Guide

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a handheld device that incorporates features to aid in self-monitoring of blood glucose. The blood glucose results are displayed on the screen and stored in the meter's memory, and may also be transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless communication.

# B Principle of Operation:

The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System quantitatively measures glucose amperometrically, and includes the enzyme on the test strip, FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), which converts the glucose in the blood to gluconolactone. When a drop of whole blood is applied to the reaction cell on the test strip, glucose in the blood sample reacts in the presence of GDH-FAD and a mediator. The electrons generated during this reaction are detected by the meter. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the blood and is converted to a glucose concentration. The glucose concentration is displayed on the meter display for the user.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

IWL2020 Meter

2. Specimen Identification:

Capillary whole blood from the user's fingertip

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action. Samples are to be tested immediately upon collection.

4. Calibration:

The IWL2020 meter is factory calibrated. No user calibration is required.

5. Quality Control:

IWL2020 control solutions (Level 1 and Level 2) are for use with the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System to check that the meters and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly. The ranges for Level 1 and Level 2 controls are printed on the test strip container label. The meter automatically recognizes the difference between the control solution and blood. Instructions on when to perform a control test, details about the control solution, performing a control test, understanding out-of-range control results are provided in the meter manual. Control solution ranges are printed on the control solution package insert.

Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and 36 IWL2020 meters by testing 11 venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 5.6 to $6 2 7 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (5.6, 14.8, 37.7, 58.4, 94.2, 127.1, 153.1, 211.0, 282.0, 471.6, $6 2 7 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). One run (across all 36 meters) was performed with each sample type using each of the strip lots. The values from the IWL2020 meter were compared with those obtained from the comparator method (hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer). The results from regression analysis are summarized below:

Test strip lot #1: $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 8 0 \mathrm { x } { + } 2 . 3 8 1 7$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 5$   
Test strip lot #2: $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 6 \ \mathrm { x } { + } 1 . 0 3 0 7$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 7$   
Test strip lot #3: $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 6 \ \mathrm { x } { + } 0 . 6 0 9 8$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 6$

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The meter will display “LO” when the result is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and “HI” when result is greater than $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sponsor validated the “LO” and “HI” functions and demonstrated that they functioned as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

To assess potential interference, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to three different glucose levels of 60, 120, $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , split into control sample and test samples. Various endogenous and exogenous substances were then added to the test sample only. The $\%$ difference between the test and control sample was calculated and the concentration tested at which no significant interference (defined a $\mathrm { \Delta \ s \pm 1 0 \ m g / d L }$ for glucose concentrations $< 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\pm 1 0 \%$ for glucose concentrations $\geq 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ was observed is presented in the table below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:

– Abnormally high concentrations (greater than $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may cause inaccurate results. High-dose vitamin C therapy that would result in abnormally high concentrations is typically prescribed by your healthcare professional. If you are not sure if this applies to you, please check with your healthcare professional.

Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing since xylose may cause inaccurate results. Xylose absorption testing is performed under the supervision of a doctor. Ask your doctor how long to wait after xylose testing before performing a blood glucose test.

# 4. Assay Reportable Range:

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values:

Traceability: According to the sponsor, the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM) 917 glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed using the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer as the comparator method (see section B.1).

Test Strip Stability: IWL2020 Test Strip stability assessed using real time stability studies. The protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the labeling claims that the test strips are stable both closed (shelf life) and open-vial for within 18 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of $3 9 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity (RH). The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.

Readability:

A Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted on the IWL2020 Meter Manual, IWL2020 Test Strip Insert, and Quick Start Guide and the results demonstrated that the labeling was written at lower than 8th grade level.

Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Values:

An additional study was conducted to assess the accuracy of the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System at the extreme low and high ends of the claimed measurement range using 46 capillary whole blood samples with glucose concentrations below $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and 56 samples greater than $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were altered by spiking or glycolysis in order to obtain the appropriate glucose concentrations. Samples were tested with the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System with test strips from 3 lots and compared to the results obtained using the comparator method (hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from $2 2 - 5 9 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , as measured by the comparator method. Results are summarized below:

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

1) Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using contrived venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of $10 - 6 5 \%$ (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 42 (nominal), 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, $70 \%$ ) spiked with glucose to achieve target concentrations between 30-50, 51- 110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400mg/dL. A total of 90 replicates per sample were performed on IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitor and 3 test strip lots and the results on the candidate system were compared to comparator method (hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer). The results demonstrated that the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System performs as intended with samples containing hematocrit concentrations spanning the claimed hematocrit range of $10 - 6 5 \%$ .

2) Altitude Study: To evaluate the effects of altitude on the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System results, contrived venous whole blood samples were altered to five glucose concentrations (60, 110, 160, 350 and $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and tested at 10,000 ft feet above sea level. Each venous whole blood glucose concentration was tested in duplicate using two strip lots and five glucose meters per strip lot. The meter results (20 glucose measurements for each glucose concentration) were compared to those obtained with the comparator method (hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer, tested at 719 ft). The results support the claims that the system functions as intended at altitudes up to the claimed

altitude of 10,000 feet.

3) System Operating Conditions Testing: To evaluate device performance over varying operating temperature and humidity conditions, contrived venous whole blood samples at glucose concentrations (60-80, 105-135, and $2 2 5 { - } 2 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ were tested at temperatures ranging from $4 { - } 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 3 9 . 2 \mathrm { - } 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ )and relative humidity from $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ . Conditions tested included $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ( 3 9 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } ) / 3 0 \%$ (relative humidity, r.h.), $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ( 3 9 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } ) / 9 0 \%$ r.h., $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ( 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } ) / 1 0 \%$ r.h., $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ( 8 2 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } ) / 9 0 \%$ r.h., $4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ( 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } ) / 1 0 \%$ r.h., and $4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ( 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } ) / 3 6 \%$ r.h, and meter results compared to the comparator method. The results support the claimed range of operating conditions: $6 { - } 4 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $4 2 . 8 \mathrm { - } 1 1 1 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity.

4) Flex Studies: Short sample detection, error codes for samples outside the measuring range, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, intermittent sampling was completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust to short sample detection, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, intermittent sampling, and that an error message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.

5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single patient use. A cleaning study was performed by cleaning the meter with mild dishwashing liquid detergent and water. Three test meters were subjected to 260 cleaning cycles, representing one cleaning per week for five years. Three meters were used for control/reference purposes that were not subjected to cleaning. The study demonstrated that cleaning the meter did not impact device durability or function. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials compromising the meter with the chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth (EPA registration #9480-4). Robustness studies were also performed by the demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles (representing weekly disinfection for five years, the expected lifetime of the meter).
