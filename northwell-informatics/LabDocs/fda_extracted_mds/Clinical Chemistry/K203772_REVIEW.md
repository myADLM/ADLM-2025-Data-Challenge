II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New device   
B Type of Test: Continuous Glucose Monitor Informed Insulin Dose Calculator

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is software intended for the management of diabetes in persons aged 6 and older requiring rapid-acting U-100 insulin. The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator calculates a suggested bolus dose based on user-entered carbohydrates, most recent sensor glucose reading (or blood glucose reading if using fingerstick), rate of change of the sensor glucose (if applicable), insulin on board (IOB), and programmable correction factor, insulin to carbohydrate ratio, and target glucose value. The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is intended for single patient, home use and requires a prescription.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

This device resides in the Omnipod 5 App and requires the App to function

The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus works with the following rapid-acting U-100 insulins. : NovoLog® (insulin aspart), Humalog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro), and Admelog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro).

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is a software device that resides in the Omnipod 5 App. It requires input parameters and settings from the SmartAdjust Technology, an interoperable automated glycemic (iAGC) and glucose values from a compatible integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) or blood glucose (BG) values from a blood glucose meter to calculate suggested insulin bolus doses. The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator can be used in both open-loop (manual mode) and closed-loop (automated mode). When used with a compatible iCGM, the Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator can use the sensor glucose values and trend information to calculate a suggested bolus dose. When the Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is used with manually entered BG readings it suggests a bolus dose based on the same calculations as the currently cleared Omnipod DASH Insulin Management System bolus calculator (K180045, K192659).

Summary of Clinical Testing:

A single-arm, multicenter, prospective clinical study was conducted to evaluate the Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator in patients with type 1 diabetes during Manual Mode operation. The study enrolled 25 evaluable subjects aged 6-70 years across 3 clinical sites, and consisted of two 7-day outpatient phases of Omnipod 5 use:

• Phase 1: 7 days of Omnipod 5 use in Manual Mode without a connected CGM using manual entry of BG values to deliver boluses, followed by; Phase 2: 7 days of Omnipod 5 use in Manual Mode with a connected CGM using the CGMinformed bolus calculator to deliver boluses.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of the CGM-informed bolus calculator using glucose metrics of percentage of time $< 7 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and percentage of time $> 1 8 0$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ during the 4-hour post bolus period from Phase 1 as compared to Phase 2. Data from the clinical study is presented in the tables below. In the 25 subjects enrolled in the combined age cohort of 6.0-70.0 years, there were zero (0) deaths and zero (0) unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) reported. One (1) serious adverse event (SAE) was reported that occurred in the aged 18.0-70.0 years cohort and was indicated as not related to the study procedures or study device. There were no non-serious adverse events reported.

In Silico Testing: Simulations of possible input and output combinations were run to supplement information collected in the clinical study. These simulations evaluated additional types and/or ranges of variables in order to assess that potential edge cases (including physiologically improbable edge cases) will produce either a safe output (e.g., bolus recommendation), or an error alerting the user to an unsafe condition.

Human Factors:   
The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is a component of the Omnipod 5 System. Human Factors validation study was conducted on the Omnipod 5 System as a whole and described in the Decision Summary for K203774.
