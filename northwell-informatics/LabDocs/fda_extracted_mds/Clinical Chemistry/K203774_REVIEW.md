# II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New device   
B Type of Test: Not applicable

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

SmartAdjust technology is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps to automatically increase,

decrease, and pause delivery of insulin based on current and predicted glucose values.

SmartAdjust technology is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons 6 years of age and older. SmartAdjust technology is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

SmartAdjust technology should not be used in anyone under the age of 6 years old. SmartAdjust technology should also NOT be used in people who require less than 6 units of insulin per day as the safety of the technology has not been evaluated in this population.

Do not use SmartAdjust technology in pregnant women, critically ill patients, and those on dialysis. The safety of the SmartAdjust technology has not been evaluated in these populations.

Do not use SmartAdjust technology if you are taking hydroxyurea as it could lead to falsely elevated CGM values and result in over-delivery of insulin that can lead to severe hypoglycemia.

Do not use SmartAdjust technology if you do NOT have adequate hearing and/or vision to allow recognition of all functions of the Omnipod 5 System, including alerts, alarms, and reminders.

SmartAdjust technology used with the Omnipod 5 System is designed to use rapid-acting U-100 insulins. The following U-100 rapid-acting insulin analogs have been tested and found to be safe for use in the Pod: NovoLog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin aspart), Humalog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro), and Admelog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro) for use up to 72 hours (3 days). Before using a different insulin with the Omnipod 5 System, check the insulin drug label and consult your healthcare provider. Refer to the insulin labeling and follow your healthcare provider’s directions for how often to replace the Pod.

SmartAdjust technology used with the Omnipod 5 System relies on accurate, current CGM values to determine your insulin needs. Always make sure you are using the CGM per manufacturer's instructions and do not extend the sensor wear beyond the recommended duration.

Do NOT attempt to use the SmartAdjust technology with the Omnipod 5 System before you receive training. Inadequate training could put your health and safety at risk.

Device components used with the SmartAdjust technology including the pod, CGM transmitter, and CGM sensor must be removed before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or diathermy treatment. In addition, the SmartAdjust Controller and smartphone should be placed outside of the precedure room. Exposure to MRI, CT, or diathery treatment can damage the components.

At the time of device authorization, the compatible integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) is the Dexcom G6 iCGM.

# A Device Description:

SmartAdjust technology (the Omnipod 5 interoperable automated glycemic controller, or iAGC) is a software-only medical device intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The Omnipod 5 iAGC uses data from a connected iCGM along with user-defined parameters to predict future glucose trends and automatically increase, decrease, or pause the delivery of insulin via a compatible alternate controller enabled (ACE) pump.

The SmartAdjust technology software is part of the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System, which also includes the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (K203768), Omnipod 5 Bolus Calculator (K203772), and an integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM, Dexcom G6). The SmartAdjust technology is intended to be digitally connected to an iCGM and an ACE Pump.

The SmartAdjust technology software resides on the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (the Omnipod 5 Pod and Omnipod 5 App). The iAGC software is responsible for controlling insulin delivery via compatible ACE Pump when the system is in Automated Mode. iCGM data is transmitted from the iCGM to the ACE Pump via Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The SmartAdjust technology uses this transmitted iCGM data in its calculations. The SmartAdjust technology can be turned off, and the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump will operate in Manual Mode, which delivers insulin based on healthcare provider (HCP) or user-defined basal programs.

The SmartAdjust technology has three states of operation: Automated Mode, Automated: Limited, and Activity. In Automated Mode, the system calculates insulin delivery every 5 minutes based on the user-customizable glucose target $( 1 1 0 { - } 1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Automated: Limited is enabled when the SmartAdjust technology is not receiving data from a connected iCGM for 20 minutes or more and during sensor warm-up. While in Automated: Limited, the user will receive no more than pre-programmed basal insulin. When a valid glucose value is received from the iCGM, the SmartAdjust technology will resume delivery of insulin in full Automated Mode. Activity is a temporary mode which the user may select for various time durations during automated mode up to 24 hours. With Activity, the algorithm reduces insulin delivery, by setting a temporary glucose target to $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Activity is intended for use during periods when insulin sensitivity is expected to be higher, such as during exercise.

# Pivotal Study

The Pivotal study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the SmartAdjust technology in patients with type 1 diabetes. The study was a single-arm, multi-center, prospective clinical study that enrolled 240 subjects 6-70 years of age, across 17 clinical sites to obtain at least 100 evaluable subjects in the 6.0-13.9 years of age cohort and at least 100 evaluable subjects in the 14.0-70.0 years of age cohort.

The Pivotal study was conducted in three outpatient phases. Phase 1 consisted of a 14 day standard therapy phase followed by Phase 2 which consisted of a 13 week hybrid closed-loop phase. Phase 3 is the extension phase and is currently ongoing.

# a. Human Factors Testing

Human factors validation tests were conducted with the Omnipod 5 App installed on a compatible mobile device with interoperable technology. A total of 7 formative studies were conducted; after each study, information was fed back into the design of the User Interface. The final device design was evaluated in the summative study performed with 64 representative participants interacting with the device in a simulated use environment. All study participants received training that was consistent with the training that patients would receive with the commercial product. Usability evaluations assessed comprehension and usability of the device for critical device tasks. Results of the study demonstrated that the device could be used safely by intended users in the intended use environment when used in combination with a digitally connected device.

# b. Insulin Compatibility:

The SmartAdjust technology used with the Omnipod 5 System is designed to use rapidacting U-100 insulins including: NovoLog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin aspart), Humalog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro), and Admelog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro). These insulins were used in the pivotal clinical study for this device and no other insulins have been tested for use with the device.

# c. Data Logging:

Software verification testing has demonstrated the device records timestamped critical events, including information related to its state, user inputs, and device settings, as required by the special controls.

d. Interoperability:

A plan and approach for interoperability were provided according to the FDA Guidance “Design Considerations and Pre-market Submission Recommendations for Interoperable Medical Devices - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff” and determined to be adequate to support and clearly specify expectations, requirements, and interface specifications to potential interoperable devices. In addition, the plans provided by the sponsor covered their approach to working with connected device companies regarding contractual issues, interfaces for data communication and exchange, and post-market reporting procedures and responsibilities (e.g., who is responsible for investigating and reporting complaints, malfunctions, and adverse events).

The sponsor additionally provided validated software protocols intended to ensure secure, accurate, and reliable communication with digital interfacing devices, as well as failsafe design features to mitigate the risks associated with interruption of communication with digitally connected devices. These protocols were reviewed and found to be adequate.

# e. Cybersecurity:

Detailed information on cybersecurity of the device was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor also provided a software bill of materials, which provided details on all software used in the device and the hardware platform that the device was installed on. This included all manufacturer-developed, commercially licensed, open source, and off-theshelf software components (including firmware as relevant), along with an identification of the hardware runtime environment in which each resides, with relevant version and/or model information, as well as details on whether each component was actively supported by its manufacturer or legacy licensed.

# f. Postmarket Surveillance Study

There is uncertainty remaining regarding the risk/benefit profile of the device when used in the broader intended use population. While the premarket clinical study provided to support the 510(k) showed some benefits, it was not adequately powered to assess differences in the rates of safety events (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia).

Accordingly, a postmarket surveillance study will be ordered by FDA to confirm understanding of safety.

# VIII Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

# IX Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
