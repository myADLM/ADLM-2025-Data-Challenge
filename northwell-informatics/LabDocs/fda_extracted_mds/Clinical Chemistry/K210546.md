# Device Description

Elecsys proBNP II (updated assay) is a second-generation assay by Roche Diagnostics for the in vitro quantitative determination of N-terminal pro-Brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in human serum and plasma with increased biotin tolerance. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

The cobas e family of analyzers employs the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” technology. The assays are an 18-minute (Elecsys proBNP II) and 9 minute (Elecsys proBNP II STAT) application following a sandwich principle using two monoclonal antibodies which are specifically directed against NT-proBNP.

# Changes to Reagent Composition

For the neutralization of free biotin in serum and plasma, Roche developed an antibody, which binds to free biotin. The antibodies are specific for free biotin and do not bind to or interact with the biotin-linker conjugates.

# Analytical Performance

# Precision/Reproducibility

# Repeatability and Intermediate Precision

Precision measurements were conducted to evaluate repeatability (within-run precision) and the intermediate precision (within-laboratory precision) according to the CLSI guideline EP5-A3.

# Methods:

The precision of the Elecsys proBNP II assay was evaluated on the cobas e 411 and proBNP II STAT assay was evaluated on one cobas e 601 analyzer at one internal site with three reagent lots over 21 days.

The protocol consisted of testing the eight serum samples and two controls in single determinations in four separate aliquots (divided into two runs per day) for 21 operating days $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 8 4 )$ . Repeatability and Intermediate Precision were calculated according to EP05-A3.

# Inter-Instrument Variability (CLSI EP5-A3)

# Methods (Inter-Instrument):

This was done using the Elecsys proBNP II (updated assay) on three cobas e 411 analyzers and using the Elecsys proBNP II STAT (updated assay) on three cobas e 601 analyzers according to the precision model described in CLSI EP5-A3 guideline. One reagent lot of the updated assay was measured on 5 days in three laboratory sites.

A precision experiment according to the CLSI EP05-A3 setup (5-day model, 25 determinations total per sample pool, reagent lot, and site) was conducted at all 3 laboratories, for each of the assays. The sample panel was identical for both and consisted of 8 native human serum sample pools, and 2 concentration levels made of quality control material (PreciControl Cardiac II Level 1 and 2). The samples were not spiked.

# Analytical Sensitivity

The analytical studies to establish the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were conducted according to the experimental design described in CLSI EP17-A2

# Limit of Blank (LoB) (CLSI EP17-A2)

LoB of the Elecsys proBNP II (updated assay) on the cobas e 411 analyzer and of Elecsys proBNP II STAT (updated assay) on the cobas e 601 was determined according to CLSI EP17- A2. Limit of Blank determines the highest observed measurement values for samples free of analyte. The Limit of Blank was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples.

# Methods:

In total 60 determinations of an analyte-free sample were obtained on one instrument over $\geq$ three days in 6 runs with 10-fold determination per run. Three lots of reagent were used in the experimental design.

As the analyzer does not report negative sample concentrations, the data set was truncated and the data were evaluated as the linear interpolation of the 57th and 58th ranked observation.

# Conclusion:

All lots met the predetermined acceptance criterion of $\leq 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$

# Limit of Detection (LoD) (CLSI EP17-A2)

LoD of the Elecsys proBNP II (updated assay) on the cobas e 411 analyzer and of Elecsys proBNP II STAT (updated assay) on the cobas e 601 analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoD determines the lower limit for samples with analyte. The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with a $9 5 \%$ probability.

# Methods:

Five low-level human serum samples were measured on one instrument over $\geq$ three days in 6 runs with a two-fold determination per run. In total sixty determinations per sample per reagent lot. The experiment was conducted using three reagent lots.

A pooled estimate of the precision (SD total) for the 5 low level samples was calculated.

LoD was calculated according to EP17-A2, chapter 5.3.3.2 as:

$\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ S D }$ total (of low analyte samples)

# Conclusion:

All lots met the predetermined acceptance criterion of $\leq 1 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The LoD claim in the labeling will be set to $\leq 1 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# Limit of Quantitation (CLSI EP17-A2)

The LoQ of the Elecsys proBNP II (updated assay) on the cobas e 411 analyzer and of the Elecsys proBNP II STAT (updated assay) on the cobas e 601 analyzer was determined according to CLSI Guideline EP17-A2.

The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte which can be reproducibly measured with an intermediate precision of $20 \%$ CV.

# Methods:

A low level sample set 9 native, unaltered serum samples using the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e 411 analyzer and 10 native, unaltered serum samples using the Elecsys proBNP II STAT on the cobas e 601 analyzer of known measurand concentration was tested in 5 replicates (aliquots) on one instrument in singleton per day, over 5 days with 1 run per day. Three lots of reagent were used in the LoQ experiment. A total of $\mathtt { n } { = } 2 5$ measured values were obtained for each sample. The mean value and the intermediate precision as coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (SD) were calculated for each LoQ sample.

LoQ is defined as the mean value of that sample which is the first that fulfills the specification for the intermediate precision and for which no sample with higher concentration exists that exceeds this specification.

Data are summarized in the following tables, below.

# Linearity/Assay Reportable Range (CLSI EP06-Ed2)

The linearity study was conducted to demonstrate that measurements across the claimed measuring range for each parameter are linear. The study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP06-Ed2.

# Methods:

One high analyte human, native serum sample above measuring rage was diluted with analyte free serum. 11 concentrations were prepared throughout the entire measuring range. Samples were assayed in 3-fold determination within a single run. The linearity data were analyzed as described below.

For each sample and its dilution levels a weighted least square regression by pooled variance is performed.

As one high analyte human, native serum sample above measuring range was diluted with analyte free serum (CLSI Design A1), a regression without intercept is chosen.

As variance increases with concentration, weighted linear regression is used.

As only 3 replicates are available at each dilution step, the weights are computed based on the pooled variance including also the replicates of the next higher as well as the next lower dilution step.

The result table is composed for each experiment, i.e. for the proBNP II $( 1 8 \mathrm { m i n } )$ on e411 and the proBNP II STAT on e601. The resulting linearity statistics and deviation results are given in the tables below (rounded data).

# Endogenous Interference Studies

The purpose of these studies was to evaluate endogenous substances for potential interference with the parameters measured on the cobas e 411 for Elecsys proBNP II (updated assay) and on the cobas e 601 for Elecsys proBNP II STAT (updated assay).

# Method for Bilirubin, Hemoglobin and Lipemia:

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances using the Elecsys proBNP II was determined on the cobas e 411 and the Elecsys proBNP II STAT was determined on the cobas e 601.

Endogenous interferences were determined by testing three different analyte concentration levels (low about $1 3 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , medium about $9 0 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , high about $2 0 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ in human native serum samples. The high concentrations were spiked with recombinant human proBNP for the bilirubin and lipemia testing.

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance ( $\stackrel {  } { = }$ interference pool) and another aliquot was spiked (if applicable) with the same volume of the solvent of the interfering substance $^ { \prime } =$ dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked sample).

Results/Conclusion for both proBNP II and proBNP II STAT:

# Method for Biotin:

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of Biotin using the Elecsys proBNP II was determined on the cobas e 411 and the Elecsys proBNP II STAT was determined on the cobas e 601.

Biotin interferences were determined by testing three different analyte concentration levels (low about $1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , medium about $8 0 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , high about $1 8 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ in human native serum samples.

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with $1 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Biotin ( $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } }$ interference pool) and another aliquot was spiked (if applicable) with the same volume of the solvent of the interfering substance $\left[ = \right.$ dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution

pool in 11 steps. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked sample).

No interference was seen up to $5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ biotin. All predetermined acceptance criteria were met. The claimed Biotin concentration at which no interference is observed is $3 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Method for Rheumatoid Factor:

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of Rheumatoid Factors using the Elecsys proBNP II was determined on the cobas e 411 and the Elecsys proBNP II STAT was determined on the cobas e 601.

Rheumatoid Factors interferences were determined by testing three different analyte concentration levels (low about $1 3 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , medium about $9 0 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , high about $2 0 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ b in human native serum samples. The high sample was spiked with recombinant human NTproBNP.

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with $1 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ Rheumatoid Factors $^ { \prime } =$ interference pool) and another aliquot was spiked (if applicable) with the same volume of the solvent of the interfering substance $^ { \prime } =$ dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked sample).

The claimed Rheumatoid factors concentration is $1 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# Method for Albumin:

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of Albumin using the Elecsys proBNP II was determined on the cobas e 411 and the Elecsys proBNP II STAT was determined on the cobas e 601.

Albumin interferences were determined by testing three different analyte concentration levels (low about $1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , medium about $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , high about $2 3 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ) in human native serum samples. The high sample was spiked with human recombinant proBNP.

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with ${ 7 } \mathrm { g / d L }$ Albumin $\stackrel {  } { = }$ interference pool) and another aliquot was spiked (if applicable) with the same volume of the solvent of the interfering substance $\left[ = \right.$ dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked sample).

The claimed Albumin concentration is ${ 7 } \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# Cross-Reactivity

This study was conducted to evaluate the Elecsys proBNP II and proBNP II STAT assay on the cobas e 411 and 601, respectively, for potential cross-reactivity.

# Methods

To determine the analytical specificity of the Elecsys proBNP II (updated assay) and Elecsys proBNP II STAT (updated assay), two human native serum samples with low (about $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ and high (about $2 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ analyte levels were aliquoted and spiked with potential crossreactants. One aliquot was left unspiked to serve as a reference. Samples were measured on the cobas e 411 analyzer for Elecsys proBNP II and on the cobas e 601 analyzer for Elecsys proBNP II STAT and cross reactivity was calculated according to the formula:

# Exogenous Interference – Drugs

The purpose of this study was to evaluate drugs for potential interference with the parameters measured on the cobas e 411 analyzer for Elecsys proBNP II (updated assay) and on the cobas e 601 analyzer for Elecsys proBNP II STAT (updated assay).

# Methods:

Two human native serum samples with approximately $1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ were analyzed using the cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 analyzer. These samples were divided into an appropriate number of aliquots. One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the respective amount (volume) of the drug ( $\stackrel {  } { = }$ interference sample) and another aliquot was spiked (if applicable) with the same volume of the solvent of the respective drug $^ { \prime } =$ reference sample). The recovery of the interference sample was calculated as percent recovery compared to the reference sample.

In total, 18 common and 33 special pharmaceutic compounds were analyzed and measured.
