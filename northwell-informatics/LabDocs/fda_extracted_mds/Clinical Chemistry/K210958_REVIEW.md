# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only For point-of-care or clinical laboratory setting

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

i-STAT 1 Analyzer

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridges. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.

The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under k103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer) is a handheld analytical device designed to run i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts with the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.

The single-use, disposable i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge contains test reagents to analyze venous and arterial whole blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory. The cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. The cartridges contain the required sensors, a fluid pouch, a sample entry well and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement within the cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which are typically applied to the cartridge using a transfer device, by the trained user before the cartridge is placed within the analyzer.

# B Principle of Operation:

Glucose on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge is measured amperometrically. A voltage is applied to the cartridge electrodes with current generated by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide that was produced by catalytic oxidation of glucose present in the sample by glucose oxidase. The current is directly proportional to the concentration of the glucose.

Creatinine on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge is measured amperometrically. Creatinine in the sample is hydrolyzed to creatine by the enzyme creatinine amidohydrolase. Creatine is then hydrolyzed to sarcosine by the enzyme creatine amidinohydrolase. The oxidation of sarcosine, catalyzed by the enzyme sarcosine oxidase, produces hydrogen peroxide. A voltage is applied to the cartridge electrodes with current generated by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. The current is directly proportional to the concentration of the creatinine.

Sodium, Potassium, Chloride and ionized Calcium on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge are measured by ion-selective electrode potentiometry; measurement of potential difference between the ion selective electrode and the reference electrode. In the calculation of concentration is related to potential through the Nernst equation.

BUN on the i-STAT CHEM $[ 8 +$ cartridge is measured by the hydrolysis of urea in the sample to ammonium ions catalyzed by the urease, and ammonium measured by ion-selective potentiometry.

TCO2 on the i-STAT CHEM $^ { 8 + }$ Cartridge is measured by potentiometric determination of both $\mathsf { p H }$ and pCO2, and calculated with an algorithm based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which uses pH, PCO2, and ionic strength (sodium) measurements.

Hematocrit on the i-STAT CHEM $[ 8 +$ cartridge is measured by the conductivity method.

Conductivity of the sample is inversely proportional to the concentration of red blood cells in the sample. The hematocrit sensor first measures the electrical conductivity of the calibrant solution, followed by the conductivity of the whole blood sample. The conductivity of the sample is also a function of the plasma electrolyte concentration. The i-STAT Hematocrit test algorithm uses the sodium concentration in the calculation of the test result.

Specimen stability

In support of the modification to add use of arterial and venous whole blood without anticoagulant and testing within three minutes of collection, a specimen stability study was conducted. In the study, venous whole blood was collected without anti-coagulant from five healthy donors. Each of the whole blood samples after collection was tested immediately (control condition) and tested at four minutes (test condition). For each of the two conditions, the samples were tested in replicates of 10 using one lot of cartridges and 20 analyzers. For each analyte the specimen was considered stable if the difference between the mean results (or median) of the test and the control condition was within the sponsor’s definition of allowable error. Based on an analysis of the results of the specimen stability study, the sponsor concluded that for i-STAT glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, iCa, BUN, creatinine, hematocrit, and TCO2 tests on the i-STAT CHEM $^ { 8 + }$ cartridge when tested on the i-STAT 1 System demonstrated that whole blood samples collected without anticoagulant are stable out to four minutes, which supports the labeling claim of three minutes.

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

A matrix equivalency assessment was conducted to support use of venous or arterial specimens collected without anticoagulant. The study was conducted at one internal site and three point of care sites (POC) sites. At the POC sites, two donor matched venous specimens with and without lithium heparin were collected, and likewise arterial specimens were collected. For the internal site, whole blood specimens from donors were collected in blood collection tubes without anticoagulant. A portion of each native or contrived nonanticoagulated sample was transferred to a lithium heparin blood collection tube to be used as the anticoagulated control condition.

Specimens without anti-coagulant were tested with the i-STAT 1 System in duplicate with the first results used in the analysis. Specimens collected with anti-coagulant (comparator specimen) were tested in duplicate with the mean used in the analysis. The internal study tested all analytes on the cartridge, except for TCO2 using native and contrived samples $( < 1 0 \% )$ . The three POC sites tested all analytes on the cartridge using only native samples. One lot of i-STAT CHEM $[ 8 +$ cartridges was used. Multiple different i-STAT 1 Systems were used at each site. The results were analyzed by combined data across all sites and analyzed by a Passing-Bablok linear regression. No outliers were removed from the analysis. Based on the results, as summarized below, the sponsor concluded that the samples (venous and arterial) collected without anticoagulant are equivalent to those collected with heparin anticoagulant for all analytes.
