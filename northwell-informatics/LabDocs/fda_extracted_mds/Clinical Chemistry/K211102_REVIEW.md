A Purpose for Submission: Modification of the cleared device to add compatibility with the 10-day MediRx sensor.   
B Measurand: Glucose in interstitial fluid   
C Type of Test: Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System is a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device with real time alarms capability indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 4 and older. It is intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions, unless otherwise indicated.

The System also detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments. Interpretation of the System readings should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time.

The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices. The System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices where the user manually controls actions for therapy decisions.

The System can be used with the FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor (14 day) or the FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor (10 day).

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin suspend systems.

Taking ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Inaccurate sensor readings due to ascorbic acid interference may be clinical significant and result in harm if relied on to make treatement decisions. Taking more that $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event.

The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could cause incorrect readings.

Do not use this system if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.

Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care professional.

Do not use the System in people less than 4 years of age.

Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the "check blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours or wearing a Sensor. In addition, use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions, if your Sensor glucose reading does not match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a number.

Wash application site on the back of your upper arm using a plain soap, dry, and then clea with an alcohol wipe. This will hep remove any oily residue that may prevent the sensor from sticking properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Carefully preparing the site according to these instructions will help the Sensor stay on your body for the full 14-day wear period and help prevent it from falling off early.

Store the Sensor Kit between $3 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ and $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ . If you suspect that the temperature may exceeed $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (e.g., an un-airconditioned home in the summer), you should refridgerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.

You must scan the Sensor to get your real-time current glucose level as the Reader will not provide this information without a scan.

The Readers's built-in meter is not for use on people who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock, or for individuals in hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis.

The Reader's built-in meter is not for use on neonates, in critically-ill patients, or for diagnosis or screening of diabetes.

Take standard precautions for transmission of blood borne pathogens to avoid contamination.

Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed by the manufacturer as compatible with the System may cause inaccuracte glucose readings.

If a Sensor breaks inside a user's body, they should call their health care professional.

D Special Instrument Requirements: Not applicable.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide glucose levels, trends, and real-time alarms capability to aid in the management of diabetes. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System consists of two primary components: a Sensor that transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a BLE enabled display device (Reader). User initiated radiofrequency identification (RFID) scanning of the Sensor via Reader provides the user with real-time glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose graph). Users may use the Sensor glucose results and information provided by the System in making treatment decisions. The System also provides configurable alarms designed to warn the user of Low Glucose, High

Glucose or Signal Loss. The system is intended for single-patient use at home and requires a prescription.

FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor

The Sensor is single use and disposable. The Sensor is provided as two secondary components, Sensor Applicator and Sensor Pack (sterile device), which are used to assemble and apply the Sensor to the back of the user’s arm. During Sensor application, the sensor tail is inserted below the surface of the skin through the guidance of a needle. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The Sensor continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid every minute and has an 8-hour memory capacity. The Sensor is factory calibrated and does not require fingerstick calibration.

FreeStyle Libre 2 Reader

The Reader is a small handheld device that is powered by a lithium-ion rechargeable battery and uses RFID communication to start new Sensors and to scan Sensors to display and record data and uses blue tooth low energy BLE communication to issue alarms that notify the user to scan his/her sensor when glucose values pass a high or low glucose threshold. The Reader also has a built-in strip port with blood glucose functionality (that is intended to work with the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose test strips, cleared under K171941), and a user interface that includes event logging features.

The FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor with a 10-day wear duration is an alternate configuration to the existing FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor, which has a 14-day wear duration. The FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor design is unchanged from that of the predicate Sensor (the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System). The algorithm and Reader design in the FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor are also the same as those of the predicate.

As with the predicate, the System is intended to be used when the user utilizes CGM information to manually control actions for therapy decisions. The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, which include full closed loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin suspend (e.g., threshold suspend and predictive low glucose suspend) systems.

# B Principle of Operation:

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System uses an electrochemical sensor to monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor is held in place with an adhesive pad and incorporates both the subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor uses a glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to a metal electrode, producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the subcutaneous space. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) for display to the user on the handheld Reader.

2. Linearity: See Section A(4), Assay Reportable Range below

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

For this device and the predicate, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been shown to significantly interfere with system performance. Analytical Specificity/Interference was previously assessed in K193371.

Based on the results of the clinical evaluation and bench testing for ascorbic acid, the following statements have been placed in the device labeling:

User Manual Warning: Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found in supplements including multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies such as Airborne $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Emergen- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { C } \mathbf { \otimes }$ , may contain high doses of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid and should not be taken while using the Sensor. See your healthcare professional to understand how long ascorbic acid is active in your body.   
Reader Screen Warning: Do not take high doses of vitamin C (more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per day). This may falsely raise your Sensor readings. Supplements like Airborne or Emergen-C have high doses of vitamin C. Read labeling for all supplements to determine vitamin C content.

# 4. Assay Reportable Range:

The Assay Reportable Range was previously assessed in K193371. The reportable range for the System with the FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor remains unchanged as 40 to 400 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): The shelf-life of the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor was previously evaluated in K193371. Both the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor and FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx sensor have a storage shelf life of 9 months. Shelf-life was evaluated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } - 8 2 ^ { \circ }$ Fahrenheit within the humidity range of $10 \%$ - $90 \%$ .

6. Detection Limit:

If a glucose measurement is less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result will be displayed by the system as ‘LO’. If the glucose measurement exceeds $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result will be displayed as ‘HI’.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not applicable.

8. Accuracy (Instrument): Not applicable.

9. Carry-Over: Not applicable.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device: Not applicable. Accuracy is determined by comparing device values to an FDA-cleared laboratory glucose measurement method and was previously assessed in K193371.

2. Matrix Comparison: Not applicable. Interstitial fluid is the only indicated matrix.

# C Clinical Studies:

1. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

2. Clinical Specificity: See Section A(3), Analytical Specificity/Interference, above.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable): Two prospective clinical studies were conducted in the United States to support clearance of the predicate device in K193371.

In both studies, accuracy of the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor was evaluated by comparing iCGM glucose values to an FDA-cleared laboratory grade comparator method (CM, using the YSI 2300). Glucose values were obtained from the iCGM and from the comparator at the same or similar time. The accuracy of iCGM glucose versus the comparator method was assessed by calculating the percentage of iCGM readings that were within $1 5 \%$ , $20 \%$ , and $40 \%$ for reference values $\geq 7 0 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ , and within $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for values $< 7 0$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For glucose values $< 7 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the difference in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ between the CGM and comparator glucose values was calculated. For values $\geq 7 0 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ , the relative difference $( \% )$ to the comparator value was calculated.

The study data was reanalyzed to include data from the first 10 days of sensor wear, to align with the proposed intended use of the System with the FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor. The sponsor did not collect paired glucose data on Day 10 due to the clinic visit schedule for both studies. Therefore, paired CGM-CM data up to Day 9 are presented in the tables below. Assessment of Day 12 data (where paired CGM-CM data are available) indicates that the performance data below is representative of the device performance for 10 days of wear.

# Trend Accuracy

Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose and is characterized by slopes, such as from $> 2 \mathrm { m g / d L / m i n }$ to ${ < } { - } 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L / m i n }$ . Trend accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

# Agreement when iCGM Reads ‘LO’ or ‘HI’

The System reports glucose readings between 40 and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . When the System determines that glucose level is below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘LO’ whenever the sensor is scanned. When the System determines that glucose level is above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned. Because the system does not display glucose values below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator) when the iCGM value is classified as ‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are evaluated separately. The cumulative percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’) and when comparator values were more that certain glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in the tables below.

# Alarm Performance

The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms. The Alarm Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells the user how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high glucose event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).

Low Glucose Alarm Performance

True Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

False Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was not below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm issued within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

Missed Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm didn’t issue within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

# Sensor Accuracy Over Time

Sensor accuracy over time (sensor stability) describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. The FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx sensor can be worn for up to 10 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the absolute relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of device readings within 15 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $1 5 \%$ $( 1 5 / 1 5 \% )$ , $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $20 \%$ $( 2 0 / 2 0 \% )$ and $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $40 \%$ $( 4 0 / 4 0 \% )$ of the comparator values during the beginning, middle, and end of the wear period. These times were defined as follows:

Beginning (Adult Days 1-3, Pediatric: Days 1-2) • Middle (Adult: Days 7-8, Pediatric: Days 7-8), End (Adult: Day 9, Pediatric: Day 9).

The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and agreement rates with the comparator method were evaluated over 10-day life of the sensor.

# Sensor Life

To estimate how long a Sensor will work for the 10-day wear duration, 146 Sensors were evaluated in the Adult study and 139 Sensors were evaluated in the Pediatric study to determine how many days of readings each Sensor provided. Subjects did not wash the insertion site with soap and water before applying the Sensors and wore two Sensors simultaneously. Of the 146 Sensors in the Adult study, $8 2 . 2 \%$ lasted 10 days. In the Pediatric study, $8 9 . 9 \%$ of the Sensors lasted 10 days.

A third clinical study was also conducted to further evaluate wear duration in subjects who first washed the insertion site with a plain soap and water, according to the full instructions in the labeling and wore only a single Sensor. A total of 39 Sensors were evaluated in this study, all the Sensors $( 1 0 0 \% )$ lasted 10 days.

# Glucose Reading Availability

The System is designed to show a Sensor glucose reading after each scan that is performed throughout the wear period after the start-up time. As such, the capture rate characterizes the reliability of the communication between components of the system.
