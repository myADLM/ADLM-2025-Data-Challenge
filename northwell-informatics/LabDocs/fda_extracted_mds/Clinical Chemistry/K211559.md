# Device Description and Indications for Use:

The EasyStat 300 is a system for use by health care professionals to rapidly analyze whole blood samples. Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs) are strongly advised when using the EasyStat 300. The analyzer incorporates a Reagent Module containing the “calibrating” solutions A2, B2, and a “conditioning” solution C2, which is also use a calibrant for the Oxygen sensor. Calibrations are performed automatically or on-demand by the user to establish the “slope” of each sensor used in the calculation of the patient sample.

The EasyStat 300 uses $1 7 5 \mu \iota$ of whole blood in the “Syringe” mode and $1 0 0 \mu \iota$ of whole blood in the “Capillary” mode to analyze patient samples. Medica provides a capillary tube kit (REF 8303) used for the capillary data collection in this submission. The EasyStat 300 reports results for blood Gases $( P \mathsf { C O } 2 , P \mathsf { O } 2 )$ , and pH. Additionally, it provides a number of calculated parameters based on the reported results and a number of input parameters as described in the Operator’s Manual.

The EasyStat 300 is a microprocessor-controlled device with a touch sensitive screen that guides the operator through the different menu options and proper operation. It also incorporates a thermal printer to record all reported results and patient information as described in the Operator’s Manual. The device software has incorporated routines to assist the end-user with maintenance, cleaning, and troubleshooting activities also outlined in the manual. The incorporated USB port may be used to download data and also to update the software version based on detailed instructions by Medica Corporation.

The blood gas and pH sensors require calibration and cleaning after a predefined number of samples are analyzed as described in the Operator’s Manual. The pH and PCO2 sensors are based on potentiometric sensor design, generating a small voltage that is dependent on the concentrations of these analytes in the patient sample. The PO2 sensor is based on amperometric sensor design that generates a small current that is dependent on the concentration of oxygen in the patient sample. The theory and mathematical formulas on which the sensor functionality is based are described in detail in the Operator’s Manual.

Medica’s EasyQC materials (REF 8315/8316/8317 and 8309) are specifically formulated for the EasyStat 300. Medica requires the use of quality controls everyday patient samples are analyzed and after any troubleshooting is performed, as instructed in the Operator’s Manual, to validate the performance of the analyzer. The analyzer stores QC results and provides a statistical analysis of its performance using Levey-Jennings plots for the last 30 consecutive days. The EasyQC materials for the EasyStat 300 have a minimum of three years shelf-life when stored refrigerated $( 2 ^ { 0 } { - } 8 ^ { 0 } \mathsf { C } )$ .

The Reagent Module (REF 8101) has a twelve-month shelf-life when stored at $4 ^ { 0 } – 2 5 ^ { 0 } C .$ . Use-life depends on the number of samples analyzed and the overall performance of the sensors. The analyzer monitors the consumption of calibrant solution A2 and warns the operator when the reagent module is about to expire. A typical Use-life for an average user is expected to be 15 days and/or 350 samples whichever comes first. This feature is the same as the one provided with the predicate EasyStat analyzer.

The sensors have one-year shelf-life when stored at $4 ^ { 0 } – 2 5 ^ { 0 } C$ for blood gases (PCO2, PO2), pH. Use-Life of the sensors is determined from their calibration profiles and from the reported results during the EasyQC analysis. Sensors are replaced by the operator as described in the Operator’s Manual. An automatic calibration is performed after installation to qualify the new sensor(s) and the operator is instructed to use the EasyQC multi-level QC materials to validate the EasyStat 300 performance.

The EasyStat 300 may be equipped with a Medica provided barcode scanner (REF 8420) via a USB port to automatically enter patient sample and EasyQC material info. Details are provided in the operator’s Manual.

To maintain the performance of the analyzer Medica provides a cleaning solution (REF 8305) and a troubleshooting kit (REF 8250). Their proper uses are described also in the operator’s Manual.

Intended use and Indications for use of the analytes measured by the EasyStat 300 are:

The EasyStat 300 provides quantitative measurements of pH (hydrogen ion activity), $p { \mathsf { C O } } 2$ (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and $p 0 2$ (partial pressure of oxygen) in Li-heparinized whole blood (arterial/venous) samples from Syringes or Capillary Tubes. This Analyzer should only be used by trained technicians in clinical laboratories to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with blood gas and/or acid-base disturbances.

$p { \mathsf { C O } } 2$ , PO2 (blood gases) and pH measurements in blood are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lifethreatening acid-base disturbances.

The EasyStat 300 has the same technical characteristics with the predicate device. Sensor technology, Reagent module calibrating solutions, principles of operation, and parameters measured are practically the same. User device display may differ due to the new touch sensitive screen, user menu preferences, and more friendly user interface. None of these differences affect the performance when compared to the predicate EasyStat analyzer. The following sections provide a brief discussion of the performance characteristics of the EasyStat 300 based on the studies submitted to determine substantial equivalency.

All tests on the following sections are non-clinical bench tests except for Method Comparison, which was performed on a clinical laboratory using actual venous and arterial blood. The non-clinical tests also used contrived venous blood of aqueous QC materials that are part of the EasyStat 300 system.

# Conclusion of Precision Studies

Medica’s Total precision and Within-Run precision studies, demonstrate that the EasyStat 300 Blood-Gas/Electrolyte/metabolite analyzer is precise and true to Medica’s performance specifications and comparable to the predicate device in this submission.

# Linearity Study

This study followed the CLSI EP06-A protocol officially recognized by the FDA. The linearity performance on the EasyStat 300 was evaluated using nine (9) to eleven (11) spiked and diluted whole blood specimens to cover the reportable range for each analyte. The pre-assayed whole blood samples were finally tested in triplicate on three EasyStat 300 analyzers to establish the linearity performance for each analyte. The table below shows a summary of the obtained results that met all device specifications.

# Conclusion of Linearity Study

Data from the linearity study on three EasyStat 300 analyzers performed according to CLSI EP6- A demonstrate that all analytes $\{ \mathsf { p H } , p \mathsf { C O 2 } , p \mathsf { O 2 } \}$ reported by the EasyStat 300 are linear within the advertised reportable range.

# Method Comparison Study

This study followed the CLSI EP9-A2 protocol. For this study we used whole blood from more than 200 donors plus six modified whole blood samples (spiked and diluted). All blood samples were tested on the predicate devices twice and on three EasyStat 300 analyzers. Some samples were modified to achieve analyte levels covering the reportable range using tonometry.

In addition, the “Capillary” mode on The EasyStat 300 was evaluated against the “Capillary” mode on the predicate EasyStat analyzer using the same whole blood samples collected with the same capillary tubes.

# Conclusion of the Method Comparison Study

Data from the Method Comparison study on three EasyStat 300 analyzers demonstrate that all analytes (pH, $p { \mathsf { C O } } 2$ , $p 0 2$ ) reported by the EasyStat 300 are favorably correlated to the predicate/reference device selected for this study. For all analytes $\{ \mathsf { p H } , p \mathsf { C O 2 } , p \mathsf { O 2 } \}$ , the linear regression slope, the coefficient of variation, and the calculated predicted bias at the decision levels for each analyte were within specifications.

Typical correlation results for all analytes (pO2, $p { \mathsf { C O } } 2$ , pH) are shown below:

# Sensitivity

The sensitivity study is used to validate the low end of the Reportable Range for a particular assay on the EasyStat 300. The study first establishes the Limit of Blank (LoB) that is the starting point for determining the Limit of Detection (LoD) and subsequently the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ).

The sensitivity study in this submission followed the guidelines from CLSI EP17-A. It was performed on three ES 300 analyzers covering the pH and blood gas sensors.

The following table lists the measured LoB, LoD, and LoQ for all analytes reported by the EasyStat 300 analyzer.

# Conclusion of the Sensitivity Study

The lower reportable limit for each assay on the EasyStat 300 was based on the LoQ result calculated or experimentally determined in this sensitivity study. Our studies indicate that the following values may be used as the lowest limit of the reportable range of each assay available on the EasyStat 300.

$p 0 2$ : 5 mmHg $p { \mathsf { C O } } 2$ : 5.0 mmHg pH 6.800 units

# Selectivity

The selectivity (interference) study has followed in principle the guidelines from CLSI EP07-A. The level chosen is the typical normal value for a particular analyte in whole blood. All collected data are from spiked whole blood samples collected from healthy donors.

Conclusion:

The technological and functional characteristics of the new EasyStat 300 analyzer described in the 510(k) summary are substantially equivalent to that of the predicate device EasyStat for pH, $p { \mathsf { C O } } 2$ , and $p 0 2$ .

The analytical study results demonstrate the EasyStat 300 is safe and effective for its intended purpose and equivalent in performance to the predicate device.
