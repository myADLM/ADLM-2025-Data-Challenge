D Special Instrument Requirements: EasyStat 300 Analyzer

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The candidate device is comprised of the EasyStat 300 Analyzer, the EasyStat reagent pack, reference electrode, pO2 sensor, ion selective electrode cartridges (for pH and pCO2), barcode scanner, and calibrators. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.

The EasyStat 300 consists of a reagent module containing calibrating solutions A2, B2, and C2. The analyzer runs in two modes: the syringe mode $( 1 7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of lithium heparinized venous whole blood and arterial blood) and the capillary mode ( $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of lithium heparinized venous whole blood and arterial blood) to analyze patient samples. To operate the analyzer in the capillary mode, a separate capillary tube kit is required. Medica’s EasyQC materials are required to be run every day to validate the performance of the analyzer.

# B Principle of Operation:

pH: pH is measured using a potentiometric method based on the use of an ion-selective electrode. One side of the membrane is in contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of unknown pH. A change in potential develops which is proportional to the $\mathsf { p H }$ difference of these solutions. This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant potential. The magnitude of the potential difference is a measure of the $\mathsf { p H }$ of the unknown sample.

pCO2: pCO2 is measured using a potentiometric method based modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the sample makes contact with a polymeric membrane mounted on a combination measuring/ reference electrode. $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ diffuses across the membrane into a thin layer of electrolyte solution in response to partial pressure difference. This solution then becomes equilibrated with the external gas pressure. $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the solution becomes hydrated, which results in a change in hydrogen ion activity, according to the equation:

$$
\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } + \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } < = > \mathrm { H } ^ { + } + [ \mathrm { H C O } _ { 3 } - ]
$$

The change in hydrogen ion activity in the electrolyte solution produces a potential which is measured against the internal filling solution. This change in potential is measured against the constant potential of the reference electrode half cell and is logarithmically related to the pCO2 of the unknown sample.

pO2: pO2 is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the cathode, consuming four electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons is then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen in the sample.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: EasyStat 300

2. Specimen Identification: The specimen identification may be manually entered or automatically scanned by the device.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The EasyStat 300 accepts lithium heparinized venous whole blood and arterial blood from syringes or capillary tubes.

The sample type is selected using the device touchscreen. Samples may be introduced via a collection glass/plastic syringe or a capillary tube. After the sample type (i.e. whole blood arterial/venous samples) is selected and loaded, the probe is placed in the sample, which will aspirate the appropriate sample volume (i.e. syringe mode - $1 7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , capillary mode - 100 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ ). Once the sample is loaded, the analyzer moves the sample to the sensor module for analysis.

# 4. Calibration:

The EasyStat 300 undergoes pump calibration, air calibration, and 2-point calibration. Once the first calibration is completed, the analyzer will continue to perform calibrations automatically on a fixed schedule. The time between calibrations is determined based on the age (in hours) since the sensors/cartridges were first installed.

# 5. Quality Control:

The EasyStat 300 requires the use of three levels of Medica’s EasyQC materials for use on the analyzer. Results that exceed the entered ranges are flagged for identification. Quality control recommendations are provided in the labeling. It is recommended that each laboratory follow their local, state, and federal regulations as it applies to quality control materials.

# 6. Reagents:

The EasyStat 300 utilizes a reagent module which contains all the reagents, concentration of calibration reagents, current reagent module serial number and installation date, and reagent volume $\%$ remaining with the number of days remaining before calibrators expire.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Two precision studies (i.e. Within-Run and Run-to-Run) were performed following the recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3.

Within Run Precision Evaluation:

Within run precision testing was performed using lithium heparinized venous whole blood in both the “Syringe” and the “Capillary” modes. Testing was performed on three EasyStat 300 analyzers over five days. Venous whole blood samples were collected in the following manner: the first set of samples was analyzed immediately after collection, and the other two were tonometered with a gas mixture to change the levels of pH, pCO2, and pO2. Five venous whole blood samples were tested in five replicates at each concentration level in the syringe mode, and then subsequently in the capillary mode. The results from one representative analyzer for both modes are summarized below.

# Multi-Day Precision Testing:

Two 20-Day precision studies were performed using three levels of aqueous quality control solutions and three different concentrations of $\mathsf { p H }$ , pCO2, and $\mathsf { p O } 2$ on three EasyStat 300 analyzers. Analyzers were calibrated twice daily, prior to testing of the QC materials. After each calibration, two samples of each QC level (i.e. level 1, 2, 3) were tested in syringe and capillary modes. The results from one representative analyzer for both modes are summarized below.

# 2. Linearity:

To support the measuring range, $\mathsf { p H }$ and $\mathsf { p O } 2$ were tested for linearity at 11 levels, and pCO2 was tested at nine levels. The samples were venous whole blood from healthy subjects that were adjusted to different levels by addition of HCL or NaOH for $\mathsf { p H }$ samples, and tonometrization for pO2 and pCO2 samples. Samples at the different levels were tested in triplicate on the EasyStat 300 analyzers. For pH, pO2 and pCO2, regression analysis demonstrated first order linearity.

The linear regression results are given in the table below:

Based on these results, the linearity data support the claimed measuring interval for $\mathsf { p H }$ , pCO2, and $\mathsf { p O } 2$ .

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

An interference testing study for endogenous and exogenous substances was performed on lithium heparin venous whole blood samples in accordance with CLSI EP37-Edition 1. With these samples, an interference screening test was conducted at 2 levels of $\mathsf { p H }$ ( $7 . 1 9 \mathrm { p H }$ units and $7 . 4 8 \mathrm { p H }$ units), $\mathsf { p C O 2 }$ $3 7 \mathrm { m m H } \mathrm { g }$ and $9 0 \mathrm { m m H g }$ ), and $\mathsf { p O } 2$ ( $2 3 \mathrm { m m H g }$ and $1 4 3 \mathrm { m m H g } )$ , tested in triplicate, on three EasyStat 300 analyzers. Interference was calculated as the bias between the average test result with interfering substance and average control measurement on one EasyStat 300 analyzer.

The following substances did not cause interference at the concentrations listed below:

# 4. Assay Reportable Range:

See section VII A.2 Linearity.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability:

Blood gases analytes (i.e. pCO2 and pO2) and pH run on the Easystat300 analyzer are traceable to NIST standards and SRM2181/2182/2183/2184 reference materials, respectively.

Stability:

Shelf life stability studies demonstrated that the ISE cartridge as it pertains to measuring pH has an on-board stability of 30 days when stored in the claimed range of $4 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The sensors for pCO2 and pO2 have an on-board stability of 90 days. The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.

# 6. Detection Limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.

For pCO2 and pO2, the LoB and LoD of the EasyStat300 analyzer were evaluated using tonometered lithium heparin venous whole blood samples. LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which measured total error was less than the pre-defined total allowable error $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \Omega }$ .

For $\mathsf { p H }$ , a saline aqueous solution buffered at low pH were used to estimate LoB, LoD, and LoQ. Linearity studies were used to support the lower end of the measuring range for $\mathsf { p H }$ (see section VII.A.2. above).

The results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>pCO2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.8 mmHg</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.6 mmHg</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.6 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>pO2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3 mmHg</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4 mmHg</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.6 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>pH</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.14 pH units</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.50 pH units</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.50 pH units</td></tr></table>

These results support the claimed measuring ranges for $\mathsf { p H }$ , pCO2, and pO2.
