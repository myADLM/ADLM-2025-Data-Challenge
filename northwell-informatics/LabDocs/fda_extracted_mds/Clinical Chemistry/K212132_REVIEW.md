# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

Modifications to the cleared FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System to display realtime glucose data via Bluetooth without scanning the Sensor.

# B Measurand:

Glucose in Interstitial Fluid

# C Type of Test:

Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is a real time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device with alarms capability indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 4 and older. It is intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions, unless otherwise indicated.

The System also detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments. Interpretation of the System readings should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time.

The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices. The System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices where the user manually controls actions for therapy decisions.

# C Contraindication(s)

Due to an administrative error, the reference to wear period was erroneously included in the Contraindications section of the previous 510(k) Decision Summary. It is now removed from this section and added to the Special Conditions for Use Statements section below.

The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed loop and insulin suspend systems.

The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could cause incorrect readings.

# D Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The sensor can be worn up to 14 days. Remember to always have your next Sensor available before your current one ends so you can keep getting your glucose readings.

Do not use the System in people less than 4 years of age. The System is not cleared for use in people under 4 years of age.

Do not use the System if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.

The FreeStyle Libre 3 app installed on a phone is intended for use by a single person. It must not be used by more than one person due to the risk of misinterpreting glucose information.

Performance of the System when used with other implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers, has not been evaluated.

Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found in supplements including multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies such as Airborne $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Emergen- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { C } \mathbf { \otimes }$ , may contain high doses of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid and should not be taken while using the Sensor. See your health care professional to understand how long ascorbic acid is active in your body.

Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care professional.

Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the symbol during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor, if your Sensor glucose reading does not match how you feel or if the reading does not include a number.

For you to receive alarms, they must be on and your device should be within 33 feet of you at all times. The transmission range is 33 feet unobstructed. If you are out of range, you may not receive alarms.

If you suspect that the temperature may exceed $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (for example, in an unairconditioned home in summer), you should refrigerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.

Do not force close the App. The App must be running in the background to receive alarms. If you force close the App you will not receive alarms. Re-open the App to ensure you will receive alarms.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide glucose levels, trends, and alerts. The System consists of the following components: a Sensor which transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a mobile application, FreeStyle Libre 3 App, downloaded to a compatible smartphone running on iOS operating system. When used with the FSL 3 the proposed mobile app allows the user to activate FSL3 sensors, provides real-time glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose graph) thus allowing the user may make treatment decisions, and connect with cloud-based applications to store as shareable data (e.g. LibreView).

# System Components and Features

Alarms: The FSL3 App can issue the following glucose and system alarms:

Mandatory Alarms: Urgent Low Glucose, Replace Sensor, Sensor Ended, App Stopped   
(Force Closed) o These alarms cannot be turned off or modified and will always sound regardless of the phone’s sound and vibe or Do Not Disturb (DND) settings.

Optional Alarms: Low Glucose Alarm, High Glucose Alarm, Signal Loss Alarm o For the optional alarms above, the Override DND setting is turned on by default; therefore, the user receives these alarms regardless of the phone’s sound, vibe or DND settings. If the user wishes to have the optional alarms follow the phone’s sound and vibe settings, the user must turn off Override DND from the App.

Hardware / Software compatibility: The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use with Field Communication (NFC) and BLE-enabled smartphones running compatible iOS. The FSL3 app is compatible with FSL3 Sensors.

Secondary Viewers: LibreView and LibreLinkUp (LLU) provide a cloud-based repository for glucose measurement data and mobile app that allows caregivers to receive and view glucose data (including glucose alarms) from users who use the FSL3 App with their sensor. Secondary viewers are not intended to be used for immediate clinical decision making.

# B Principle of Operation:

The FreeStyle Libre 3 System provides the user with real-time glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historic 12-hour glucose results (glucose graph) that are presented on the App. The real-time glucose measurements and glucose arrows are calculated by the Sensor software based upon glucose sampling, also performed by the Sensor.

The Sensor is designed to measure glucose levels in the user’s interstitial fluid through an amperometric electrochemical sensor component. The sensor tail is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue and generates an electrical current via the oxidation of glucose from the interstitial fluid. The FreeStyle Libre 3 System is intended for single patient use. The App can only pair to one Sensor at a time. The Sensor is disposable and may be worn up to 14 days. The Sensor automatically terminates after 14 days of use.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The iCGM performance was evaluated in clinical studies described below in section C(3) below. A sub-set of study participants wore two sensors concurrently, one on the back of each upper arm, to evaluate device precision for a period of up to 14 days.

For adults, the paired absolute relative difference (PARD) between the two Sensors was $5 . 9 \%$ with coefficient of variation (CV) of $4 . 2 \%$ . For children ages 4-5, PARD was $4 . 7 \%$ with CV of $3 . 3 \%$ . For children ages 6-17, PARD was $8 . 1 \%$ with CV of $5 . 7 \%$ . Paired absolute difference (PAD) is a measurement of absolute difference (in $\mathrm { m g / }$ dL) between paired CGM readings, while PARD is the absolute relative difference $( \mathrm { i n \% } )$ ) between paired CGM readings.

Study 3 was conducted at 4 centers in the US with 100 adult and pediatric subjects in total (83.0 $\%$ Type 1, $1 7 . 0 \%$ Type 2). All subjects required insulin to manage their diabetes. 56 adult subjects were aged 18 and older, 39 pediatric subjects were aged six to seventeen and 5 pediatric subjects were aged four to five. 81 subjects were analyzed during the beginning of the Sensor wear period (day 1, 2 or 3), 46 subjects were analyzed during the early middle period (day 7 or 8), 47 subjects were analyzed during the late middle period (day 9 or 12), and 34 subjects were analyzed during the end period (day 13 or 14).

Subjects aged six and older had their venous blood glucose analyzed for up to 16 hours over one or two separate visits to the clinical center. Each visit lasted up to eight hours. The venous blood samples were analyzed using a laboratory reference method, the Yellow Springs Instrument Life Sciences 2300 STAT Plus™ Glucose & Lactate Analyzer (YSI). Self-monitoring blood glucose meter (SMBG) was used as the comparator method for subjects 4-5 years of age.

Glucose values were obtained from the system and from the comparator at the same or similar time. Data from Study 1 (the adult Libre 2 study) was combined with data from the adult cohort in Study 3, and data from Study 2 (the pediatric Libre 2 study) was combined with data from the pediatric cohort in Study 3.

For values below $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , absolute differences in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ were compared to the comparator method. For values of $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and above, percentage differences compared to the comparator method were calculated.

# Agreement when iCGM reads “LO” or “HI”

The FreeStyle Libre 3 Glucose Monitoring System reports glucose readings between 40 and 400 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . When the system determines that the glucose reading is below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘LO’ whenever the sensor is scanned. When the system determines that the glucose reading is above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned. Because the system does not display glucose values below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator) when the iCGM value is classified as ‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are evaluated separately. The cumulative percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’) and when comparator values were more that certain glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in the tables below.

# Alarm Performance

The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms. The Alarm Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells the user how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high glucose event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).

Low Glucose Alarm Performance

True Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

False Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was not below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm issued within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

# Sensor Stability

Sensor stability describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can be worn for up to 14 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the absolute relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of device readings within $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $1 5 \%$ $( 1 5 / 1 5 \% )$ , $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $20 \%$ $( 2 0 / 2 0 \% )$ and $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $40 \%$ $( 4 0 / 4 0 \% )$ of the comparator values during the beginning, early middle, late middle, and end of the wear period. These times were defined as follows:

Beginning (Adult Days 1-3, Pediatric: Days 1-2) • Early Middle (Adult: Days 7-8, Pediatric: Days 7-8), • Late Middle (Adult: Days 9-12, Pediatric: Days 9-12), and End (Adult: Days 13-14, Pediatric: Days 13-14).

The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and agreement rates with the comparator method were evaluated over 14-day life of the sensor. For these tables the adult data for FreeStyle Libre 2 study were combined with the adult data for FreeStyle Libre 3. The same approach was also implemented for pediatric subjects.

# Sensor Life

The Sensor can be worn for up to 14 days. To estimate how long a Sensor will work over the wear duration, 101 Sensors were evaluated in Study 3 to determine how many days of readings each Sensor provided. Of the 56 Sensors used in adults, $6 6 . 1 \%$ lasted until the final day; while of the 45 sensors used in pediatric patients, $7 1 . 1 \%$ lasted until the final day. Abbott performed a retrospective analysis and concluded that the survival rate of the FSL3 in Study 3 was negatively affected by a software configuration unique to the investigational device, and that the actual survival rates should be higher.

A subsequent study was conducted in adults to assess the impact of this software configuration on early sensor shut-off as well as to determine the survival rate after eliminating for physical factors (e.g., getting caught in car seat belt, accidental knocking off the sensor etc.). A total of 34 of the 39 $( 8 7 . 2 \% )$ of the sensors gave glucose results over the entire intended wear period of 14 days. After correcting for several factors, the actual survival rate was $9 4 . 4 \%$ .
