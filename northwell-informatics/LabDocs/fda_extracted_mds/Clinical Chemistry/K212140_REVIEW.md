# D Special Instrument Requirements:

GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose meter

# A Device Description:

The GlucoSure Link blood glucose monitoring system (model number BGM024) consists of the GlucoSure Link meter, GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Test Strips and Contrex Plus glucose control solutions (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). The GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Test Strips and Contrex Plus glucose control solution are available for purchase separately.

# B Principle of Operation:

The GlucoSure Link blood glucose monitoring system quantitatively measures glucose amperometrically, using test strips containing an enzyme (Glucose Oxidase). Glucose in the whole blood sample applied to the test strip reacts with the glucose oxidase. The electrons generated during this reaction are detected by the meter. The meter applies a small electrical current to the test strip and measures changes in the current caused by the reaction of glucose in the blood sample to the enzyme in the test strip. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the blood and is converted to a glucose concentration. The glucose concentration is displayed on the meter’s display. The test results are plasma-calibrated.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose meter

2. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips, forearm, or palm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action and samples are to be tested immediately upon collection.

4. Calibration:

The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically coded.

5. Quality Control:

Contrex Plus Glucose Control Solutions (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) are available for use with the system. Each test strip vial is printed with a control solution range, and the user is

instructed to compare the control results with the expected control ranges printed on the strip vial. Users are given instructions on when to conduct control solution testing and to call customer service if repeat testing with control material is out of range.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A within-run precision study using 3 lots of GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips was performed. Venous blood was spiked to 5 concentrations (i.e., Level $1 \colon 3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Level $2 \colon 5 1 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Level $3 \colon 1 1 1 - 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Level 4: $: 1 5 1 - 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and Level 5: 251-400 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ). For each sample concentration, 10 GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose meters were used, with 10 measurements taken by each meter for a total of 300 test for each glucose level. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ControlLevels</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>46</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>89</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>120</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>221</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>328</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.6</td></tr></table>

Intermediate precision was evaluated using 3 lots of the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips and five levels of control solutions (i.e., Level $1 \colon 3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Level $\therefore 5 1 - 1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Level $3 \colon 1 1 1 - 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Level 4: $1 5 1 { - } 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and Level 5: $2 5 1 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Each sample was measured in replicates of 10 using 10 GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose meters over ten days resulting in a total of 300 tests for each glucose level. Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ControlLevels</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>69</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>121</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>222</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>329</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.8%</td></tr></table>

Linearity was evaluated using venous whole blood adjusted to eleven glucose levels at 19.7, 50.1, 80.7, 115, 160, 200, 260, 310, 420, 530, and $6 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (as measured by the comparator method, YSI 2300) and 3 GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strip lots. The GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System results were compared with the values obtained from the comparator method. The results from the regression analysis are summarized below:

Lot $\mathsf { l } \colon \mathsf { y } = 0 . 9 9 7 2 \mathrm { x } { - } 0 . 1 9 6 1$ , $\ R 2 { = } 0 . 9 9 8 5$ Lot 2: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 3 5 \mathrm { x } - 1 . 0 7 3 6 , \mathrm { R } 2 = 0 . 9 9 8 4$ Lot 3: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 2 7 \mathrm { x } . - 0 . 8 4 2 9 , \mathrm { R } 2 = 0 . 9 9 8 3$

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If a sample is less than $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as “LO”. If a sample result is more than $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is flagged by the meter as “HI”. The low and high functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference testing was conducted to evaluate the effect of endogenous substances and common exogenous substances expected in the intended use population on the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The study was designed using venous whole blood samples adjusted to 3 target glucose levels $\mathrm { \hbar \langle 5 0 - 7 0 \ m g / d L }$ , $1 1 0 { - } 1 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and 225-270 $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Samples were divided into a test pool with the potential interferent added and a control sample with no added interferent. The difference between the test and control sample results was calculated and the concentration at which no significant interference (defined as average $\%$ bias $\leq 1 0 \%$ ) was observed is listed in the table below:

1) System operating conditions (temperature, humidity):

The GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System was tested at different temperature and humidity conditions to assess the effect of the operation environment on the performance of the system. Temperatures ranging from $5 0 - 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 1 0 - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and 20 $- 8 5 \%$ relative humidity were tested. Five temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. Venous whole blood glucose levels (60, 120, 200, and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested using 10 meters and 3 lots of GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips. Values measured by the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to the results obtained using the comparator method, the YSI 2300 method. The study results support the labeled operating conditions claim of $5 0 { - } 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $\mathrm { 1 0 - 4 0 ^ { \circ } C ) }$ and $20 \%$ RH.

2) Sample Volume Study:

The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 1.0 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ for the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples with 3 glucose concentrations (50-65, 100-120 and $2 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } $ were tested at 5 sample volumes (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1 and $1 . 2 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) using 3 lots of GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips and 10 GlucoSure Link meters. Values obtained were compared to the results obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300 Glucose analyzer). Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $1 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ for the system. The meter displays an error message if enough blood is not added to the test strip. This feature was validated and was shown to function as intended.

3) Hematocrit Study:

The effect of hematocrit on the performance of the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated at $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $42 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $5 5 \%$ hematocrit levels, and at 5 glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250 and $2 5 1 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } \rangle$ . Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 using 10 meters and 3 lots of GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips, for a total of 30 replicates per sample. The values were compared with the glucose measurements obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300 Glucose analyzer). The results of the study demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of $30 \% { - } 5 5 \%$ .

4) Altitude Study:

A high-altitude study was conducted where the effects of sea level $( < 5 0 0$ ft) and highaltitude (10,000 ft) were simulated and the effects on the GlucoSure Blood Glucose Monitoring System were evaluated. Venous whole blood samples adjusted to 5 glucose concentrations (50, 120, 220, 330, and $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were tested using 10 meters and 3 lots of GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips. Values measured by the candidate device were compared with the glucose measurements obtained with the comparator method (YSI 2300 Glucose analyzer). The results of the study support the claim that the

GlucoSure Blood Glucose Monitoring System can be operated at altitudes of up to 10,000 ft.

5) Flex Studies:

Flex studies were performed demonstrating that the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System is robust to short sample application, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, intermittent sampling, drop and vibration.

6) Infection Control Studies:

The device system is intended for single patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were previously performed (k150396) with the external meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or removal of HBsAg with the following disinfectants: Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal and Disinfectant Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 67619-12), Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach (EPA Registration Number: 56392-8), Medline Micro-Kil $^ +$ Disinfecting, Deodorizing, Cleaning Wipes with Alcohol (EPA Registration Number: 59894-10), and Medline Micro-Kill Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 69687-1-37549). The sponsor also conducted robustness studies demonstrating that there was no change in performance or to the external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles (representing weekly disinfection for five years, the expected lifetime of the meter). Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

7) The sponsor provided acceptable documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing was performed with the candidate system and the system was found to be compliant.

8) Test strip lot release criteria: The test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
