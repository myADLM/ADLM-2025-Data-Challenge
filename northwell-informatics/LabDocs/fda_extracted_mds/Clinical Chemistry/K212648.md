Dear Declan Hynes:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

# Trade or Proprietary Names:

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CK-MB Reagent Pack Common Name: VITROS CK-MB   
Assay Classification: 862.1215 Creatine phosphokinase/creatine kinase or isoenzymes test system.   
Product Code: JHX

4. Predicate Device

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CK-MB Reagent Pack, K993068

5. Device description

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CK-MB assay is performed using the VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack and the VITROS CK-MB Calibrators on the VITROS Systems.

The current VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CK-MB assay is susceptible to interference from biotin. Ortho has made a modification to the manufacturing process to allow the biotinylated antibody capture conjugate to be pre-bound to the well, thus mitigating the risk of biotin interference.

The modified product utilizes all the same antibodies and raw materials with the exception of the addition of $0 . 7 \%$ Tween 20 and an increase in EDTA concentration from 0.001M to 0.030M, both of these modifications are to improve serum/plasma agreement which required a conversion factor in the previously cleared product.

![](images/dbc1361e74f84a6e6f31d6aa78d64aef7690def0deca9359aead3d42d19629fc.jpg)

An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the reaction of CK-MB present in the sample with a microwell coated with biotinylated Antibody (Mouse monoclonal anti-CK-BB bound to Streptavidin), and a Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (Mouse monoclonal anti-CK-MB). Unbound (HRP)-labeled anti-CK-MB antibody conjugate is removed by washing.

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of CKMB conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of CK-MB present in the sample.

6. Device intended use

# Rx ONLY

# Other Limitations

The results from this or any other diagnostic test should be used and interpreted only in the context of the overall clinical picture.

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic CK-MB Reagent Pack has no high dose hook effect up to $4 4 , 2 0 0 \mathrm { { n g / m L } ( \mu g / L ) }$ .

Elevated CK-MB concentrations have been observed in patients experiencing skeletal muscle trauma, renal failure and certain chronic heart pathologies, as well as after strenuous exercise. Factors that may aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction include the pattern of rise and fall in CK-MB concentrations as well as the ratio of CK-MB concentration to total CK activity. These and other appropriate clinical factors should be considered when interpreting test results.

Heterophilic antibodies in the serum or plasma samples may cause interference in immunoassays. These antibodies may be present in blood samples from individuals regularly exposed to animals or who have been treated with animal serum products. Results that are inconsistent with clinical observations indicate the need for additional testing.

Certain drugs and clinical conditions are known to alter CK-MB concentrations in vivo. For additional information, refer to one of the published summaries referenced in the product Instruction for Use.
