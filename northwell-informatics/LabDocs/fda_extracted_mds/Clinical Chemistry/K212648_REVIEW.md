D Special Instrument Requirements: VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System (K083173)

IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack contains:

• 100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-CK-BB binds ${ \geq } 3 4 4 . 9 \ \mathrm { n g } \mathrm { C K - M B / m L } )$ .   
• $8 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ assay reagent (buffer with bovine serum albumin, bovine alpha globulins, bovine gamma globulins and antimicrobial agent).   
• $8 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti-CK-MB binds ≥344.9 ng CK-MB/mL) in buffer with bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent.

Testing is performed using the VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack and the VITROS CK-MB Calibrators on the VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System. The current VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CK-MB assay is susceptible to interference from biotin. Ortho has made a modification to the manufacturing process to allow the biotinylated antibody capture conjugate to be pre-bound to the well, thus mitigating the risk of biotin interference. The modified product utilizes all the same antibodies and raw materials with the exception of the addition of $0 . 7 \%$ Tween 20 and an increase in EDTA concentration from 0.001M to 0.030M, both of these modifications are to improve serum/plasma agreement which required a conversion factor in the previously cleared product.

# B Principle of Operation:

An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the reaction of CK-MB present in the sample with a microwell coated with biotinylated antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-CK-BB bound to Streptavidin), and a Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-CK-MB). Unbound (HRP)-labeled anti-CK-MB antibody conjugate is removed by washing.

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of CK-MB conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of CK-MB present in the sample.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated using four serum pools tested on one VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System using three reagent lots. The precision pools were prepared by selecting serum samples of a desired concentration (sample 2) or by adjusting the CK-MB concentration levels of the serum samples by spiking with either a blend of patient samples (sample 1) or by spiking with exogenous CK-MB (samples 3 and 4). Samples were measured for 20 days, twice a day in duplicate for a total of 80 measurements per sample in accordance with the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. The results of a representative lot are shown below.

2. Linearity:

Linearity studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP06-A2 guideline. In the first study, a series of nineteen proportionally related admixtures of low and high concentration samples were tested. The samples used to prepare the mixtures were a low serum sample and a high serum sample spiked with exogenous CK-MB antigen. Five replicates were measured for each mid-level sample in the linearity panel and ten replicates were measured for high and low pools in the linearity panel. All linearity levels were tested on three reagent lots and one VITROS 3600 System. The sample concentrations ranged from 0.08 to $4 4 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The deviation from linearity was $< 1 0 \%$ . A second linearity study was performed using native serum patient samples. The results of the linearity studies support that the assay is linear over the claimed measuring range of $0 . 2 2 \mathrm { - } 4 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Auto Dilution Study

Studies were performed to analyze the recovery of samples containing high levels of CK-MB outside the claimed measuring range of $0 . 2 2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ using 5 human serum sample spiked with human derived CK-MB material. The results support a sample dilution ratio of 1:5 (1-part sample to 4-parts diluent) for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CK-MB Reagent Pack.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack was tested for interfering substances at CK-MB concentrations of approximately $3 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $5 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ following the recommendations in the CLSI EP07 and EP37 guidelines. Each test and control sample were run in replicates of 5 on 3 reagent lots. The sponsor defined interference as a bias ${ > } 1 0 \%$ when compared to the control sample.

The following substances did not interfere with the VITROS CK-MB assay at the concentrations shown below.

\*Not Detectable. Concentration was below the measuring interval of the test, 0.22 to 400 ng/mL

# Hook Effect

The sponsor provided data supporting the claim that there is no hook effect up to 44,200 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

4. Assay Reportable Range:

The claimed assay reportable range of is $0 . 2 2 \mathrm { - } 4 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): Calibration of the VITROS CK‑MB test is traceable to in-house reference calibrators which have been value‑assigned to correlate to another commercially available test. The traceability of the modified device is the same as the predicate, K993068.

6. Detection Limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined for the VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack based upon recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The detection limit studies were conducted using three VITROS CK-MB assay reagent lots on one VITROS 3600 System over five working days. Each reagent lot was calibrated on the first day of testing.

The LoB testing consisted of 20 replicates of four fluids containing no measurable CK-MB. LoB was determined as the 95th percentile of the measurements of the blank samples. The LoD testing consisted of 60 replicates of five neat serum samples (low levels of endogenous CK-MB) spiked with purified CK-MB sourced from human heart tissue. The LoD was calculated using the classical approach outlined in CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined using a precision profile approach with a $\% \mathrm { C V }$ limit of $20 \%$ .

The results of the studies support the claims summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CK-MB (ng/mL )</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.07</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.22</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.22</td></tr></table>

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Method comparison studies were conducted by testing 149 serum samples in singlicate using the modified VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack (candidate device) using 3 reagent lots and the unmodified VITROS CK-MB assay (predicate device) in duplicate using 2 reagent lots on one VITROS 3600 System. For the modified device, each sample was tested using each reagent lot. For the unmodified device, each sample was tested using each lot and the mean for each sample was used in the comparison. The concentrations in the samples ranged from $0 . 6 1 { - } 3 7 8 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , as determined by the predicate device. Each sample was run in singleton. Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed. The regression analysis summary of one representative lot is shown below:

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

The study included samples from 49 individual whole blood donors. The following matrices were evaluated: serum, lithium heparin plasma and K2-EDTA plasma. Samples were unaltered, spiked using endogenous human serum samples with elevated CK-MB values, and spiked with concentrated human CK-MB to ensure the full measuring interval of the assay was tested.

Samples from each matrix were tested in singlicate using one reagent lot on one VITROS 3600 System. Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed using the serum data as the reference. Results are shown in the table below.
