Dear Katherine Lemus:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for

devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Indications for Use (Describe)

The BD Vacutainer® UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set is a sterile, multi-sample, single-use fixed winged blood collection set intended to be used by trained healthcare professionals for venipuncture to obtain blood specimens from patients, including those patients with difficult vein access who may have small, fragile, and/or non-palpable veins, into evacuated blood collection tubes and/or blood culture bottles. When used without the male adapter, the device allows the clinician to obtain a blood specimen from the female hub with a syringe, if necessary. The device can be used for short-term, single infusions with consideration given to patient size and appropriateness for the solution being infused. The device is not to be left in place and is to remain under the direct supervision of a clinician.

The recommended use of the device is to activate the needle safety feature prior to removal from the venipuncture site. The retraction of the intravenous (IV) end of the needle aids in the prevention of accidental needlestick injury.

# Device Description

The BD Vacutainer® UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set is a winged blood collection set with flexible tubing, a female luer connector and a male luer adapter. The BD Vacutainer® UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set also contains a needle protector.

The BD Vacutainer® UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set models available consist of a combination of different needle gauges (21G, 23G, 25G), tubing length (12-inch, 7 inch), and are available with or without a pre-attached holder.

The proposed indications for use, are similar to the predicate indications for use, except for the inclusion of both healthy patients and patients with vascular anatomy and/or co-morbidities which may cause difficulty in locating a vein. Healthy patients and patients with these conditions often exhibit small, fragile, non-palpable veins, commonly referred to as difficult vein access (DVA). The addition of DVA in the revised indications for use statement does not significantly change the intended use as butterfly needles have historically been used on patients with small veins and similar statements were included for previous device iterations and were inadvertently removed in subsequent submissions. BD believes that the addition of specific reference to patients with DVA does not raise new questions of safety/effectiveness.

# Substantial Equivalence Discussion:

# Comment #1

The subject device indicates that the intended population is for general use, including a subset of patients who may have difficult veins, whereas the predicate device population is general use. Both devices are used on all patient populations regardless of their vein status. Adding a reference to patients with difficult veins has no effect on clinical safety or effectiveness.

# Comment #2

The subject device is available in models with and without a pre-attached holder. The predicate device is only available in models without the pre-attached holder and requires the user to add a holder in order to use the device for blood collection. Adding models with the pre-attached holder to the subject device is a user convenience and does not affect clinical safety or effectiveness.

# Technical Performance Summary

The sponsor has determined that since the subject and predicate blood collection sets are the same, and the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Brand Holder is unchanged from clearance under K181730, new performance testing is not required. Specifically, because there has been no significant change to design, product materials, packaging materials, processing/assembly, packaging, or manufacturing that would affect device performance no new performance testing is provided in support of this submission.

# Conclusion

The technical performance characteristics of the subject device are unchanged. The clinical literature, BD’s sponsored studies, and Investigator sponsored studies sufficiently support the determination that patients with Difficult Vein Access (DVA) is a subset of the current patient population for the BD Vacutainer® UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set. The risk profile of patients with DVA is not substantially different from that of the general patient population and is supported by the extensive clinical literature evidence presented under this submission. Based on information provided in this submission the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
