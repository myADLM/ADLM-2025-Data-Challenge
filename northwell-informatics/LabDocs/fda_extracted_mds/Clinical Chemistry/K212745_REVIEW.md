C Type of Test: Saliva collection for DNA testing

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

# A Intended Use(s):

ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx is intended for the collection of saliva samples for diagnostic testing of human DNA. Saliva samples may be collected by a healthcare professional or non-healthcare professional, such as a lay user. Saliva samples collected using ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx are stabilized and isolated for use in downstream diagnostic testing applications. Saliva samples collected using ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx can be transported and/or stored at ambient conditions.

B Indication(s) for Use: See Intended for Use above

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Models OCD-100 and OCD-100A

ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx saliva samples can be self-collected. ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx devices are intended for use in over-the-counter (direct-to- consumer) downstream diagnostic testing applications. Test manufacturers must validate the use of ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx for their specific indications for use. • ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx is intended for collection and stabilization of human DNA from saliva, it is not intended for the collection and stabilization of RNA, protein, or hormones. ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx has only been validated for use with germline testing. For use in individuals 18 years of age and older.

# Model OCD-100.014:

ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx (Model OCD-100.014) collection device is only cleared for use with the AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk service. For use in individuals 18 years of age and older.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

None

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx (models OCD-100A, OCD-100, and OCD-100.014) is a collection device for human saliva samples. All ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ •Dx formats have the same collection principle in that saliva is collected using a sponge into a collection tube containing a stabilizing liquid. All formats are made from the same physical and chemical materials. All formats consist of the same double ended tube cap with an attached integrated sponge, the same collection tube and contain the same DNA stabilizing liquid. The attached integrated sponge is used to collect and transfer the saliva sample from a donor’s mouth into the stabilizing liquid inside the collection tube.

The model OCD-100A includes a molded plastic insert inside the collection tube. The insert does not impact user experience or user collection instructions but rather is intended to facilitate or

enable a more efficient physical handling of the sample in the laboratory. The model OCD100.014 is identical to the OCD-100 but is labeled for use with a specific assay.

# B Principle of Operation:

After saliva is collected, the stabilizing liquid is mixed with the sample. Upon contacting saliva cells, the stabilizing liquid lyses cellular and nuclear membranes to release and stabilize nucleic acids (DNA). Samples can be immediately processed, transported, or stored for future use.

# V Substantial Equivalence Information:

Evaluation of lay user collection and labeling comprehension:

Performance of saliva samples collected with ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ·Dx (device model OCD100.014) was evaluated in an over-the-counter setting. The study consisted of samples from 389 subjects 18 years or older and the demographics were representative of the United States (US) population. Each participant completed the saliva sample collection following the instructions for use and mailed the collected sample to a testing laboratory. Each study sample was assessed for compliance to shipping instructions, collection instructions, sample volume, DNA concentration, and genotype calls. User comprehension of test instructions, including comprehension of sample collection instructions was also assessed. A sub-set of the study participants were randomly selected to complete the same process, excluding the completion of the user questionnaire to evaluate the possibility of questionnaire-related bias. Laboratory results (DNA concentration, yield and genotyping call rates) from those who completed the user questionnaire and those who did not were compared to identify any potential bias between the populations.

Two samples out of the 389 specimens were not evaluated, one due to insufficient volume ( $<$ $4 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ ), and another due to the lack of detectable DNA. The remaining 387 out of 389 samples $( 9 9 . 5 \% )$ contained the minimum amount of DNA after extraction, and were evaluated. Of these 387 samples, there were 2 “no calls” in the first pass $( 3 8 5 / 3 8 7 = 9 9 . 5 \%$ call rate in first pass). After the second pass, there was 1 “no call” and genotyping results for 386 out of 387 samples $( 9 9 . 7 \% )$ matched confirmatory sequencing. No bias was observed between the questionnaire and non-questionnaire groups. Genotyping results were confirmed via bi-directional sequencing.

The results of the user comprehension survey and the physical characteristics of the participant samples demonstrate that the ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ·Dx collection device can be used successfully in the over-the-counter setting.

A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the collection device labeling in K141410. Lay user collection and labeling comprehension for the ORAcollect $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ·Dx model

OCD-100.014 device, when used with the AlphaID At Home Genetic Risk Service was reviewed and found acceptable.
