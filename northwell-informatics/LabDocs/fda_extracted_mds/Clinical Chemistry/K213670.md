The BD Vacutainer® EDTA Blood Collection Tubes met all non-clinical testing requirements at time-zero and over the product shelf life, demonstrating that the device functions as designed. These performance tests demonstrate that the modifications to the device do not impact its safety or effectiveness and that the subject BD Vacutainer® EDTA Blood Collection Tubes continue to perform as intended.

# 1.17 Performance Testing – Animal Summary

No animal studies were performed in support of this submission.

# 1.18 Performance Testing – Clinical Summary

The suitability of the BD Vacutainer® EDTA Blood Collection Tubes for collection of clinical samples was demonstrated through testing performed internally and externally which demonstrated clinical equivalency to the venous comparator tube by performing the following studies: Method Comparison (Clinical Equivalence), Precision, Within-Tube Type Stability, and Shelf Life. Testing was performed on identified analytes (i.e., White Blood Cell Count (WBC), Red Blood Cell Count (RBC), Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelet Count, Neutrophil $\%$ , Lymphocyte $\%$ , Monocyte $\%$ , Eosinophil $\%$ , Basophil $\%$ , Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration, Mean Corpuscular Volume, and Red Cell Distribution Width."

# Method Comparison

This study was performed to evaluate Clinical Equivalence between the evaluate the performance of BD Vacutainer® EDTA Blood Collection Tubes against legally marketed comparator tubes., for the analytes identified above. This assessment considered whether the mean and the two one-sided $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limits of the paired sample biases were within the Clinical Acceptance Limits (CALs).

Clinical equivalency was demonstrated for all hematology parameters for each tube comparison except Hgb, PLT, and WBC at the low medically relevant points on two instruments. For these three analytes the mean bias was within the predefined clinical acceptance limits, but exceeded the confidence interval. The observed non-equivalence is clinically acceptable, as the number of data points at the low medically relevant points were insufficient to adequately power the analysis.

# Lot to Lot Variability

This study was performed to evaluate non-inferiority of the BD Vacutainer® K2EDTA tube for repeatability (within tube) and reproducibility (lot-to-lot and tube-to-tube) variation using hematology parameters identified above.

Performance of the BD Vacutainer® K2EDTA Tubes with Hemogard™ closure for repeatability, lot-to-lot variation and tube-to-tube variation showed non-inferiority for all tube comparisons for the hematology parameters tested on two instrument platforms when compared with a comparator device.

# Within-Tube Type Stability

This study evaluated within-tube type stability of BD Vacutainer® EDTA Blood Collection Tubes by comparing samples taken from the same subject in the candidate tubes at various identified time points and storage conditions.

All analytes demonstrated stability at 12- and 24-hours storage Room Temperature, 24 hours Refrigerated, 24 hours Room Temperature followed by 24 hours Refrigerated.

# Shelf-Life

The purpose of this study was to evaluate product shelf-life by evaluating evaluate Shelf-Life performance ( $1 1 { + } 1$ months or $1 0 { + } 1$ months from date of manufacture) of BD Vacutainer® K2EDTA and K3EDTA Blood Collection Tubes with Hemogard™ closure and Conventional closure, respectively, in comparison with recently manufactured BD Vacutainer® K2EDTA and K3EDTA Blood Collection Tubes for selected hematology test parameters.

Real time clinical stability testing performed using clinical samples demonstrated a shelf life of 11 months for BD Vacutainer® K2EDTA Blood Collection Tubes and 10 months for BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K3EDTA Blood Collection Tubes.

# 1.19 Conclusion

The technical performance characteristics of the subject device are unchanged. The proposed BD Vacutainer® EDTA Blood Collection Tubes and predicate device of the same name have the same intended use, principle of operation, and technological characteristics. Non-Clinical and Clinical Performance Testing sufficiently support the determination that the changes made to the

BD Vacutainer® EDTA Blood Collection Tubes do not raise any new concerns of safety or effectiveness. Based on information provided in this submission the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
