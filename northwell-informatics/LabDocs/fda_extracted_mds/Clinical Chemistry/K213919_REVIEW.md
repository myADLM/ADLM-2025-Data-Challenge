B Measurand: Glucose in Interstitial Fluid   
C Type of Test: Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System is a real time, continuous glucose monitoring device indicated for the management of diabetes in persons 2 years and older.

The Dexcom G7 CGM System is intended to replace fingerstick BG testing for diabetes treatment decisions. Interpretation of the Dexcom G7 CGM System results should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential sensor readings over time. The Dexcom G7 CGM System also aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments.

The Dexcom G7 CGM System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices, including automated insulin dosing (AID) systems. The Dexcom G7 CGM System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected medical devices for the purpose of managing diabetes.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Users of the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System can take a standard dose of acetaminophen (up to 1 gram every 6 hours in adults) and still use the Dexcom G7 System readings. Sensor glucose readings will be falsely higher if the user is taking more than a standard acetaminophen dose.

Sensor glucose readings will also be falsely higher if the user is taking hydroxyurea. Users should not use the Dexcom G7 System for diabetes treatment decisions if they are taking hydroxyurea.

Don't wear any Dexcom G7 CGM System component during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. However, it's safe to have a CT scan if you keep the sensor out of the scanned area and cover the sensor with a lead apron during the scan.

Don't ignore low/high symptoms: Use BG meter to make treatment decisions when the sensor readings don't match the user's low/high symptoms. If needed, seek immediate medical attention.

Use BG meter to make treatment decisions when the Dexcom G7 CGM System doesn't show both a number and trend arrow as well as during the 30-minute sensor warmup period.

• Don't use if on dialysis or critically ill: The Dexcom G7 CGM System performance hasn't been evaluated in these populations and sensor readings may be inaccurate.

• Don't ignore broken or detached sensor wires. If this happens, contact 24/7 technical support.

• Insert only in the arm or buttocks: Don’t wear it on other sites as it may not work as expected.

Store sensors at room temperature or in the refrigerator, between $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ and $8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ , but not in the freezer.

Check settings: Make sure the smart device volume is turned up, not muted, and the speaker works. When a headphone is connected, alerts will only sound through the headphone, not on the smart device speaker.

• Make sure Bluetooth is on. Otherwise, the user won't get readings or alerts.

Make sure the smart device settings follow Dexcom’s recommended settings. Certain phone settings such as Android's Digital Wellbeing and Apple’s Screen Time may prevent notifications if enabled.   
• Allow Dexcom G7 CGM System app notifications to show on Lock screen. This will ensure the user can receive Dexcom notifications and allow the user to see notifications without unlocking the phone.   
• Android users must allow Location Permission, Do Not Disturb Access, and Notifications to use the app. Apple users must allow Critical Alerts to use the app.

• Battery: Keep the battery charged.

Quiet Mode (Vibrate): When this setting is enabled all System alerts will vibrate. The Urgent Low Glucose and technical alerts will still escalate to sound if not acknowledged. Quiet Mode (Silence All): When this setting is enabled, all System alerts will be silent. The user won't receive sound or vibration for any alerts. The user will still receive visual alerts on the display device. (Exceptions: App Stopped alerts will still sound.) Check the display device frequently to avoid missing a low/high event.   
Before upgrading the smart device or its operating system, check   
dexcom.com/compatibility. Always update manually and verify correct device settings afterward.   
Let the date and time on the smart device automatically update when traveling across time zones or switch between standard and daylight saving times. Don’t manually change the smart device time because the user may not get readings or alerts and it may make the time on the trend screen wrong.

Use electrical equipment as directed:

Portable radio frequency communications equipment (including peripherals such as antenna cables and external antennas) should be used no closer than 12 inches to any part of the Dexcom G7 CGM System including cables specified by the manufacturer. Otherwise, degradation of the performance of this equipment could result.

Use of this equipment adjacent to, or stacked with, other equipment should be avoided because it could result in improper operation.

Not using supplied USB charger and cable may cause the receiver battery to not charge. Don't use if the supplied USB charger or cable is damaged. Store supplied USB charger and cable safely. Misuse of the USB cable can be a strangulation risk.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (G7 System) is an interoperable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system intended to continuously measure the glucose in the interstitial fluid, calculate the glucose reading and make this value available to the user. It consists of the following components:

• G7 Glucose Sensing Subsystem (GSS) • G7 Mobile Applications Subsystem (MAS) • G7 Receiver Subsystem (RVS)

To achieve the intended functions and performance of the G7 System, one GSS and one receiving device (MAS or RVS) must be used together. The receiving device acts as the primary display device and the user may choose to use only the MAS or only the RVS as the sole display device; they may also choose to use both display devices simultaneously (MAS and RVS). The user must pair the receiving device(s) with each unique GSS to enable communication and start a sensor session. During an active session, the GSS reports new glucose data to a receiving device every 5-minutes. The receiving device then displays glucose data and provides alerts and information signals to the user. The reportable glucose range for the G7 System is $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Glucose values below this range are reported as ‘LOW’ and glucose values above this range are reported as ‘HIGH’. The sensor has an expected wear period of up to 10 days with an extended 12-hour grace period after the sensor session. The grace period allows additional time for the user to change the sensor at a convenient time.

The Dexcom G7 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic interfaces; including compatible AID systems.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System detects glucose levels from the fluid just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using an algorithm to a glucose value read in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which is then transmitted to the receiver/mobile application for the user to see and use accordingly.

# C Instrument Description Information:

2. Specimen Identification: Not applicable.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Not applicable.

4. Calibration: The G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is factory calibrated and does not require a sensor code. User may enter optional calibration using fingerstick blood glucose values.

\*Only pediatrics aged between 2-6 YO wore devices on the upper buttocks.

2. Linearity:

The reportable range for the System is 40 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Users of the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System can take a standard or maximum dose of acetaminophen (up to 1 gram every 6 hours in adults) and still use the Dexcom G7 System readings. Sensor glucose readings will be falsely higher if the user is taking more than a standard acetaminophen dose.

Sensor glucose readings will also be falsely higher if the user is taking hydroxyurea. Users should not use the Dexcom G7 System for diabetes treatment decisions if they are taking hydroxyurea.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

See Linearity section above.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The Dexcom GSS (sensor and transmitter) has a storage shelf-life of up to 9 months with the insert molded needle hub design and up to 6 months with the bonded needle hub design. Shelf life was evaluated at $3 5 . 6 ^ { \circ } – 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $10 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. Sensors should be stored at $3 6 ^ { \circ } .$ - $8 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ and $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ relative humidity.

6. Detection Limit:

If a glucose measurement is less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result is displayed by the system as LOW. If a glucose measurement exceeds $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , result is displayed as HIGH.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not applicable.

8. Accuracy (Instrument): Not applicable.

9. Carry-Over: Not applicable.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Not applicable. Accuracy is determined by comparing device values to an FDA cleared laboratory grade glucose analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument 2300 STAT Plus™ Glucose Analyzer) and referred to as the “comparator method” in Section C(3) below.

2. Matrix Comparison: Not applicable. Interstitial fluid is the only indicated matrix.

# C Clinical Studies:

1. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

2. Clinical Specificity: Not applicable.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):

Two prospective clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom G7 CGM System or G7):

Study 1 – a pivotal study conducted at 12 clinic sites in the United States to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Dexcom G7 CGM System. A total of 482 adult and pediatric subjects (ages 2 and older) were enrolled.

Study 2 – a pivotal study conducted at two clinic sites in the United States to evaluate the data transmission reliability of the Dexcom G7 CGM System. A total of 60 adult and pediatric subjects (ages 12 and older) were enrolled.

The G7 wearables (sensor, data-logging transmitter, and adhesive patch) worn in Study 1 logged the glucose data but did not transmit real-time glucose data to a display device. As such, Study 2 was conducted to characterize the reliability of the real-time communication between the G7 wearable and the G7 display devices.

Data from Study 1 are presented in the tables below.

# Tread Accuracy

Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose and are characterized by slopes, such as from ${ \mathrm { > } } 2 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ to ${ < } { - } 2 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Trend accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change (changes in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ of glucose per minute) determined by the iCGM values and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measured pairs (typically collected once every 15 minutes).

G7 reports glucose readings between 40 and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . When G7 determines the sensor reading is below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it displays “LOW” on the receiver or mobile app. When G7 determines the glucose level is above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it displays “HIGH” on the receiver or mobile app. Because the System does not display glucose values below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator method) when the iCGM value is classified as LOW or HIGH is evaluated separately, and the cumulative percentages when laboratory comparator values were less than certain glucose levels (for LOW), and when laboratory comparator values were greater than certain glucose levels (for HIGH) are presented in the table below.

# Alert Performance

The Hypoglycemic Alert Rate shows how often the alert is right or wrong. The True Alert Rate is the $\%$ of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was at or below the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the device alarmed (as confirmed by the comparator method). The False Alert Rate is the $\%$ of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was above the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the device alarmed. The Correct Detection Rate is the $\%$ of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was at or below the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the hypoglycemic event. The Missed Detection Rate is the $\%$ of time the device did not alarm when the blood glucose level was at or below the alert setting within 15 minutes before and after the hypoglycemic event.

# Sensor Stability

Sensor stability describes the performance over the sensor intended lifetime (up to 10 days, including the optional 12-hour grace period). Performance was estimated by calculating the percentage of iCGM readings within $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $1 5 \%$ $( 1 5 / 1 5 \% )$ , $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $20 \%$ $( 2 0 / 2 0 \% )$ , and $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $40 \%$ $( 4 0 / 4 0 \% )$ of the laboratory comparator values at the beginning (Day 1, 2), middle (Day 4, 7), and end (Day 10, 10.5) of the System lifecycle. The mean of the absolute relative difference was evaluated over the sensor life within the measuring range.

# Sensor Life

A total of 460 sensors worn on the arm by adult and pediatric subjects were evaluated to determine the percentage of sensors that lasted through the 10-day sensor life. Seventy-nine percent $( 7 9 \% )$ of the 460 sensors lasted through the end of the entire wear period (e.g., Day 10). Among the 460 sensors evaluated, 66 sensors $( 1 4 . 3 \% )$ had “early sensor shut-off” where the sensor algorithm would have detected sensors that did not function as intended and shut them off.

The survival rates summarized separately for adult and pediatric populations are provided in the tables below:
