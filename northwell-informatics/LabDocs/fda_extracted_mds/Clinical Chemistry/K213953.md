# 1.13 Intended Use

BD Vacutaine $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element K2EDTA Tubes are plastic, evacuated, sterile, single use, in vitro diagnostic medical devices. They are intended to be used in settings where venous blood specimens are collected by trained healthcare professionals for the collection, transportation, and processing of blood in a closed tube. Blood collected in the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element K2EDTA Tubes are used for trace element testing (e.g., Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Lead, Manganese, Mercury, Selenium, and Zinc).

# 1.14 Device Description

The BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA Tube is an evacuated plastic blood collection tube. It consists of closure assembly, a plastic tube, and EDTA coating (dipotassium) and is available in two draw sizes, $6 \mathrm { m L }$ ( $1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m m } )$ and $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ( $1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 7 5 \mathrm { m m } )$ . The plastic tube is manufactured from PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic, which enhances user safety and disposal because of the reduced risk of tube breakage and the use of incineration as a method of disposal compared to glass. The EDTA anticoagulant coating is spray-dried on the walls of the tube in the dipotassium $( \mathrm { K } _ { 2 } )$ form.

The BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tube is also an evacuated plastic blood collection tube consisting of a closure assembly, a plastic tube and contains a silica clot activator additive which is spray-dried on the interior walls of the tube. It is available in one draw size, $6 \mathrm { m L }$ $\boldsymbol { 1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } }$ $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$ ). The plastic tube is manufactured from PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic.

All of these plastic tubes are closed with a BD Hemogard™ Closure, which consists of a rubber stopper and protective plastic shield to help reduce user exposure to blood. The stopper/closures are color coded to reflect the intended use (Royal Blue for trace element tubes).

# 1.16 Substantial Equivalence Discussion

# Intended Use

The intended use of the subject BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes is substantially equivalent to the prior cleared indications for use of the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Plus Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA Tubes under K041071. They are intended to be used for the collection, transportation, and processing of blood in a closed tube for trace element testing.

The subject device indication for use is for a subset of the previously cleared predicate trace element indications. The subject indication for use statement reduces the scope of trace elements to remove Calcium, Iron, and Magnesium from trace element testing because they are not present in the blood in trace amounts. In addition to this change, there is a minor language change in the subject indications for use which expands on the cleared indication for use to better clarify the intended setting and user of the devices, e.g., to be in settings where venous blood samples would be collected by trained healthcare professionals. These minor changes do not result in a new intended use of the subject device.

Both the subject and predicate device have the same intended use and substantially similar indications for use, meeting the first criteria for a finding of substantial equivalence.

# Technological Characteristics

Both the subject and predicate tubes have similar technological characteristics. They are plastic, evacuated, sterile, single use, in vitro diagnostic medical devices with Royal Blue BD Hemogard™ closures. There is no change in sterilization method or sterility assurance level for these tubes.

The subject BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes and predicate tubes are available in 6 mL draw volumes and contain the same quantity of spray dried silica additive to ensure clot formation.

The one minor change to the technological characteristics is the introduction of a $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ draw BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element K2EDTA Tube as an extension to the BD Trace Element Tube line. This new tube size does not introduce any new questions of safety or effectiveness. The additive types and application methods are unchanged. In alignment with this new size offering, the $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA blood-to-additive ratio for the tubes, which is related to the draw volume to ensure adequate anticoagulation of the sample, remains unchanged. This is technologically equivalent and allows for testing on an anticoagulated sample.

Furthermore, performance testing demonstrates that the modifications do not impact the safety or effectiveness of the device over the indicated shelf life and that the subject BD Trace Element tubes continue to perform as intended.

# Principles of Operation

Both the subject and predicate tubes are used for the collection of venous whole blood for trace element testing. BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element K2EDTA Tubes are designed to provide an anticoagulated sample for trace element testing and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes are designed to ensure clot formation for trace element testing on serum. The principles of operation are unchanged compared to the predicate device.

# 1.17 Performance Testing – Bench Summary

Non-clinical performance testing was conducted following defined protocols and with established acceptance criteria to evaluate the following attributes of the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element K2EDTA Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes at time-zero and over the proposed shelf life: Draw Volume, X-Value, Second Stopper Pullout, Stopper/Shield Separation, Stopper Leakage, Tube Leakage, Breakage Resistance During Centrifugation, Breakage Resistance During Drop Testing, and Trace Metal Content Testing. Additionally, Ship Testing was conducted to assess the functional performance of the packaging materials.

The BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element K2EDTA Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes met all non-clinical testing requirements at time-zero and over the product shelf life, demonstrating that the device functions as designed. These performance tests demonstrate substantial equivalence of the subject devices to the predicate devices.

# 1.18 Performance Testing – Animal Summary

No animal studies were performed in support of this submission.

# 1.19 Performance Testing – Clinical Summary

Clinical testing was conducted on whole blood collected in the subject devices (BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes) and a legally marketed comparator device to demonstrate Clinical Equivalence. Additional clinical testing was completed to evaluate Within-Tube Stability, Shelf-Life Performance, and Repeatability/Reproducibility. Clinical testing results confirmed the devices’ functional clinical equivalence in the identification of clinically relevant levels of Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Lead, Manganese, Mercury, Selenium, and Zinc using these tubes.

Results based on pre-determined acceptance criteria demonstrated the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element K2EDTA Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes are suitable for use in trace element testing.

# 1.20 Conclusion

The technical performance characteristics of the subject device are unchanged. The proposed BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes and predicate devices have the same intended use, principle of operation, and technological characteristics. Non-Clinical and Clinical Performance Testing sufficiently support the determination of substantial equivalence of the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ Tubes and BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Serum Tubes. Based on information provided in this submission the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
