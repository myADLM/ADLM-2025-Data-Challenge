# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K2EDTA Tubes are plastic, evacuated, sterile, single use, in vitro diagnostic medical devices. They are intended to be used in settings where venous blood specimens are collected by trained healthcare professionals for the collection, transportation, and processing of blood in a closed tube. Blood collected in the BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA Tubes are used for trace element testing (e.g., Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Lead, Manganese, Mercury, Selenium, and Zinc).

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Tubes have not been evaluated for other testing applications which use serum or EDTA anticoagulated blood.

BD Vacutainer® Trace Element tubes are controlled only for the trace elements listed within their respective upper limits. Other trace elements may be present, however, these levels have not been evaluated and are not controlled. Users should assess whether the use of these tubes is appropriate for their intended testing purposes.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not applicable.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The BD Vacutainer® Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA Tube is a sterile, plastic, evacuated plastic blood collection tube. It consists of closure assembly, a plastic tube, and $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA coating and is available in two draw sizes, $6 \mathrm { m L }$ ( $1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m m } )$ and $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ $1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 7 5 \mathrm { m m }$ . The plastic tube is manufactured from PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic. The K2EDTA anticoagulant coating is spray-dried on the walls of the tube.

The BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tube is a sterile, plastic, evacuated plastic blood collection tube consisting of a closure assembly, a plastic tube and contains a silica clot activator additive which is spray-dried on the interior walls of the tube. It is available in one draw size, 6 mL ( $1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m m }$ ). The plastic tube is manufactured from PET.

Both types of tubes are closed with a BD Hemogard™ Closure, which consists of a rubber stopper and protective plastic shield to help reduce user exposure to blood. The stopper/closures are color coded in royal blue to reflect that the tubes are intended to collect samples for trace element.

# B Principle of Operation:

The BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K2EDTA and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum tubes use controlled vacuum to pull a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube. Within the serum tube, silica clot activator serves to enhance clot activation of the blood, thus rendering serum samples for trace element testing. The other tube contains K2EDTA, which prevents blood coagulation, thus rendering whole blood or plasma samples for trace element testing.

The tubes are compatible with BD Vacutainer® Blood Collection Needles, Blood Collection Sets, Transfer Devices, Holders and Adapters. Once the vein of the patient has been penetrated using a standard needle, the collection tube is centered in the holder and pushed onto the needle, puncturing the stopper of the tube. Immediately after the blood has been drawn, the tube is gently inverted 8-10 times for $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and 8 times for serum to mix the blood with the additive. For the serum tubes, blood should be allowed to clot for a minimum of 60 minutes before centrifugation, The recommended centrifugation conditions are $1 3 0 0 \mathrm { R C F }$ (relative centrifuge force or g) for 10 minutes.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A study was conducted to evaluate BD Vacutainer® Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ Tubes (6 mL) and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes $\mathrm { ( 6 \ m L ) }$ ) for repeatability (within tube) and reproducibility (lot to lot and tube to tube) performance using lead and zinc as representative trace elements for testing. Two sample matrices, including serum (for zinc testing) and anticoagulated whole blood (for lead testing), were evaluated on two instrument platforms for Zinc and one platform for Lead to confirm tube performance. Three lots of each of the evaluation tubes (BD Vacutainer® Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes) were evaluated.

The first study (whole blood lead testing) was performed using samples collected from 35 subjects. The second study (serum zinc testing) was performed using samples collected from 43 subjects.

The samples were tested for trace elements using atomizing methods, i.e., inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

# a) Shelf-life stability:

Real Time stability testing of the BD Vacutainer® Trace Element $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes showed that the $6 \mathrm { m L }$ BD Vacutainer® Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA Tubes and $6 \mathrm { m L }$ BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes are stable for 12 months ( $6 \mathrm { m L }$ tubes) and the $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ BD Vacutainer® Trace Element

K2EDTA Tubes are stable for 10 months, when stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# b) Analyte stability:

Multiple analyte stability studies were conducted to assess the analyte within tube stability for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Mn, Se and Zn in BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K2EDTA Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes. Stability studies were assessed at initial time (Time 0) and 24 hrs at room temperature storage (for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Mn, Se) and 4 hrs at room temperature storage $( Z \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } )$ .

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim, the within-tube stability was demonstrated in the BD Vacutainer® Trace Element $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes for up to 24 hrs at room temperature storage for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Mn, Se and up to 4 hrs at room temperature storage for Zn.

# c) Clinical Transportation Study:

A study was conducted to assess the analyte within tube stability for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Mn, Se and Zn when exposed to simulated transportation conditions and worst-case room temperature. Conditions evaluated included:

Exposure to vibration and impact simulations that replicate the vibratory and impact loadings which a small parcel (e.g., small box) is expected to experience when shipped via a parcel carrier. Exposure to the upper limit of the labeled temperature of $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The results of the study support that the tubes can be used to transport venous blood sample when subjected to the drop, vibration, temperature and humidity conditions used in this test method. Study protocols and acceptance criteria have been reviewed, and performance was considered acceptable.

The study protocols were reviewed, and performance was considered acceptable.

6. Detection Limit: Not applicable.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not applicable.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A study was conducted to evaluate the Clinical Equivalence of BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Blood Collection Tubes (BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum and K2EDTA) in comparison with Greiner Bio-One Vacuette® Trace Element Blood Collection Tubes (Greiner Bio-One Vacuette® Trace Element Serum and Sodium Heparin) for testing trace elements.

A total of\`159 subjects were enrolled in the study across several study parts. All samples were collected by routine venipuncture into the corresponding candidate tube and also in no additive tubes that were used for the preparation of the contrived samples to obtain results for high levels of trace elements that spanned the analytical measurement range.

Immediately after collection and prior to centrifugation, tubes were inspected for complete fill, clot formation and stopper leakage. After centrifugation, additional visual assessments were performed. Tubes were then handled and processed according to manufacturer’s recommended handling conditions for tube inversions and centrifugation time and force.

The following tube comparisons were performed for clinical equivalence:

▪ 6 mL BD Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ vs $6 \mathrm { m L }$ Greiner Trace Element NaHep ▪ 6 mL BD Trace Element Serum vs 6 mL Greiner Trace Element Serum ▪ 3 mL BD Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA vs $6 \mathrm { m L }$ Greiner Trace Element NaHep ▪ 3 mL BD Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA vs $6 \mathrm { m L }$ BD Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA

Samples collected in the BD Trace Element $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA were analyzed on one ICP-MS instrument platform for testing As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Mn, $\mathrm { H g }$ and Se in anticoagulated whole blood and samples collected in the BD Trace Element Serum were tested for Cr, Cu, Mn, Se and Zn in serum. Biases between tube types at pre-determined medical decision points were estimated with $9 5 \%$ intervals. The mean biases and $9 5 \%$ limit were compared to the clinically acceptable limit (CAL). Data was analyzed using Passing Bablok regression .

Summary of the Passing-Bablok regressions analyses is provided in the table below:
