# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

Modifications to the cleared FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System (with FreeStyle Libre 2 app) to display real-time glucose data via a Bluetooth-enabled Android device without scanning the Sensor.

# B Type of Test:

Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is a real time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device with alarms capability indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 4 and older. It is intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions, unless otherwise indicated.

The System also detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments. Interpretation of the System readings should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time.

The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices. The System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices where the user manually controls actions for therapy decisions.

# C Contraindication(s):

Due to an administrative error, the reference to wear period was erroneously included in the Contraindications section of the previous 510(k) Decision Summary. It is now removed from this section and added to the Special Conditions for Use Statements section below.

The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed loop and insulin suspend systems.

The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could cause incorrect readings.

# D Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The sensor can be worn up to 14 days. Remember to always have your next Sensor available before your current one ends so you can keep getting your glucose readings.

Do not use the System in people less than 4 years of age. The System is not cleared for use in people under 4 years of age.

Do not use the System if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.

The FreeStyle Libre 3 app installed on a phone is intended for use by a single person. It must not be used by more than one person due to the risk of misinterpreting glucose information.

Performance of the System when used with other implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers, has not been evaluated.

Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found in supplements including multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies such as Airborne $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Emergen- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { C } \mathbf { \otimes }$ , may contain high doses of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid and should not be taken while using the Sensor. See your health care professional to understand how long ascorbic acid is active in your body.

Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care professional.

Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the symbol during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor, if your Sensor glucose reading does not match how you feel or if the reading does not include a number.

For you to receive alarms, they must be on and your device should be within 33 feet of you at all times. The transmission range is 33 feet unobstructed. If you are out of range, you may not receive alarms.

If you suspect that the temperature may exceed $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (for example, in an unairconditioned home in summer), you should refrigerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.

Do not force close the App. The App must be running in the background to receive alarms. If you force close the App you will not receive alarms. Re-open the App to ensure you will receive alarms.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The FreeStyle Libre 3 (FSL3) Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide glucose levels, trends, and alerts. The System requires a prescription and is intended for home use. The System consists of the following components: a Sensor which transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a mobile application, FreeStyle Libre 3 App, downloaded to a compatible smartphone running on Android operating system. When used with the FSL 3 sensor cleared under K212132, the proposed mobile app allows the user to activate FSL3 sensors, provides real-time glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose graph) thus allowing the user may make treatment decisions, and connect with cloud-based applications to store and share data (e.g. LibreView).

The device is intended for use in people with diabetes mellitus, age 4 and older. The user downloads the app from the Google Play Store for Android OS.

# Principle of Operation

The FreeStyle Libre 3 System provides the user with real-time glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historic 12-hour glucose results (glucose graph) that are presented on the App. The real-time glucose measurements and glucose arrows are calculated by the Sensor software based upon glucose sampling, also performed by the Sensor.

The Sensor is designed to measure glucose levels in the user’s interstitial fluid through an amperometric electrochemical sensor component. The sensor tail is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue and generates an electrical current via the oxidation of glucose from the interstitial fluid. The FreeStyle Libre 3 System is intended for single patient use. The App can only pair to one Sensor at a time. The Sensor is disposable and may be worn up to 14 days. The Sensor automatically terminates after 14 days of use.

# System Components and Features

Alarms: The FSL3 App can issue the following glucose and system alarms:

• Mandatory Alarms: Urgent Low Glucose, Replace Sensor, Sensor Ended o These alarms cannot be turned off or modified and will always sound regardless of the phone’s sound and vibe or Do Not Disturb (DND) settings. Optional Alarms: Low Glucose Alarm, High Glucose Alarm, Signal Loss Alarm o For the optional alarms above, the Override DND setting is turned on by default; therefore, the user receives these alarms regardless of the phone’s sound, vibe or DND settings. If the user wishes to have the optional alarms follow the phone’s sound and vibe settings, the user must turn off Override DND from the App.

Hardware / Software compatibility: The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use with Field Communication (NFC) and BLE-enabled smartphones running compatible Android operating systems. The FSL3 app is compatible with FSL3 Sensors.

Secondary Viewers: LibreView and LibreLinkUp (LLU) provide a cloud-based repository for glucose measurement data and mobile app that allows caregivers to receive and view glucose data (including glucose alarms) from users who use the FSL3 App with their sensor. Secondary viewers are not intended to be used for immediate clinical decision making.

# Cybersecurity

Abbott Diabetes Care (ADC) has provided cybersecurity risk management documentation for the FreeStyle Libre 3 System that includes analysis of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for data, information and software related to the System. For each identified threat and vulnerability risk event scenario, risk assessment of impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability was performed and documented within the cybersecurity risk management documentation. Risk mitigation controls have been implemented and tested.

ADC provides a comprehensive cybersecurity bill of materials (CBOM) describing third party software components utilized and detailing support status and known vulnerabilities for each offthe-shelf (OTS) software component. In addition, ADC has controls and processes in place to ensure continued support for keeping the device secure and to ensure that the device firmware, software and components are malware free. Additional controls are also in place in manufacturing through distribution to ensure that the medical device firmware and software are malware free from point of origin to the hands of the end user.

# Wireless Coexistence

The FreeStyle Libre 3 System underwent coexistence testing in the presence of common RF interfering devices that are likely to be encountered by users in a home environment. A representative set of devices known to operate in the same frequency band (2.4 GHz) was selected and tested following methods consistent with AAMI TIR69 and ANSI C63.27. The test results showed that the FreeStyle Libre 3 System could tolerate interference generated by these RF interfering devices and still meet the target performance criteria.

Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility

Electrical safety data was leveraged from K212132 as the Sensor has not changed and the app only interacts with the Sensor via NFC and BLE radios on the compatible mobile phone (which independently needs to comply with applicable electrical safety standards).

Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing (radiated emissions, radiated immunity and magnetic field immunity) was performed to verify that the system was able to withstand electromagnetic interference in compliance with IEC 60601-1-2:2014. The FreeStyle Libre 3 System was tested with six (6) compatible smartphones running Android OS. A risk management process was used to evaluate the basic safety and essential performance of the FreeStyle Libre 3 System (with FreeStyle Libre 3 App) per IEC 60601-1:2005(r)2012. Previous testing from K212132 for electrostatic discharge (ESD) and other device EMC aspects is leveraged.

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
