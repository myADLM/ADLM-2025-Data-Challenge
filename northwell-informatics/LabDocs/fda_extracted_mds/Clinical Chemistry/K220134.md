# Device Description Summary

cobas pure integrated solutions   
The cobas pure integrated solutions is a fully automated, random-access, software controlled system intended for in vitro quantitative and qualitative analysis of analytes in body fluids. It will typically be used in low to mid throughput clinical laboratories. The system consolidates clinical chemistry, homogenous and heterogeneous immunoassays as well as electrolyte testing within one workplace. The cobas pure integrated solutions consists of a clinical chemistry analytical unit (cobas c 303) with an integrated 1SE analytical unit, an immunoassay analytical unit (cobas e 402) and a core unit.

Glucose HK Gen. 3 Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) specifically oxidizes G-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH). One micromole of NADH is produced for each micromole of glucose consumed. The NADH produced absorbs light at $3 4 0 \mathsf { n m }$ and can be detected spectrophotometrically as an increased absorbance.

1SE indirect Na for Gen.2

The 1SE analytical unit for Na+ employs ion-selective membrane to develop an electrical potential (electromotive force, EMF) for the measurements of ions in solution. Selective membrane is in contact with both the test solution and an internal filling solution. Due to the selectivity of the membrane, only the ions to be measured contribute to the EMF. The membrane EMF is determined by the difference in concentration of the test ion in the test solution and the internal filling solution.

The 1SE analytical unit of the Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems is intended for the quantitative determination of sodium in serum, plasma or urine using ion-selective electrodes. Sodium is the major extracellular cation and functions to maintain fluid distribution and osmotic pressure. Some causes of decreased levels of sodium include prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, diminished reabsorption in the kidney and excessive fluid retention. Common causes of increased sodium include excessive fluid loss, high salt intake and increased kidney reabsorption.

# ONLINE DAT Methadone II

The Methadone assay is based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a solution (KIMS) as measured by changes in light transmission. In the absence of sample drug, soluble drug conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing the formation of particle aggregates. As the aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence of sample drug, the absorbance increases.

When a urine sample contains the drug in question, this drug competes with the drug derivative conjugate for microparticle-bound antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer available to promote particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited. The presence of sample drug diminishes the increasing absorbance in proportion to the concentration of drug in the sample. Sample drug content is determined relative to the value obtained for a known cutoff concentration of drug.

Elecsys TSH

The Elecsys TSH immunoassay makes use ofa sandwich test principle using monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against human TSH. The antibodies labeled with ruthenium complex) consist of a chimeric construct from human and mouse specific components. Elecsys TSH immunoassay is intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of thyrotropin in human serum and plasma. Measurements of TSH are used in the diagnosis of thyroid and pituitary disorders. It is intended for use on the cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
