BD Vacutainer® Push Button Blood Collection Set (K030573)

# Device Description

The BD Vacutainer® Push Button Blood Collection Set is a sterile, multiple-sample, single-use device used for venipuncture to obtain blood specimens from patients and may be used for the short-term intravenous administration of fluids. The BD Vacutainer® Push Button Blood Collection Set is a winged blood collection set with flexible tubing, a female luer connector and an optional male luer adapter. The BD Vacutainer® Push Button Blood Collection Set also contains a needle protector. The wingset is designed with a safety mechanism to protect against needlesticks. When the button is depressed by the user, the needle fully retracts and is enclosed and locked within the barrel of the device. The retraction of the intravenous (IV) end of the needle aids in the prevention of accidental needlestick injury.

The BD Vacutainer® Push Button Blood Collection Set consists of:

• Stainless steel cannula (Intravenous end and non-patient end of cannula)   
• Stainless steel spring   
• Hub, front and rear barrel   
• Wings (color coded according to needle gauge)   
• Tubing   
• Female luer connector and an optional male luer adapter   
• Intravenous (IV) needle protector (covers the needle before use)   
• Pre-attached holder (connected by male luer adapter in some models)

The intravenous needle of the blood collection set is bonded to one end of the hub. The other end of the hub is bonded to the blood collection set tubing, the end of which is then bonded to a female luer connector with an optional attached male luer adapter. Some models come with a pre-attached holder connected to the male luer adapter for user convenience. A spring is loaded onto the front barrel of the hub. Once the sample is collected, and without removing the needle from the patient vein, the user depresses the raised push button on top of the hub which activates the spring mechanism to automatically retract the needle from the vein into the device. In this retracted (locked) position, the IV point of the needle is fully contained within the body of the device. This will prevent the needle from coming out of the front barrel once it has retracted as well as preventing accidental overriding of the safety feature.

The blood collection set with a male luer adapter contains threads for attachment to a Vacutainer® Brand Needle Holder, and a non-patient cannula for blood collection into evacuated blood collection tubes and/or blood culture bottles. For models without the pre-attached holder, the user is instructed to attach a holder before using the device. The pre-attached holder models come with the BD Vacutainer® Brand Holder pre-attached for user convenience. The non-patient end cannula of the luer adapter has a sleeve that recovers over the cannula to stop blood flow in between collection of multiple tubes.

When used without the male adapter, the device allows the clinician to obtain a blood specimen from the female hub with a syringe, if necessary. The device can be used for short-term, single infusions (up to 2 hours) with consideration given to patient size and appropriateness for the solution being infused.

The proposed indications for use are similar to the predicate indications for use, except for the addition of healthy patients and patients with vascular anatomy and/or co-morbidities which may cause difficulty in locating a vein. Healthy patients and patients with these conditions often exhibit small, fragile, and/or non-palpable veins, commonly referred to as DVA. The addition of DVA in the revised indications for use statement does not significantly change the intended use as butterfly needles have historically been used on patients with small veins and similar statements were included for previous device iterations and were inadvertently removed in subsequent submissions. This is supported by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline GP411 , which states that winged blood collection sets are recommended for accessing smaller, fragile, or difficult-to-locate veins. Additionally, per the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines2 , winged blood collection sets can provide easier access and movement and better precision when drawing blood from patients with small or difficult veins. BD believes that the addition of specific reference to patients with DVA does not raise new questions of safety/effectiveness.

Furthermore, the use of a syringe was part of the instructions for use cleared under K030573, but was unintentionally omitted from the indications for use. The inclusion of the use of a syringe has been added back to the indications for use. Based on this, BD has concluded the use of a syringe with this device is not a new intended use. BD believes this does not raise new questions of safety/effectiveness.

# Substantial Equivalence Discussion:

# Comment #1

The subject device indicates that the intended population is for general use, including a subset of patients who may have difficult veins, whereas the predicate device population is general use. Both devices are used on all patient populations regardless of their vein status. Adding a reference to patients with difficult veins has no effect on clinical safety or effectiveness. This is supported by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline $\mathrm { G P 4 1 ^ { 1 } }$ , which states that winged blood collection sets are recommended for accessing smaller, fragile, or difficult-to-locate veins. Additionally, per the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines2 , winged blood collection sets can provide easier access and movement and better precision when drawing blood from patients with small or difficult veins.

# Comment #2

The subject device is available in models with and without a pre-attached holder. The predicate device is only available in models without the pre-attached holder and requires the user to add a holder in order to use the device for blood collection. Adding models with the pre-attached holder to the subject device is a user convenience and does not affect clinical safety or effectiveness.

# Performance Testing – Animal Summary

Not applicable

# Performance Testing – Clinical Summary

The real-world clinical data of the study submitted as part of this 510(k) indicate that the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set was preferred by phlebotomists when compared to conventional blood collection needles as demonstrated by increased patient and phlebotomist satisfaction with the subject device as compared to a conventional (straight) blood collection needle (Ibarra AF and Villanueva, 2019)4 . Additionally, winged blood collection sets, such as the subject device, were shown to improve venipuncture collection for patients with DVA. The BD

Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set allows healthcare professionals to draw blood from patients with small, fragile, and/or non-palpable veins (DVA) without compromising sample quality as supported by clinical literature (Merrill, 2021)5 . In this study, venipuncture blood draws were collected from a total of 89 oncology outpatients ${ \ge } 1 8$ years of age using the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set or devices similar to the subject device. Chemotherapy impacts the vasculature causing veins to become much smaller, fragile, and difficult to anchor for venous access $( \mathrm { L y n n } , 2 0 1 1 ) ^ { 6 }$ . Specimen quality (LDH, K and plasma free hemoglobin levels) were measured from specimens collected with each winged blood collection set. The results of the study indicate that the devices provided the ability to draw blood from oncology patients, who may have small, fragile and non-palpable veins (DVA), as each device achieved successful blood collections from each patient, and the sample quality was not compromised as LDH, K and plasma free hemoglobin levels were within the normal and acceptable analyte reference ranges (Merrill, $2 0 2 1 ) ^ { \bar { 5 } }$ .

# Conclusion

In summary, the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set has the same intended use as its predicate device. In addition, the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set has the same technological characteristics and principles of operation as its predicate. The clinical literature sufficiently supports the determination that patients with DVA (small, fragile and nonpalpable veins) is a subset of the current patient population for the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Push Button Blood Collection Set. The risk profile of patients with small, fragile, and/or non-palpable veins is not substantially different from that of the general patient population and is supported by the clinical literature evidence presented under this submission. Furthermore, the changes made to the device since K030573, do not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness because they do not alter the device’s diagnostic/therapeutic purpose, blood collection functionality, mechanism of action, or method of use. Performance testing confirms that the subject device performs as intended and is as safe and effective as the predicate device. Based on information provided in this submission the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
