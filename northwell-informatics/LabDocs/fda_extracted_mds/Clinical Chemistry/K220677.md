Dear Neal Hartman:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part

801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

Device Name Kurin Blood Culture Collection Set with Kurin Lock Technology

Indications for Use (Describe)   
The Kurin Blood Culture Collection Set is intended to obtain blood samples through the patient's vasculature via venipuncture or Peripheral IV (PIV) access. As it enters the Kurin Lock, blood initially fills a side   
channel then flows into the sample collection device (syringe or bottle) via an adjoining sampling channel to reduce blood culture contamination rates\*.

When supplied with a pressure-rated extension set, the pressure-rated extension set is intended to be utilized separately with infusions systems to administer IV fluids, medications, blood and blood products into the patient's vascular system and may be safely used with power injectors at pressures up to 325 psi.

\*The Kurin Blood Collection System is for use as a blood collection system and its Kurin Lock allows the specimen of blood from the patient to be sidelined prior to the collection of the test sample to reduce the frequency of blood culture contamination when contaminates are present in the initial blood sample compared to blood cultures drawn using standard practice without the Kurin Lock.

# Purpose of Pre-Market Notification

To incorporate the blood culture contamination reduction claim in the indication for use statement.

# Device Description

The Kurin Blood Culture Collection Set is a sterile, single-use device that includes a vasculature connection (i.e., winged needle, male luer connection), flexible tubing, blood lock mechanism, and blood culture bottle holder (when supplied). The blood culture bottle holder varies between device models. Refer to the primary labeling for the compatible culture bottle.

The Subject Device is intended to be used with the adult and pediatric population. The main purpose of the Subject Device is to obtain blood samples by transferring from the patient to a culture bottle or collection container.

Venipuncture sets incorporate a needle-safe feature that covers the needle prior to disposal to aid in the prevention of needlestick injury if activated after the blood draws. Venipuncture needles include 21 and 23 gauge.

Various Peripheral IV (PIV) sets incorporate a pressure-rated extension set with slide clamp that, when detached from the blood culture collection set, can be used for infusion purposes.

The unique technology with the Subject Device is the blood lock mechanism (i.e., Kurin Lock). Upon access to the patient’s vasculature, the Subject Device uses the patient’s blood pressure to push an initial portion of blood that could contain bacterial contaminants (e.g., skin plugs) into the side channel. After the side channel is filled, flow stops until a collection device (i.e., blood culture bottle, vacutainer tube, syringe) is attached. The attachment of a collection device draws additional blood through the Subject Device and into the collection device. The initial portion of blood in the side channel is not isolated from this additional incoming blood, the amount of contamination reaching the collection device is dramatically reduced.

# Summary of Evaluations Performed

The following evaluations were conducted to support the blood culture contamination claim for the Subject Device in this submission:

Scientific Literature Review o “Innovation for Reducing Blood Culture Contamination: Initial Specimen Diversion Technique” Richard G. Patton ▪ Diversion devices were not utilized in the documented study ▪ Provides information on skin/tissue fragments created during venipuncture contain microbial contaminants that are present in initial specimen volume Does not identify the absolute minimum effective volume for blood contamination rates reduction Significant improvement in contamination with a volume of $\ge 0 . 5$ , $\leq 2 \mathsf { m } |$ was with a 16-gauge needle, which has approximately 5 times greater volume than a 21-GA needle: one should expect less contamination with the smaller 21-GA needle. o “Asynchronous Testing Of 2 Specimen diversion - Devices to Reduce Blood Culture Contamination: A Single-Site Product Supply Quality Improvement Project” Monica Arenas Conducted at Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (CTVHCS) between November 2017 to February 2019, where a total of 4300 blood samples were taken between the control and two (2) blood culture– diversion devices. Device A is manufactured by Magnolia Medical Technologies and isolates the first $1 { \cdot } 2 \ m \lfloor$ of blood and Device B is manufactured by Kurin, Inc. and passively diverts less than $0 . 1 5 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ of blood. The control was blood sampling without a blood culture-diversion device. Model estimated that the mean incidence of contaminated draws per month in the device A group was 0.29 (0.14-0.55) times the incidence of contaminated draws in the control group. The estimated mean incidence of contaminated draws in device B group was 0.23 (0.13-0.37) times the incidence of contaminated draws in the control group. Evaluation demonstrates equivalent performance between the Magnolia’s diversion device and the Subject Device, as it relates to blood contamination rate reduction.
