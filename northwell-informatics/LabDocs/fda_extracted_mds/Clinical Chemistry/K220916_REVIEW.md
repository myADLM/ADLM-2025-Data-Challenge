E Purpose for Submission: New device

II Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The iLet Dosing Decision Software is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps. A self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) meter may also be used for manual input of blood glucose values to continue insulin dosing for a limited period of time when input from the iCGM is temporarily not available.

The iLet Dosing Decision Software autonomously determines and commands an increase, decrease, maintenance, or suspension of all basal doses of insulin and autonomously determines and commands correction doses of insulin based on input from an iCGM, and it autonomously determines and commands meal doses of insulin based on meal announcements.

iLet Dosing Decision Software is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in people 6 years of age or older. iLet Dosing Decision Software is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx – For prescription use only.

Do not use the iLet Dosing Decision Software if you are unable or unwilling to test blood glucose (BG) levels with an SMBG meter when input from the iCGM is not available.

Do not use the iLet Dosing Decision Software if you are unable or unwilling to recognize and respond to iLet safety alerts.

Do not use the iLet System if you are taking hydroxyurea, also known as Hydrea. This medication is sometimes used in the treatment of blood disorders and some kinds of cancer. The use of hydroxyurea can result in falsely elevated sensor glucose readings. The iLet System relies on sensor glucose readings to adjust insulin, provide insulin doses, and provide high and low glucose alerts. If the iLet System receives sensor readings that are higher than actual glucose levels, it could result in missed hypoglycemia alerts and potential errors in diabetes management, such as too much insulin being delivered. Hydroxyurea can also result in errors when reviewing, analyzing, and interpreting historical patterns for assessing glucose control.

Do not use the iLet ACE Pump and Dosing Decision Software in people under 6 years of age.   
The iLet ACE Pump and Dosing Decision Software have not been studied in these populations.

Do not use the iLet Dosing Decision Software in people who are pregnant, on dialysis or critically ill. The iLet Dosing Decision Software has not been studied in these populations.

The system should NOT be used in hospitalized people as the safety of the technology has not been evaluated in this population.

The iLet Dosing Decision Software is only for use with insulin U-100 lispro (Humalog), insulin U-100 aspart (Novolog), or insulin U-100 aspart (Fiasp).

Do not use the iLet Dosing Decision Software with the U-100 Fiasp in individuals under 18 years of age. The iLet Dosing Decision Software has not been studied with the U-100 Fiasp in these populations.

The iLet Dosing Decision Software is only for use with the Dexcom G6 iCGM. When using the iLet device, wear an iCGM.

Remove the iLet device, steel infusion set, CGM sensor, and CGM transmitter before undergoing radiation therapy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or diathermy treatment procedures. Exposure of the iLet device, steel infusion set, CGM sensor, or CGM transmitter to any of these may damage them.

Do not expose your iLet device, steel infusion set, CGM transmitter, or CGM sensor to equipment used in procedures for Pacemaker/Automatic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (AICD) placement or reprogramming, Cardiac Catheterization, or Nuclear Stress Test.

The iLet Go App is compatible with the iOS platform. The iLet Go App provides the ability to perform over-the-air updates and / or pull data from an iLet device to share with the Beta Bionics Cloud. The iLet Go App is not currently compatible with Android or other platforms.

If your CGM is offline for an extended period of time, dosing will stop and you should switch to alternative therapy until you are able to reconnect to a CGM sensor. A countdown timer will appear before dosing would stop.

# III Device Description

The iLet Dosing Decision software is part of the iLet Bionic Pancreas and is intended for use by people with diabetes. The iLet Dosing Decision software works in conjunction with a compatible alternate controller enabled (ACE) pump. The iLet Dosing Decision Software requires initialization with the user’s body mass (body weight), as well as meal announcements. When initiating a meal announcement with the iLet Dosing Decision Software, the user qualitatively approximates carbohydrate content (meal size) relative to the usual carbohydrate content for each of the three meal types (breakfast, lunch, or dinner). The iLet Dosing Decision Software autonomously determine the size of the insulin dose in response to a meal announcement by the user.

The iLet Dosing Decision software works to control glucose to a user-set glucose target of “lower” $\mathrm { 1 1 0 \ m g / d L }$ , “usual” ( $[ 1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , or “higher” $\mathrm { 1 3 0 m g / d L } )$ ) within the device settings. Users can also set glucose targets specific for sleep.

The iLet Dosing Decision software also includes a feature, called “BG-Run mode”, which enables the device to continue insulin delivery in the event CGM-data is unavailable. Use of the feature, however, should be temporary and always for the shortest duration possible, with the goal to resume CGM-guided insulin dosing as soon as possible.

The sponsor conducted an ancillary study after the conclusion of the RTC to evaluate the safety of utilizing BG values obtained by fingerstick instead of CGM as input into the iLet System. Fifty-four subjects (43 adults and 11 pediatrics) participated in the ancillary-phase of the study. Median time using BG measurements as input for the iLet System was 49.5 hours, with all participants having at least 46.5 hours of continued BG-run mode use. Median number of BG measurements entered during the first 24 hours was 9 and during the second 24 hours was 10. There were no incidences of severe hypoglycemia, DKA, or other serious adverse events (SAEs). Results of the ancillary study indicated that the frequency of lowsensor glucose events during the BG-run period appeared similar to the pre-randomization period and the RCT period, and the frequency of high-sensor glucose events during the BGrun period appeared higher than in the RCT-period.

# 2. Human Factors Testing

Human factors validation tests were conducted with the iLet Dosing Decision Software installed on the iLet ACE insulin pump (K223846). The summative human factors validation study was performed with 60 total users (45 primary users and 15 secondary users). All study participants received training that was consistent with the training that patients would receive with the commercial product. Usability evaluations assessed comprehension and usability of the device for critical device tasks. Results of the study demonstrated that the device could be used safely by intended users in the intended use environment when used in combination with a digitally connected device.

# 3. Insulin Compatibility

The iLet Dosing Decision Software used with the iLet Bionic Pancreas System is designed to use rapid-acting U-100 insulins including: NovoLog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin aspart), Humalog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro), and Fiasp $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin aspart). These insulins were used in the pivotal clinical study for this device and no other insulins have been tested for use with the device.

# 4. Data Logging

Software verification testing has demonstrated the device records timestamped critical events, including information related to its state, user inputs, and device settings, as required by the special controls.

# 5. Interoperability

A plan and approach for interoperability were provided according to the FDA Guidance “Design Considerations and Pre-market Submission Recommendations for Interoperable Medical Devices - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff” (issued on September 6, 2017) and determined to be adequate to support and clearly specify expectations, requirements, and interface specifications to potential interoperable devices. In addition, the plans provided by the sponsor covered their approach to working with connected device companies regarding contractual issues, interfaces for data communication and exchange, and post-market reporting procedures and responsibilities (e.g., who is responsible for investigating and reporting complaints, malfunctions, and adverse events).

The sponsor additionally provided validated software protocols intended to ensure secure, accurate, and reliable communication with digital interfacing devices, as well as failsafe design features to mitigate the risks associated with interruption of communication with digitally connected devices. These protocols were reviewed and found to be adequate.

# 6. Cybersecurity

Detailed information on cybersecurity of the device was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor also provided a software bill of materials, which provided details on all software used in the device and the hardware platform that the device was installed on. This included all manufacturer-developed, commercially licensed, open source, and off-theshelf software components (including firmware as relevant), along with an identification of the hardware runtime environment in which each resides, with relevant version and/or model information, as well as details on whether each component was actively supported by its manufacturer or legacy licensed.

# 7. Postmarket Surveillance Study

There is uncertainty remaining regarding the risk/benefit profile of the device when used in the broader intended use population. While the premarket clinical study provided to support the $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ showed some benefits, it was not adequately powered to assess differences in the rates of safety events (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia). Accordingly, a postmarket surveillance study will be ordered by FDA to confirm understanding of safety.

# VII Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

# VIII Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
