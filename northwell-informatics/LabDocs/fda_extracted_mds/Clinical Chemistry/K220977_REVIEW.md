# B Principle of Operation:

# ISE Reagents

The Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) module for $\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ , $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ , and Cl- measurement employs crown ether membrane electrodes for sodium and potassium and a molecular oriented PVC membrane for chloride that are specific for each ion of interest in the sample. An electrical potential is developed according to the Nernst Equation for a specific ion. When compared to the Internal Reference Solution, this electrical potential is translated into voltage and then into the ion concentration of the sample.

# Glucose

In this procedure, glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) specifically oxidizes G-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $( \mathrm { N A D ^ { + } } )$ to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced (NADH). The change in absorbance at $3 4 0 / 6 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample.

# CRP Latex

The CRP Latex reagent is an in vitro diagnostic device that consists of ready to use buffer and latex particles coated with rabbit anti-CRP antibodies. Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape, and concentration. Turbidimeters measure the reduction of incident light due to reflection, absorption or scatter. In this procedure, the measurement of the rate of decrease in light intensity transmitted (increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution is the result of complexes formed during the immunological reaction between the CRP of the patient serum and rabbit anti-CRP-antibodies covered on latex particles.

The same CRP Latex reagent have two different applications on the instrument: Normal Application (CRP concentrations ranging between $5 . 0 { - } 4 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ) and Highly Sensitive (Cardiac) Application (CRP concentrations ranging between $0 . 2 \mathrm { - } 8 0 \mathrm { m g / L ) }$ ).These two applications require separate calibrators and instrument workflows.

2. Linearity:

Linearity studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP- $0 6 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Edition guideline. For each analyte per specimen type, equally spaced samples were prepared by mixing high and low concentration sample pools to cover the claimed measuring range. Each sample was measured in four replicates on one (1) DxC 500 AU Clinical Chemistry Analyzer using one (1) reagent lot. The data were analyzed using weighted least square regression and the regression results are summarized in the table below:

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP07, $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ Edition guideline. Common endogenous substances were evaluated for each candidate assay to determine the potential interference effects to the assay performance.

For each assay type, samples at high and low concentrations were prepared (see table below) and each sample was further divided into two aliquots: test samples (with added interference substances) and control samples (without interference substances). Each sample was assayed in five (5) replicates. The results of the spiked samples were compared to the results of nonspiked samples for each assay. At the following concentrations, the percentage difference was less than $\pm 1 0 \%$ between the test samples results and control samples results.

Sixteen (16) commonly used drugs were assessed for potential exogenous interference for the CRP latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) and the CRP latex (normal application). The exogenous substances were tested at approximately three (3) times the peak therapeutic concentrations as recommended by the CLSI EP37 guideline. Samples with three (3) analyte levels were divided into paired control samples (without interference substances) and test samples (with interference substances). Each test sample and control sample was assayed in 5 replicates with two (2) lot of reagents and calibrators on one DxC 500AU Analyzer. The results of the test samples were compared to the results of the control samples. At the following concentrations, the percent difference between the results of the spiked samples compared to the results of the control samples was less than $\pm 4 \%$ .

The following is a new limitation for the Glucose reagent:

“Eltrombopag and its metabolites may interfere with this assay causing erroneously high patient results.”

The other limitations remain the same as described in K161837.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

Assays reportable ranges are described in the linearity section (VII.A.2 above).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The traceability of the ISE Reagents and Glucose is unchanged (cleared in K921718 and K043460, respectively).

CRP Latex: Assay is traceable to ERM DA472/IFCC.

# 6. Detection Limit:

Detection limit studies were designed in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the Glucose assay, the CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) and the CRP Latex (normal application) were determined by running replicate measurements on blank and low-level samples across multiple days using two (2) reagent lots on one DxC 500 AU Analyzer, with each lot evaluated separately for each parameter. Per assay and specimen type, a total of 72 blank replicates were generated per reagent lot (4 blank samples ran in replicates of 6 for 3 days) to determine the LoB. For LoD and LoQ determinations, 250 low-level sample replicates were generated per Glucose assay specimen type per reagent lot (10 low-level samples ran in replicates of 5 for 5 days), 325 low-level sample replicates were generated for the CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) per reagent lot (13 low-level samples ran in replicates of 5 for 5 days), and 500 low-level sample replicates were generated for the CRP Latex (normal application) per reagent lot (10 low-level samples ran in replicates of 10 for 5 days). The LoB was determined following the classic approach and the LoD and LoQ were determined following the precision profile approach described in the guideline. The sponsor defines the LoQ as the lowest concentration with a within-laboratory precision of $\leq$

$20 \%$ CV. The claimed LoB, LoD, and LoQ are the highest estimates across the two (2) lots. The detection limits for glucose, CRP latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) and CRP latex (normal application) are summarized below:

The lower limits of the measuring range for the ISE Reagents $( \mathrm { N a } ^ { + } , \mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ , Cl - ) are supported by the linearity studies.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not applicable.

8. Accuracy (Instrument): Refer to the method comparison study.

9. Carry-Over:

Carry-over study was performed for the CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) with the DxC 500AU contamination parameters that provide additional cleaning of the sample probe before and after each CRP sample is tested. The study supports the carry-over information provided in the CRP assay Instruction-for-Use.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Method comparison studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP09c guideline comparing the results from the candidate devices to the predicate devices. A minimum of 100 samples with analyte concentrations within the claimed analytical ranges were evaluated for the ISE Reagents, Glucose, CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) and CRP Latex (normal application) for each sample type respectively. Each sample was assayed in duplicate by the candidate method and the comparator method on the same day. Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed using the first replicate result only, and results are summarized in the table below.

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

ISE reagents (Na+, K+, Cl- ):

A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate the equivalence between serum and plasma samples when measuring sodium, potassium and chloride on the DxC 500 Analyzer. Each study utilized freshly drawn paired serum and plasma samples from over forty (40) donors. Less than $20 \%$ of the total samples were altered by diluting or spiking in order to cover the claimed measuring range.

# Glucose :

A matrix comparison study was performed on the $\mathrm { D x C }$ AU 500 Analyzer to evaluate the performance of K2EDTA, $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA, Fluoride Oxalate, and Lithium Heparin plasma samples compared to serum samples for the Glucose test. Fifty-nine (59) paired samples were evaluated for each combination and less than $1 6 \%$ of the total samples were altered to cover the entire claimed measurement range. For each set of samples, only one measurement was obtained for the evaluation tube and one measurement for the serum sample control.

# CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application)

Matrix comparison studies were performed on the DxC AU 500 Analyzer to evaluate the performance of $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA, $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA and Lithium Heparin plasma samples versus serum samples on the CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application). Forty-six (46) paired samples were evaluated for each combination and less than $7 \%$ of the total samples were altered. For each set of samples, only one measurement was obtained for the evaluation tube and one measurement for the serum sample control. Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed. The results support the use of $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA, K3 EDTA, lithium heparin plasma samples on the candidate CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application).

# CRP Latex (normal application)

Matrix comparison studies were performed on the DxC AU 500 Analyzer to evaluate the performance of $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA, $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA and Lithium Heparin plasma samples versus serum samples for the CRP Latex (normal application). Forty (40) paired samples were evaluated for each combination. For each set of samples, only one measurement was obtained for the evaluation tube and one measurement for the serum sample control. Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed. The results support the use of $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA, $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA, and lithium heparin plasma samples on the candidate CRP Latex (normal application).
