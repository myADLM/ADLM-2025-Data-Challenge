# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

For in vitro diagnostic use (for use outside of the body only). This test is not CLIA Waived and should not be used in CLIA Waived environments.   
• Not for patients undergoing tight glycemic control. Not for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Not for use on patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy. Not for use in acute care, nursing facilities, skilled nursing facilities or hospital settings. The system is not for pediatrics under 18 years old. Do not use to test neonates. The XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System has not been validated for neonatal use.   
• Severe dehydration and excessive water loss may cause readings which are lower than actual values. The device should not be used on severely hypotensive individuals. This system should not be used in patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy because of the potential for preanalytical collection error and specifically in patients with decreased peripheral blood flow, as it may not reflect the true physiological state when test

results are generated using capillary whole blood samples. Examples include, but are not limited to, severe hypotension, coma, shock, hyperosmolar-hyperglycemia (with or without ketosis), impaired peripheral circulation, and severe dehydration.

The system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices when performing a fresh capillary whole blood sample from the fingertip.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Meter

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the handheld XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Meter and the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips. The TaiDoc Blood Glucose Control Solutions (Levels Y1, W2, B3) are sold separately.

# B Principle of Operation:

The XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is designed to quantitatively measure the amount of blood sugar (glucose) in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertips. The blood sample is pulled into the test strip by capillary action. The glucose measurement is based on the amperometry achieved with the glucose dehydrogenase enzyme (GDH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent based chemistry. The glucose in the sample reacts with GDH to produce electrons that are transferred to the electrodes via FAD and a mediator. The resulting electric current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. After the reaction the meter calculates the detected current and reports the glucose concentration in plasma equivalents.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Meter

2. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary fingerstick whole blood. The blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The detection of the calibration code is automatic.

5. Quality Control:

Three levels of TaiDoc Blood Glucose Control Solutions (Y1, W2, B3) are available for use with the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Instructions on how to order control solutions, and when to perform a control solution test are included in the labeling. The acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip bottle or on the bottom of the test strip box. The meter automatically recognizes and flags the test result in the memory as a control solution test result. The user is cautioned not to use the meter and to contact the customer support if the control result falls outside the ranges printed on the test strip vial label.

This medical device product has functions subject to FDA premarket review as well as functions that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, if the product has functions that are not subject to FDA review, FDA assessed those functions only to the extent that they either could adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to FDA premarket review or they are included as a labeled positive impact that was considered in the assessment of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.

The results of the study support linearity of the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System across the claimed measuring range of 10 to $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If the concentration of a sample is less than $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as “Lo”. If a sample exceeds $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as “Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference testing was conducted to evaluate the effect of common endogenous substances and exogenous substances expected in the intended use population on the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Additional potential interferents were included in the testing following a detailed analysis of medications and medical conditions of the subjects evaluated in the method comparison study (see Section VII.C.3 below). The study was conducted by spiking 58 exogenous and endogenous substances into venous whole blood adjusted to three glucose levels (50 to 70, 110 to 130, and 225 to $2 7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; as measured by the laboratory comparator method). Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool, with the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering

substances added to the test pool. The $\%$ bias was calculated from the difference between the test sample and the control sample using the mean of replicates for each of the 3 strip lots tested. The highest tested concentration for each substance at which no significant interference was observed (defined by the sponsor as a bias for the test sample within $10 \%$ of the control mean) is summarized in the following table:

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

1. Hematocrit Study:

The effect of hematocrit on the performance of the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 20 to $70 \%$ (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 42, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and $70 \%$ ), and at 7 glucose concentrations (10 to 30, 31 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to 400, and 600 to $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). The results obtained with the candidate system were compared to those obtained with the laboratory comparator method. The results of the study demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 10 to $70 \%$ .

2. Altitude Study:

A simulated high-altitude study was conducted in a pressure chamber to simulate the effects of 4 altitudes from sea level (0 ft) and high-altitude (15,000 ft) on the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples adjusted to 7 glucose concentrations ranging from 62 to $5 8 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The results of obtained with the candidate system were compared to those obtained with the laboratory comparator method.

The results support the claims that the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System blood glucose monitoring system functions as intended at altitudes up to the claimed altitude of 15,000 ft.

# 3. System Operating Conditions:

To evaluate device performance over varying operating temperature and humidity conditions, venous whole blood samples were adjusted to 3 glucose levels (65, 125, and $3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Testing was conducted under 4 combinations of temperature and relative humidity (RH) including $1 1 7 \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } F } }$ $( 4 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $4 3 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ $( 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $8 \%$ and $92 \%$ RH, and under the nominal condition of $7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ at $60 \%$ RH. The results obtained with the candidate system were compared to those obtained with the comparator method. The results support the claims in the labeling that the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System blood glucose monitoring system can be used in conditions of 46 to $1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (8 to $4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) with relative humidity of $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ .

# 4. Sample Volume Study:

The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ for the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples with 3 glucose concentration ranges (50 to 65, 100 to 120 and 200 to 250 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ were tested at six sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and $0 . 8 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) using three lots of test strips. Values obtained were compared to the comparator method. The sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that with blood volumes below $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , the insufficient sample volume error message functioned as intended. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ for the system.

# 5. Flex Studies:

The following additional flex studies were performed with the candidate system: drop/shock, early test strip removal, intermittent sampling, sample outside measuring range, sample perturbation, shipping, used test strips, incorrect test strips and vibration testing. The results demonstrated that the performance of the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is robust under these expected use conditions.

6. Infection Control Testing:

The device is intended for multiple-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the exterior meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory, demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Clorox HealthcareTM Bleach Germicidal Wipe (EPA No.: 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after 27,500 cycles of cleaning and disinfection using the chosen disinfectant. The robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning and disinfection over the 5-year multi-patient use life of the meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
