IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description: ALFIS-3 Analyzer

The ALFIS-3 Analyzer is an automated, fluorometric analyzer intended to perform in vitro diagnostic tests on clinical specimens. The system is intended for quantitative analysis of body fluids.

# ALFIS Vitamin D

The ALFIS Vitamin D test kit is comprised of 24 ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridges, 1 ALFIS Vitamin D test ID Chip, 24 pipette tips, and 24 magnetic tips.

ALFIS Vitamin D Test Cartridge

The ALFIS Vitamin D Test Cartridge is a disposable, self-contained, unitized device which houses the magnetic bead, antibody-alkaline phosphatase-conjugator, sample diluent, diethanolamine, 4-Methylumbelliferyl phosphate, and washing buffer. Cartridges are provided in individually sealed aluminum pouches. The magnetic bead well contains one lyophilized magnetic bead which is conjugated with streptavidin and Vitamin D antibody-biotin complex.

ALFIS Vitamin D Test ID Chip   
ALFIS Vitamin D Test ID Chip is a lot-specific electronic memory device. Each lot-specific Vitamin D Test ID chip contains an encoded master calibration curve data/equation which is meant to compensate for the lot-to-lot variation in ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridges on test results. Apart from the lot-specific calibration curve the ALFIS Vitamin D test ID chip also contains other information such as name of the test, test cartridge, lot number, expiry date, reportable ranges etc.

Materials required, but not supplied: ALFIS-3 Analyzer, ALFIS Vitamin D Calibrators, ALFIS Vitamin D Controls.

# B Principle of Operation:

The ALFIS Vitamin D assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescence immunoassay. To quantitatively measure total 25-hydroxyvitamin D in human serum or plasma, a magnetic tip and pipette tip provided with the test kit are inserted into the designated sites on the analyzer. The sample (100 $\mu \mathrm { L } )$ ) is added to the sample well. The test cartridge is inserted into the analyzer and the following steps are performed automatically within the instrument: an antibody is labeled with an alkaline phosphatase enzyme and other reagents are conjugated with a magnetic bead. Upon interaction between antigen and enzyme-labeled antibody, a substrate is added, and fluorescence product is formed by catalytic action of enzyme. The obtained fluorescence intensity of a substrate is proportional to the amount of analyte. ALFIS-3 uses an amplified photodetector (APD) module for the measurement of UV light intensity as a light detector. The fluorescent light is collected with together the scattered UV light. Pure fluorescence is filtered from the scattered UV and fluorescent light. The exact fluorescence intensity is measured by APD module and converted into the relative fluorescence ratio (RFR) which is correlated with the concentration of target analytes in the sample. The on-board microprocessor computes the concentration of the analyte in the test sample based on proprietary software. Computed and converted test result are displayed on the display screen of the ALFIS-3.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: ALFIS-3 Analyzer

2. Specimen Identification:

Human serum, Lithium heparin and Sodium heparin samples are identified by the lot specific barcode that identifies the lot number of the ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridge while it undergoes scanning in the ALFIS-3 analyzer.

Specimen Identification can be done by writing patient ID on the space labeled Patient ID on the sample cartridge. The lot specific barcode signifies the identity and lot number of the ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridge while it undergoes scanning in the ALFIS-3 analyzer.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This sample is loaded into the sample well of the ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridge. An opening at the right end of the cartridge housing acts as the “scanning well’ as the sample loaded test cartridge undergoes scanning in ALFIS-3 analyzer after automated pipettingmixing steps and reactions as part of the assay.

The sample handling system consists of the ALFIS vitamin D test cartridge, the magnetic tip, and the pipette tip. The pipette tip is inserted into the pipette tip hole and dispenses washing buffer from the washing buffer well, into the magnetic bead well.

2. Linearity:

The linearity performance of the ALFIS vitamin D assay on the ALFIS-3 analyzer was established in a study conducted following the recommendations of CLSI guideline EP06-A. Two sample panels were prepared: in the first panel, 10 samples were prepared by intermixing a serum sample spiked with a high concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with a depleted, low analyte serum sample to cover a range of 13 to $1 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . In the second panel, 9 serum samples were prepared by intermixing a serum sample spiked with a low concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with a depleted, low analyte serum sample to cover a range of 1.3 to $1 1 . 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each sample was assayed in triplicate using one lot of ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridges and one ALFIS-3 analyzer. The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring interval of ${ 6 { \cdot } 1 0 0 \ n g / \mathrm { m L } }$ .

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Endogenous Interferences:

Potential interference from endogenous substances was evaluated. For each interfering substance, pooled native serum samples with concentrations representing low, middle, and high vitamin D were tested. An aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substances. Each sample was measured in triplicate using one lot of ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridge on one ALFIS-3 analyzer. The following substances were tested up to the levels indicated and demonstrated no significant interference $( \leq 1 0 \% )$ .

# Exogenous Interference:

Interference was assessed using serum samples representing low $( \mathrm { { \sim } 1 2 \mathrm { { - } 1 5 \ n g / m L ) } }$ , middle $\left( { \sim } 3 5 { - } 3 7 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } \right)$ , and high $\left( \sim 6 8 \mathrm { - } 7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } \right)$ concentrations of vitamin D. Each of the samples (without any added interferent) acted as control samples. To evaluate potential interference, test samples for each interferent were prepared by adding specified concentration of the respective interferent to the serum samples. The results were analyzed as percent recovery between the test sample and the control sample. The substance was considered to have no significant interference if the recovery was $90 { - } 1 1 0 \%$ .

The following limitation statement is included in the labeling:

Endogenous alkaline phosphatase and exogenous alkaline phosphatase (e.g., asfotase alfa, Strensiq) are capable of binding to alkaline phosphatase and may cause erroneous results. Carefully evaluate results if the sample is suspected of having these types of interferences.

# Cross-reactivity

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of the assay with other vitamin D metabolites. In the study, three test samples were prepared by adding specified concentrations of the respective cross-reactant to 25 hydroxyvitamin D-spiked serum samples containing low, medium, and high concentrations of 25 hydroxyvitamin D. Control and test samples were tested in replicates of five with one lot of ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridge on one ALFIS- 3 analyzer. Cross-reactivity was evaluated in terms of percent cross-reactivity in presence of the concentrations of respective potential cross-reactants/structural analog of 25- hydroxyvitamin-D mentioned below. Percent cross-reactivity was determined using the following formula:

Cross-reactivity $( \% ) =$ [(average of test sample measurements - average of control sample measurements) / concentration of the potential cross-reactants] $\textbf { x } 1 0 0$ .

Limit of Blank (LoB)

The LoB of the assay was evaluated using four (4) Vitamin D-depleted serum samples that were measured in replicates of six (6) with three lots of test cartridges over three successive days for a total of 72 blanks per lot. The LoB was calculated by the nonparametric analysis at the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile. The highest LoB of the three lots was found to be $1 . 8 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , supporting the claimed limit of blank of $1 . 8 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Limit of Detection (LoD)

The LoD was evaluated by testing 4 low level spiked serum samples using three lots of test cartridges on three analyzers (1 lot per analyzer) for 3 successive days. Each sample was measured in 5 replicates for a total of 60 measurements per lot. The LoD was calculated by parametric analysis which was the lowest concentration of which the analyte can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. The claimed LoD is $3 . 7 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Limit of Quantification (LoQ)

The LoQ was evaluated using 5 low level spiked serum samples using three lots of test cartridges on three analyzers (1 lot/analyzer). Each sample was tested in replicates of four across each lot on 3 successive days for a total of 36 replicates per sample. The data was visually inspected to find out the lowest concentration of analyte which has imprecision less than or equal to $20 \%$ CV. The LoQ of the assay was found to be $6 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with inter-assay $C V < 2 0 \%$ .
