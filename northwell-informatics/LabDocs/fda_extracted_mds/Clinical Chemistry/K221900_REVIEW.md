# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is a small automatic blood gas analyzer for laboratory and point of care settings. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator packs, auto-cartridge quality control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials (external controls) and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens may be identified by scanning a barcode or by manually entering the information via the touchscreen.

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer was previously cleared for use by healthcare professionals in clinical laboratory settings and for point-of-care usage for quantitative determination of pH, pCO2, pO2, Hematocrit, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Ionized Calcium, Ionized Magnesium,

Glucose, Lactate, Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Oxygen Saturation, Total Hemoglobin, Oxyhemoglobin, Carboxyhemoglobin, Methemoglobin, and Deoxyhemoglobin in heparinized arterial and venous whole blood. Those claims have not changed. In this submission, the use by healthcare professionals in clinical laboratory settings and for point-of-care usage for quantitative determination of pH, Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (pCO2), Partial Pressure of Oxygen (pO2), Hematocrit, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Ionized Calcium, Ionized Magnesium, Glucose, and Lactate in heparinized capillary whole blood is being added.

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not reporting them) are determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards, for which there are two options:

• Primary Sensor Card 1 reports the following analytes: pO2, pCO2, pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl, K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO2, O2Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb, tBil, HbF

• Primary Sensor Card 2 reports the following analytes: pO2, pCO2, pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl, K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO2

Auxiliary Sensor Card Port:

The reporting of Creatinine and BUN parameters (or not reporting them) is determined by the selection of the Auxiliary Sensor Card   
• Auxiliary Sensor Card 1 enables Creatinine and BUN parameters   
• Auxiliary Sensor Card 2 is a “dummy” sensor card and does not report any parameters.

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is a blood gas, co-oximetry, electrolyte, chemistry, and hematology analyzer with an enhanced test menu and multiple quality control options. Both traditional internal and external quality control is available, as well as an on-board Quality Management System (QMS), and an electronic monitoring approach to ensure the analyzer is working properly at all times. The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer accepts samples from syringes, open blood collection tubes, and capillary tubes. The end user selects which analytes are to be tested from the test menu on the analyzer display screen.

# B Principle of Operation:

$\mathsf { p H }$ is measured using a hydrogen ion selective glass membrane. One side of the glass is in contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of unknown $\mathsf { p H }$ . A change in potential develops which is proportional to the $\mathsf { p H }$ difference of these solutions. This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant potential. The magnitude of the potential difference is a measure, then, of the $\mathsf { p H }$ of the unknown solution.

pCO2 is measured with a modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the unknown solution makes contact with a gas permeable membrane mounted on a combination measuring/ reference electrode. $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ diffuses across the membrane into a thin layer of electrolyte solution in response to partial pressure difference. This solution then becomes equilibrated with the external gas pressure. $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the solution becomes hydrated producing carbonic acid, which results in a change in hydrogen ion activity.

pO2 is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the cathode, consuming 4 electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons is then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen.

Hematocrit is defined as the percentage of red blood cells to the total blood volume and can be obtained by measuring electrical resistance of the blood sample. Two standard solutions are used to calibrate the hematocrit sensor and to obtain the slope. The analyzer then measures the electrical resistance of the blood sample to obtain the hematocrit value. The hematocrit value obtained is corrected for the concentration of the sodium ion.

Glucose measurement is based on the level of $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ produced during the enzymatic reaction between glucose and oxygen molecules in the presence of the glucose oxidase enzyme. At a constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ is oxidized at the surface of the platinum anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum electrode is proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample.

Lactate measurement is based on the level of $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ produced during the enzymatic reaction between lactate and oxygen molecules in the presence of the lactate oxidase enzyme. At a constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ is oxidized at the surface of the platinum anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum electrode is proportional to the lactate concentration of the sample.

Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Ionized Calcium, Ionized Magnesium: The parameters are measured by an Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE) that selectively measures the activity of ionic species. When the ISE is contacted with a sample, potential is developed. The potential is proportional to the logarithm of the ionic activity and is measured versus a reference electrode.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study for capillary whole blood was performed at two external POC sites with 5 POC operators at site 1 and 4 POC operators at site 2 over a minimum of 20 days. Capillary blood samples were collected via finger-stick and analyzed in singlet on the Stat Profile Prime Plus in capillary mode and on the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra in capillary mode. Stat Profile Prime Plus test results were compared to the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra test results for each parameter. To span the reportable range for each analyte, $< 1 0 \%$ of total samples were contrived, transferred into capillary tubes and run in singlicate on the Stat Profile Prime Plus and Stat Profile pHOx Ultra. A least squares linear regression analysis of the samples was performed for contrived and native sample combined and native samples only. The results from both sites were similar and combined results are shown below for native and contrived samples.
