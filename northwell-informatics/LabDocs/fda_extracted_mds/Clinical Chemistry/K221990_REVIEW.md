# B Principle of Operation:

The Access Total $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ (5th IS) assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with citrate buffer. After an initial incubation, rabbit anti- $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ alkaline phosphatase conjugate and paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse IgG: mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ complexes are added. The hCG binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti- $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ on the solid phase while, at the same time, the rabbit anti$\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the hCG. After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were conducted to estimate repeatability and within-laboratory precision. The study was run on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers and three reagent pack lots. Seven serum samples with approximate hCG concentrations of 0.5, 7, 25, 100, 800, 1,000 and $1 2 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ were used in the determination of imprecision. Each sample was assayed in duplicate, in two runs per day, over twenty days for a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates per instrument. Each instrument was evaluated with one reagent lot. The withinrun, between-run, between-day, and total imprecision was calculated. Results from multiple lots were similar. Results from one representative lot are provided in the table below:

A reproducibility study was conducted to assess instrument-to-instrument variability. Five serum samples with different hCG concentrations were run on three $\operatorname { D x I } 9 0 0 0$ Immunoassay Analyzers. The samples were tested across three reagent lots and one calibrator lot on each instrument with five replicates per run and one run per day over five days. The within-run, between-day, between-instrument, and reproducibility was calculated for each reagent lot. Results from multiple lots were similar.

2. Linearity:

Linearity was evaluated based upon recommendations in CLSI EP06-Ed2. Seven sample dilutions at concentrations across the measuring range of the Access Total $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ (5th IS) (0.07 to approximately $1 5 9 8 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ) were prepared by mixing different proportions of a serum sample containing high concentrations of $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ and a serum samples containing low concentrations of $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ . The low concentration serum sample was run in eight replicates, and all other samples were run in replicates of four. This study was run on one DxI 9000 Immunoassay System, using three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two to verify the system was in control. The data was analyzed using a weighted linear regression model as described in the guideline. The results from the linearity study supports the sponsor’s claimed analytical measuring interval of 0.6 to approximately $1 3 5 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . The maximum deviation from linearity was found to be acceptable and supported by the results.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Potential cross-reactivity, interference, and high dose effect were evaluated in k130020. No cross reactivity, interference, or high dose effect was observed.

4. Assay Reportable Range: The assay reportable range is $0 . 6 - 1 3 5 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): This assay is traceable to the WHO 5th International Standard for human Chorionic Gonadotropin (NIBSC Code 07/364).

6. Detection Limit:

The LoB, LoD, LoQ were determined based upon recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.

Limit of blank (LoB) is the highest concentration that is likely to be observed for a blank sample. To calculate the LoB, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems were used with three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Four S0 (hCG free)calibrator lots were used for the

LoB determination. Samples were tested over three days one run per day, five replicates per run, for each reagent pack lot. Three quality controls were run in duplicate on each day.. LoB was determined using the $9 5 \%$ nonparametric percentile of the replicates for each of three reagent lots. The LoB was determined to be $0 . 1 \mathrm { \ m I U / m L }$ .

Limit of detection (LoD) is the lowest concentration of analyte that can be detected reliably. To calculate the LoD, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems were used with three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Seven serum samples containing low levels of total βhCG (5th IS) analyte were prepared. Samples were tested in nine replicates per day over five days for each reagent pack lot. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day.. The LoD was determined to be $0 . 2 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

Limit of quantitation (LoQ) is the lowest concentration which is the design requirements of $\mathrm { T E a } \%$ (Total Error Allowance) of $\leq 3 0 \%$ . To calculate LoQ, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems were used with three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Thirteen native serum samples containing low levels of total $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ analyte were prepared. Each of the samples were run in replicates of nine, in one run per day, for five days on three reagent pack lots (45 replicates of each sample on each reagent lot). Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day to verify the systems were in control. The LoQ was determined to be $0 . 6 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

7. Assay Cut-Off:

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed comparing the Access Total $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ (5th IS) assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the comparator device, the Access Total βhCG (5th IS) assay run on the Access 2 Immunoassay System using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c-A3. A total of one hundred eleven (111) human serum samples were run on three DxI 9000 instruments and three Access 2 instruments with three reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots. Three commercial quality controls were run in triplicate each day. The Passing Bablok regression analysis between Access Total $\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ (5th IS) $\operatorname { D x I } 9 0 0 0$ analyzer values (dependent variable, y) and the Access Total βhCG (5th IS) Access 2 Immunoassay system values (x, comparator), are shown below:
