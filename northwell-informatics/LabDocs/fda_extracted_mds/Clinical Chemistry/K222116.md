Dear Anoop Joy:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

# 4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

# 4.1. Atellica CI Analyzer

The Atellica $\textcircled{8}$ CI Analyzer is an automated, integrated system designed to perform in vitro diagnostic tests on clinical specimens. The system is intended for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of various body fluids, using photometric, turbidimetric, chemiluminescent, and integrated ionselective electrode technology for clinical use.

The Atellica CI Analyzer with Atellica $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Rack Handler supports both clinical chemistry (CH) and Immunoassay (IM) features and contains all the necessary hardware, electronics, and software to automatically process samples and generate results, including sample and reagent dispensing, mixing, and incubating.

# 4.2. Atellica IM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone 3-Ultra (TSH3‑UL)

The Atellica IM TSH3-UL assay is a third-generation assay that employs anti-FITC monoclonal antibody covalently bound to paramagnetic particles, an FITC-labeled anti-TSH capture mouse monoclonal antibody, and a tracer consisting of a proprietary acridinium ester and an anti-TSH mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) for chemiluminescent detection

# 4.3. Atellica CH Albumin BCP (AlbP)

The Atellica CH Albumin BCP (AlbP) assay is an adaptation of the bromocresol purple dy-e binding method reported by Carter and Louderback et al. In the Atellica CH AlbP assay, serum or plasma albumin quantitatively binds to BCP to form an albumin-BCP complex that is measured as an endpoint reaction at 596/694 nm coenzyme ${ \mathsf { N A D } } +$ functions only with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroides) enzyme employed in the assay.

# 5. INTENDED USE

# Hemolysis, Icterus, and Lipemia (HIL)

The Atellica CH AlbP assay is designed to have $\leq 1 0 \%$ interference from hemoglobin, bilirubin, and lipemia. Interfering substances at the levels indicated in the table below were tested in accordance with CLSI Document EP07 using the Atellica CH AlbP assay.

Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (does not contain the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias $> 1 0 \%$ is considered interference. Analyte results should not be corrected based on this bias.

# Non-Interfering Substances

The following substances do not interfere with the Atellica CH AlbP assay when present in serum, potassium EDTA plasma, and lithium heparin plasma at the concentrations indicated in the table below. Bias due to these substances is $\leq 1 0 \%$ .

# Linearity

Linearity studies were performed following CLSI EP06-ED2. Dilution series composed of at least nine levels created by mixing the high and low pools of serum. Measurements were made with $\Nu = 5$ replicates per level. The results of the linear regression analysis are summarized in the table below.
