# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

Modification to an existing device to add the Android mobile app as an alternate primary display and to add the silence all alarms feature

# B Measurand:

Glucose in interstitial fluid

# C Type of Test:

Quantitative, amperometric assay via glucose oxidase

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Bigfoot Unity $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Diabetes Management System is indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 12 years and older.

Bigfoot Unity $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ provides glucose monitoring data via the Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring sensor. The system incorporates real time alarm capabilities and is designed to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions, unless otherwise indicated. The device is intended to provide insulin dose information using the available glucose data to assist persons with diabetes mellitus who use disposable pen-injectors for the self-injection of insulin in implementing health care provider recommended insulin dose regimens. The device is intended for single patient use only and requires a prescription.

Bigfoot Unity $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ is also intended to communicate autonomously with digitally connected medical devices where the user manually controls therapy decisions.

# C Contraindications

The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed loop and insulin suspend systems.

The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the Sensor has not been evaluated

# D Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could result in a severe low glucose event.

Do not use the System in people less than 12 years of age.

Do not use the System if you are pregnant, on dialysis or critically ill. The System is not cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.

Performance of the System has not been evaluated when used with other implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers.

The System does not support insulin doses in half-unit increments. Patients that require half doses should not use the System.

The System supports once daily dosing of long-acting insulin. Patients who take more than one daily dose of long-acting insulin should not use the System.

Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care professional.

Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the "check blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor, if your Sensor glucose reading does not match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a number.

Wash application site on the back of your upper arm using a plain soap, dry, and then clean with an alcohol wipe. This will help remove any oily residue that may prevent the sensor from sticking properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Carefully preparing the site according to these instructions will help the Sensor stay on your body for the full 14-day wear period and help prevent it from falling off early.

Store the Sensor Kit between $3 6 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ and $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ . If you suspect that the temperature may exceed $8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (e.g., an un-airconditioned home in the summer), you should refrigerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.

You must scan the Sensor to get your current glucose level as the Bigfoot Unity App will not provide this information.

Take standard precautions for transmission of blood borne pathogens to avoid contamination.

Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed by the manufacturer as compatible with the System may cause inaccuracte glucose readings.

If a Sensor breaks inside your body, call your health care professional.

If you use an Android phone, do not lower the notification vibration. If you use an Android phone, do not lower the notification vibration intensity to the lowest level in your phone’s Vibration Intensity menu. At the lowest level, you may not detect vibrations with your alerts, including the Very Low Glucose Alert.

If you use an iPhone, do not turn off vibration in the iOS Sound & Haptics or Accessibility menus. If you turn off any vibration setting, you will not get any vibrations with your alerts, including the Very Low Glucose Alert.

# E Special Instrument Requirements:

Not Applicable

# A Device Description:

The Bigfoot Unity utilizes continuous glucose monitoring to support people with diabetes mellitus who use disposable insulin pens for self-injection of insulin. The system consists of the Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM), two reusable insulin pen caps (one each for rapid-acting and long-acting insulin pens) and a mobile application. The components communicate via near field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

The Bigfoot Unity contains a digital lookup table that displays insulin dose recommendations on the Bigfoot Unity pen caps based on healthcare provider (HCP)-prescribed regimens. The System also provides a set of meal dose recommendations based on meal size, where the meal doses are set by the healthcare provider (HCP) and entered in the lookup table.

The device generates glucose data using the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor and displays the data (value and trend) on the rapid-acting insulin pen cap (the White Cap) when the user scans the sensor using the White Cap. The rapid-acting pen cap also displays correction and meal insulin doses based upon the lookup table and available glucose data. The long-acting pen cap (the Black Cap) displays the long-acting insulin dose prescribed by the user’s healthcare provider. From the dose recommendations on the pen caps, as well as other contextually relevant information such as glucose trend arrows, users manually select an insulin dose and administer it using the pens according to the insulin manufacturers’ instructions. In addition to displaying dose information, both pen caps track the time of insulin doses.

The mobile app allows user entry, in consultation with their HCP, of a prescribed insulin dosing regimen into the digital lookup table, as well as provides system alerts and historical information. The mobile app has a built-in, mandatory low-glucose alarm at $5 5 \mathrm { m d / d L }$ and an optional lowglucose alarm at $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The alarms are able to be silenced for up to 4 hours through the mobile app, but alarms will still be pushed as notifications and vibrate as they occur. The mobile app receives glucose data from the sensor via BLE and will alert if the sensor glucose reading is below the threshold(s). However, in order to obtain the glucose sensor value, the user must scan the sensor with the White Cap. Additionally, the mobile app manages the secure wireless communication between the system components and enables the transfer of the system data to the cloud.

# B Principle of Operation:

Bigfoot Unity incorporates the FreeStyle Libre 2 continuous glucose sensor and glucose translation library for calculating glucose values and trend information. Additionally, Bigfoot Unity uses the FreeStyle Libre 2 wireless communication protocols to (1) obtain glucose values and trend information on the White Cap, and (2) provide real-time alerts in the mobile app.
