Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System

# Common Name:

Blood Collection Tubes, Vials, Systems, Serum Separators

# Regulation Name:

Blood Specimen Collection Device

# Regulation Number:

21 CFR 862.1675

Regulatory Class: Class II

Product Code: JKA and FPA

Primary Predicate:  Steripath Micro Blood Collection System (K200661)

# 5.1. Device Description:

The device, Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System, is a system to draw blood for in vitro diagnostic testing. The purpose of this submission is to expand the product line to include inlet components with the BD Venipuncture® UltraTouch™ Push Button Needle, outlet components with a transfer adapter, and universal models with no inlet component.

The Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System is indicated for use as a blood collection system that diverts and sequesters the initial specimen prior to collection of a subsequent test sample to reduce the frequency of blood culture contamination when contaminants are present in the initial blood sample compared to blood cultures drawn with standard procedure without manual diversion.

The device sequesters and diverts $0 . 5 \textrm { - } 1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m L }$ of the initial specimen of blood (potentially contaminated) into a diversion chamber. Once diversion is complete, a subsequent blood sample flows through a second pathway within the device and is collected either directly into a culture bottle (not provided by Magnolia Medical Technologies), or into a syringe that is used to inoculate culture bottles. Additionally, components of the system may be used for infusion after disconnection of the Initial Specimen Diversion Device® $\mathrm { \Delta } [ { \mathsf { S D D } } ^ { \circledast } ]$ ).

The Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System, needle configurations, for the subject device are manufactured using non-sterile BD UltraTouch® needles, which are equivalent to the commercially available BD UltraTouch® Push Button™ Blood Collection Set (K212724), except for the sterilization step. The Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System and UltraTouch® needles have the same intended use. Incorporation of the needle with the ${ | \mathsf { S D D } ^ { \circledast } }$ functions on the same technological characteristics and principles of operation with the difference that the subject device leverages the Initial Specimen Diversion Technology® (ISDT) and mechanically sequesters the initial specimen of blood. Inclusion of this technology does not raise any added questions of safety or effectiveness.

The different configurations of the Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System are made available by using different combinations of the inlet and outlet accessories. Proposed configurations are listed in Table 5.1.

# 5.2. Intended Use/ Indication for Use:

The Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System is a system to draw blood for in vitro diagnostic testing.

The Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System is indicated for use as a blood collection system that diverts and sequesters the initial specimen prior to collection of a subsequent test sample to reduce the frequency of blood culture contamination when contaminants are present in the initial blood sample compared to blood cultures drawn with standard procedure without manual diversion.

Additionally, components of the system may be used for infusion following sample collection after disconnection of the Initial Specimen Diversion Device® $( I S D D ^ { \circleddash } )$ .

# 5.3. Technological characteristics

The Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System is a pre-assembled single use, sterile, mechanical device that diverts and sequesters the initial $0 . 5 \mathsf { m l }$ to $\pm . 0 \mathsf { m l }$ of blood from the patient. The device consists of the proprietary Initial Specimen Diversion Device® $\bigl ( | \mathsf { S D D } ^ { \circledast } \bigr )$ ) made of injection molded, medical grade plastics, an inlet component, and an outlet component. The inlet components include needles and Luer extensions for interfacing with patients while the outlet components include syringes and transfer adapters for interfacing to blood culture bottles. The device family also includes no-inlet configurations which requires a compatible inlet to be attached prior to use.

Venous blood access is obtained by venipuncture or connecting to the peripheral IV catheter hub using the standard blood collection procedure. The negative pressure created by actuating the syringe plunger or by connecting the culture bottle to the transfer adapter, causes blood to flow into the C-shaped diversion chamber. When the C-shaped chamber is filled with blood, the button on the side of the diversion chamber is depressed to isolate the initial specimen and a new sterile pathway opens to collect a subsequent specimen for blood culture or other analysis.

The predicate device – the three (3) previously cleared models (4005-EN, 4010-EN, 4020-EN) of Steripath® Micro Blood Collection System (K200661) – utilizes the same technology and principle of operation as the subject device. A comparison of the technological characteristics is listed in Table 5.2.
