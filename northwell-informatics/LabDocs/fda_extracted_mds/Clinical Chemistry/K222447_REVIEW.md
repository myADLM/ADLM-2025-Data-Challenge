D Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The following special conditions for use statements apply to both the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and the FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System:

• Do not use the System if you are on dialysis or critically ill. The System is not cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.   
• Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: If you are experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with your glucose readings, consult your health care professional.   
• Do not use the System in people less than 2 years of age. The System is not cleared for use in people under 2 years of age.   
• The system is intended for use by a single person. It must not be used by more than one person due to the risk of misinterpreting glucose information.   
• Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the "check blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor. In addition, use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions, if your Sensor glucose reading does not match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a number.   
• Store the Sensor Kit between $3 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and $8 2 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ . Storage outside of this range may cause inaccurate Sensor glucose readings. If you suspect that the temperature may exceed $8 2 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ (for example, in an un-airconditioned home in summer), you should refrigerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.   
• Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed (as compatible) may cause inaccurate glucose readings.   
• Do not force close the App. The App must be running in the background to receive alarms. If you force close the App you will not receive alarms. Re-open the App to ensure you will receive alarms.

The following special conditions for use statements apply to the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System only:

You must scan the Sensor to get your real-time current glucose level as both the Reader and App will not provide this information without a scan. For you to receive alarms, they must be on and your Reader should be within 20 feet of you at all times. The transmission range is 20 feet unobstructed. If you are out of range, you may not receive glucose alarms.   
• To prevent missed alarms, make sure the Reader has sufficient charge and that sound and/or vibration are turned on. The Reader is for use by a single person. It must not be used on more than one person including other family members due to the risk of spreading infection. All parts of the Reader are considered biohazardous and can potentially transmit infectious diseases, even after performing the cleaning and disinfection procedure.

# B Principle of Operation:

The modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and the modified FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System use an electrochemical sensor to monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor is held in place with an adhesive pad and incorporates both the subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor uses a glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to an electrode, producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the ISF. The system converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) accompanied by trend arrow for display to the user on a display device.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is physically identical to the predicate FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System except for the differences in sensor transmission dimensions as previously established in K212132. Therefore, the pivotal clinical studies for the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System were leveraged for the modified FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

iCGM performance was evaluated in clinical studies described below in section C(3). Subjects wore two modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash sensors concurrently, one on the back of each upper arm, to evaluate device precision.

In the study for 18 years and older, the mean paired absolute relative difference (between the 2 concurrently worn devices) was $8 . 0 \%$ ; and the mean coefficient of variation (mean $\% C V )$ was $5 . 6 \%$ .

For pediatric age 6 to 17 years, the mean paired absolute relative difference was $8 . 6 \%$ ; and the mean $\% \mathrm { C V }$ was $6 . 1 \ \%$ .

For pediatric age 2 to 5 years old, the mean paired absolute relative difference was $6 . 5 \%$ ; and the mean $\% \mathrm { C V }$ was $4 . 6 \%$ .

2. Linearity:

The reportable range for the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash System and FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is 40 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Data supporting this claimed measuring range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was shown to significantly interfere with system performance of the predicate device.

A clinical study was conducted to evaluate ascorbic acid interference for the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash System. This was a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study that enrolled 60 subjects at 2 sites. The study was designed to evaluate performance of the system in people with diabetes (age 18 and older) taking ascorbic acid. Each subject wore two sensors, one on the back of each upper arm, for a period of up to 10 days. The sensors were from a single production lot.

The interference effect of ascorbic acid on the modified Freestyle Libre 2 Flash System was assessed by the difference $\mathrm { ( m g / d L ) }$ between CGM and comparator method (CM), in this case the Yellow Springs Instrument Life Sciences 2300 STAT Plus™ Glucose and Lactate Analyzer, readings at baseline and after each ascorbic acid doses. In this study, maximum bias was observed approximately 2 to 3 hours after each ascorbic acid dose.

The maximum average interference bias was $5 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ after one $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ dose. The maximum average total interference biases were $9 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $9 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (vs. baseline) after the second and third $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ doses (given every 4 hours), respectively.

Based on data from the clinical interference study, the sponsor included the following statement in the User Guide:

“Interfering Substances: Taking more than $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of Vitamin C per day may falsely raise your Sensor readings, which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event.

Vitamin C can be found in supplements including multivitamins and cold remedies such as Airborne $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Emergen- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { C } \mathbf { \otimes }$ . See your health care professional to understand how long Vitamin C is active in your body.

Additional Notes for Health Care Professionals: In the original version of the FreeStyle Libre 2 system, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) doses of larger than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per day could affect the Sensor readings, making them look higher than they really were. With the current version of the FreeStyle Libre 2 System, users can take up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of ascorbic acid per day and can still use the Sensor readings to make treatment decisions.”

4. Assay Reportable Range:

The reportable range for modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and the modified FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is 40 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The storage shelf-life of 9 months at 36 to $8 2 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ within the humidity range of $10 \% - 9 0 \%$ previously established for the predicate FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash sensor in K193371 is applicable to the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash sensor.

The storage shelf-life of 3 months at 36 to $8 2 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ within the humidity range of $10 \% - 9 0 \%$ previously established for the reference FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor in K212132 is applicable to the modified FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor.

# 6. Detection Limit:

If a glucose measurement is less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result will be displayed by the system as ‘LO’. If the glucose measurement exceeds $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the result will be displayed as ‘HI’. Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not applicable

8. Accuracy (Instrument): Not applicable

9. Carry-Over: Not applicable

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device: Not applicable. Accuracy is determined by comparing device values to an FDA cleared

laboratory grade glucose measurement method.

2. Matrix Comparison: Not applicable. Interstitial fluid is the only indicated matrix.

# C Clinical Studies:

1. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

2. Clinical Specificity: See Section A(3), Analytical Specificity/Interference, above.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):

The accuracy performance of the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System was assessed in a single pivotal clinical study conducted in the United States at seven centers.

The study enrolled 150 subjects (18 years and older) with diabetes ( $8 5 . 3 \%$ with Type 1 diabetes and $1 4 . 7 \%$ with insulin-requiring Type 2 diabetes). Subjects wore two sensors for up to 16 consecutive days following Sensor application and accuracy analysis is based on the first applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects took part in up to three ten-hour clinical sessions that took place during four distinct periods: Days 1 to 3; Days 5 to 7; Days 9 to 11, and Days 13 to 15. During each clinic session, each subject’s glucose was manipulated to observe data spanning the measuring range.

The study also enrolled 142 pediatric subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Subjects wore two sensors for up to 16 consecutive days following Sensor application and accuracy analysis is based on the first applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects age 2 to 5 years took part in one four-hour clinical session. Subjects age 6 to 12 years took part in one twelve-hour clinical session. Subjects age 13 to 17 years took part in two twelve-hour clinical sessions. Clinic sessions for each subject took place during four distinct periods: Days 1 to 3; Days 5 to 7; Days 9 to 11, and Days 13 to 15. During each clinic session, glucose levels were manipulated in subjects 11 years and older to observe data spanning the measuring range. Subjects 10 years and younger underwent observation only without glucose manipulation.

The modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated by comparing iCGM glucose values to glucose values from venous blood draws measured with an FDA-cleared laboratory grade comparator method (YSI 2300) subjects 6 years and older, and glucose values from capillary blood measured with a self-monitoring blood glucose meter (SMBG) for subjects 2 to 5 years of age.

Glucose values were obtained from the system and from the comparator at the same or similar time. In both studies, absolute differences in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ of values compared to the comparator method were calculated for all values below $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For values of $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and above, percentage differences compared to the comparator method were calculated.

# Trend Accuracy

Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose and is characterized by slopes, such as from $> 2 \mathrm { m g / d L / m i n }$ to $< - 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L / m i n }$ . Trend accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

# Agreement When iCGM Reads ‘LO’ or ‘HI’

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System reports glucose readings between 40 and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . When the system determines that the glucose reading is below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘LO’ whenever the sensor is scanned. When the system determines that the glucose reading is above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it will display ‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned. Because the system does not display glucose values below $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator) when the iCGM value is classified as ‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are evaluated separately. The cumulative percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’) and when comparator values were more that certain glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in the tables below.

# Alarm Performance

The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms. The Alarm Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells the user how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high glucose event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).

# Low Glucose Alarm Performance

True Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

False Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was not below the alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm issued within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

Missed Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm didn’t issue within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

# Sensor Stability

Sensor stability describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can be worn for up to 14 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the absolute relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of device readings within $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $1 5 \%$ $( 1 5 / 1 5 \% )$ , $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $20 \%$ $( 2 0 / 2 0 \% )$ and 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $40 \%$ $( 4 0 / 4 0 \% )$ of the comparator values during the beginning, early middle, late middle, and end of the wear period. These times were defined as follows:

• Beginning (Days 1, 2 or 3)

Early Middle (Days 5, 6 or 7), • Late Middle (Days 9, 10 or 11), and End (Days 13, 14 or 15).

The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and agreement rates with the comparator method were evaluated over 14 day life of the sensor.

# Sensor Life

The Sensor can be worn for up to 15 days. 151 Sensors were evaluated on the adult subjects and 142 Sensors were evaluated in the pediatric subjects to determine how many days of readings each Sensor provided.

Of the 151 Sensors with adult subjects, $8 3 . 1 \%$ lasted until the final day of use. Four (4) Sensors $( 2 . 6 \% )$ had “early sensor shut-off” where the Sensor algorithm detected that the Sensors did not function as intended and presented the user with a “Replace Sensor” message.

Of the 142 Sensors with pediatric subjects, $7 6 . 8 \%$ of the Sensors lasted until the final day of use. Three (3) Sensors $( 2 . 1 \% )$ had “early sensor shut-off” and presented the user with a “Replace Sensor” message.

Software regression testing was conducted in accordance with established specifications and IEC 62304 and documentation was provided as recommended by FDA Guidance "Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices", published May 11, 2005. The test results met acceptance criteria and support that the subject devices are acceptable for their intended use.

# Interoperability

The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System include the Libre Data Sharing API (cleared in K223537) to communicate iCGM data with authorized client software. The sponsor developed an approach for interoperability in alignment with FDA guidance, “Design Considerations and Pre-market Submission Recommendations for Interoperable Medical Devices,” published September 6, 2017. The approach to interoperability with authorized partners provides information to support device expectations, requirements, development methodology, testing protocols for their software integration, and interface specifications for data exchange with compatible interoperable devices, including automated insulin dosing (AID) systems.

As standalone iCGMs, the first 12 hours of sensor wear for the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be adjunctive. The sponsor includes a “Check Blood Glucose” icon in the user interface to remind users to use a blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions. Authorized partners should consider the sensor performance throughout the duration of device wear with particular consideration during the first 12 hours of adjunctive use.
