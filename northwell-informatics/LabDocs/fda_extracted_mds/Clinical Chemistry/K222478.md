Dear Sravan Rajamani:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic.

# Device Description

The BD Vacutainer® Luer-Lok™ Access Device and the BD Vacutainer® Blood Transfer Device are sterile, single use, non-invasive devices for the safe transfer of blood into an evacuated BD Vacutainer® blood collection tube or BD BACTEC™ blood culture bottle for in vitro diagnostic testing. The only difference between the devices is the BD Vacutainer® Luer-Lok™ Access device features a male Luer lock connection for connection with compatible female Luer catheter port (blood collection set) and the BD Vacutainer® Blood Transfer Device features a female Luer lock for connection with BD Luer-Lok™ syringes.

The proposed and predicate device have the same basic indication for use, the collection of a blood sample using a male or female Luer connector on a multiple sample adapter with a preattached holder. All devices use an ISO 594 connector of various gender (male/female) connected to a compatible $6 \%$ Luer to transfer blood into an evacuated container (blood collection tube, blood culture bottle) for in vitro diagnostic testing. The differences in the indications statement are in language and do not pose new questions of safety or effectiveness.

Difference in Hub Material: The materials of hub from proposed device are different with predicate device. However, the biocompatibility test for proposed device has been tested and the results comply with the requirements of ISO 10993. Therefore, this difference is not determined to affect substantial equivalence or safety/effectiveness.

Difference in Length: The length of between the proposed device and predicate device is different. This difference in length is not substantial. This difference does not affect intended use or the performance of the device. Therefore, this difference does not affect substantial equivalence or safety/effectiveness.

Difference in precautions: The proposed Luer-Lok™ Access Device has an added precaution for use in urinalysis to address reported adverse events associated with reasonably foreseeable misuse. This difference does not affect substantial equivalence or safety/effectiveness. This difference does not affect the Blood Transfer Device.

Conclusion: The differences between proposed device and predicated device include materials of manufacture, product length and device labeling. These differences do not raise any question regarding its safety and effectiveness. The differences in technological characteristics may be evaluated through performance testing.
