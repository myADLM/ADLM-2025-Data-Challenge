Dear Jianwei Pan:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for

devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

Comment 1

The proposed indications for use, are similar to the predicate indications for use. The difference is commented as follows:

-the short term is clearly defined for up to 2 hours in indications for use of proposed device. It does not raise new questions of safety/effectiveness, however users are more aware of the safe use time.

-in predicate indications for use, the recommended use is to activate the needle safety feature prior to removal from the venipuncture site. The needle safety feature can be activated before or after the needle leaves the body, which will not cause new safety/effectiveness. It aids in the prevention of accidental needle stick through the use of an active safety feature.

So the differences are not a significant change.

# Comment 2

The predicate device is two configuration: with an integrated male luer adapter which connects to a holder(without holder) and without the male luer adapter. The male luer adapter is intended to installed the holder and held during operation. The proposed device is expanded into two configurations, pre installed holder and without holder. This gives users more choices. The pre installed holder do not change any function of proposed device. So the differences are not a significant change.

# Comment 3

The patient contact materials for the proposed device are different from predicate device. According to guidance, Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1 "Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process", the proposed device is external communicating device of Blood path, indirect and limited contact. The Cytotoxicity test, Sensitization test, Irritation test, Acute systemic toxicity test, Pyrogen test, Hemolysis test have been performed for proposed device. Therefore, this material difference does not affect substantially equivalence on safety and effectiveness.

# Comment 4

The expiration date for the proposed device is different from predicate device. The proposed devices have been performed 3 years accelerated aging and demonstrated that the aged samples also complied with the requirements of relevant performance standards. The ability of immediate package of the proposed device to maintain the device in a sterile state for a period of 3 years has been validated in accordance with ISO 11607 and ISTA 3A. Therefore, this expiration date difference does not affect substantially equivalence on safety and effectiveness.

# Comment 5

The sterile method of proposed device is Eto, the sterile method of predicate device is Gamma. Both of them achieve a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of $1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ . Examination of the Ethylene Oxide (EO) and Ethylene Chlorohydrin (ECH) residuals have met with ISO 10993-7,AMD1:2019, this sterilization difference does not affect substantially equivalence on safety and effectiveness.

# Comment 6

The needle size and tube length is different between proposed device and predicate device. The proposed device have expanded of needle and tube range. These extended devices have been verified according to ISO 9626, ISO 7864, ISO 8536-4. The difference does not affect substantially equivalence on safety and effectiveness.

# 8. Non-Clinical Test Conclusion
