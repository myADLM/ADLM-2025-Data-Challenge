II Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The BlueStar $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CGM insulin dose calculator is software intended for the management of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in persons aged 18 years and older requiring fast-acting insulin. The BlueStar CGM insulin dose calculator allows patients to calculate a dose of bolus insulin for a given amount of carbohydrates, the most recent CGM glucose reading and rate of change, activity, and, optionally, insulin on board (IOB). The BlueStar CGM insulin dose calculator requires a prescription.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# III Device Description

The BlueStar $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CGM insulin dose calculator is a software module that resides in the BlueStar Rx application (K203434). It requires input parameters and settings from an integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) as well as inputs set by a healthcare provider and by the user. When used with a compatible iCGM, the BlueStar CGM insulin dose calculator can use sensor glucose values and trends to calculate a bolus of fast-acting insulin and provide coaching messages on implementing insulin boluses and suggestions on when to consume rescue carbohydrates. The BlueStar CGM insulin dose calculator cannot use blood glucose data to calculate an insulin bolus, but blood glucose from a self-monitoring blood glucometer (SMBG) can be used in a separate calculator to determine a fast-acting insulin bolus in the event iCGM data is not available was previously cleared in K203434.

The BlueStar $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CGM insulin dose calculator uses an algorithm to calculate both insulin boluses and coaching messages. The inputs that influence insulin doses are CGM value and rate of change inputs are sourced from a compatible iCGM device while the user carbohydrates, exercise status, and logged insulin for insulin on board calculations (optional) are sourced from the user or caregiver. The duration of insulin action, insulin to carb ratio, correction factor, and target glucose are all set by the healthcare provider and are editable by the patient except for duration of insulin action.

This medical device product has functions subject to FDA premarket review as well as functions that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, if the product has functions that are not subject to FDA premarket review, FDA assessed those functions only to the extent that they either could adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to FDA premarket review or they are included as a labeled positive impact that was considered in the assessment of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.

# VI Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Summary of Clinical Testing:

A single arm, single site, prospective clinical study was conducted to evaluate the BlueStar Rx continuous glucose monitor insulin bolus calculator (BlueStar CGM-IDC) in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The study enrolled 27 evaluable subjects aged 18 and older that had been using the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for 30 days prior to the start of the study and were users of both long-acting insulin and short-acting insulin. The single site study consisted of three visits and 30 days of daily use of the subject device use to administer shortacting bolus insulin:

• Visit 1: Participants received configured device and used it daily for 7 days • Virtual Visit 2: Principal Investigator reviewed CGM data for the first week to assess if parameters of the calculator needed adjustment and participants continued use of calculator for 23 days • Visit 3: Study concludes, and participants are returned to their standard of care

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of the CGM-informed dose calculator using continuous glucose meter metrics of time in range (TIR) of $7 0 { - } 1 8 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ during the 30-day study compared with the prior 30 days of CGM use as a baseline. The clinical study CGM metric results are presented in the table below. In the 27 subjects enrolled in the combined age cohort of $1 8 +$ years old there were zero (0) deaths and zero (0) unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE), and one (1) serious adverse event (SAE) reported that occurred due to device use. There were thirteen (13) total hypoglycemia events reported with one (1) being indicated by the principal investigator as being due to a participant’s incorrect estimation of carbohydrates with a meal. There were no non-serious adverse events reported.

Human factors evaluation was conducted to assess whether users can perform all critical tasks associated with the new device. Subjects were representative of the device’s intended use population.

# VII Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

# VIII Conclusion:

The device is substantially equivalent to the predicate.
