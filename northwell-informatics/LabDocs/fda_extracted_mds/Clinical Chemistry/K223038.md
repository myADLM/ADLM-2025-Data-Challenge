Dear Kuljeet Kaur:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part

801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

Imprecision: Verification studies were performed to determine the imprecision of the Access Cortisol assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer using a protocol based on CLSI EP-05-A3. The study was performed within one internal site over twenty days. Three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers were used in the study design. There were three reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots. Five (5) serum samples, with Cortisol concentrations spanning the assay range were used for this study. The within-laboratory (total) $\%$ CV ranged from $2 \%$ to $9 . 3 \%$ , for Cortisol

concentrations $> 5 . 0 \ \mathsf { u g } / \mathsf { d L }$ . The within-laboratory (total) SD was 0.1 for Cortisol concentrations $\leq 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { u g / d L }$ . The results from a representative lot are as follows:

Acceptance criteria for non-linearity within $\pm \mid \mathsf { u g } / \mathsf { d L }$ for values $\leq 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { u g / d L }$ and $\pm$ $20 \%$ for values $> 5 . 0 \ \mathsf { u g } / \mathsf { d L }$ was met and indicate that the Access Cortisol assay is linear on the DxI 9000 Immunoassay System across the analytical measuring interval of 0.8 - ${ \tt 6 0 u g / d L }$ (22 - 1,655 nmol/L).

LoB/LoD: Verification studies were performed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) for the Access Cortisol assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer using a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A2. The assay is designed to meet the claimed LoB of $0 . 4 \ : \mathsf { u g } / \mathsf { d L }$ and LoD of $0 . 4 \ : \mathsf { u g } / \mathsf { d L }$ .

LoQ: Verification studies were performed to determine the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Access Cortisol assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer using a protocol based on CLSI EP17- A2. The LoQ for Access Cortisol designed to meet the claimed LoQ of $0 . 8 \ : \mathsf { u g } / \mathsf { d L }$ based on a $20 \%$ CV.
