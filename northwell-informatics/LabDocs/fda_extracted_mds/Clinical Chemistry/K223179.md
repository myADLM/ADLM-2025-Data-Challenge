Dear Nathifa Bradshaw:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR

803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97).

Predicate Device: Cholestech LDXTM System (k120615)

The following are the legally marketed devices covered under the predicate device clearance, k120615, and their prior clearances:

# Abbott

The original Cholestech LDX TM lipid monitoring system was cleared under premarket notification k901900 for use with Cholestech LDX TM analyzer.

In addition to total cholesterol, the analytes glucose, HDL, triglycerides were cleared under premarket notification k932727.

The Cholestech multianalyte controls and calibration verification materials were originally cleared under premarket notification k102700.

Cholestech LDX TM software update to incorporate a humidity sensor was cleared under premarket notification k120615.

# 5.3 Device Description

The Cholestech LDX TM system combines enzymatic methodology and solid-phase technology to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. Samples used for testing can be whole blood from a fingerstick (collected in a lithium heparin-coated capillary tube) or venipuncture. The sample is applied to the Cholestech LDX TM cassettea.

The cassette is then placed into the Cholestech LDX TM Analyzer where a unique system on the cassette separates the plasma from the blood cells. A portion of the plasma flows to the right side of the cassette and is transferred to both the total cholesterol and triglyceride reaction pads. Simultaneously, plasma flows to the left side of the cassette where the low- and very low-density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) are precipitated with dextran sulfate $\mathrm { ' } 5 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { M W } )$ and magnesium acetate precipitating reagent.The filtrate, containing both glucose and HDL cholesterol, is transferred to both the glucose and HDL cholesterol reaction pads.

The Cholestech LDX TM Analyzer measures total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol by an enzymatic method based on the method formulation of Allain et al, and Roeschlau. Cholesterol esterase hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters in the filtrate or plasma to free cholesterol and the corresponding fatty acid. Cholesterol oxidase, in the presence of oxygen, oxidizes free cholesterol to cholest-4-ene-3-one and hydrogen peroxide. In a reaction catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase, the peroxide reacts with 4-

# Abbott

Aminoantipyrine and N-ethyl-N-sulfohydroxypropyl-m-toluidine, sodium sale (TOOS) to form a purple-colored quinoneimine dye proportional to the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol concentrations of the sample.

The analyzer measures triglycerides by an enzymatic method based on the hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipase to glycerol and free fatty acids. Glycerol, in a reaction catalyzed by glycerol kinase, is converted to glycerol-3-phosphate. In a third reaction, glycerol-3- phosphate is oxidized by glycerol phosphate oxidase to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and hydrogen peroxide. The color reaction utilizing horseradish peroxidase is the same as for the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Estimated LDL cholesterol and nonHDL cholesterol and a TC/HDL ratio are calculated using the measured values for TC, $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { H D L } } ,$ and Triglycerides.

The analyzer measures glucose by an enzymatic method that uses glucose oxidase to catalyze the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide. The color reaction utilizing horseradish peroxidase is the same as that for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The resultant color in all the reactions is measured by reflectance photometry.

A brown (magnetic) stripe on each cassette contains the calibration information required for the Cholestech LDX TM Analyzer to convert the reflectance reading $( \% \mathbb { R } )$ to the total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose concentrations.

# 5.6 Technological Characteristics

Cholestech LDX TM system maintains the same intended use and indications for use. The principle of operations, and chemical composition remains unchanged.

# 5.7 Description of Device Modification

The modification to the labeling of the Cholestech LDX TM system is to update the performance claim of the device as it pertains to interference level of conjugated and unconjugated Bilirubin. The population of the intended use of the device has been further specified to indicate that the system should not be used for testing in children under the age of 2 years; and for Glucose measurements, to remove use in neonatal hypoglycemia.

# 5.8 Design Control Activities

The verification studies of the device modification have been performed under design control. The design control activities were based on risk analysis, and acceptance criteria were set to maintain the performance and safety of the Cholestech LDX TM system. The risk analysis identified the appropriate in-house analytical performance verification studies to demonstrate that the analytical performance and risk of erroneous results for Cholestech LDX TM system are not adversely affected by using the proposed modification device.

# 5.9 Conclusion

Verification studies were performed as required by risk analysis and all acceptance criteria were met. The technological characteristics of the predicate device cleared under k120615 are the same as the modified device, and the system maintains the same

# Abbott

intended use and indications for use as the predicate device. In addition, the update to the Bilirubin Interference claim and further specification of the population in the indications for use/intended use did not raise new or different questions of safety and effectiveness; therefore, the Cholestech LDX TM system is found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
