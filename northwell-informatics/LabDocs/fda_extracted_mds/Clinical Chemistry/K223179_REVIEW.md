# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Cholestech LDX™ System is a small, portable analyzer and test cassette system. The System is for in vitro diagnostic use only and should not be used for testing in children under the age of 2 years. The Cholestech LDX™ System is comprised of the Cholestech LDX Analyzer and the following cassettes:

The Lipid Profile•GLU cassette is for the quantitative determination of total cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose in whole blood. The TC/HDL (total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol) ratio and estimated values for LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and non-HDL cholesterol are also reported.

The TC•HDL•GLU cassette is for the quantitative determination of total cholesterol, HDL (highdensity lipoprotein) cholesterol, and glucose in whole blood.

The TC•GLU cassette is for the quantitative determination of total cholesterol and glucose in whole blood.

The Lipid Profile cassette is for the quantitative determination of total cholesterol, HDL (highdensity lipoprotein) cholesterol, and triglycerides in whole blood. The TC/HDL (total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol) ratio and estimated values for LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and non-HDL cholesterol are also reported.

The TC•HDL cassette is for the quantitative determination of total cholesterol and HDL (highdensity lipoprotein) cholesterol in whole blood.

The TC cassette is for the quantitative determination of total cholesterol in whole blood.

• Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders.

• HDL (lipoprotein) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders (such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis, and various liver and renal diseases.

• Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid metabolism, or various endocrine disorders.

• Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus, idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Limitation – Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ is not for use in children under the age of 2 years or patients with hyperbilirubinemia (Elevated bilirubin levels).

D Special Instrument Requirements:

Cholestech LDX™ Analyzer.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Cholestech LDX™ System is a small, portable analyzer and test cassette system. The system is for in vitro diagnostic use only. The Analyzer uses reflectance photometry (the amount of light reflected from a solid surface) to determine the amount of the analyte in blood. The analyzer measures color changes of the four reagent pads. The amount of color formed is converted by the analyzer to a concentration and the results are shown on the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. The assays for use on the Analyzer include total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TRG), glucose (GLU), and by calculation, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), non-HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio.

The modification that is the subject of this submission addresses revised bilirubin interference claims for all analytes (see Section VII.A.3.) and includes a new limitation and a software upgrade to mitigate the modified risks. The revised limitations consist of the statement “Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X T M }$ is not for use in children under the age of 2 years or patients with hyperbilirubinemia (Elevated bilirubin levels)”. The software upgrade incorporates the revised limitations, displaying it on the Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X T M }$ analyzer screen, printing it on all paper test results, and presenting it on all results sent to the electronic medical record.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

This performance characteristic was established in the previous 510(k) submissions, reviewed under K901900, K912136, K914469, K922612, K932727, K914033, K905296 and K904082.

# 2. Linearity:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference testing was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP07-A3 and a study evaluating two interferents\*, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin was conducted. For the study, target analytes at different concentrations; triglycerides ( $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), HDL $\mathrm { 3 0 m g / d L }$ and $8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), glucose $( 5 0 { - } 7 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 1 0 { - } 1 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 225-270 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ), total cholesterol ( $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were created in pooled samples that were spiked with the interferents, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, at a range of concentrations. Samples were tested in replicates of sixteen (16) using three (3) Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X T M }$ Lipid Profile Glucose test cassettes, on sixteen (16) Cholestech $\mathrm { L D X T M }$ Analyzers. The following table list the concentration of each substance at which no significant interference was detected; defined by the sponsor as a difference of less than or equal to $\pm 1 0 \%$ between the test sample and control:

Potential interference from conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin was also estimated for the calculated parameters.

Based on the data, the sponsor updated the interference claims in their labeling for the test system for conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin to indicate that concentrations up to 2.5 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ do not interfere with the test system.
