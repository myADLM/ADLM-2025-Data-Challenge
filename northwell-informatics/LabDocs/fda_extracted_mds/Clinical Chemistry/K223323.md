Dear Charles Mack:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

# Device Description:

The subject devices are blood collection devices used in routine venipuncture procedures, which form a channel between the patient’s vein and the evacuated blood collection tube intended to collect blood.

The Blood Collection Needle (with/without Needle Holder) is intended for single use only and consists of a bottom sheath or needle holder, needle tube, rubber cap, upper sheath, and hub. They are available in different configurations.

The product is to be used by appropriately trained healthcare professionals only in accordance with these instructions.

It is manufactured from tubular stainless steel sharpened at both ends and is attached to the hub:

-The subject devices are available with a pre-attached needle holder or without a needle holder; the hub is threaded on one side to connect with the needle holder, which is used to guide the needle into an evacuated blood collection tube. This needle’s end is shorter and fitted with a protective rubber cap and a needle holder.

- The opposite end of the needle is longer for withdrawing blood and is fitted with a needle sheath.

The subject devices are available in different specifications of needle gauge (25G-18G) and length $( 3 / 4 " 1 ~ 1 / 2 " )$ .

The proposed devices are only packaged as sterile, disposable, and single-patient use.

The devices are packaged for sterile, single-use, and single-patient use only.

# Indications for Use

The Blood Collection Needle (with/without Needle Holder) is intended to be used with a vacuum blood collection tube for the collection of venous blood.

The predicate device included three devices; We only chose one “Blood Collection Needle with/without Needle Holder” as the predicate device;

The subject device’s Indication for Use is precisely the same as the selected predicate device “Blood Collection Needle with/without Needle Holder” in K200027; it doesn’t raise new questions on the safety and effectiveness of the subject device.

# Note 2: Needle Gauge

The needle gauge of the subject devices differs from the predicate device, but they still conform to the same applicable performance standards of ISO 9626. Therefore, the difference does not raise new questions about the safety and effectiveness of the proposed device.

Note 3: Needle Length

The needle length of the subject devices is available in more sizes than the predicate device, but they conform to the same applicable performance standards. Therefore, the difference does not raise new questions about the safety and effectiveness of the proposed device.

Note 4: Material Although the materials of these components of subject devices are different from predicate devices, they conform to the same ISO10993-1 biocompatibility standards;

# Performance Testing

To establish substantial equivalence to the identified predicate devices, we performed the tests noted below on the subject devices. The testing results proved that the device complies with the applicable standards requirement and is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

No clinical data was submitted in this submission.

# Conclusions:

Based on the verification test results, the subject devices conform to the exact standards requirements, such as performance and biocompatibility as the predicate devices. The subject device uses the same fundamental scientific technology, the same indications for use, sterilization methods, and the same shelf life and packaging. The different technological characteristics do not raise new or different questions about the safety and effectiveness of the proposed device.
