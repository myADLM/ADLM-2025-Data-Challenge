II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: Modified device   
B Measurand: Folic acid   
C Type of Test: Quantitative; chemiluminescent immunoassay

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Access Folate assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, lithium heparin plasma, and red blood cells using the Access Immunoassay Systems.

Folic acid measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of megaloblastic anemia.

Folate levels in serum, lithium heparin plasma, and red blood cells are used to assess folate status. The serum folate levels is an indicator of recent folate intake. A low RBC folate value can indicate a prolonged folate deficiency.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only For in vitro diagnostic use   
D Special Instrument Requirements: DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Access Folate assay consists of the reagent pack and calibrators. Reagent pack is provided in two assay packs containing 50 tests per pack for 100 tests. The Access Folate reagent pack is consists of the following reagents:

R1a: Mouse monoclonal anti-folate binding protein, paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse IgG, buffer, human serum albumin (HSA) and $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin\* 300. R1b: 1.0M Ascorbate, 0.05N HCl, $\mathsf { p H } 5 . 5$ R1c: Milk folate binding protein (bovine) in buffer, HSA and $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin 300. R1d: Folic acid alkaline phosphate (bovine) conjugate buffer, HSA and $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin 300. • R1e: 0.6M K3PO4

Other materials needed to run the assay, but not included in the kit include: Access Folate Calibrators, Quality Control (QC) materials, Lumi-Phos PRO, UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II, Access Red Blood Cell Folate Lysing Agent, and Access Wash Buffer II.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Access Folate assay is a competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay. For the assay of folate in serum or lithium heparin plasma, no pre-treatment is required. For the assay of folate in red blood cells, a whole blood sample is first treated off-line with a lysing agent composed of ascorbic acid. This pre-treatment hemolyzes the red blood cells and converts the folate to polyglutamic acid forms present in red cells to the monoglutamic acid form predominant in serum. The sample from the pre-treatment of whole blood is defined as hemolysate.

Fifty-five (55) $\mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample $[ 1 0 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ when using the automated dilution feature) is added to a reaction vessel with folate binding protein, mouse anti-folate binding protein, folic acid-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and paramagnetic particles coupled with goat anti-mouse capture antibody. Folate in the sample competes with the folic acid-alkaline phosphatase conjugate for binding sites on a limited amount of folate binding protein. Resulting complexes bind to the solid phase via mouse anti-folate binding protein. After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

Red blood cell (RBC) folate is calculated by multiplying the RBC folate hemolysate result by 21 to correct for the 1:21 dilution that was made during preparation of the hemolysate, and then dividing the result by the patient's hematocrit.

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were conducted following the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline.

Serum: To estimate repeatability and within-laboratory imprecision, five (5) levels of serum were tested using 3 lots of reagent, 3 lots of calibrator, and $3 \mathrm { ~ D x I ~ } 9 0 0 0$ Immunoassay analyzers.

2. Linearity:

# Serum

A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI $\mathrm { E P 0 6 - } 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ edition. A total of 9 levels of serum samples ranging from 0.480 to $3 0 . 8 4 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were prepared by mixing different proportions of a serum sample containing a high concentration of folate with a serum sample containing a low concentration of folate. The lowest sample was run in 8 replicates, and all other samples were run in 4 replicates. Samples were tested on $3 \mathrm { ~ D x I ~ } 9 0 0 0$ Access Immunoassay Analyzers using 3 reagent lots and three calibrator lots. The data was analyzed using a weighted linear regression model. The deviation from linearity did not exceed $5 \%$ within the claimed measuring interval.

# Hemolysate

A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI $\mathrm { E P 0 6 - } 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ edition. A total of 9 levels of hemolysate samples ranging from 0.30 to $3 3 . 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were prepared by mixing different proportions of a hemolysate sample containing a high concentration of folate with a hemolysate sample containing a low concentration of folate. The lowest sample was run in 8 replicates, and all other samples were run in 4 replicates. Samples were tested on a single DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers using a single reagent lot and a single calibrator lot. The data was analyzed using a weighted linear regression model. The deviation from linearity did not exceed $8 \%$ within the claimed measuring interval.

The results support the sponsor’s claimed measuring interval of $2 - 2 4 . 8 \mathrm { n g / m L }$
