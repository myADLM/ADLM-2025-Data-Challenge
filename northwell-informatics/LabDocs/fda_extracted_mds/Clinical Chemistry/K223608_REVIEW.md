III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The GEM Premier 7000 with $\mathrm { i Q M } _ { 3 }$ is a portable critical care system for use by health care professionals to rapidly analyze lithium heparinized whole blood samples at the point of health care delivery in a clinical setting and in a central laboratory.The instrument provides quantitative measurements of pH, pCO2, pO2, sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, glucose, lactate, hematocrit, total bilirubin, and CO-Oximetry (tHb, O2Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb, $\mathbf { s } \mathbf { O } 2 ^ { * }$ ) parameters from arterial, venous, or capillary lithium heparinized whole blood. These parameters, along with derived parameters, aid in the diagnosis of a patient’s acid/base status, electrolyte and metabolite balance and oxygen delivery capacity.

${ } ^ { * } { \bf s } { \bf O } 2 =$ ratio between the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus deoxyhemoglobin.

pH, pCO2, and pO2 measurements in whole blood are used in the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening acid- base disturbances.

Electrolytes in the human body have multiple roles. Nearly all metabolic processes depend on or vary with electrolytes:

– Sodium $\mathrm { ( N a + ) }$ measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease, dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.

– Potassium $( \mathrm { K } ^ { + } )$ measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.

– Ionized calcium $\mathrm { ( C a + + ) }$ measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease, and tetany.

– Chloride (Cl-) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.

Hematocrit $\mathrm { ( H c t ) }$ measurements in whole blood of the packed red cell volume of a blood sample are used to distinguish normal from abnormal states, such as anemia and erythrocytosis (an increase in the number of red cells).

Glucose (Glu) measurement is used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disturbances including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, idiopathic hypoglycemia, and pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.

Lactate (Lac) measurement is used:

– to evaluate the acid-base status of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis;

– to monitor tissue hypoxia and strenuous physical exertion;

– in the diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.

Total Bilirubin (tBili) measurement is used to aid in assessing the risk of kernicterus and hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.

CO-Oximetry (tHb, COHb, MetHb, O2Hb, HHb, and sO2) evaluates the ability of the blood to carry oxygen by measuring total hemoglobin and determining the percentage of functional and dysfunctional hemoglobin species.

– Total Hemoglobin (tHb): Total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure the hemoglobin content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.

– COHb: Carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the carboxyhemoglobin content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.

– MetHb: Methemoglobin measurements are used to determine different conditions of methemoglobinemia.

– HHb: Deoxyhemoglobin, as a fraction of total hemoglobin, is used in combination with oxyhemoglobin to measure oxygen status.

– O2Hb: Oxyhemoglobin, as a fraction of total hemoglobin, is used in combination with deoxyhemoglobin to measure oxygen status.

– sO2: Oxygen saturation, more specifically the ratio between the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus deoxyhemoglobin, is used to measure oxygen status.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

An internal precision study was performed in normal mode (syringe) and in micro mode (capillary) using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples at 5 different levels for each analytes and the results support that the precision is not changed by adding the hemolysis detection feature to the device.

2. Linearity:

Previously established in K160225, K160412, and K160415.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

In addition to the studies described in K160225, K160412, and K160415, a new interference study was performed to evaluate the potential impact of hemolysis interference on potassium results. Venous whole blood was ultrasonically-lysed to generate a high hemolysis pool ( $100 \%$ $= 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ plasma-free hemoglobin). The high hemolysis pool was mixed with native venous whole blood without hemolysis $( 0 \% )$ to generate 3 additional hemolysis levels $( 2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ ). Testing was performed using two concentrations of potassium: $3 . 8 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and $5 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . Each combination of potassium level and hemolysis level was tested in triplicate on 3 GEM Premier 7000 with $\mathrm { i Q M } _ { 3 }$ , using 3 different cartridge lots, for a total of 9 replicates of each hemolysis level/potassium level. Both the normal mode and the micro mode were evaluated. Interference was calculated as the bias between the average result with the interfering substance and the average control measurement. The sponsor considered no significant interference to be $\leq 7 \%$ bias for this study. The highest level of hemolysis with no significant interference was $1 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ plasma-free hemoglobin. Hemolysis of $\ge 1 1 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was found to have significant interferences the with potassium result.

The labeling contains the following statement:

Do not use hemolyzed samples, as hemolyzed samples may cause falsely elevated potassium results. A GEM Premier 7000 with iQM3 hemolysis flag (estimated hemolysis $= 1 1 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ indicates hemolysis interference has been detected and the potassium result should not be reported out of the laboratory. It is strongly recommended that hemolysis detection remain enabled in order to detect hemolysis in samples.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Previously established in K160225, K160412, and K160415.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): As described in K160225, K160412, and K160415.

6. Detection Limit: Previously established in K160225, K160412, and K160415.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not applicable.

8. Accuracy (Instrument): See method comparison study.

9. Carry-Over: Not applicable

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Lithium heparin venous and arterial whole blood and fingerstick capillary samples were assayed by 3 point-of-care (POC) operators at 1 simulated clinical site using 2 GEM Premier 7000 with $\mathrm { i Q M } _ { 3 }$ and 2 GEM Premier 5000. Venous and arterial samples were assayed in normal mode and fingerstick capillary samples were assayed in normal mode and micro mode. Each sample was run in singlicate on 1 GEM Premier 7000 with iQM3 and 1 GEM Premier 5000. Deming Regression was used for analytes with constant SD and PassingBablok was used for analytes with mixed variability. The results support that the addition of the hemolysis detection feature did not impact the accuracy of device results in normal mode or in micro mode.

The representative study results for venous and arterial samples from POC in normal mode are shown below:

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

Previously established in K160225, K160412, and K160415.

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

The GEM Premier 7000 with $\mathrm { i Q M } _ { 3 }$ does not report a specific plasma free hemoglobin result to the user, but displays flags indicating different degrees of hemolysis (mild, moderate, gross) to represent the estimated hemolysis (plasma free hemoglobin).

To verify the hemolysis flag performance of the GEM Premier 7000 with $\mathrm { i Q M } _ { 3 }$ in whole blood samples, a hemolysis verification study was performed using a volumetric spiking procedure by adjusting native (venous and arterial) whole blood samples with ultrasonically lysed whole blood to span 6 hemolysis index categories to verify the hemolysis flag performance in venous and arterial samples in normal mode. Hemolysate-contrived venous samples transferred to a capillary device were tested in micro mode to verify the hemolysis flag performance in capillary samples. All results were analyzed using a volumetric target value and overall agreement analysis was performed for the pooled dataset (venous, arterial, and transferred capillary samples) as well as for venous, arterial, and transferred capillary samples separately. All samples were correctly flagged, and $9 9 . 2 \%$ of venous, $9 7 . 6 \%$ of arterial, and $9 9 . 2 \%$ of transferred capillary samples were correctly flagged based on the target value of the spiked hemoglobin.
