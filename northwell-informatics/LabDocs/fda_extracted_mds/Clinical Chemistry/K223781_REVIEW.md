# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not applicable.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Quantisal™ II Oral Fluid Collection Device is intended for the collection, preservation, and transport of oral fluid specimens for drugs of abuse testing. The Quantisal II device simultaneously collects two $1 \mathrm { m L } \pm 1 0 \%$ oral fluid samples. Each device contains a split collector made up of two cellulose pads affixed to a two component polypropylene stem and two transportation tubes (labelled A and B).

# B Principle of Operation:

The Quantisal II device is designed to simultaneously collect two oral fluid samples. Each device contains a split collector made up of two cellulose pads with cellulose extending into the interior of a two-component polypropylene stem. Blue dye is pre-applied to the cellulose inside the stem. When the cellulose pads are placed under the tongue of a donor, oral fluid is collected via passive diffusion. Upon saturating the cellulose pad, oral fluid migrates along the cellulose tail through capillary action and dissolves the dye. As oral fluid collection continues, the dye becomes visible in the windows on the stem. Specimen collection is complete when the windows are completely blue on both sides of the stem. The device stem is split into two separate components, collector 1 and collector 2, each of which contains one half of the stem and a single pad saturated with of oral fluid. The separated pads are transferred into provided polypropylene transport tubes (Tube A and Tube B) which contain $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of preservative buffer each. The preservative buffer serves as a reservoir into which analytes may distribute, permitting recovery of analytes from the pad during the time the specimens are in storage or being transported.
