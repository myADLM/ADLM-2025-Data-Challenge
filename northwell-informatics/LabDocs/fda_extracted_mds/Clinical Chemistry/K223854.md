Dear Patty Cronan:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn).

# 4. Description of The Devices

The Unistik $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ShieldLock is a sterile, single use, multi-sample blood collection set for use by healthcare professionals to obtain venous blood specimens from patients when used in conjunction with blood collection tubes or syringes. The Unistik Shield Lock is a ‘butterfly needle’ with wings, the color of the wings is unique for each needle gauge to assist with identification. The Unistik ShieldLock is designed for prescription use only and is to be used only by healthcare professionals for patients who are required to have venous blood specimens collected.

The Unistik® VacuFlip is a sterile, single use, multi-sample blood collection vacuum needle for use by healthcare professionals to obtain venous blood specimens from patients when used in conjunction with blood collection tubes or syringes. The Unistik VacuFlip is a ‘vacuum needle’ and is designed with a user activated integral sharps injury prevention feature, the safety shield, which can be activated after the needle is removed from the vein to help prevent needlestick injuries. The safety shield features a textured surface to help improve grip during activation. An audible click signals that the safety shield is activated and is locked in place, covering the needle, and preventing reuse. The color of the safety shield is unique for each needle gauge to assist with identification. The Unistik VacuFlip is designed for prescription use only and is to be used only by healthcare professionals for patients who are required to have venous blood specimens collected.

The subject devices comply with the acceptance criteria established based on the specifications of the devices. All additional performance tests met the acceptance criteria.

The results from these tests demonstrate that the Unistik® ShieldLock and Unistik VacuFlip are safe and effective when used as intended.

# Biocompatibility:

In accordance with ISO 10993-1:2018, the Unistik® ShieldLock and Unistik VacuFlip devices are classified as shown in Table 5.6 below.

Table 5.6 - ISO 10993-1:2018 classification of Unistik® SheildLock & VacuFlip

Based on available information and biocompatibility reports available for the device and its components, Owen Mumford concludes that the device meets all requirements according to ISO 10993 and FDA guidance when used as intended.

The following Biocompatibility standards were used when assessing the biocompatibility of the subject devices:

ISO 10993-5:2009 Biological evaluation of medical devices Part 5: Tests for in vitro cytotoxicity. ISO 10993-10:2010 Biological evaluation of medical devices Part 10: Tests for irritation and skin sensitization ISO 10993-11:2017 Biological evaluation of medical devices Part 11: Tests for systemic toxicity ASTM F756-2017 Standard Practice for Assessment of Hemolytic Properties of Materials. ISO 10993-4:2017 Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 4: Selection of tests for

interactions with blood

# Sterilization:

The Unistik® ShieldLock Blood Collection Set & Unistik VacuFlip Blood Collection Needle are supplied to the user in a sterile state and remain sterile for 5 years from the date of sterilization. The devices are single-use and are not intended to be reprocessed and re-used. The Unistik $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ShieldLock Blood Collection Set & Unistik VacuFlip Blood Collection Needle are sterilized by ethylene oxide sterilization in Accordance with ISO 11135-1:2014. The sterilization cycle below was validated per over kill method as qualified in accordance with Annex B of ISO 11135-1:2014 – “Sterilization of health-care products — Ethylene oxide — Requirements for the development, validation and routine control of a sterilization process for medical devices — Amendment 1: Revision of Annex E, Single batch release”.

The following standards were used to assess the sterility and shelf life of the device:

ISO 11135-1:2014 – “Sterilization of health-care products — Ethylene oxide — Requirements for the development, validation and routine control of a sterilization process for medical devices — Amendment 1: Revision of Annex E, Single batch release”   
ISO 10993-7:2008 - Biological evaluation of medical devices   
Simulated Transportation Test: ISTA 3A (2018)   
ASTM F88/F88M-15 Standard test method for seal strength of flexible barrier materials (Sterility) ASTM F 1929-15 Standard test method for detecting seal leaks in porous medical packaging by dye penetration   
ASTM F1886 / F1886M-16, Standard Test Method for Determining Integrity of Seals for Flexible Packaging by Visual Inspection

# 8. Clinical Testing

No clinical testing was performed as this device does not require clinical studies to demonstrate substantial equivalence with the predicate device

# 9. Conclusion

It can be concluded that the differences between the subject devices, Unistik $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ShieldLock Blood Collection set and Unistik $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ VacuFlip and predicate devices do not raise any new or different questions of safety or effectiveness. The subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices, BD Vacutaine $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ UltraTouch™ Push Button Blood Collection Set, cleared under K212724 and BD Vacutaine $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Eclipse™ Blood Collection Needle, cleared under K982541.
