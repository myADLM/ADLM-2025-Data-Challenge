Dear Diana Hong:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical

The Indications for Use between proposed device and predicate device is similar. Because the needle holder is used as part of the predicate device, the proposed device is an independent needle holder, the Luer adapter with Holder, but the Indications for Use are the same. Therefore, this difference is not determined to affect substantially equivalence on safety and effectiveness.

# Analysis 2 -Configuration and material

The configuration difference between proposed device and predicate device is only the description of component. They have same configuration. The difference in the description of component does not affect the indications for use. In addition, the material of rubber sleeve from proposed device is different with predicate device. However, the biocompatibility test for proposed device has been tested and the results comply with the requirements of ISO 10993. Therefore, this difference is not determined to affect substantially equivalence on safety and effectiveness.

Analysis 3 -Needle Gauge and Length

The needle gauge and length of between the proposed device and predicate device is different. However, this difference is just in dimension. Different gauge and length device will be selected by the end user. In addition, needles were tested according to ISO 7864:2016 and ISO 9626:2016 standards, and the results met the requirements of the standards. Therefore, this difference does not affect raise new or different questions of safety or effectiveness

9. Non-Clinical Test Conclusion

The test results demonstrated that the proposed device complies with the following standards and guidance. The following tests were conducted as applicable to the subject devices:

Biocompatibility tests was conducted on the subject device, include in vitro cytotoxicity test (ISO 10993- 5), skin sensitization test (ISO 10993-10), and irritation sensitivity (ISO 10993-10), Acute Systemic Toxicity (ISO 10993-11), Pyrogen (USP ${ < } 1 5 1 >$ ), Hemolysis Test (ASTM F756-2017), Complement Activation Test (ISO 10993-4), Partial Thromboplastin Time Study (ISO 10993-4) and Platelet Leukocyte Count Study (ISO 10993-4).

# 10. Clinical Test Conclusion

No clinical study is included in this submission as the device does not require clinical studies to determine substantial equivalence with the predicate device

11. Conclusion

It can be concluded that the differences between the subject devices, Blood collection Set with/without holder, Safety Blood Collection set with/without holder, Blood Collection Needle with/without Holder, Safety Blood Collection Needle with/without holder and Luer Adapter with Holder, and the predicate devices, Blood Collecting Needle, Safety Blood Collecting Needle, Blood Collecting Needle with Holder, Safety Blood Collecting Needle with Holder, Blood Collecting Set, Safety Blood Collecting Set, Blood Collecting Set with Holder and Safety Blood Collecting Set, do not raise any new or different questions of safety or effectiveness. The subject devices are substantially equivalent to the predicate devices cleared under K172763 with respect to the indications for use, target population, treatment method, and technological characteristics.
