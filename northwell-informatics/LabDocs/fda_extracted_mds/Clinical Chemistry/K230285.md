# IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge is used with the i-STAT 1 analyzer as part of the i-STAT 1 System and contains test reagents to measure $\mathrm { p H }$ , partial pressure of oxygen $\left( P 0 _ { 2 } \right)$ , and partial pressure of carbon dioxide $\left( P \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } } \right)$ in arterial, venous or capillary whole blood.

The i-STAT 1 System is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical device intended for the quantitative determination of various clinical chemistry tests contained within i-STAT cartridges using whole blood. The i-STAT 1 System consists of a portable blood analyzer (i-STAT 1 analyzer), single-use disposable test cartridges (i-STAT cartridges), liquid quality control and calibration verification materials, and accessories (i-STAT 1 Downloader/Recharger, i-STAT Electronic Simulator and i-STAT 1 Printer). The i-STAT 1 System, including the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge, is designed for use by trained medical professionals in point of care or clinical laboratory settings and is for prescription use only.

The $i { - } S T A T C G \delta { + }$ cartridge contains the required sensors, a fluid pack (calibrant pouch), a sample entry well and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement within cartridge. The i-STAT cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. All the test steps and fluid movement occur within the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood applied to the cartridge using a transfer device by the trained user before the cartridge is placed within the analyzer.

The i-STAT 1 analyzer is a handheld, in vitro diagnostic analytical device designed to run only i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts with the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result (within approximately 2 minutes).

# V. INTENDED USE STATEMENT

The i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is intended for use in the in vitro quantification of pH, partial pressure of oxygen $\left( P 0 _ { 2 } \right)$ , and partial pressure of carbon dioxide $\left( P \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } } \right)$ in arterial, venous, or capillary whole blood in point of care or clinical laboratory settings.

$\mathrm { p H }$ , $P 0 _ { 2 }$ , and $P \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ measurements are used in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of respiratory, metabolic and acid-base disturbances.

# ii. Multi-site and operator-to-operator precision (Aqueous materials)

Multi-day precision testing was performed at three (3) sites using a panel of aqueous solutions containing five (5) levels of pH, $P 0 _ { 2 }$ , and $P \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ . At each site, each level was tested once a day by two (2) operators for five (5) days on six (6) i-STAT 1 analyzers using i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridges. Within-run, between-day, betweenoperator and within-site (total) variance components were calculated by site. These components were also calculated for all sites combined and provided in the Table 3 below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

i. Linearity

The study was designed based on CLSI EP06-Ed2: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures – Second Edition.

The linearity of the i-STAT pH, $P 0 _ { 2 } ,$ , and $P \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ tests in the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was evaluated by preparing whole blood samples of varying analyte levels for each $i .$ -STAT test. The i-STAT pH, $P 0 _ { 2 }$ , and $P \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ tests in the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge demonstrated linearity over the reportable range for each i-STAT test. Regression summary of the response for each i-STAT test versus the concentration of the whole blood samples of varying analyte levels is provided in Table 5 for $i { - } S T A T C G \delta { + }$ cartridge.

# c. Detection Limit

i. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The study was based on the CLSI EP17-A2: Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.

The LoQ of the i-STAT pH, $P 0 _ { 2 }$ and $P \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ tests in the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge was evaluated on the $i { - } S T A T { 1 }$ analyzer using two (2) i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge lots and whole blood that was altered to a low analyte level for each i-STAT test. The LoQ for the i-STAT pH, PO2, and PCO2 tests in the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge and i-STAT $E G 7 +$ cartridge was determined to be at or below the lower limit of the reportable range for each of the i-STAT tests as shown in Table 6.

# d. Analytical Specificity

# i. Interference

The study was based on CLSI EP07-ED3: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Third Edition.

The interference performance of the i-STAT pH, $P 0 _ { 2 }$ , and $P \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ tests in the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge on the i-STAT 1 analyzer with the $i \cdot$ -STAT 1 System was evaluated using whole blood samples based on CLSI EP07-ED3: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Third Edition. The effect of each substance was evaluated by comparing the performance of a control sample, spiked with blank solvent

solution, with the test results from a test sample spiked with the potentially interfering substance at the toxic/pathological concentration based on CLSI EP37- ED1: Supplemental Tables for Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, First Edition, as applicable. A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference between the control and test samples was outside of the allowable error $\mathrm { ( \pm E a ) }$ for the i-STAT test. For an identified interferent, a dose-response was performed to determine the degree of interference as a function of the substance concentration.

Table 7 contains the lists of potentially interfering substances tested and the interference results for the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge.

# B. Comparison Studies

# a. Method Comparison with Comparator Device

Method comparison for arterial, venous, and capillary whole blood specimens on the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was demonstrated in studies based on CLSI EP09c-ED3: Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples – Third Edition.

Lithium heparin venous and arterial whole blood specimens collected across multiple point of care sites were evaluated using i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridges on the i-STAT 1 analyzer against whole blood specimens tested on a comparative method. For pH, $P 0 _ { 2 }$ , and $P \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ , a Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis was performed using the first replicate result from the i-STAT 1 analyzer versus the singlicate result from the comparative method.

Two (2) capillary whole blood specimens collected from skin puncture with balanced heparin capillary tubes from each study subject across multiple point of care sites were evaluated and analyzed in singlicate on the $i – S T A T 1$ analyzer against the comparative method. A Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis for $\mathrm { p H }$ , $P 0 _ { 2 }$ , and $P \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ was

performed using the singlicate result from the i-STAT 1 analyzer versus the singlicate result of the comparative method.

The venous, arterial, and capillary whole blood data were pooled, and a Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis was performed using the results from the i-STAT CG8+ cartridges on the i-STAT 1 analyzer versus the comparative method results.

Method comparison results for arterial, venous, and capillary whole blood specimens are shown in Table 9. In the table, N is the number of specimens in the data set, and r is the correlation coefficient.

# b. Matrix Equivalence

A matrix equivalence study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the i-STAT $\mathrm { p H }$ , $P 0 _ { 2 }$ and $P \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ tests in the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge on the i-STAT 1 System using non-anticoagulated venous and arterial whole blood specimens. The study design and analysis method were based on recommendations from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline EP35: Assessment of Equivalence or Suitability of Specimen Types for Medical Laboratory Measurement Procedures, 1st ed. The matrix equivalence of each test in the i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridge was assessed by comparing arterial or venous whole blood specimens collected without anticoagulant (candidate specimen type) to samples collected with balanced heparin or lithium heparin anticoagulant (primary specimen type). Each specimen was tested in duplicate using two (2) i-STAT $C G 8 +$ cartridges with two (2) i-STAT 1 analyzers. A Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis was performed using the first replicate result from the candidate (y-axis) versus the mean result from the primary specimen (x-axis). The regression analysis results are summarized in Table 12. In the table, N is the number of specimens in the data set, and r is the correlation coefficient.
