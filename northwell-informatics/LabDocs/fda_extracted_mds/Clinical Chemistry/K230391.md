# Device Description

The BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System family of devices is a capillary blood collection solution designed to collect, separate, transport, and store capillary blood samples from a finger stick that are clinically equivalent to both capillary and venous comparator tubes. The system is designed to standardize the capillary blood collection procedure, thereby allowing users who are trained to use the subject device, but who may not otherwise have been trained in phlebotomy, to collect fingerstick capillary blood samples. The BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System is intended to be used by trained healthcare workers in ancillary healthcare facilities and clinical use environments (e.g., retail pharmacies, clinics).

The BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System with BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary Blood Collection Tube (MiniDraw™ SST™ System) is a subset of components in the BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System. It is intended to collect a whole blood specimen from a finger and deliver a serum sample for measurement of specific analytes listed in the Indication for Use. The BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary Blood Collection Tube (MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube) contains a silica-based clot activator solution and a gel that creates a barrier between serum and cells during centrifugation. The tube has a unique barcode that links the tube with the patient.

The MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube is designed to be used in combination with the BD MiniDraw™ Finger Sleeve (available in four sizes), the BD Microtainer® Contact-Activated Lancet (clearance K223243), and three accessories; BD MiniDraw™ Finger Sizing Tool, BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Tube Adapter SST™ and BD MiniDraw™ Cap Removal Tool.

# Method Comparison

This study was performed to evaluate Clinical Equivalence between the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube and respective capillary and venous comparator devices, BD Microtainer® SST™ Tubes (BD Microtainer® SST™) and Greiner Bio-One Vacuette® Serum Tubes with Clot Activator and Gel Separator (Greiner Vacuette Serum), for the serum chemistry analytes identified above. This assessment considered whether the mean and $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval (CI) were within the Clinical Acceptance Limits (CALs).

MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube vs BD Microtainer® SST™ (Capillary Comparator): Comparison of the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube vs BD Microtainer® SST™ demonstrated clinical equivalence at all medical decision levels for all analytes identified above.

MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube vs Greiner Vacuette Serum (Venous Comparator): Comparison of the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube vs Greiner Vacuette Serum led to a conclusion that the mean and $9 5 \%$ CI of biases were within CALs identified above

# Lot to Lot Variability

This study was performed to evaluate the total variability (lot-to-lot and within lot) of the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube for the selected chemistry analytes and included testing in comparator devices (BD Microtainer $^ { \textregistered } \mathrm { S S T I M }$ and Greiner Vacuette Serum) for . The acceptance criteria were met for each selected analyte, therefore, the lot variability in the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube was considered acceptable.

# Within-Tube Type Stability

This study evaluated within-tube type stability of selected chemistry analytes in the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube for up to 4 hours at room temperature and up to 48 hours at refrigerated conditions.

The MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube demonstrated within-tube type stability up to 4 hours with room temperature storage and up to 48 hours with refrigerated storage for all evaluated chemistry analytes.

# Operator Variability

This study was performed to evaluate operator variability of the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube for selected serum chemistry analytes. The respective capillary and venous comparator devices, BD Microtainer® SST™ and Greiner Vacuette Serum were also tested in this study. The acceptance criteria were met for each selected analyte, therefore, the operator variability in the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube was considered acceptable.

# Shelf-Life

The purpose of this study was to evaluate product shelf-life by evaluating real time aged 9 $( + 1 )$ months MiniDraw™ SST™ Tubes in comparison with newly manufactured MiniDraw™ SST™ Tubes. The BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary Blood Collection Tube aged $9 ( + 1 )$ months at both high and low temperature conditions demonstrated clinically equivalent performance when compared with the newly manufactured BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary Blood Collection Tube for the selected serum chemistry analytes identified above that were evaluated in the study.

# Conclusion

The comparison between the proposed device (MiniDraw™ SST™ System) and the predicate device (BD Microtainer® SST™) shows that they have the same fundamental technology and technological characteristics and any differences in technology do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness. The intended use of the MiniDraw™ SST™ System is also considered to be the same as the predicate device.

The performance bench testing based on applicable standards and internal specifications demonstrates that acceptance criteria were met.

During clinical performance testing, the evaluation device, MiniDraw™ SST™ System was compared to the predicate device and the blood collected in each tube was analyzed for identified chemistry analytes and produced test results that are clinically equivalent to both the capillary and venous comparator tubes. The results generated in the clinical performance testing for Method Comparison (Clinical Equivalence), Lot to Lot Variability, Stability, Operator Variability and Shelf-Life demonstrated appropriate performance.

Based on information provided in this submission the MiniDraw™ SST™ System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
