Dear Valerie Followell:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn).

# IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The K-SHIELD Zen is a sterile, single use winged blood collection set consisting with a cannula, flexible tube, connection parts and the Press Button anti-needle stick protector designed to minimize accidental needlestick injuries when accessing peripheral veins to collect patient blood. The Press Button anti-needle stick protector stores the needle within the housing when the activation button is pressed after blood collection procedure.

This product has a variety of Needle gauge sizes (21G, 23G, 25G) and a lineup of 3 types of connection parts, Luer connector (PBM), Multiple Sample Luer Adapter (PBMA) and Preattached Holder (PBMH). During blood collection, the Luer connector is connected to a syringe. Multiple Sample Luer Adapter and Pre-attached holder are connected to vacuum blood collection tubes / blood culture bottles to obtain multiple samples. The different configurations (connection options) are chosen by the user based on facility blood collection procedure.

The mechanism of action for the device, all configurations, is blood collection using syringes or vacuum blood collection tubes / blood culture bottles to assist the user with obtaining blood from a patient.

The K-SHIELD Zen is a single use, disposable Ethylene Oxide Sterilized medical device. Sterilization Validation was conducted per ISO 11135: 2014 – Sterilization of Health-Care Products – Ethylene Oxide –Requirements for the Development, Validation, and Routine Control of a Sterilization Process for Medical Devices.

The K-SHIELD Zen is considered blood path, indirect, limited contact $( < 2 4$ hours) per ISO 10993-1: 2018 - Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices – Part 1: Evaluation and Testing within a Risk Management Process. All device materials comply with ISO 10993-1.

The K-SHIELD Zen is a sterile, single-use device that consists of the following components:

Winged needle with Press Button Anti-needle Stick Protector • Main Tube • Clip • Connector Tube

Luer Connector • Locking Cap (optional) • Multiple Sample Luer Adapter (optional) • Pre-attached Holder (optional)

The K-SHIELD Zen is intended for use at healthcare facilities or in hospitals.

# V. INTENDED USE
