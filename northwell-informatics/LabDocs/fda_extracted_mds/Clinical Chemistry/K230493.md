# Performance Testing – Animal Summary

No animal studies were performed in support of this submission.

# Performance Testing - Clinical

The clinical performance evaluation of the MiniDraw™ EDTA System was based on applicable standards, guidance documents, statistical evaluation and accepted medical decision levels. Studies were performed internally at BD’s Franklin Lakes laboratory, or externally at Babson Diagnostics’ laboratory, externally at Research Management, Inc. (RMI) or at some combination of these sites. Clinical performance testing was performed to demonstrate that blood specimens collected in MiniDraw™ EDTA Tube produced test results that are clinically equivalent to both the capillary and venous comparator tubes by performing the following studies: Method Comparison (Clinical Equivalence), Lot to Lot Variability, Within-Tube Type Stability, Operator Variability and Shelf Life. Results were evaluated in accordance with the associated Statistical Analysis Plan for BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System. Data generated from the studies were compared to the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

Testing was performed on identified analytes (i.e., Hemoglobin $\mathrm { ( H g B ) }$ and Hematocrit (HCT)).

# Method Comparison

This study was performed to evaluate Clinical Equivalence between the MiniDraw™ H&H Tube and respective capillary and venous comparator devices, BD Microtainer® Microtube for Automated Processes (BD MAP EDTA) and Greiner Vacuette® Blood Collection Tube with $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA (Greiner Vacuette EDTA), for the analytes identified above. This assessment considered whether the mean and the two one-sided $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limits of the paired sample biases were within the Clinical Acceptance Limits (CALs).

MiniDraw™ H&H Tube vs BD MAP EDTA (Capillary Comparator): The performance of the MiniDraw H&H Tube was considered clinically equivalent to the BD MAP EDTA for both analytes identified above.

MiniDraw™ H&H Tube vs Greiner Vacuette EDTA (Venous Comparator): The performance of the MiniDraw H&H Tube was considered clinically equivalent to the Greiner Vacuette EDTA for both analytes identified above.

# Lot to Lot Variability

This study was performed to evaluate non-inferiority of the MiniDraw™ H&H Tube in comparison to respective comparator devices (BD MAP EDTA and Greiner Vacuette EDTA) for total variability (lot-to-lot and within lot) for the analytes identified above.

MiniDraw™ H&H Tube vs BD MAP EDTA [Capillary comparator]: This evaluation led to the conclusion that the MiniDraw™ H&H Tube passed the non-inferiority criterion (which included lot to lot variation and within lot) for the analytes identified above when compared with capillary comparator, BD MAP EDTA.

• MiniDraw™ H&H Tube vs Greiner Vacuette EDTA [Venous comparator]: This evaluation led to the conclusion that MiniDraw™ H&H Tube passed the non-inferiority criterion (which included lot to lot variation and within lot) for all the analytes identified above when compared with venous comparator, Greiner Vacuette EDTA.

# Within-Tube Type Stability

This study evaluated within-tube type stability of analytes identified above in the MiniDraw™ H&H Tube for up to 4 hours at room temperature and up to 48 hours at refrigerated conditions.

The MiniDraw™ H&H Tube demonstrated within-tube type stability up to 4 hours with room temperature storage and up to 48 hours with refrigerated storage for all evaluated analytes.

# Operator Variability

This study was performed to evaluate operator variability of the MiniDraw™ H&H Tube and respective capillary and venous comparator devices, BD MAP EDTA and Greiner Vacuette EDTA for analytes identified above.

• MiniDraw™ H&H Tube vs BD MAP EDTA [Capillary comparator]: This evaluation led to the conclusion that the MiniDraw™ H&H Tube passed the non-inferiority criterion for operator variability for the analytes identified above when compared with capillary comparator, BD MAP EDTA.   
• MiniDraw™ H&H Tube vs Greiner Vacuette EDTA [Venous comparator]: This evaluation led to the conclusion that MiniDraw™ H&H Tube passed the non-inferiority criterion for operator variability for all the analytes identified above when compared with venous comparator, Greiner Vacuette EDTA.

# Shelf-Life

The purpose of this study was to evaluate product shelf-life by evaluating real time aged 9 $( + 1 )$ months MiniDraw™ H&H Tubes in comparison with newly manufactured MiniDraw™ H&H Tubes. The MiniDraw™ H&H Tubes aged 9 $( + 1 )$ months at both high and low temperature conditions demonstrated clinically equivalent performance when compared with the newly manufactured MiniDraw™ H&H Tubes for the analytes identified above that were evaluated in the study.

# Conclusion

The comparison between the proposed device (MiniDraw™ H&H System) and the predicate device (BD MAP EDTA) shows that they have the same fundamental technology and technological characteristics and any differences in technology do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness. The intended use of the MiniDraw™ H&H System is also considered to be the same as the predicate device.

The performance bench testing based on applicable standards and internal specifications demonstrates that acceptance criteria were met.

During clinical performance testing, the evaluation device, MiniDraw™ H&H System was compared to the predicate device and the blood collected in each tube was analyzed for identified hemoglobin and hematocrit and produced test results that are considered clinically equivalent to the capillary and venous comparator tubes. The results generated in the clinical performance testing for Method Comparison (Clinical Equivalence), Lot to Lot Variability, Within-Tube Type Stability, Operator Variability and Shelf Life demonstrated appropriate performance.

Based on information provided in this submission the MiniDraw™ H&H System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
