# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

The method comparison study was conducted at two clinical testing sites including 126 subjects 18 years of age or older collected from five representative collection sites. Participants were enrolled at various collection sites representative of the ancillary health care site of the intended use environment to enroll patient populations. Blood was collected from each participant into the capillary (BD MiniDraw H&H System and BD MAP EDTA) study tubes. Samples were tested for the Hemoglobin $\mathrm { ( H g B ) }$ and Hematocrit (HCT) analytes on Sysmex XN-1000 (Sampling Module XN-10). Deming or Passing Bablok Regression was used to estimate average differences between the evaluation tube (BD MiniDraw H&H System) and the comparator tube (BD MAP EDTA) at medically relevant points for each analyte.

The results are summarized in the following table:

Regression Parameter Estimates – BD MiniDraw™ H&H System vs BD MAP EDTA   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Parameter</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HCT</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>117</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2 (-0.73, 0.91)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1 (0.98, 1.03)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.979</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HGB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>117</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1 (-0.07, 0.23)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1 (0.99, 1.01)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.982</td></tr></table>

The result demonstrated that the BD MiniDraw H&H System demonstrated the substantial equivalent performance for the tested parameters (HGB and HCT) compared to the BD MAP EDTA.

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

A capillary vs. venous matrix comparison study consisting of 117 normal and pathological paired capillary K2EDTA whole blood and venous K2EDTA whole blood specimens were used. Paired specimens collected from the same individuals were assayed in duplicate on the Sysmex XN-1000 to compare performance between capillary whole blood samples and venous whole blood samples, and the results were analyzed for Hemoglobin $\mathrm { ( H g B ) }$ and Hematocrit (HCT). The test result for each parameter was compared between venous and capillary blood to determine if there were any differences. The investigation found no statistical or clinical differences using venous or capillary blood for the analytes Hemoglobin $\mathrm { ( H g B ) }$ and Hematocrit (HCT). The result demonstrates the comparable performance characteristics for K2EDTA capillary and K2EDTA venous whole blood samples and the venous whole blood is acceptable for use in tube-specific clinical assessments (i.e., shelf-life and lot-to-lot precision studies).
