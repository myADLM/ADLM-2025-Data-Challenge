# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor evaluated precision of the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2 Immunoassay system in several studies following the recommendations in CLSI EP5-A3.

Four lithium heparin plasma samples with troponin concentrations spanning the assay range were each tested on a single Access 2 in duplicate, in two runs per day, over 20 days for a total of 40 runs and a minimum of 80 replicates per platform using a single reagent pack lot at a single site. All four samples used were unique pools of native patient samples. The two highest concentration samples (1,200 and $1 5 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ targets) were spiked with a natively sourced troponin.

The within-laboratory (total) imprecision includes within-run (repeatability), between-run, and between-day variance components. Variance components analysis was used to estimate within-run, between run, and between-day, $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and SD. Results for this study are shown below:

The results of the study support that the enhanced washing protocol did not impact the precision of the test system.

# 2. Linearity:

The sponsor evaluated the linearity of the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2 Instrument following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A2 using both serum and lithium heparin plasma sample types covering the full range of the assay. The results of the study demonstrate that the mitigation (the enhanced washing procedure) did not impact the linearity of the test system.

Hook Effect: Same as described in K172787.

# Dilution Recovery:

The sponsor has changed the validated dilution scheme and provided data to support a dilution ratio of 1:5.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The Analytical Specificity/Interference performance was evaluated in K172787 and the claims are unchanged.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

$2 . 0 \cdot 2 7 , 0 2 7 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$

The sponsor performed studies to evaluate intra-assay carryover and included a limitation in the labeling describing the carryover observed. In the study, when a sample with $\mathrm { c T n I } >$ $1 5 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { n g / L } )$ was tested on an Access 2 system, intra-assay carryover was observed if an Access hsTnI was tested after a high cTnI sample. The extent of carryover observed was directly proportional to the cTnI concentration that was present in the high sample. In the studies, the estimated carryover was $3 { - } 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { n g / L } )$ from a high sample at $2 7 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { n g / L } )$ and $5 { - } 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { n g / L } )$ from a high sample at $5 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { n g / L } )$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability and stability is the same as described in K172787, except the stability of frozen samples has been updated to support the storage of frozen samples at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for up to 180 days.

# 6. Detection Limit:

Studies were performed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2 instrument using the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2. Blank samples were used in the LoB studies, lithium heparin samples and serum samples were used in the LoD and LoQ studies. The results provided for LoB, LoD, and LoQ demonstrate that the modification to the assay workflow did not impact the claimed measuring range of $2 . 0 { - } 2 7 { , } 0 2 7 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

7. Assay Cut-Off:

The Assay Cut-off was evaluated in K172787.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Two method comparison studies were completed to assess the impact of the modification using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c. The first study evaluated 40 Lithium Heparin Plasma and 49 Serum samples across three (3) Access 2 instruments. The second method comparison study was performed to evaluate 51 Lithium Heparin Plasma and 53 Serum samples across two (2) Access 2 instruments. Each sample was measured using the proposed test system and the predicate test system. Each sample was measured in duplicate. The first replicate result from each sample was utilized to fit a Passing-Bablok linear regression model. Representative results are shown below:

The results of the method comparison study (including analyses around the cutoffs) show that the performance of the assay is unchanged since its clearance in K172787.

# 2. Thermal Method Comparison:

Two Thermal Sensitivity studies were completed to assess the impact of the design change on the Thermal Sensitivity of the hsTnI immunoassay on the Access 2 Immunoassay system using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c. In the first study, more than 80 samples (Lithium Heparin Plasma and Serum) were analyzed across 2 Access 2 instruments. Each sample was measured at each of three different ambient room temperature conditions and calibration temperature conditions ( $1 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). The second study evaluated more than 80 samples (Lithium Heparin Plasma and Serum) across 2 Access 2 instruments. The results were analyzed using Passing-Bablok linear regression comparing each potential run temperature/calibration temperature combination.

The results of the thermal method comparison studies support that the performance of the assay is unchanged since its clearance in K172787.
