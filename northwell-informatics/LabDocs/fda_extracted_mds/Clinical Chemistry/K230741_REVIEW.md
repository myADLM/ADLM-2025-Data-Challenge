# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Macro & Micro-Test HCG Pregnancy Test Midstream is a qualitative lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The midstream kits consist of one test device and a package insert. The result is displayed within the “result window” by two distinct colored lines, one control line and one test line.

# B Principle of Operation:

The tests use a double antibody sandwich immunochromatography method to detect hCG in human urine. Goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody is coated at the quality control line on the nitrocellulose membrane, and hCG monoclonal antibody is coated at the test line on the nitrocellulose membrane. hCG monoclonal antibody labeled with red tracers is coated on the glass cellulose membrane. After application of the urine specimen, the sample flows upward under the action of chromatography and hCG in the sample binds to the anti-hCG and is captured by the hCG monoclonal antibody at the test line, thus a red band appears at the test line. If hCG is not present or the concentration is too low, no red band appears at the test line. Regardless of the hCG concentration in the samples, a red band will form at the quality control line where goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody will bind to hCG monoclonal antibody. The test result is shown in the result window and is read visually 5 to 10 minutes after urine application. Two distinct colored lines, one in the test zone and another in the control zone indicate a positive test result (pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the test zone and only a colored line in the control zone indicates a negative test result (not pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the control zone, even in the presence of a colored line in the test zone, indicates an invalid test result.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Urine samples from non-pregnant females (negative) were spiked with $0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , 12.5 mIU/mL, $1 8 . 7 5 \mathrm { \ m I U / m L }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , $5 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ of hCG. Three (3) lots of Macro & Micro-Test HCG Pregnancy Test Midstream were used to test each hCG concentration in replicates of 10 per day, at 3 sites. A total of 150 replicates were tested for at each hCG concentration. Testing was repeated for 5 non-consecutive days. The device has $100 \%$ positive detection at the claimed sensitivity of $2 5 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ and above. There were no significant differences in performance between lots, between operators, between time of day and between days. Summary of results are presented in the following tables.

2. Linearity:

Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Cross-reactivity:

The candidate device was tested for potential cross-reactivity from follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Each potential crossreactant was spiked into a negative pooled human urine sample (control) and a positive pooled human urine sample containing 25mIU/mL hCG (test). Test and control samples were tested in replicates of 5 with 3 lots of the candidate device (Macro & Micro-Test HCG Pregnancy Test Midstream). The results demonstrated no cross-reactivity from potential cross-reactants up to 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ TSH in either negative or positive urine samples.

Interference from exogenous and endogenous substances:

Urine samples from non-pregnant women were collected (negative samples) and half were spiked with hCG to final concentration of $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (positive samples). All samples were spiked with final concentrations of potential interferents listed in the below table. For each condition 15 replicates were tested on 3 device lots by a single operator. The results demonstrated no interference from substances at the concentrations shown in the table below.

# Effect of hCG Beta Core Fragment:

Urine samples from non-pregnant females (negative) were used to prepare samples at $0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (negative) and $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (positive) hCG. The positive and negative samples were then spiked with the hCG $\beta$ -core fragment concentrations of $5 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ and $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The results demonstrated that the candidate device is not affected by concentrations of hCG $\beta .$ -core fragment up to $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

# Effect of urine pH:

To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples containing $0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ of hCG were adjusted to $\mathsf { p H }$ values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0. The results demonstrated that changes in $\mathsf { p H }$ ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.

# Effect of urine specific gravity:

To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples containing 0 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ of hCG were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.00, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030 and 1.035. The results demonstrated that changes in specific gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.

# High dose hook effect study:

Urine samples from non-pregnant women were used to prepare samples with hCG concentrations of $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ , $1 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , $5 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . Each of the samples was tested using 3 lots of the device. No hook effect was observed at concentrations up to $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L h C }$ CG.
