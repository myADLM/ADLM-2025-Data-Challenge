A Device Description:

# Alinity ci-series

The Alinity i System (previously cleared in k170317) and the Alinity c System (previously cleared in k170316) were designed to be combined into multimodule configurations. The Alinity ci-series is comprised of individual processing modules that may be arranged into individual or multimodule configurations which include either multiple Alinity i processing modules, multiple Alinity c processing modules, or a combination of up to four of both Alinity i and Alinity c processing modules with a shared system control module (SCM). The SCM includes the reagent and sample manager (RSM). The multimodule configurations do not have a separate device label or list number. In a multimodule configuration, each processing module retains its original unique identification label and each multimodule configuration includes a single shared SCM with a single shared RSM. The Alinity ci-series is comprised of the following components and functions:

System Control Module (SCM): contains a user interface computer that provides software interface to the Alinity ci-series and provides an interface to a host or middleware computer. The power supply operates the user interface computer and the Reagent and Sample Manager (RSM). Reagent and Sample Manager (RSM): Transport system used to load calibrators, controls, specimens, reagents, and onboard solutions (e.g., lifts, positions, and moves racks and cartridges to and from different areas). One primary RSM transports samples and reagents through an Alinity ci-series. • Alinity i processing module: uses chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) detection technology to measure analyte concentration in samples. It is an immunoassay analyzer that can process up to 200 CMIA tests per hour and has 47 positions in the reagent carousel to hold assay reagent cartridges and calibrators/control racks at a controlled temperature. Alinity c processing module: uses photometric detection technology to measure sample absorbance for the quantification of analyte concentration and uses potentiometric

detection technology to measure the electrical potential in a sample. An integrated chip technology (ICT) module is used to measure potentiometric assays (electrolytes). The ICT module contains $\mathrm { N a + }$ , $\mathrm { K } +$ , Cl-, and reference electrodes to potentiometrically measure the concentration of analytes in samples. It is a chemistry analyzer that can process up to 1350 photometric and potentiometric tests per hour and has 70 positions in the reagent carousel to hold assay reagent cartridges and calibrators/control racks at a controlled temperature.

Multimodule Integration Kit: provides the necessary components to physically connect the different processing modules, extending them to the RSM and creating a shared load platform for multimodule configurations. The components in this kit include fasteners, waste manifold, different length drive belt and cables including communications, power, ethernet, motor, and ground.

# Alinity i Total $\mathbf { \beta }$ -hCG Reagent Kit (Previously cleared in k170317)

The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG Reagent Kit consists of magnetic microbeads coated with anti-hCG monoclonal antibody in TRIS buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizers and anti-hCG monoclonal antibody labeled with acridinium in MES buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizers. The Reagent Kit is composed of two cartridges, and each cartridge contains two vials (microparticle antibody and conjugate antibody) and a spacer (empty cartridge).

# Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit (Previously cleared in k170316)

The Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit consists of ATP•2Na $( 9 . 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ), NAD $( 5 . 0 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), G-6- PDH $\left( 3 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / L } \right)$ , hexokinase ( $1 5 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / L } )$ , and preservative: sodium azide $( 0 . 0 5 \% )$ .

# Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent (Previously cleared in k170320)

The Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent consists of $6 8 . 2 \mathrm { m L }$ reagent 1 and buffer for 9350 tests (935 tests per cartridge, x10 cartridges per kit). One test per sample can generate one to three results $( \mathrm { N a } + , \mathrm { K } ^ { + } ;$ , and Cl-).

# B Principle of Operation:

The Alinity i System module is a fully automated immunoassay analyzer allowing random and continuous access, as well as priority and automated retest processing using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. CMIA technology is used to determine the presence of antigens, antibodies, and analytes in samples. The Alinity c System is a fully automated, random access chemistry analyzer using detection technologies such as quantitative ion selective electrodes (with an integrated chip technology module) or colorimetric, enzymatic methods to determine analyte concentrations in body fluids.

The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG Reagent Kit is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative and qualitative determination of $\beta$ -hCG in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. A specific mouse anti-hCG monoclonal antibody is coated on the magnetic beads; another monoclonal antibody is labeled with an acridinium-labeled conjugate. After addition of sample, calibrator, or controls to the microbeadantibody conjugate, the mixture is incubated in the reaction vessel (RV) allowing $\beta$ -hCG present in samples, calibrator, or controls to bind to the monoclonal antibody on the bead. A magnet attracts the paramagnetic microparticles (which are bound to $\beta$ -hCG) to a wall of the RV. The wash zone assembly washes the reaction mixture to remove unbound materials. After a washing step, the chemiluminescent, acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to the RV, reacting with hCG already bound to the magnetic beads to form sandwich complexes. The wash zone assembly washes the reaction mixture once more to remove unbound materials. Subsequently, the PreTrigger Solution (hydrogen peroxide) is added to prepare the mixture for the chemiluminescent reaction. Then the Trigger Solution (sodium hydroxide) is added to initiate a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as Relative Light Units, which is proportional to the concentration of total $\beta$ -hCG present in samples. For qualitative interpretation of the Alinity I Total $\beta$ -hCG test results, specimens with $\beta$ -hCG levels less than or equal to 5.00 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ will be reported in the INTERPRETATION field on the test results screen or printout as “NEGATIVE.” Specimens with $\beta$ -hCG greater than or equal to $2 5 . 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ will be reported as “POSITIVE.” Specimens with $\beta$ -hCG levels greater than $5 . 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and less than $2 5 . 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ will be reported with concentrations only. No interpretation will be reported for these results.

The concentration of glucose is determined by the glucose hexokinase method. Glucose in the specimen is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) oxidizes G-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH). The NADH produced is detected spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) for sodium, potassium, and chloride utilize membranes selective to each of these ions. An electrical potential (voltage) is developed across the membranes between the reference and measuring electrodes in accordance with the Nernst equation. The voltage is compared to previously determined calibrator voltages and converted into ion concentration.

# Alinity c ICT Potassium Method Comparison

A total of 105 human serum specimens spanning the measuring range (1.0 to $1 0 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ of the assay were tested. $5 . 7 \%$ of the samples were contrived by adding potassium chloride analyte (at $< 5 \%$ ) to a native human serum samples to create high potassium samples. The samples were tested in singlicate using one lot of reagents, calibrators, and controls on one Alinity ci-series instrument and on one Alinity c system in a single-module configuration over at least three days. The table below shows the Passing-Bablok Linear Regression results.
