# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

The submission is to obtain clearance for the GLP systems Track, a laboratory automation system (LAS) used with clinical chemistry and immunoassay systems such as the Alinity i system and the Alinity ci series.

The manufacturer uses the performance of Total $\beta$ -hCG assay to compare results obtained from specimens when the same analyzer pipette aspirated either from the instrument front (manualloaded) or from the instrument back (GLP systems Track loaded).

# B Measurand:

Total beta human chorionic gonadotropin $\beta$ -hCG)

# C Type of Test:

Quantitative and qualitative, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The GLP systems Track is a modular laboratory automation system designed to automate preanalytical and post- analytical processing, including sample handling, in order to automate sample processing in clinical laboratories. The system consolidates multiple analytical instruments into a unified workflow.

The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) used for the quantitative and qualitative determination of beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( $\beta$ -hCG) in human serum and plasma for the early detection of pregnancy on the Alinity i analyzer.

Alinity i System

The Alinity i System is a fully automated analyzer allowing random and continuous access, as well as priority and automated retest processing using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. CMIA technology is used to determine the presence of antigens, antibodies, and analytes in samples.

Alinity ci-series

The Alinity ci-series is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only.

The Alinity ci-series is a System comprised of individual Alinity i or Alinity c analyzers/processing modules that may be arranged into individual or multimodule configurations including up to four Alinity i processing modules, up to four Alinity c processing modules, or a combination of up to four of Alinity i and Alinity c processing modules with a shared system control module to form a single workstation.

The Alinity c System is a fully automated, random/continuous access, clinical chemistry analyzer intended for the in vitro determination of analytes in body fluids.

The Alinity i System is a fully automated analyzer allowing random and continuous access, as well as priority and automated retest processing using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Alinity i system and Alinity ci series

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The GLP systems Track is a modular laboratory automation system (LAS) used to perform multiple pre-analytical and post-analytical steps to automate sample preparation and distribution processes in clinical laboratories. These processes include bar code identification of samples, decapping of samples, centrifugation, aliquoting of samples, transport of samples between processes (modules), and delivery of samples to one or more Abbott and third Party commercially available laboratory analyzers, capping of samples, and storage of samples. Each module includes a built-in touchscreen, a user interface that functions as a central operating and display element. Due to the modular nature of the LAS, customers may select modules and configurations to fit their laboratory needs.

# Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG Reagent Kit

The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG Reagent Kit consists of magnetic microbeads coated with anti- $\beta$ -hCG monoclonal antibody in TRIS buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizers and anti-hCG monoclonal antibody labeled with acridinium in MES buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizers. The Reagent Kit is composed of two cartridges, and each cartridge contains two vials (microparticle antibody and conjugate antibody) and a spacer (empty cartridge).

# B Principle of Operation:

The Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative and qualitative determination of $\beta$ -hCG in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. Sample and anti- $\beta$ -hCG coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined and incubated. The $\beta$ -hCG present in the sample binds to the anti- $\beta$ -hCG coated microparticles. The mixture is washed. Anti- $\beta$ -hCG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). There is a direct relationship between the amount of $\beta$ -hCG in the sample and the RLUs detected by the system optics.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: GLP systems Track

2. Specimen Identification: Barcode identification of patient samples. GLP systems Track reads sample bar codes and electronically communicates sample identification number to the analyzers.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The patient’s sample tubes are loaded onto the GLP systems Track Input/Output Module (IOM) or BulkLoader Module to be centrifuged, de-capped, aliquoted, recapped and stored. The sample bar codes are read to direct the sample to a specific analyzer.

4. Calibration: Provided in k170317 (Alinity i Total ß-hCG Reagent Kit, Alinity i System)

5. Quality Control: Provided in k170317 (Alinity i Total ß-hCG Reagent Kit, Alinity i System)

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed based on recommendations in CLSI EP09c. The method comparison study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between results from specimens that were loaded using the GLP systems Track (investigational method) and on the same Alinity ci-series where specimens were loaded in the front (comparator method). A total of 117 native human serum samples spanning the measuring range of the Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG (beta human chorionic gonadotropin) assay were tested. For both methods (i.e., investigational and comparator), samples were tested in singlicate using one lot of reagents, calibrators, and controls on one Alinity ci-series instrument over the course of three nonconsecutive days. Only samples with results that were within the measuring interval of the Alinity i Total $\beta$ -hCG assay were included in the analysis. A Deming regression analysis was performed using all samples by comparing the result from the investigational method versus the result from the comparator method. The regression analysis result is summarized in the table below:
