C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Do not use if foreign matter is present or if tube is damaged.

Fluoride powdered additives may be white to pale pink. Do not use if it is any other color.

Follow your facility’s procedures if clots or other visible obstructions are present in the sample as this could lead to the inability to test the sample.

Any change in blood collection tube type, size, handling, processing, or storage condition for a particular laboratory assay should be evaluated by the laboratory for each instrument/reagent system per the laboratory's standard procedures.

BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes may contain trace levels of tert‑butanol, ethylbenzene, formate, hexane, 2‑methylpentane, 3‑methylpentane, and xylene. It has not been determined if the presence of trace levels of these compounds will affect test results in chromatography‑based assays.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not applicable. Specific analyzers used to evaluate the device are listed in the labeling and in section VII.B.1. Method Comparison, below.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

A Device Description:

The BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes are evacuated, sterile, single use tubes intended to be used in settings where venous blood samples would be collected by trained healthcare professionals for the collection, containment, preservation, transportation, and centrifugation of blood in a closed tube.

BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes are available in plastic $1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 7 5 \mathrm { m m }$ and $1 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$ configurations with draw volumes from 2.0 to $6 \mathrm { m L }$ . The configurations contain various additive combinations in a blended powder mixture, including the additives Potassium Oxalate $( \mathrm { k O x } )$ and Na2-EDTA which provide an anticoagulated specimen when used according to the instructions for use. The tubes containing $\mathbf { N a } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA can be used to produce plasma samples to measure glucose. The tubes containing $\mathrm { k O x }$ can be used to produce plasma samples to measure glucose or lactate. The blended powder mixture contains sodium fluoride (NaF), which acts as an antiglycolytic agent. Tubes include a gray color‑coded BD Hemogard™ Closure indicative of the NaF additive. Tube stoppers are lubricated with silicone to facilitate stopper insertion.

# B Principle of Operation:

The BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes are intended to be placed inside any BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Needle Holder of the standard size or an adapter of a blood collection system. Once the vein of the patient has been penetrated using a standard needle, center the collection tube in the holder and push the tube fully onto the needle, puncturing the stopper of the tube. The tube uses a controlled vacuum to pull a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube. Once the pressure is equalized, the blood flow ceases, and the tube is removed from the needle holder or needle. Immediately after the blood has been drawn, the tube is gently inverted 8 times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant and antiglycolytic. The BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes are centrifuged at $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { R C F }$ (relative centrifuge force or $\textrm { \textbf { g } } ^ { \ \mathrm { : } } \mathrm { s } ^ { \mathrm { \scriptsize } }$ ). The whole blood is then processed to plasma for various clinical laboratory testing.

A study was conducted to evaluate equivalence between the BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes $6 \mathrm { m L }$ BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Sodium Fluoride / Potassium Oxalate and $2 \mathrm { m L }$ BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Sodium Fluoride / Na2EDTA) and a cleared comparator tube (NaF/K Oxalate Blood Collection Tubes, $2 \mathrm { m L }$ ) for testing glucose and lactate. All samples were collected by routine venipuncture using standard phlebotomy techniques. In addition, contrived samples were prepared to obtain results that spanned the analytical measurement range for the tested analytes. Glucose and Lactate were evaluated on two instrument platforms each and demonstrated comparable results between the candidate tubes and the comparator tubes.

Immediately after collection and prior to centrifugation, tubes were inspected for complete fill, clot formation and stopper leakage. After centrifugation, additional visual assessments were performed. Tubes were then handled and processed according to manufacturer’s recommended handling conditions for tube inversions and centrifugation time and force. Biases between tube types were estimated with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals. Regression analyses for a representative tube using each instrument platform are provided in the tables below:
