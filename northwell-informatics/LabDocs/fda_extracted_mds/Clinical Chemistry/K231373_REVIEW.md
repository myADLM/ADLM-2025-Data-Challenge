II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New Device   
B Measurand: Not applicable – Blood collection tube.   
C Type of Test: Not applicable

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are evacuated, sterile, single use, in vitro diagnostic medical devices. They are intended to be used by trained healthcare professionals for the collection, containment, preservation, and transport of human venous blood specimens used for in vitro diagnostic testing.

BD Vacutaine $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are used for Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only In vitro diagnostic use only   
• Do not use if foreign matter is present or if tube is damaged. Examine tubes prior to use. K2EDTA is visible in the tube and should appear as clear and colorless dots. K2EDTA spray coated additives may have a white to slightly yellow appearance; this does not affect the performance of the EDTA additive. Do not use the tube if the additive is missing, discolored, or if foreign matter or precipitate is present. BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes have been validated for use with HbA1c and hemotology analytes. They have not been evaluated for Chemistry or Molecular testing in whole blood or plasma. Do not use BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes with lavender caps for trace element testing. Use only BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Trace Element Tubes with royal blue caps for trace element testing.   
• Samples collected in BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are known to have interferences with Magellan Diagnostics LeadCare $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ assays employing the Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (ASV) methodology, and should not be used with assays employing ASV methodology.   
• Venous blood gas samples collected with plastic tubes made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), including BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA tubes, should not be used when testing carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). A clinically significant positive bias with COHb results may occur.   
• BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes should not be used to measure divalent cations (e.g. calcium and magnesium) because the EDTA additive may bind to divalent cations and may cause interference in their measurement, depending on the test methodology.   
• Do not use BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes containing K2EDTA for potassium measurement. Follow your facility’s procedures if clots or other visible obstructions are present in the sample as this could lead to the inability to test the sample. Any change in blood collection tube type, size, handling, processing or storage condition for a particular laboratory assay should be evaluated by the laboratory for each instrument/reagent system per the laboratory's standard procedure. BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Tubes may contain trace levels of Acetone, tert Butanol, Ethylbenzene, Hexane, 2 Methylpentane, 3 Methylpentane, and Xylene. It has not been

determined if the presence of trace levels of these compounds will affect test results in chromatography-based assays.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not applicable. Several FDA cleared test systems with different technologies were used in the validation studies.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are plastic, evacuated, sterile, single use, in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The tube consists of a Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Hemogard™ Closure Assembly, a plastic tube, and EDTA (dipotassium) additive. The EDTA anticoagulant is spray coated in the dipotassium (K2) form. The EDTA additive prevents specimen coagulation. The tube closure is lavender color-coded to indicate the presence of the EDTA additive. Tube stoppers are lubricated with silicone to facilitate stopper insertion. The tubes are available in $1 3 \mathrm { x } 7 5 \mathrm { m m }$ , $1 3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$ and $1 6 \mathrm { x } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$ configurations with draw volumes ranging from 2.0 to $1 0 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ . The same BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes for hematology testing were cleared in K213670.

# B Principle of Operation:

The BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes use controlled vacuum to draw a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube. The interior of the tube wall is spray coated with K2EDTA which binds calcium ions thus blocking the coagulation cascade. The presence of a surfactant is intended to reduce adhesion of red blood cells and fibrin to the tube walls. The tubes are compatible with BD Vacutainer $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Blood Collection Needles, Blood Collection Sets, Transfer Devices, Holders and Adapters. Once the vein of the patient has been penetrated using a standard needle, the collection tube is centered in the holder and pushed onto the needle, puncturing the stopper of the tube. Once the pressure is equalized, the blood flow ceases and the tube is removed from the needle holder or needle. Immediately after the blood has been drawn, the tube is gently inverted 8-10 times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

This study was conducted to evaluate the repeatability (within tube) and reproducibility (lot to lot and tube to tube) of BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes for Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing.

The study included fifty-two participants from clinical settings. Blood was collected from each subject into six BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes. Specimens were tested for HbA1c in duplicate per tube with 2 tubes per lot across 3 lots of tubes and 2 tubes per lot within two hours of collection on two FDA cleared HbA1c test systems with different technologies. Results are summarized in the table below.
