# E Purpose for Submission:

Modifications to the device to add compatibility with the iOS version of the Omnipod 5 App component of the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump.

II Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The SmartBolus Calculator is software intended for the management of diabetes in persons aged 2 and older requiring rapid-acting U-100 insulin. The SmartBolus Calculator calculates a suggested bolus dose based on user-entered carbohydrates, most recent sensor glucose value (or blood glucose reading if using fingerstick), rate of change of the sensor glucose (if applicable), insulin on board (IOB), and programmable correction factor, insulin to carbohydrate ratio, and target glucose value. The SmartBolus Calculator is intended for single patient, home use and requires a prescription.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx – For prescription use only.

This device resides in the Omnipod 5 App and requires the App to function. The SmartBolus Calculator works with the following rapid-acting U-100 insulins: NovoLog® (insulin aspart), Humalog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro), and Admelog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro).

# III Device Description

The SmartBolus Calculator is a software device that resides in the Omnipod 5 App. It requires input parameters and settings from the SmartAdjustTM Technology, a glycemic controller (iAGC) and glucose values from a compatible integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) or blood glucose (BG) values from a blood glucose meter to calculate suggested insulin bolus doses. The SmartBolus Calculator can be used in both openloop (manual mode) and closed-loop (automated mode). When used with a compatible iCGM, the SmartBolus Calculator can use the sensor glucose values and trend information to calculate a suggested bolus dose. When the SmartBolus Calculator is used with manually entered BG readings it suggests a bolus dose based on the same calculations as the currently cleared Omnipod DASH Insulin Management System bolus calculator (K180045, K192659).
