# VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

CLSI EP6 $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Edition: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline

CLSI EP17-A2: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: Previously established in K100130.

2. Linearity:

Linearity studies using EDTA and lithium heparin whole blood and plasma samples were designed and analyzed following the recommendations in the Guideline CLSI EP6 $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Edition: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.

EDTA whole blood and plasma samples, and lithium heparin whole blood and plasma samples with low and high cTnI values were mixed to produce up to 12 levels with concentrations ranging from 1 to $6 4 { , } 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / L }$ . Three dilution series of each sample matrix were prepared and tested with three different lots of reagents (one lot for each dilution series). Each level was tested in replicates of three. The maximum deviation from linearity observed in the study across all sample matrices was $9 . 7 \%$ .

The studies support that the device is linear from 4.1 to $5 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / L }$ .

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Previously established in K100130.

4. Assay Reportable Range: The measuring range of the PATHFAST hs-cTnI-II is from $4 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / L }$ to $5 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): Unchanged from K100130.

6. Detection Limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by testing four lots of reagents and four blank samples. The limit of detection (LoD) for EDTA and lithium heparin whole blood and plasma was determined by testing 4 low level samples and four lots of reagents for each sample matrix.

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was conducted using EDTA and lithium heparin whole blood and plasma samples at concentrations expected to be around the proposed LoQ. The LoQ was determined by testing six samples per sample type and two reagent lots.

The LoB was calculated using the classical approach using nonparametric analysis as described in CLSI EP17-A2 Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures. The LoD was calculated per the classical approach using parametric analysis as described in the CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline. The LoQ was determined based on a precision performance goal of less than $20 \%$ CV.

The results of the study support the assay LoQ of $4 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / L }$ .
