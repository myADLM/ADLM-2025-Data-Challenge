# D Special Instrument Requirements:

StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System (previously cleared under K060345, K063821, K132121, K150281 and K181043) consists of a handheld StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter with docking station and StatStrip Glucose Test Strips (sold separately). The Nova StatStrip Control Solutions (Levels 1, 2 and 3) and Nova StatStrip Linearity Test Kit solutions (5 levels) are also sold separately.

Modifications to the device include a change of the position of the test strip port, addition of wireless charging, changes to the user interface, increase in data storage capacity of operator records and the addition of a validated cleaning and disinfecting wipe.

# B Principle of Operation:

The StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a plasma equivalent result and is displayed on the meter.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter

2. Specimen Identification:

A built-in barcode scanner allows for scanning of the operator ID, patient ID and lot numbers. These fields can also be manually entered. The StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter memory will store 1500 patient tests, 8000 operator records 200 QC test results.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary fingerstick whole blood, arterial, venous, neonatal heel stick and neonatal arterial. The blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

The meter stores patient test data, quality control test data, and other information relating to the patient, patient sample, operator, reagents, and meter. Data is transferred bi-directionally between the meter, data docking station, and separate data management system each time a meter is placed into a data docking station.

4. Calibration:

The meter does not require the user to input a test strip code or perform any other calibration.

5. Quality Control:

Three levels of control solutions (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) and five levels of linearity solutions (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4, Level 5) are available for use with the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling.

Infection Control:

The device is intended for multiple-patient use. To support the changes to the exterior of the meter and the additional claimed cleaning and disinfecting wipe, the sponsor conducted cleaning and disinfection studies with the modified meter. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the external meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with each of the chosen disinfectants separately, Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA registration # 67619-12) and Super Sani Disposable Wipes (EPA registration #9480-4). A robustness study was also conducted by the sponsor that demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) using both of the wipes separately to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.

EMC:

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was found to be compliant.

Software and Cybersecurity:

The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable software validation and cybersecurity testing had been performed and the system was found to be compliant.

Battery life:

A battery consumption and battery life study was performed to assess the number of tests that can be run under normal operating conditions without recharging and demonstrated that the rechargeable battery will last as long as the meter life (minimum of 3 years).

Physical trauma to the meter:

A study was performed to confirm that there are no problems with the functionality of the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter following drop unit testing. The meter was dropped 10 times from a height of 60 inches such that each face of the item made impact with a hard surface (e.g. tile floor). All of the verification results were within the criteria limits and no deterioration in functionality was observed.
