# Device Description

The Access NT-proBNP assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels in human serum and plasma using the automated DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers to aid in the following: 1) diagnosis of patients suspected of acute heart failure in the Emergency Department, 2) assessment of heart failure severity, 3) risk stratification of patients with heart failure, 4) risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome.

The Access NT-proBNP is a two-site immunoenzymatic (sandwich) assay. Paramagnetic particles coated with monoclonal anti-NT-proBNP antibody and monoclonal anti-NTproBNP antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase are added to a reaction vessel along with a surfactant-containing buffer and serum or plasma sample. The human NTproBNP binds to the anti-NT-proBNP antibody on the solid phase, while the anti-NTproBNP antibody–alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with a different antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule. After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

Other items required to use the assay include calibrators, Lumi-Phos PRO, and wash buffer. The Access NT-proBNP reagent packs, Access NT-proBNP calibrators, along with the Access wash buffer, and Lumi-Phos PRO are designed for use on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers in a clinical laboratory setting.

All native patient samples from each sample type were run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay analyzer. The results demonstrate the Access NT

proBNP assay is within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for values $> 5 0 { \mathsf { n g / L } }$ and is within $\pm 5 . 0 \mathsf { n g / L }$ for values $\leq 5 0 \mathrm { \ n g / L }$ . The assay demonstrates acceptable non-linearity across the analytical measuring range $( 1 0 . 0 - 3 5 , 0 0 0 \mathsf { n g / L } )$ .

# Matrix Comparison

Lithium heparin plasma and serum are preferred sample types. EDTA plasma is also an acceptable sample type. A sample type comparison study was performed on the Access NT-proBNP assay. The study included sixty-eight (68) matched serum, lithium heparin and EDTA plasma samples spanning the assay measuring range that were analyzed in replicates of three (3). The results of the study demonstrate all sample types are suitable for use on the Access NTproBNP assay.

# Interfering Substances

Lithium heparin plasma samples that contained NT-proBNP concentrations of approximately 125 and $1 , 8 0 0 \mathrm { n g / L ( p g / m L ) }$ were spiked with the substances listed in Table 5. The spiked samples were run on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The values were calculated based upon CLSI EP07-A3 guidelines. The interference was determined by testing controls (with no interfering substance added) and matched test samples (with interfering substance added). None of the compounds tested were found to cause significant interference (as defined by a shift in $\mathsf { d o s e } > 1 0 \% )$ using the test concentrations provided in the following table.

# Cross Reactivity

A study evaluated the potential for cross-reactivity of substances that are similar in structure to NT-proBNP. Lithium heparin samples that contain NT-proBNP concentrations of $1 2 5 \mathrm { n g / L } \mathrm { ( p g / m L ) }$ and $1 , 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / L }$ (pg/mL) were spiked with concentrations of the substances listed in Table 6. The spiked samples were run on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The values were calculated based upon CLSI EP07-A3 guidelines. No significant cross-reactivity $( > 1 0 \% )$ was observed when the listed substances were tested at the indicated concentrations.

# Expected Values

Each laboratory should validate or establish its own reference intervals to assure proper representation of specific populations.

A multicenter prospective reference interval study was conducted to establish the upper limit of normal (ULN) for Access NT-proBNP in a population of apparently healthy adults. A total of 306 males and 369 females were included with $3 9 . 6 \%$ $\mathtt { < 5 0 }$ , $3 7 . 9 \%$ from 50 to 75, and $2 2 . 5 \% > 7 5$ years of age.

Subjects were surveyed and were excluded if they met any of the following criteria:

• Disease(s) of/or affecting the cardiovascular system   
• Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as current blood pressure $\geq 1 4 0 \mathrm { m m } \nmid$ Hg systolic, or $\geq 8 5$ mm Hg diastolic) • Currently taking medication for cardiovascular disease (except medications to control hypertension)   
• Body-mass index $\left( \mathsf { B M I } \right) \ge 3 0 \mathrm { k g } / \mathsf { m } 2$   
• Diabetes   
• Chronic kidney disease.   
• Other serious chronic disease(s) (e.g. cancer, COPD, HIV, lupus erythematosus, etc.)   
• Acute bacterial or viral infection

Additional surrogate biomarkers were screened, and subjects were also excluded based on abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hsTnI). Descriptive statistics for NT-proBNP concentrations are shown in Table 9.

# Clinical Performance Evaluation

# Clinical Sensitivity

The Access NT-proBNP assay is not intended to be used in isolation; results should be interpreted in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and clinical information.

A multicenter prospective study was conducted to validate clinical performance of the established diagnostic cutoffs and evaluate the clinical utility of the Access NT-proBNP assay on the DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzer as an aid in the diagnosis of adults aged 21 and older presenting to the Emergency Department with a clinical suspicion of acute heart failure. NT-proBNP concentrations were determined in samples from 2,384 patients presenting to the Emergency Department with clinical suspicion of acute heart failure (AHF). Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an independent committee of medical doctors who decided on presence or absence of acute heart failure. Adjudicators were blinded to the Access NT-proBNP assay results. The AHF incidence was $4 4 . 4 \%$ (1059/2384) consisting of $4 8 . 2 \%$ Females (1149/2384) and $5 1 . 8 \%$ (1235/2384) Males, $5 7 . 8 \%$ White or Caucasian (1377/2384), $3 5 . 7 \%$ Black or African American (850/2384), and $6 . 5 \%$ Asian (155/2384). Two subjects did not have their races reported.

Descriptive statistics were determined by age group for the enrolled population and are presented below.

# Access NT-proBNP Correlation to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification in patients diagnosed with acute HF

There was an even distribution of classifications across the 1043 subject group adjudicated to acute HF with a clinical ED site NYHA evaluation and represents the accurate performance estimates for this claim. The population consisted of 450/1043 $( 4 3 . 1 4 \% )$ females and 593/1043 $( 5 6 . 8 6 \% )$ ) males. The descriptive statistics for the Access NT-proBNP results $( \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { L } )$ were determined across gender and are summarized in Table 12.

The JT test of trending was conducted on the 1043 all-subject group, resulting in a Z statistic of 4.1991 and a one-sided $\mathsf { p }$ -value ${ < } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ indicating a significant trend relationship between NT-proBNP values and NYHA classification.

The JT test of trending was conducted on the 450 Female sub-group, resulting in a Z statistic of 3.2729 and a one-sided p-value 0.0005, indicating significant trend relationship between NT-proBNP values and NYHA classification.

The JT test of trending was conducted on the 593 Male sub-group, resulting in a Z statistic of 2.7120 and one-sided p-value 0.0033 indicating significant trend relationship between NT-proBNP value and NT-proBNP values and NYHA classification.

# Comparison to Other Commercially Available NT-proBNP Assays

Samples from the prospective multicenter study were also run on the Elecsys proBNP II assay (Roche Diagnostics) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for each assay, which are presented in the figure below. Area under the curve (AUC) for Access NT-proBNP was 0.8536 ( $9 5 \%$ CI: 0.8362 - 0.8710), demonstrating comparable diagnostic accuracy to the Roche Elecsys proBNP II assay [0.8562 ( $9 5 \%$ CI: 0.8361 - 0.8762)].

# Risk Stratification of Patients with Heart Failure and Acute Coronary Syndrome

An objective and systematic analysis of recent peer-reviewed literature and clinical practice guidelines was conducted to verify clinical performance supporting use of NTproBNP for risk stratification. Prognostic utility was assessed in the following patient groups:

• Patients with heart failure • Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome

Based on peer-reviewed scientific papers, guidelines for an assay measuring the same analyte, and results from clinical performance studies, the measurement of NT-proBNP is recommended as an aid in risk stratification for patient groups listed in the previous paragraph. Studies have consistently demonstrated elevated NT-proBNP concentrations are correlated with increased incidence of cardiovascular events, mortality and composite outcomes.1,2,3

# Conclusion

This submission provides clinical and nonclinical data to assure that the Access NTproBNP assay is safe and effective for the stated intended use and is substantially equivalent to the cleared predicate and reference devices.
