Dear Pooja Kannam:

We have reviewed your section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Additional information about changes that may require a new premarket notification are provided in the FDA guidance documents entitled "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99812/download) and "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99785/download).

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Device Name Monarch Blood Collection Set

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Monarch Safety Blood Collection Set is a sterile, multi-sample, single use fixed winged blood collection set. The device is indicated for general medical use in Healthcare Facilities by medical professionals with the patient population to include both adolescent and adult patients. The Monarch Blood Collection Set is intended to be used with evacuated blood collection tubes and/or blood culture bottles. The Monarch Blood Collection device is to remain under direct supervision of a medical professional during use.

The Monarch Blood Collection set includes a safety feature to prevent accidental needlestick injury during normal handling and disposal. The safety feature is initiated by full manual retraction of the needle from the venipuncture site to prevent accidental needlesticks during handling and disposal. The Monarch Blood Collection set is not intended for infusion, IV administration, or transfusion.

# 5. Device Description

The Monarch Blood Collection Set is a sterile, single-use, winged needle with tubing and luer connector. Each Monarch Blood Collection device is individually wrapped in a blister pouch. Monarch Blood collection sets include configurations for three (3) needle gauges (21, 23, 25) each with a tubing length of 12 inches. All the models are included with the back-end needle and a vacutainer holder.

A blood collection assembly, comprises of a needle assembly fixedly coupled to a fingeractivated actuator and tubing, the needle assembly comprising a needle; a hub including a channel in a top surface of the hub, a proximal end and a distal end, the distal end

defining a cavity and a distal passageway, the channel slidably engaging the fingeractivated actuator such that when the finger-activated actuator is moved from a first position at a distal end of the hub to a second position toward a proximal end of the hub; an active closure assembly including a door and a biasing mechanism positioned within the cavity such that when the finger-activated actuator is in the second position, the biasing mechanism operates to move the door along the cavity to contact the needle; and a support wall positioned adjacent the cavity such that, when the finger-activated actuator is in the second position, the needle contacts the support wall.

Nature of contact duration for the device is limited exposure $\leq 2 4 \mathrm { { h } }$ . Nature of body contact is external communicating device: Circulating blood.

The Monarch Blood Collection set is available in the following models,

# 9. Clinical Testing

Clinical studies are not required to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device.

# 10. Conclusion

The differences between the predicate device and the subject device do not raise new or different questions of safety or effectiveness. The Monarch Blood Collection Set is substantially equivalent to the SOL-GUARD Safety Pull Button Collection Set, K213718 with respect to indications for use, and technological characteristics.
