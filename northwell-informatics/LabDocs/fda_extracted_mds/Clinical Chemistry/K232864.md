# 9. Test Principle

EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II are a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. When the absorbent end is immersed into a sample, the sample is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate (mouse anti-beta HCG monoclonal antibody), flowing across the pre-coated (Goat anti HCG polyclonal antibody) membrane. During the test procedures, hCG in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate and forms a complex. The complex migrates along the membrane to the hCG antibody line (T), and remains captured in the T line. As a result a red colored band develops in the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine, there is no red band in the test zone, indicating a negative result. The Control line should develop in the control zone regardless of the test result. If no lines appear, or if only a red band appears in the test zone, indicating the test result is invalid.

EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II are calibrated against reference material traceable to WHO International Standard $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ edition, NIBSC code 07/364.

# Stability:

Products in sealed foil pouch are stable for 24 months at $2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , based on the real time stability study.

# e. Specificity and cross reactivity

To evaluate specificity, 300 urine samples were collected from healthy, nonpregnant female in pre-menopausal (ages $1 8 { \sim } 4 0$ years old), peri-menopausal $( 4 1 { \sim } 5 5$ years old) and post-menopausal $( > 5 5$ years old) groups. 100 people for each age group. Both dip and midstream testing are evaluated. No false positive results were observed for any of the age groups.

To evaluate cross-reactivity, negative and positive urine samples (0, 5 and 10 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with potential cross reactants $\mathrm { 5 0 0 m I U / m L }$ hLH, 1000 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ hFSH, $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu I U / m L }$ hTSH). These samples were tested in 30 replicates using three device lots. No cross-reactivity was observed at tested concentration. To evaluate the effect of the hCG $\beta$ -core fragment, Negative urine samples (0 and

$5 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG) and positive urine samples (10 and $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG) were spiked with hCG $\beta$ -core fragment $( \mathrm { h C G } \mathrm { \beta c f } )$ at concentrations of $5 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , $1 2 5 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , 250,000pmol/L and 500,000pmol/L. These samples were tested in 30 replicates using three device lots. The device performance is not affected by hCG $\beta \mathrm { . }$ -core fragment concentrations up to $5 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

# f. Interfering substance

To evaluate potential interferers with EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II, urine samples containing 0, 5 and 10 mIU/mL hCG were spiked with the interfering substance to obtain the certain desired test concentration. No interference effect was observed at the tested concentration shown in table below:

To evaluate the effect of urine $\mathsf { p H }$ on the results of EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II, urine samples containing 0, 5 and $1 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG were tested at $\mathsf { p H }$ values of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The results indicated that urine $\mathsf { p H }$ ranges between 4 and 9 does not affect the performance of EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy

Test Midstream II.

To evaluate the effect of urine density on the results of EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II, urine samples containing 0, 5 and $1 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG were tested at density values of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030 and 1.035. The results indicated that urine with a relative density of 1.000 to 1.035 does not affect the performance of EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II.

# B. Method comparison study

Method comparison with predicate device   
The performance of the new device was compared to the predicate test. A total of 206 urine samples were first collected from 206 women presenting to test for pregnancy. Of the total 206 samples, 100 samples were tested by EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I device and the remaining 106 samples were tested by EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II device. Another 100 urine samples were collected from an additional 100 women presenting to test for pregnancy. These additional 100 urine samples were tested by both EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II devices using both the in-stream method and dip method, yielding 200 testing results for each device from the additional 100 urine samples. Test results showed $100 \%$ conformity between the candidate device and the predicate device.

Each lay person was given a questionnaire to assess the readability of the labeling. The results of the questionnaire reflected that the consumers found the test easy to use and that they did not have trouble understanding the labeling and interpreting the results.

# D. Early Pregnancy Test Study

In this study, total 585 urine samples from 65 characterized cycle segments of conceptive cycles were collected from 65 pregnant women. All samples were masked and randomized. Each sample was tested by two formats of the device. The new device detected $6 8 \%$ positive hCG five days before the Expected Menstrual Period (EMP), and $100 \%$ positive hCG on the day of EMP. No differences were observed between different device formats. The following table is the summary of the data.
