# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not applicable.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Quantisal™ Oral Fluid Collection Device is intended for the collection, preservation, and transport of oral fluid specimens for drugs of abuse testing. The Quantisal device is designed to collect $1 \mathrm { m L } \pm 1 0 \%$ oral fluid sample. Each device contains (a) cellulose pad affixed to a polypropylene stem and (b) one transportation tube.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Quantisal device is designed to collect $1 \mathrm { m L } \pm 1 0 \%$ oral fluid sample. Each device contains a collector made up of a cellulose pad with cellulose extending into the interior of a polypropylene stem. Blue dye is pre-applied to the cellulose inside the stem. When the cellulose pad is placed under the tongue of a donor, oral fluid is collected via passive diffusion. Upon saturating the cellulose pad, oral fluid migrates along the cellulose tail through capillary action and dissolves the dye. As oral fluid collection continues, the dye becomes visible in the window on the stem. Specimen collection is complete when the window is completely blue. The collector is then removed from the mouth. The pad is transferred into provided polypropylene transport tube which contains $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of preservative buffer. The preservative buffer serves as a reservoir into which analytes may distribute, permitting recovery of analytes from the pad during the time the specimens are in storage or being transported.

The Quantisal device collects $1 \mathrm { m L }$ sample of neat oral fluid and dilutes it with $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of preservative buffer in each tube. This results in a 1 to 4 dilution factor.
