# 5.5 Device Description

The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (hereinafter also referred to as ‘FSL3 System’) and FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System (hereinafter also referred to as the ‘FSL2 System’) are integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) systems that provide continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide glucose levels, trends, and real-time alarms capability to aid in the management of diabetes. The FSL2 and FSL3 Systems also provide configurable alarms designed to warn the user of Low Glucose, High Glucose or Signal Loss. The user may make treatment decisions based in part on the sensor glucose results provided by both Systems. The FSL2 and FSL3 Systems require a prescription and are intended for home use.

The subject FSL3 System consists of a sensor (the FreeStyle Libre 3 Sensor (FSL3 Sensor) or FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus Sensor (FSL3 Plus Sensor)) and a primary display device (the FreeStyle Libre 3 Reader (FSL3 Reader) or the FreeStyle Libre App (FSL App) [iOS and Android] downloaded to a compatible phone). The FSL3 Reader and the FSL App do not interact with each other.

The subject FSL2 System consists of a sensor (the FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor (FSL2 Sensor) or FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus Sensor (FSL2 Plus Sensor)) and a primary display device (the FreeStyle Libre 2 Reader (FSL2 Reader) or the FSL App (iOS and Android) downloaded to a compatible phone). The FSL2 Reader and FSL App do not interact with each other.

Both the FSL2 and FSL3 Systems are compatible with the Libre Data Sharing API cleared in K223537. The display device of the connected FSL2 or FSL3 Systems, which directly receives the data from the sensor, continues to serve as a primary display device for the glucose data and alarms.

# 5.7 Comparison of Technological Characteristics with the Predicate Device

Amperometric measurement of glucose concentration (via glucose oxidase chemical reaction) in the interstitial fluid is the technological principle for both the subject and predicate devices. The sensor is held in place with an adhesive pad and incorporates a subcutaneously implanted sensor component and associated electronics. The electrochemical sensor component uses glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to an electrode, producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the subcutaneous space. The electrical current signal is converted to a glucose value (in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) for display to the user on the compatible receiver.

At a high-level, the subject and predicate devices are based on the following technological elements:

Compatibility with system-specific sensor.   
• Use of NFC interface for starting new sensors.   
• Use of BLE interface for wireless communication with the sensor.   
• Use of software algorithm for conversion of sensor raw glucose measurements to calculate glucose results.   
Automatic display of glucose results from FSL3 family of sensors without a user-initiated scan. Ability to display of glucose results from FSL2 family of sensors after a user-initiated scan via NFC. Inclusion of software interface to wirelessly communicate with cloud-based application (app only).   
• Interoperability specification provided to authorized partners to allow compatibility with AID systems. Libre Data Sharing API to communicate iCGM data with authorized client software for specific and permitted use cases in accordance with the cleared intended use environments. App Silent Mode feature to silence the Urgent Low Glucose Alarm, Low Glucose Alarm, High Glucose Alarm and Signal Loss Alarm. This feature is turned off by default but can be turned on by the user for a maximum of 6 hours.

The following major technological differences exist between the subject and predicate devices:

• When used with the FSL 2 family of sensors, the subject device FSL App allows automatic display of glucose results without a user-initiated scan. The user may still perform a scan of sensors of the FSL2 System as an option. The predicate FSL2 App required a userinitiated scan to display glucose results.

• The subject device labeling removes the contraindications against CT scan and MRI. Both subject FSL2 and FSL3 Systems are now labeled MR conditional.

• The subject device labeling removes the caution and warning against X-ray.

The subject device FSL App includes an “Alarms Escalation” feature for both iOS and Android. The custom tone volume of High Glucose Alarm, Low Glucose Alarm, Urgent Low Glucose Alarm and Signal Loss Alarm increases incrementally over 30 seconds until the volume reaches maximum level. The final volume of the alarm is same as the alarm volume set in the predicate FSL2 App and FSL3 App. The predicate apps do not include this feature.

# 5.8 Summary of Performance Testing

The following performance characteristics were evaluated to support substantial equivalence:

Software Verification and Validation – Software verification and validation testing and evaluation was conducted in accordance with IEC 62304 and documentation was provided as recommended by FDA Guidance “Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions” dated June 14, 2023, and FDA Guidance “Multiple Function Device Products: Policy and Considerations”, dated July 29, 2020. Results of executed protocols met the acceptance criteria and therefore support that the system software is acceptable for its intended use.

Cybersecurity – ADC has provided cybersecurity risk management documentation for the System that includes analysis of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for data, information and software related to the System accordance with the FDA guidance document, “Cybersecurity in Medical Devices: Quality System Considerations and Content of Premarket Submissions” dated September 27, 2023. For each identified threat and vulnerability risk event scenario, risk assessment of impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability was performed and documented within the cybersecurity risk management documentation. Appropriate risk mitigation controls have been implemented and tested.

Bench Testing – The subject device underwent additional safety and compatibility performance testing for the sensors to support removal of contraindications against X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scans and the modification of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindication to magnetic resonance (MR) conditional. The test results showed all functionality testing acceptance criteria was met. Previous mechanical, electrical, and functional testing established in the predicate device are not affected by the introduction of the FSL App.

The following supportive performance characteristics were established in the predicate device (K223435) and are not affected by the introduction of the FSL App in this 510(k):

Biocompatibility • Sterility • Shelf Life Stability • Packaging Integrity/Shipping Integrity • Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility • Clinical Performance • Human Factors • Interoperability

# 5.9 Conclusion
