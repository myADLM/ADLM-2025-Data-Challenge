II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: Modified Device   
B Measurand: Holotranscobalamin (Active-B12)   
C Type of Test: Quantitative, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of Holotranscobalamin in human serum on the ARCHITECT i System. Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) is used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

D Special Instrument Requirements: ARCHITECT i2000SR system

IV Device/System Characteristics:

A Device Description:

The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) device includes the following: • Microparticles - 1 Bottle $( 6 . 5 \mathrm { m l }$ or $2 6 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ ) Anti-holotranscobalamin (mouse, monoclonal) antibody coated microparticles in HEPES buffer with surfactants. Minimum concentration: $0 . 1 \%$ solids. Preservative: sodium azide. • Conjugate - 1 Bottle $\mathrm { 5 . 8 \ : m L }$ or $2 5 . 8 \mathrm { m L }$ ) Anti-transcobalamin antibody acridiniumlabeled conjugate in MES buffer with surfactants. Minimum concentration: $0 . 1 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Preservatives: Sarafloxacin and Nipasept.

Other materials needed to run the assay, but not included in the kit include: ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) calibrator kit and ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) control kit.

# B Principle of Operation:

The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of Holotranscobalamin in human serum. In the first step, $7 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample with $4 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ buffer and anti-holotranscobalamin coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. Holotranscobalamin present in the sample binds to the anti-holotranscobalamin coated microparticles. After washing, anti-transcobalamin acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of Holotranscobalamin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the instrument.

# 2. Linearity:

A study was performed based on CLSI EP06-Ed2. One high holotranscobalamin native serum sample was diluted using calf serum across 11 dilution levels from 2.26 to $1 3 4 . 1 7 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . All dilutions were assayed in replicates of five (5). Linearity was evaluated using linear regression analysis. The deviation from linearity did not exceed $10 \%$ for samples across the range of LoQ to $1 2 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The results of the linearity study support the claimed analytical measuring range of $5 . 0 { - } 1 2 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

# Dilution Verification

A sample dilution study was conducted to support the claim that samples with holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) concentrations ${ > } 1 2 8 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ can be diluted 1:2, either manually or automatically by the device. The dilution study results support the sponsor’s labeling claims that samples with HoloTC concentrations above 128 pmol/L may be diluted following the instructions for use.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-ED3. Serum samples were spiked into a minimum of two samples with HoloTC concentrations ranging from 20 to $4 5 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ and 70 to $9 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The samples were assayed, and the HoloTC concentrations of the spiked samples were compared to control samples. No significant interference was defined as less than $10 \%$ difference between the mean of control and spiked samples.

The substances and the highest concentration tested which did not cause significant interference are listed below.

Cross-Reactivity Study:

A cross reactivity study was performed to evaluate the potential cross-reactants, apotranscobalamin and haptocorrin. Apotranscobalamin and haptocorrin were spiked into control samples at approximately $5 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ and $5 0 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , respectively. The samples were assayed and the resulting $\%$ cross-reactivity was calculated using the following formula: $\%$ cross reactivity $=$ [(mean concentration of spiked samples in pmol/L) – (mean concentration of control samples in pmol/L) / (concentration of cross reactant in pmol/L)] $\ast 1 0 0 \%$ . The data are summarized in the following table.

The sponsor has the following statements in their labeling:

“Do not use hemolyzed samples. Hemolyzed samples will cause erroneous results.”

“Samples containing concentrations of triglycerides at $> 8 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , total protein at $> 1 5 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , and/or rheumatoid factor a $\mathrm { \Delta _ { 1 } t > 7 0 ~ I U / m L }$ may interfere with ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay results.”

“Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Specimens containing HAMA may produce anomalous values when tested with assay kits such as ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) that employ mouse monoclonal antibodies.”

“Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this interference, and anomalous values may be observed. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.”

# 4. Assay Reportable Range:

5.0-128.0 pmol/L.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay is traceable to an internal reference material which is traceable to another commercially available assay.

The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection, and Limit of Quantitation (LoB, LoD and LoQ) for the ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay were evaluated following guidance in the CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of analyte which has withinlaboratory imprecision less than or equal to $10 \%$ . Results are summarized below.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A comparison study between the candidate ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay and the predicate ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay was conducted according to the CLSI EP09C-ED3 guideline.

A total of 108 samples with HoloTC ranging from 5.4 to $1 2 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ were collected and evaluated: 105 samples were individual native serum samples and 3 samples were diluted using calf serum to cover the low end of the measuring range. The data were analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression and the comparison of the candidate ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay (y) and the predicate ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay $\mathbf { \rho } ( \mathbf { x } )$ , is summarized below:

\*As measured by the predicate.

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

A matrix comparison study was conducted to support the use of the ARCHITECT Active-B12 assay with different sample matrices. Specifically, the study compared values obtained from samples drawn into serum tubes with gel (SST) and serum tubes without gel (Serum clot). Paired SST and Serum clot samples, with HoloTC concentrations ranging from 7.3 to $1 1 9 . 5 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , were collected and tested. The following results were determined using Passing-Bablok regression analysis: y=1.025X-0.819, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 8 5$ .

The results support the sponsor’s claims that the assay is suitable for use with serum tubes with gel (SST) and serum tubes without gel (Serum clot).
