# Device Description

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total $\beta$ -hCG II Reagent Pack (test) is performed using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total $\beta$ -hCG II Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total $\beta$ -hCG II Calibrators on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System.

An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the reaction of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) present in the sample with a microwell coated with   
biotinylated Antibody (mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta$ -hCG) bound to streptavidin, and a Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labelled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta$ -hCG). Unbound materials are removed by washing.   
Ortho Clinical Diagnostics

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total $\beta$ -hCG II Reagent Pack Traditional 510(k)

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of hCG present in the sample.

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total $\beta$ -hCG II Reagent Pack contains:

1 reagent pack containing:

100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta$ -hCG, binds ${ > } 6 0 0$ mIU hCG/well) $1 4 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$ assay reagent (buffer containing mouse serum, bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin and antimicrobial agent) $1 9 . 2 \mathrm { m L }$ conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta$ -hCG, binds ${ \ge } 4 0 0 5$ mIU hCG/mL) in buffer with bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent.

# Nonclinical Performance

Several nonclinical tests were performed.

# Stability Studies

Long term stability and on-board storage performance was evaluated consistent with methods based on CLSI EP25-A.

Long Term Stability: Four runs have been performed on each of 3 Lots at each time-point, monthly intervals, data supports a 52 week shelf-life.

On-board Stability: Three Lots of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total $\beta$ -hCG II reagent pack will be stored opened refrigerated for up to 12 weeks. Four runs were performed on each Lot at each time-point for fresh and open, all results were acceptable and support a claim of 6 weeks on-board stability currently.

# Precision

Precision was evaluated consistent with CLSIdocument EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline—Third Edition. Six (6) precision fluids, covering the analytical measuring interval, were evaluated for performance. For one reagent Lot, two (2) replicates of each precision fluid were run on two (2) occasions per day for twenty (20) days, for a total of 80 data points per fluid.

The data presented are a representation of test performance and are provided as a guideline. Variables such as sample handling and storage, reagent handling and storage, laboratory environment, and system maintenance can affect reproducibility of test results.

# Detection Capability

Detection studies for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total $\beta$ -hCG II reagent pack were evaluated consistent with CLSI document EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Edition. Four serums containing no measurable human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were used for determining the LoB. The study design was 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day over 5 test days $= 2 0$ reps per test fluid x 4 fluids $= 8 0$ replicates $\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 3 ~ \mathrm { l o t s } = 2 4 0$ total replicates. The representative LoB is $0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (IU/L) which supports the claimed LOB of $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

Five samples were used for establishing the LoD, which were targeted at 1 to 5 times the LoB concentration. The LoD samples were neat serum samples containing low levels of endogenous hCG to achieve the approximate target hCG concentrations. The LoD serums were also used to analyze the LoQ via the Precision Profile method. The Total Error Analysis for LoQ was determined by testing a separate set of four LoQ fluids which were then analyzed to calculate the LoQ via the Total Error method. All samples were run using three reagent lots on one VITROS 5600 System, 6 replicates per run, 2 runs per day over 5 test days $= 6 0$ reps per fluid x 5 fluids $= 3 0 0$ replicates x 3 lots $= 9 0 0$ total replicates.

This supports the claimed LoD of $0 . 7 0 \ : \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (IU/L). The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total $\beta$ - hCG II reagent pack was designed to be less than or equal to the currently claimed low end of the measuring range of $2 . 3 9 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (IU/L) at $20 \%$ CV. The representative LoQ using the Total Error approach was determined to be $2 . 3 2 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (IU/L), consistent with CLSI document EP17. The claimed LoQ has been verified at 2.39 mIU/mL (IU/L).

# Linearity

Linearity was established in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP06 2nd edition. In a study with two series, one across the entire range (pools 1a to 10a) and one in the lower range of the assay (pools 1b to 10b). 10 replicates of pools $1 \mathrm { a } / 1 \mathrm { b }$ and $1 0 \mathrm { a } / 1 0 \mathrm { b }$ , and 5 replicates of pools $2 \mathrm { a } / 2 \mathrm { b }$ to $9 \mathrm { a } / 9 \mathrm { b }$ were run on one VITROS 5600 Integrated System. Results support linearity from $1 . 5 1 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (IU/L) to $1 5 6 9 5 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (IU/L).
