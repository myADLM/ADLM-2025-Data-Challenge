C Type of Test: Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase).

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Libre Rio Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is an over-the-counter (OTC) integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) device indicated for non-insulin using persons age 18 and older.

The System detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of euglycemia, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia. The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

OTC - Over The Counter

Contraindication

Diathermy: Remove all parts of your Libre Rio Continuous Glucose Monitoring System before high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of diathermy on the System hasn’t been tested. The exposure may damage the Sensor, which could impact proper device function and cause inaccurate readings.

Do not use the Libre Rio Continuous Glucose Monitoring System if you are on dialysis or critically ill. It is not known how different conditions or medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.

Only apply the Libre Rio Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Sensor to the back of the upper arm. If placed in other areas, the Sensor may not function properly.

Taking more than $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of Vitamin C per day may falsely raise your Libre Rio Continuous Glucose Monitoring System readings. Vitamin C can be found in supplements including multivitamins and cold remedies such as Airborne $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Emergen- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { C } \mathbf { \otimes }$ . See your health care professional to understand how long Vitamin C is active in your body.

D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not Applicable.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Libre Rio Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (herein referred to as the 'Libre Rio System' or 'System') is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to facilitate calculation of glucose values accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose graph). The System is intended for over-the-counter use in a home setting. The System consists of the following components: a Sensor which transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a mobile application Libre Rio App that is downloaded to a compatible smartphone running iOS and Android operating system. The Libre Rio System is compatible with the Libre Data Sharing API cleared under K223537. The display device of the connected Libre Rio System, which directly receives the data from the Sensor, continues to serve as a primary display device of the glucose data.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Libre Rio Continuous Glucose Monitoring System uses an electrochemical sensor to monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor is held in place with an adhesive pad and incorporates both the subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor uses a glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to an electrode, producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the ISF. The system converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) for display to the user on a display device.
