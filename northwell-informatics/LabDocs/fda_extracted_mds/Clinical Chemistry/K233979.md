Dear Manfred Abel:

We have reviewed your section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Additional information about changes that may require a new premarket notification are provided in the FDA guidance documents entitled "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device"

(https://www.fda.gov/media/99812/download) and "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99785/download).

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics

As can be seen in the above table a comparison of the design of the VACUETTE® QUICKSHIELD Complete (Plus) and its features show that both the candidate device and the predicate devices have the same fundamental scientific technology and technological characteristics. The VACUETTE® QUICKSHIELD Complete (Plus) and the predicate devices include the same safety mechanism covering the needle after the blood collection. The used safety mechanisms need to be activated manually. After manual activation of the safety mechanism of candidate device as well as the predicate devices the safe and locked position of the safety mechanism is reached by the Quickshield-needle-cover. The used materials for all products are the same or at least comparable and the differences do not have an influence on the safety and effectiveness of the candidate device. The candidate device and the predicate devices are provided sterile and single use only.

# Comparison of Intended Use

The above comparison table shows the indications for use of the candidate device as well as predicate devices. The indications are comparable in their content so that all products are intended to be used for venous blood collection.

# 7. PERFORMANCE DATA

The VACUETTE® QUICKSHIELD Complete (Plus) is manufactured and verified by testing in conformity with applicable recognized consensus standards like ISO 23908, ISO 7864, and ISO 9626 but not limited to those standards. Simulated use tests were performed for venous blood collection procedure as well as the functionality of the safety mechanism was tested.

The VACUETTE® QUICKSHIELD Complete (Plus) is manufactured and tested in conformity with internal specifications and recognized consensus standards. Performance testing was conducted to demonstrate and support our substantial equivalency claim that the device performs as intended and in an equivalent manner as the predicate devices.

# Sterility testing:

VACUETTE® QUICKSHIELD Complete (Plus) are sterilized by e-beam irradiation for a final Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of $1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ per ISO 11137-1 Sterilization of health care products – Radiation – Part 1: Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization process for medical devices. Bioburden testing for determination of verification dose and subsequently the processing dose was performed in accordance with ISO 11737-1 – Sterilization of medical devices – microbiological methods – Part 1: Determination of a population of microorganisms on products.

# Biocompatibility testing:

Biocompatibility for the VACUETTE® QUICKSHIELD Complete (Plus) was performed in accordance with the standards of the ISO 10993 series and under consideration of the Guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration Stuff – Use of the International Standard ISO 10993-1, “Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process” (Attachment A: Table A.1 Endpoints to be addressed in a biological risk assessment). The holder was classified as “surface device with short term contact to intact skin”, and the cannula was classified as “external communicating device with short term contact to the blood path.” Based on the classification the following biological endpoints were evaluated, and it was demonstrated that the candidate device meets the following standards:

Cytotoxicity (ISO 10993-5) Sensitization (ISO 10993-10)   
• Irritation (ISO 10993-23)   
• Hemocompatibility (ISO 10993-4) Material mediated pyrogenicity (ISO 10993-11) Acute Systemic Toxicity (ISO 10993-11)

# 8. CONCLUSION

The test results and the comparison table above show the VACUETTE® QUICKSHIELD Complete (Plus) is substantially equivalent to its predicate devices with respect to intended use, technological and performance characteristics and does not raise new safety or effectiveness concerns.
