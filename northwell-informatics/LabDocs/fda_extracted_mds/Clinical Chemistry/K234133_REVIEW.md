# A Device Description:

The Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (G7 System) is an interoperable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system intended to continuously measure the glucose in the interstitial fluid, calculate the glucose reading and make this value available to the user. The system is intended for single-patient use at home and requires a prescription.

The G7 System consists of the following primary components: a wearable, consisting of a G7 sensor and transmitter worn on the body and a display device, which can be a G7 Mobile Application (Mobile App) on an iOS or Android OS smart device or a G7 Receiver (Receiver). The G7 System uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless communication between these components.

This submission introduces the Direct to Watch (DTW) feature for users who have a compatible Apple iPhone and Apple Watch. If users choose to enable this feature and the iPhone is not near their smartwatch, the user will be able to receive glucose data and alerts on the G7 Watch App (Watch App) directly from the transmitter. The DTW feature requires updates to the iOS Mobile App and Watch App, which are described in the sections below.

To achieve the intended functions and performance of the G7 System, one sensor and at least one display device (app or receiver) must be used together. The receiving device acts as the primary display device and the user may choose to use only the app (with optional DTW) or the receiver as the sole display device; they may also choose to use multiple display devices simultaneously. The user must pair the display device(s) with each unique sensor to enable communication and start a sensor session. During an active session, the sensor reports new data and provides alerts and information signals to the user. The reportable glucose range for the G7 System is $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Glucose values below this range are reported as ‘LOW’ and glucose values above this range are reported as ‘HIGH’. The sensor has an expected wear period of up to 10 days with an extended 12-hour grace period after the sensor session. The grace period allows additional time for the user to change the sensor at a convenient time.

The G7 System is unchanged from the predicate device, with the exception of the new direct to watch feature.

The G7 System comprises of the following subsystems:

Glucose Sensing Subsystem (GSS): G7 Wearable (Sensor, Transmitter, and Patch) and Applicator Mobile Applications Subsystem (MAS): iOS and Android G7 Mobile Application (iOS App and Android App) Watch Application Subsystem (WAS): G7 Watch App (Watch App) • Receiver Subsystem (RVS): G7 Receiver (Receiver)

Glucose Sensing Subsystem (GSS): G7 Wearable (Sensor, Transmitter, and Patch) and Applicator

The Sensor is a small and flexible wire inserted by the applicator into subcutaneous tissue where it converts glucose into electric current. The Transmitter is pre-connected to the sensor and is worn on the body by the adhesive patch. The Transmitter measures the electric current produced by the sensor and converts these measurements into estimated glucose values (EGV) using an onboard algorithm. The Transmitter is capable of sending glucose data to a display device (mobile app, receiver, or watch app).

Each GSS box also includes an overpatch, which is a general adhesive tape that helps with the adhesion of the wearable to the user’s body.

# Comparison to predicate device

The proposed G7 System uses the same GSS as the predicate device. There are no changes to the GSS as a result of this pre-market notification.

Mobile Applications Subsystem (MAS): iOS and Android G7 Mobile Application (iOS App and Android App)

The G7 Mobile App is available on both iOS and Android platforms for users with a compatible Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled smart device. The Mobile App can be used as a primary display to receive and display glucose readings and trend graphs via BLE communication. The Mobile App provides in-app guidance for the user on how to apply and set up the wearable and how to create a user account. Once the set-up has been completed, the Mobile App receives information from the transmitter and acts as a user interface by indicating the system state (e.g., warm-up period, signal loss, etc.), displaying glucose readings and trend graphs, and alerting the user when glucose levels are outside of a target zone and when specific system states occur. The iOS App (Apple users) can also be used with the Watch Application Subsystem (WAS). When the user downloads the iOS Mobile App from the Apple App Store, they automatically download the Dexcom Watch App.

# Comparison to predicate device

The G7 Mobile App (iOS app only) is being updated for the new feature introduced in this submission, referred to as the Direct to Watch (DTW). With DTW enabled, the user does not always need the phone to see CGM information on the smartwatch. The feature must be enabled and set up via the iOS App. With the new version of the G7 Mobile App, the user has the option to use the G7 Mobile App to turn on, onboard, and configure a Direct to Watch (DTW) feature, which subsequently allows the G7 Watch App to connect directly to the G7 Transmitter. All onboarding, details, and settings of the G7 Watch App are only viewable or configurable on the G7 Mobile App.

# Watch Application Subsystem (WAS): G7 Watch App (Watch App)

Currently, users with compatible smartwatches can use the G7 Watch App to view glucose information and notifications, which are mirrored off of the phone iOS App (referred to as Standard Smartwatch mode). The Watch App is bundled as part of the iOS Mobile App software code and is by default automatically downloaded at the same time the user downloads their Mobile App from the Apple App Store.

# Comparison to predicate device

The new DTW feature allows the Watch App to act as a primary display even when the iPhone is not in range of the wearable (sensor, transmitter). The Watch App can operate with either Direct to Watch (DTW) enabled (Direct to Watch mode) or DTW not enabled (Standard Smartwatch mode). DTW is the subject of this premarket notification. The two user experiences are described below:

• DTW Not Enabled (Standard Smartwatch mode) – this mode is identical to the Watch App included in the predicate device, where the Watch App connects to the G7 Mobile App and mirrors the G7 Mobile App UI. The user’s smart phone is required to be within close proximity of the watch to utilize the Watch App, as the Watch App receives all information from the Mobile App.

• DTW Enabled (DTW mode) – this new smartwatch feature allows the Watch App to connect directly with the G7 Transmitter, after the sensor session has started and the user has enabled the DTW feature on their iOS App. This means that users are not required to keep their smart phones in close proximity to their Watch App in order to receive EGVs and alerts and can instead receive glucose data on their smartwatch directly from the Transmitter.

# Receiver Subsystem (RVS): G7 Receiver (Receiver)

The Receiver is a small handheld device that can also be used as a primary display to receive and display glucose readings and trend graphs via BLE communication with the G7 Transmitter. Similar to the App, the Receiver can alert the user when glucose levels are outside of a target zone and when specific system states occur. The Receiver does not communicate directly with either the iOS App or the Watch App and is therefore not modified for the DTW feature.

# Comparison to predicate device

The proposed G7 System uses the same Receiver Subsystem (RVS) as the predicate device.   
There are no changes to the RVS as a result of this pre-market notification.

# B Principle of Operation:

The G7 CGM System detects glucose levels from the fluid just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using an algorithm to a glucose value read in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which is then transmitted to the display device for the user to see and use accordingly.

The principles of operation of the proposed G7 CGM System remain the same as the predicate.
