• OTC - Over The Counter For in vitro diagnostic use only   
• For self-testing Single-patient use only Not for use on neonates   
• RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel can only use with capillary whole blood samples. DO NOT use the results from alternative sites (palm, forearm) for insulin dose calculations. DO NOT use the results from alternative site testing (palm, forearm) to calibrate Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices. Not for use on critically ill patients, severely hypotensive individuals, patients in shock, dehydrated patients, or in a hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state with or without ketosis.   
• Do not use at altitudes greater than 10,000 feet (3,048 meters).   
• Severe dehydration and excessive water loss may cause inaccurately low results. Not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Use of this device on multiple patients may lead to transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or other bloodborne pathogens.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Meter Max Tel

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel, is designed to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm or forearm. RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel consists of: RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Meter Max Tel, Blood Glucose Test Strip Max, RIGHTEST Control Solution GC700 (Level 1,

Level 2 and Level 4), RIGHTEST Lancing Device and Sterile Lancets (K221062). The RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Test Strip Max is the same as Test Strip Max cleared in K173638. The test strips, control solutions and lancing device can be purchased separately.

# B Principle of Operation:

The RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel is designed to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is achieved by using the amperometric detection method that uses glucose dehydrogenase flavinadenine dinucleotide (GDH-FAD) based chemistry. When a drop of blood is applied to the test strip it is pulled into the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with test strip chemistry generating electrons and producing a current that is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. After the reaction time, the detected current is calculated by the meter and the resulting glucose concentration is displayed by the meter. The RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel system reports glucose results as plasma glucose.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Meter Max Tel

2. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Fresh capillary whole blood from user’s fingertips, palm, or forearm. Samples are to be tested immediately upon collection. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

4. Calibration:

No user calibration is required. The meter is automatically coded.

5. Quality Control:

Three levels of control solution (Level 1, Level 2, Level 4) are for use to perform quality control testing to check whether the system is working properly. Instructions on when to perform a control test, details about the control solution, performing a control test, understanding out-of-range control results are provided in the labeling. User needs to enter the control solution mode (CS mode) on the meter to perform a quality control test. Control solution ranges are printed on the test strip vial label.

This medical device product has functions subject to FDA premarket review as well as functions that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, if the product has functions that are not subject to FDA premarket review, FDA assessed those functions only to the extent that they either could adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to FDA premarket review or they are included as a labeled positive impact that was considered in the assessment of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: Previously established in K231192.

2. Linearity:

The linearity study provided in K231192 supports the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The meter displays “LO” with glucose values below $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and “HI” with glucose values over $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The LO and HI functions were validated and were demonstrated to function as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Previously established in K231192. The sponsor has included the following in the labeling: The sponsor has the following statements in their labeling:

If you have a condition, such as kidney disease or gout, that may cause your blood levels of uric acid to rise to more than $1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the results from your meter may not be correct. If you are taking a high level of vitamin C (ascorbic acid level in your blood $> 3$ $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ), your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, ask your doctor. If you have a condition, such as jaundice, that may cause your blood levels of Conjugated Bilirubin to rise to more than $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the results from your meter may not be correct. • Do not test your blood glucose during or soon after a xylose absorption test. Xylose in the blood can give inaccurate results with this meter.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Glucose $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The system is traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standard reference material NIST SRM #917c. A method comparison was performed using the candidate device and a YSI 2300 comparator method.

Test strip stability protocols and acceptance criteria were previously reviewed in K231192 and found acceptable to support the labeling claims that the test strips are stable for 4 months after first being opened, and that closed vials are stable for 24 months when at the recommended storage temperatures $3 9 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F } - 8 6 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F }$ $( 4 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } - 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } )$ and $10 - 9 0 \%$ relative humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.

6. Detection Limit: The assay reportable range is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Values:

To supplement the previous accuracy performance studies conducted in K231192 and support the broader measuring range claim (from previously cleared $5 0 { - } 5 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in K231192 to $2 0 { \cdot } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ an additional extreme glucose study was performed using 113 capillary blood samples to assess the accuracy of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel at the extreme glucose concentrations at the extreme lower and upper ends of the measuring range. Of the 113 samples, 72 were altered by glycolysis or spiking to achieve appropriate glucose concentrations to achieve 53 samples ranging from 20.4 to 77.4 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose and 60 samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 257 to $5 9 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (as measured by YSI 2300). Each sample was measured on the candidate device and results compared to results obtained on the YSI 2300 analyzer. Results are summarized in the table below:
