The VITROS Troponin I ES Assay was selected as the predicate device for the risk stratification indication for use. The comparison table examines similarities and differences between the candidate and predicate devices for this indication for use. The predicate device was selected based on the following information:

The predicate device is legally marketed (cleared under K062838). The intended use includes the use of Cardiac Troponin I measurements to aid in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, as well as an indication for use for risk stratification. Both assays are sandwich assays using chemiluminescent technology indicating that they share the same technological characteristics.   
 While the predicate device has a wider measuring range, the measuring range for the candidate device is clinically acceptable since critical concentrations for cardiac troponin I $( 9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile values) are at the lower end of the measuring range. Both assays measure concentrations at low levels suitable for cardiac troponin I. As a result, this difference does not raise questions related to safety or effectiveness.   
 The candidate device is more sensitive based on the lower limit of the measuring interval as determined by the Limit of Quantitation.   
 Although the predicate device was considered a high‐sensitivity assay based on the definition available at the time of clearance, the candidate device meets the current definition of a high‐ sensitivity assay which includes an additional requirement for at least $50 \%$ of measurements from healthy individuals used to determine the 99th percentile value to be above the LoD for the device.

Based on this comparison, the performance characteristics of the candidate device are substantially equivalent to the predicate device to support the addition of an indication for use as an aid in prognosis for all‐cause mortality (ACM) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The candidate device is substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the predicate device cleared under K062838, based on the intended use for diagnosis of AMI, as well as a prognosis indication for use, and performance characteristics.

All analytical performance claims for the candidate device remain the same as the device that was previously cleared in K171566. No changes have been made to the physical device. The purpose of this submission is to expand the intended use of the device to include an indication for use to aid in prognosis for all‐cause mortality (ACM) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

# 9. Special Instrument Requirement

The Atellica® IM TnIH assay is for in vitro diagnostic use with the Atellica® IM Analyzer.

The Atellica® IM Analyzer was previously cleared under 510(k) K151792. Please note that the product name associated with this submission is the interim project name of “Trinidad IM System”. The instrument was subsequently assigned the trade name of “Atellica® IM Analyzer”.

# 10. Special Conditions for Use Statements

The assay is intended to be used by licensed healthcare professionals.

This assay is labeled For Professional Use.

# 11. Performance Characteristics – Clinical Study

A clinical performance study was performed to establish additional performance claims for the Atellica® IM TnIH assay.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a baseline Atellica® IM TnIH result in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with signs and symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can predict future mortality or adverse cardiac events.

This prognostic risk analysis utilized the same emergency department cohort previously described in K171566. Following enrollment in the study, a detailed symptom history was obtained for each subject. The following information was collected from each subject’s medical chart: age, gender, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), current cardiac risk factors, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD‐EPI) equation estimate glomerular filtrate rate (eGFR) Interval $( \mathsf { m L } / \mathsf { m i n } / 1 . 7 3 \mathsf { m } ^ { 2 } )$ , concurrent medications, dates of ED admission and discharge, status of ischemic conditions (historically and at ED presentation), and status of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at initial presentation. Current cardiac risk factors included hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, tobacco use, and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Ischemic conditions included myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and revascularization procedures (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery).

Patients presenting to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of ACS were followed up for 30-, 90-, 182-, and 365-day progression to ACM and MACE (consisting of myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization, cardiac death, or heart failure hospitalization). At each time point, the risk (cumulative incidence) and hazard ratios were calculated for populations with baseline cTnI levels ≤ or $>$ the overall 99th percentile value. Kaplan‐Meier curves were generated to display the absolute risk (cumulative incidence) of ACM and MACE outcomes. Analyses were performed for both serum and lithium heparin plasma sample types using the overall 99th percentile value. The following tables present pre‐ and post‐test risk and unadjusted hazard ratios, adjusted hazard ratios, multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) model parameters, and event types, as well as Kaplan‐Meier curves, for the following populations based on the overall 99th percentile value:

Population 1: Entire Population Excluding Subjects with Adjudicated AMI   
Population 2: Entire Population Excluding Subjects with Adjudicated AMI as well as History of   
Incident or Prior MACE   
Population 3: Entire Population Excluding Subjects with Adjudicated AMI and Including those   
with History of Incident or Prior MACE

For Populations 1 and 3, results are shown for lithium heparin plasma samples. Similar results were observed for serum samples. For population 2, results are shown for lithium heparin plasma and serum samples. Confidence intervals were generated in accordance with CLSI EP12‐Ed3.

# 12. Conclusion

The Atellica® IM High‐Sensitivity Troponin I (TnIH) assay is substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the currently marketed predicate device, the VITROS Troponin I ES Assay (K062838). The results of the clinical study provided in this submission support the addition of an indication for use as an aid in prognosis for all‐cause mortality (ACM) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
