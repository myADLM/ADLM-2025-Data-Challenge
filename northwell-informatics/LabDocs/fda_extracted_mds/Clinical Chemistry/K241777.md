Re: K241777 Trade/Device Name: SmartAdjust™ Technology Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1356 Regulation Name: Interoperable Automated Glycemic Controller Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: QJI Dated: June 20, 2024 Received: June 20, 2024

Dear Alexander Hamad:

We have reviewed your section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Additional information about changes that may require a new premarket notification are provided in the FDA guidance documents entitled "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99812/download) and "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99785/download).

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

# Intended Use and IndicaƟons for Use

SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps to automatically increase, decrease, and pause delivery of insulin based on current and predicted glucose values. SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons 2 years of age and older and type 2 diabetes mellitus in persons 18 years of age and older. SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.

# Device DescripƟon

SmartAdjust™ technology is a software-only device that enables automated insulin delivery by taking in glucose inputs from a connected iCGM and calculating insulin micro-bolus outputs for delivery by a connected ACE Pump.

SmartAdjust™ technology is part of the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System, which also includes the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump and the SmartBolus Calculator regulated devices. The Omnipod 5 ACE Pump and the SmartBolus Calculator are functionally independent from SmartAdjust™ technology. SmartAdjust™ technology is intended to be digitally connected to a third party iCGM, the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump, and the SmartBolus Calculator.

The SmartAdjust™ technology software is installed on both the Omnipod 5 Pod and Omnipod 5 Controller (which contains the Omnipod 5 App), the 2 physical components that make up the Omnipod 5 System.

The Omnipod 5 System is a hybrid closed loop system and therefore can operate in either open loop (Manual Mode; SmartAdjust™ technology disabled) or closed loop (Automated Mode; SmartAdjust™ technology enabled). When Automated Mode is turned on, the SmartAdjust™ algorithm (installed on the Pod) controls insulin delivery based on recent CGM values.

# Summary of Non‐Clinical Performance TesƟng

Human Factors Validation: Insulet performed a comprehensive Human Factors process that followed and complied with the FDA-recognized standards IEC 62366-1 and HE75 as well as FDA’s guidance documents Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices – issued February 3, 2016, and Content of Human Factors Information in Medical Device Marketing Submissions – draft issued December 9, 2022. The validation study evaluated behavioral tasks and knowledge tasks with 16 representative study participants. The results of the validation test support the conclusion that SmartAdjust technology (as part of the Omnipod 5 System) is safe and effective for the intended users with type 2 diabetes, uses, and use environments.

Special Controls: Evaluation of the Special Controls for this device (regulation 21 CFR 862.1356) assures the safety and effectiveness of the device.

# Summary of Clinical Performance TesƟng

Insulet performed a clinical study to validate the design of the SmartAdjust algorithm in people 18 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes. The study enrolled 343 participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The primary safety endpoint was the change in HbA1c (noninferiority margin $0 . 3 \%$ ) as measured by comparing participant values at baseline to the end of the study. The mean change in HbA1c was $- 0 . 8 \%$ ( $\mathsf { P } { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ for non-inferiority). No safety concerns associated with the use of the device were identified during the study and there were no unexpected or serious adverse device effects. There were no DKA events, no hospitalizations or emergency visits for severe hypoglycemic events, and no instances of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome reported during the study.

# Conclusion

SmartAdjust™ technology has the same intended use as the predicate device. The indications for use have been updated to add people 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes. Product labeling has been updated to include the expanded indication and clinical study results.

# Inset

SmartAdjust™ technology has the same technological characteristics and principles of operation as the predicate device. There have been no design or software modifications to the subject device in relation to the indication change.

The changes to SmartAdjust™ technology are supported by clinical study and human factors validation data that demonstrates that the devices are substantially equivalent.

The differences between the predicate and subject devices do not raise any different questions about safety and effectiveness, therefore, SmartAdjust™ technology is substantially equivalent to its predicate.
