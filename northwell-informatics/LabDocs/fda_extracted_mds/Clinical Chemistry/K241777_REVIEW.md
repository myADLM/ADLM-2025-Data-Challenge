A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps to automatically increase, decrease, and pause delivery of insulin based on current and predicted glucose values. SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons 2 years of age and older and type 2 diabetes mellitus in persons 18 years of age and older. SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx – For Prescription Use Only

• SmartAdjust™ technology should not be used by anyone under the age of 2 years old. SmartAdjust™ technology should also NOT be used in people who require less than 5 units of insulin per day as the safety of the technology has not been evaluated in this population.   
• Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology in pregnant women, critically ill patients, and those on dialysis. The safety of the SmartAdjust™ technology has not been evaluated in these populations.   
• Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology if you are taking hydroxyurea as it could lead to falsely elevated CGM values and result in over-delivery of insulin that can lead to severe hypoglycemia.   
• Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology if you do NOT have adequate hearing and/or vision to allow recognition of all functions of the Omnipod 5 System, including alerts, alarms, and reminders.   
• SmartAdjust™ technology used with the Omnipod 5 System is designed to use rapidacting U- 100 insulins. The following U-100 rapid-acting insulin analogs have been tested and found to be safe for use in the Pod: NovoLog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin aspart), Humalog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro), and Admelog $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (insulin lispro) for use up to 72 hours (3 days). Before using a different insulin with the Omnipod 5 System, check the insulin drug label and consult your healthcare provider. Refer to the insulin labeling and follow your healthcare provider’s directions for how often to replace the Pod.   
• SmartAdjust™ technology used with the Omnipod 5 System relies on accurate, current CGM values to determine your insulin needs. Always make sure you are using the CGM per manufacturer's instructions and do not extend the sensor wear beyond the recommended duration.   
• Do NOT attempt to use the SmartAdjust™ technology with the Omnipod 5 System before you receive training. Inadequate training could put your health and safety at risk.   
• Device components used with the SmartAdjust™ technology including the pod, CGM transmitter, and CGM sensor must be removed before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or diathermy treatment. In addition, the SmartAdjust™ Controller and smartphone should be placed outside of the procedure room. Exposure to MRI, CT, or diathermy treatment can damage the components.

# III Device Description

SmartAdjust™ technology (the Omnipod 5 interoperable automated glycemic controller, iAGC) is a software-only medical device intended for the management of type 1 diabetes in people 2 years of age and older. With this submission, the sponsor intends to market the device to adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes as well. SmartAdjust™ technology is part of the Omnipod 5 System made of the following components:

• Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (pod) – product code QFG, most recently cleared under K231826   
• SmartAdjust™ Technology – product code QJI, most recently cleared under K232741   
• SmartBolus Calculator – product code QRX, most recently cleared under K231824

Integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) – cleared for use with Dexcom G6 and G7, and Abbott Freestyle Libre 2

The SmartAdjust™ technology software resides on the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (the Omnipod 5 Pod and Omnipod 5 App). The iAGC software is responsible for controlling insulin delivery via compatible ACE Pump when the system is in Automated Mode. iCGM data is transmitted from the iCGM to the ACE Pump via Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The SmartAdjust™ Technology uses this transmitted iCGM data in its calculations. The SmartAdjust™ technology can be turned off, and the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump will operate in Manual Mode, which delivers insulin based on healthcare provider (HCP) or user-defined basal programs.

The SmartAdjust™ technology has three states of operation: Automated Mode, Automated: Limited, and Activity. In Automated Mode, the system calculates insulin delivery every 5 minutes based on the user-customizable glucose target $( 1 1 0 { - } 1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Automated: Limited is enabled when the SmartAdjust™ technology is not receiving data from a connected iCGM for 20 minutes or more and during sensor warm-up. While in Automated: Limited, the user will receive no more than pre-programmed basal insulin. When a valid glucose value is received from the iCGM, the SmartAdjust™ technology will resume delivery of insulin in full Automated Mode. Activity is a temporary mode which the user may select for various time durations during automated mode up to 24 hours. With Activity, the algorithm reduces insulin delivery and sets a temporary glucose target to $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Activity is intended for use during periods when insulin sensitivity is expected to be higher, such as during exercise.

Meal challenge: All study participants completed 4 days of a meal challenge that consisted of a meal that was ≥60 g of carbohydrates. Subjects gave a meal bolus with that meal on days 1 and 3 and skipped a meal bolus on days 2 and 4, and CGM metrics were compared 4 hours post meal. 3. Exercise challenge: All study participants underwent 3 exercise sessions on 3 days. Exercise consisted of 1 hour of mild intensity exercise and 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise. Subjects did not change their glucose target before exercising. Subjects who consumed a meal prior to exercise followed their normal meal bolus routine (i.e., meal boluses were not adjusted to account for exercise), and 93% did not consume a snack prior to exercise. CGM metrics were assessed during exercise, 2 hours after exercise, and overnight after exercise.</td></tr><tr><td>Safety Results</td><td>and the Hypoglycemia Confidence Scale. There was 1 severe hypoglycemia event during the study period, which was attributed to a manual bolus request that was greater than necessary for the food that was consumed. The study algorithm stopped insulin delivery in the setting of a decreasing glucose an hour after the bolus was administered, but the subject still experienced a hypoglycemic event. The subject was able to correct this with oral carbohydrates. There were no other severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis events during the study. There were 14 serious</td></tr></table>

This gave the same point estimate, confidence interval and $p$ -value as above: - $. 0 . 8 \%$ $( - I . 0 \% , - 0 . 7 \% )$ ; $p { < } 0 . 0 0 I$ . Note, any HbA1c measurements outside the analysis window of 42-119 days (6-17 weeks) from AID initiation were treated as missing data.

There was no statistically significant change in HbA1c between sex, income or education level, or other medication use. There was a significant change in HbA1c between different age, race/ethnicity, pre-study carb counting knowledge, and baseline HbA1c. Specifically, the most improvement in HbA1c was noted in Hispanic or other subjects, subject ages 31-45 years old, and subjects who did not carb count prior to this study. Finally, subjects with the highest starting baseline $( \mathrm { H b A l c } \geq 9 \% )$ ) had the greatest improvement in HbA1c from a mean of $1 0 . 1 \%$ to $8 . 1 \%$ .

\* Based on the pre-specified criteria (“CGM analyses will include all participants with $\ge I 6 8$ hours of CGM data during each of the Standard therapy period and the 13-week treatment period.”), $N { = } 2 9 9$ for the glycemic metrics. ^ Similar with medians, robust means do not add up; that is difference of medians is not the same as the median of the differences. On the other hand, standard means add up and thus any inconsistency noticed above is due to rounding.

† Lower scores indicate better outcomes (e.g., less stress/distress related to diabetes, better sleep quality). # As part of the hierarchy testing and because of the $p$ -value ${ \bf \varepsilon } = 0 . 1 0$ for $P S Q I > 5$ the formal testing stopped, and $p$ - values were not given for any outcomes further down on the list.

# Challenge Results

During this clinical study, subjects participated in up to 3 different challenges. Sixty-four subjects participated in a target glucose challenge in which they utilized 3 different glucose targets for 3 days each ( $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $1 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). The mean time in range was the highest in the $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ target group $( 6 6 \% )$ and was lower in the two remaining target groups ( $6 3 \%$ in both). There was no significant difference in time above $1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or 250 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ between all three groups and there was a mean of $0 \%$ time below $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in all three groups.

All subjects participated in the meal challenge which lasted 4 days and consisted of a meal that was $\geq 6 0 ~ \mathrm { g }$ of carbohydrates. Subjects gave a meal bolus on days 1 and 3 and skipped the meal bolus on days 2 and 4. CGM metrics were compared at 4 hours post meal. The mean time in range was elevated when given a bolus $( 5 5 \% )$ compared to without a bolus $( 4 4 \% )$ . There was more time above range when the bolus was skipped, but no difference in time below range for the two different actions.

All subjects also participated in the exercise challenge in which they underwent 3 exercise sessions on 3 separate days. The exercise session consisted of 1 hour of mild intensity exercise and 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise. Subjects did not change their glucose target, nor did they change their behavior for administering meal boluses prior to exercise if a meal was consumed, and $9 3 \%$ of them did not consume a snack prior to exercise. CGM metrics were assessed during exercise, 2 hours after exercise, and overnight after exercise. The mean time in range for all 3 timepoints was the same $( 7 3 \% )$ and time above $1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was the same $( 2 7 \% )$ . There was $0 \%$ time below $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at all three timepoints. There was a slight increase in time above $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in the 2 hours post-exercise.

# Summary of Human Factors Validation Study

Human Factors validation tests were conducted with the Omnipod 5 App installed on a compatible mobile device. A total of 1 feasibility study and 3 formative studies were conducted. This Human Factors program consisted of an iterative design process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining the Omnipod 5 System for the type 2 diabetes indication. Following the 4 total preliminary studies, the final device design was evaluated in the summative study performed with 16 representative participants interacting with the device in a simulated use environment. All study participants received training that was consistent with the training that patients would receive with the commercial product. Usability evaluations assess comprehension and usability of the device for critical device tasks. Results of the study demonstrated that the device could be used safely by intended users in the intended use environment.
