# D Special Instrument Requirements:

CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose Meter CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT GEN Blood Glucose Meter

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE and CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems consist of a meter (CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE blood glucose meter and CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT GEN blood glucose meter respectively) and blood glucose test strips (CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS blood glucose test strips and CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT blood glucose test strips respectively). CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT control solutions (Level 1 and Level 2), MICROLET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT lancing device and MICROLET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ lancets (K220633), and the CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Diabetes app are to be used with the systems and are provided separately. The CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Diabetes App is used as an optional display for the results obtained with the subject device and may be used to change the CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE and CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT GEN meter settings.

# B Principle of Operation:

The CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE and CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems quantitatively measures the amount of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is achieved using an amperometric detection method by the reaction of FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase and an electron mediator in the test strip with glucose in the sample producing an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration, which is displayed by the meter’s display screen in plasma equivalents.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose Meter CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT GEN Blood Glucose Meter

2. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with these devices. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The systems are intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action. Samples are tested immediately upon collection.

4. Calibration:

The meters are automatically coded and do not require calibration or coding by the user.

5. Quality Control:

Two levels of glucose control solutions are available for use with the CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose Monitoring System (CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS control solution Level 1 and Level 2) and for use with the CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring System (CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NEXT control solution Level 1 and Level 2) which are used as a quality control check to ensure the customer that their CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE system is working properly. Recommendations on when to test with control solutions are provided in the labeling. Acceptable ranges for each level of control solution are printed on the test strip vial label and foil packet. If controls solutions fall outside the printed ranges the labeling instructs the customer to not use the system until the issue has been resolved and provides customer service contact details for support, as needed. The CONTOUR $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PLUS BLUE and CONTOUR NEXT GEN meters recognize the control solutions automatically and differentiate the control solution results from patient results. The control test results are not included in the patient glucose averaging features such as blood glucose averages.

This medical device product has functions subject to FDA premarket review as well as functions that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, if the product has functions that are not subject to FDA review, FDA assessed those functions only to the extent that they either could adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to FDA premarket review or they are included as a labeled positive impact that was considered in the assessment of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.
