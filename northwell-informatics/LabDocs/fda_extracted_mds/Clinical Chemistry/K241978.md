# 6. Intended Use

Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test is a pregnancy test. It is used for the qualitative detection of hCG in human urine as an aid in early detection of pregnancy. For in vitro diagnostic use, for over the counter use.

# 7. Device Description

Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test is used for in vitro qualitative detection of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) in human urine, and is designed to be tested in dip or midstream mode. The test device consists of a single test strip assembled in a plastic housing, with an absorbent tip. The device is in a ready-touse format.

Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test uses lateral flow immunoassay and light reflection for the detection of the HCG in urine specimens. The test would detect the light intensity by using the LED as the light source. After that, the result can be displayed on the display screen.

# 9. Test Principle

Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is a glycoprotein produced by the placenta during pregnancy. Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test uses lateral flow immunoassay and light reflection for the detection of the HCG in urine specimens. After the appropriate urine sample is added to the absorbent tip, the clock symbol will appear and blink on the Display Screen after urine is applied, indicating the test is working. The HCG in urine specimen will react with the anti- $\beta$ -HCG antibody-colloidal gold conjugate and form a compound. As the liquid flows to the Test area of the test strip, the compound will be captured by the anti- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ -HCG antibody immobilized on the Test area, then a colored line will be formed on the Test area.

The test midstream would detect the light intensity by using the LED as the light source. The background of the LED lighted zone will be darker due to the color of colloidal gold conjugate, and the intensity of the reflected light received by the photodiode decreases significantly. By detecting the signal parameter of the reflected light intensity, which is decreasing significantly, the test midstream can determine that the sample is adding properly. The LED light will irradiate the test strip and then be reflected to the photodiode and the photodiode can respond to the different light intensity value by testing the intensity of reflected light.

In approximately 3 minutes, the result will be shown on the display screen. If test value is over the preset threshold, the test result is positive and “Pregnant” is displayed on the screen. Otherwise, the result is negative and “Not Pregnant” is displayed on the screen.

If the sample is adding improperly, the background color of the LED lighted zone does not decrease significantly. By detecting the signal parameter of the reflected light intensity, which isn’t decreasing significantly, the test midstream can determine that the sample is adding improperly, and the test will be invalid and “?” is displayed on the screen.

To evaluate specificity, 300 female urine samples were collected from healthy, non-pregnant females in pre-menopausal (ages $1 8 { \sim } 4 0$ years old), peri-menopausal $( 4 1 { \sim } 5 5$ years old), and post-menopausal ( ${ > } 5 5$ years old) groups. A total of 100 samples from each age group were collected and these samples were tested by lay persons using both dip and midstream methods. No false positive results were observed for any of the age groups.

To evaluate cross-reactivity, negative and positive female urine samples (0, 5 and $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG) were spiked with potential cross reactants $\mathrm { 5 0 0 \ m I U / m L }$ hLH, 1000 mIU/mL hFSH, $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu I U / m L }$ hTSH). No cross-reactivity was observed at tested concentration.

To evaluate the effect of the hCG $\beta$ -core fragment, negative female urine samples (0 and 5 mIU/mL hCG) and positive female urine samples (25 and $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG) were spiked with hCG $\beta$ -core fragment $( \mathrm { h C G } \mathrm { \beta c f } )$ at concentrations of 50,000 pmol/L, 125,000 pmol/L, 250,000pmol/L, and $5 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The performance of Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test is not affected by hCG $\beta$ -core fragment concentrations up to $5 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

# e. Interfering substance

To evaluate potential interferers with Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test, urine samples containing 0, 5 and $2 5 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG were spiked with the interfering substance to obtain the certain desired test concentration. No interference effect was observed at the tested concentration shown in table below:

To evaluate the effect of urine $\mathsf { p H }$ on the results of Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test, urine samples containing 0, 5 and $2 5 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG were tested at $\mathsf { p H }$ values of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The results indicated that urine $\mathsf { p H }$ ranges between 4 and 9 does not affect the performance of Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test.

To evaluate the effect of urine density on the results of Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test, urine samples containing 0, 5 and $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG were tested at density values of 1.000, 1.004, 1.009, 1.015, 1.021, 1.026, 1.029 and 1.035. The results indicated that urine with a relative density of 1.000 to 1.035 does not affect the performance of Shinetellä Digital Pregnancy Test.

# B. Method comparison study

Method comparison with predicate device   
The performance of the new device was compared to the predicate test. Urine samples were collected from 200 women presenting to test for pregnancy. All subjects were suspected to be pregnant and they are all in the early stage of less than 5 weeks. All samples were tested with candidate and predicate devices at three POC sites (3 different professionals using the candidate device and 1 professional using the predicate device at each site).

From the above tables, the lay person results showed $100 \%$ positive and $100 \%$ negative conformity with the professional results.

Second study:

Negative urine sample pools were spiked with $5 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG and $2 5 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG. All aliquots were blind labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. Both laypersons and professionals use dip method to test the above samples. 100 laypersons tested the $5 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG aliquots and 100 laypersons tested the $2 5 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG aliquots. Each testing site had a study administrator to observe or monitor the studies by laypersons without providing assistance to the participants.
