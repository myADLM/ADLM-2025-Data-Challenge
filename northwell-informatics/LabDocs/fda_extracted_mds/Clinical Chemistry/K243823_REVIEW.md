# E Purpose for Submission:

The purpose of this submission is an expansion of the indications for use (IFU) to include type 2 diabetes mellitus in persons 18 years of age and greater.

# II Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

Control- $\mathrm { { I Q + } }$ technology is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps to automatically increase, decrease, and suspend delivery of basal insulin based on iCGM readings and predicted glucose values. It can also deliver correction boluses when the glucose value is predicted to exceed a predefined threshold.

Control- $\cdot \mathrm { I Q + }$ technology is intended for the management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons 2 years of age and greater and of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in persons 18 years of age and greater.

Control-IQ $^ +$ technology is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Only use U-100 insulin analogs that have been tested and found to be compatible for use in the pump. Use of insulin with lesser or greater concentration can result in under delivery or over delivery of insulin. This can cause hypoglycemia (low BG) or hyperglycemia (high BG) events.

When the CGM reading is automatically populated into the bolus calculator, only the current CGM reading is used to calculate the correction bolus. The trend arrow is not used in the dose calculation. Speak with your healthcare provider for recommendations on how best to utilize the arrows for your correction bolus dosing.

Control- $\cdot \mathrm { I Q + }$ should not be used in anyone under the age of two years old. Control- $\cdot \mathrm { I Q + }$ should also not be used in patients who require less than a total daily insulin dose of 5 units per day or who weigh less than 20 pounds, as those are the required minimum values needed in order for Control-IQ technology to operate safely.

The System is magnetic resonance (MR) unsafe. You must take off your pump, transmitter, and sensor and leave them outside the procedure room.

DO NOT use Control- $\cdot \mathrm { I Q + }$ if you are taking hydroxyurea, a medication used in the treatment of diseases including cancer and sickle cell anemia. Your Dexcom G6 CGM readings may be falsely elevated and result in over-delivery of insulin that could result in severe hypoglycemia.

# III Device/System Characteristics:

Control- $\cdot \mathrm { I Q + }$ technology (Control- $\mathrm { I Q + }$ , the device) is a software-only device intended for the management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The device controls insulin delivery from a compatible alternate controller enabled insulin pump (ACE pump) based on inputs provided by a compatible integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) and inputs provided by the user (e.g., carbohydrate intake, exercise, and sleep schedule). Control- $\mathrm { I Q + }$ technology is meant to be installed on a compatible ACE pump.

Control- $\cdot \mathrm { I Q + }$ technology has three different modes: Normal, Sleep, and Exercise. The glucose targets are not individually customizable in these modes but can change based on the mode selected. During normal mode, Control- $\mathrm { { I Q + } }$ technology aims to control glucose within a target range of $1 1 2 . 5 - 1 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . During sleep mode, this range is changed to $1 1 2 . 5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and it is changed to $1 4 0 { - } 1 6 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ during exercise mode.

Control- $\mathrm { { I Q + } }$ technology includes an integrated feature whereby iCGM values are automatically populated into the glucose field of the integrated bolus calculator when Control- $\mathrm { { I Q + } }$ technology is active (i.e., the device is operating in closed-loop mode). This feature is disabled when Control-IQ is turned off.

Control- $\mathrm { { I Q + } }$ technology requires users to input their weight and their total daily insulin requirement, which should be established with the help of a health care provider before using the device.

# VI Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

For the purposes of analytical and clinical validation testing, the Control-IQ algorithm was installed on the t:slim X2 Insulin Pump with Interoperable Technology ACE pump (K232380), which was paired with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring system (K223931).

# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

Summary of Clinical Testing:

The sponsor conducted a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled study to compare the use of Control- $\cdot \mathrm { I Q + }$ technology (or automated insulin dosing (AID) group) to the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with basal-bolus insulin therapy (or CGM group). The randomized controlled phase (Primary Study) was 13 weeks in duration.

The primary endpoint evaluated the non-inferiority of the change in HbA1c at baseline to the end of 13 weeks between the intervention group (AID group) and control group (CGM group). HbA1c changed from $8 . 2 { \pm } 1 . 4 \%$ at randomization to $7 . 3 \pm 0 . 9 \%$ at 13 weeks in the AID group, compared to $8 . 1 \pm 1 . 2 \%$ at randomization to $7 . 7 \pm 1 . 1 \%$ at 13 weeks for the CGM group. The AID group had a 13-week adjusted group different from the CGM group of - $- 0 . 6 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $- 0 8 \%$ , $- 0 . 4 \%$ .

# Challenge Results

During this clinical study, subjects in the AID group participated in 3 meal challenges and 3 exercise challenges.

From the AID group 195 participants completed 567 meal challenges in which no bolus, half bolus or full bolus was delivered. Of the meal challenges 320 were lunch meals, 209 were dinner meals and 38 were meals outside of lunch or dinner. The median amount of carbohydrates was 60 grams. During and up to the 4 hours post the meal challenge the CGM time in range increased from $5 7 \%$ to $6 6 \%$ to $71 \%$ for no bolus, half bolus and full bolus respectively.

From the AID group 172 participants completed 511, 60-minute-long exercise challenges, of which 500 were intensity of mild or moderate. During and for 2 hours after the exercise challenge there was minimal (less than $0 . 0 1 \%$ ) of time below $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as determined by CGM.

Summary of Human Factors Validation Study

The study was conducted as established in K232382. No differences in critical tasks were identified between adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A summative Human Factors validation was performed and followed FDA recognized standard IEC 62366-1 as well as the FDA guidance document Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices (February 3, 2016). A summative validation study evaluated a total of 30 individuals with T2D to ensure individuals can safely and effectively perform critical tasks associated with the use of Control- $\mathrm { I Q + }$ technology.
