Dear Trevor Denbo:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action.

# X. Description

The Signos Glucose Monitoring System is a mobile device application that is paired, via Bluetooth®, with an over-the-counter interoperable continuous glucose monitor (iCGM). The application functions as a primary display for the iCGM by showing the user’s glucose reading along with a historic trend every 15 minutes. The system is capable of backfilling missed data and supporting a grace period dictated by the iCGM.

The system’s various displays, text, graphs, suggestions, and notifications serve to clearly illustrate the user’s past and present glucose readings and their trend direction to assist the user in maintaining a euglycemic state.

The glucose display range is $7 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $2 5 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The Signos System is intended for users over the age of 18 not on insulin.

XI. Indications for Use

The Signos Glucose Monitoring System is an over-the-counter (OTC) mobile device application that receives data from an integrated Continuous Glucose Monitor (iCGM) sensor and is intended to continuously measure, record, analyze, and display glucose values in people 18 years and older not on insulin. The Signos Glucose Monitoring System helps to detect normal (euglycemic) and low or high (dysglycemic) glucose levels. The Signos Glucose Monitoring System may also help the user better understand how lifestyle and behavior modification, including diet and exercise, impact glucose excursions. This information may be useful in helping users to maintain a healthy weight.

The user is not intended to take medical action based on the device output without consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.

XII. Summary of the Technological Characteristics

The fundamental scientific technology, materials of construction, processing methods and mechanism of operation are the same between the subject and predicate devices. Both devices are provided as software systems, designed to display interstitial fluid glucose sensor data and assist the user in understanding how lifestyle and behavior modification, including diet and exercise, impact glucose excursion these levels. The predicate also includes the iCGM, which is the same iCGM used with the subject device. The table below summarizes the comparison of technological characteristics between the subject and predicate devices.

# XIII. Discussion of Differences

Indications for Use Comparison

The predicate states that the device “is an over-the-counter (OTC) integrated Continuous Glucose Monitor (iCGM) intended…,” while the subject device inserts the words “mobile device application that receives data from an” and “sensor and is” to make the statement read as “is an over-the-counter (OTC) mobile device application that receives data from an integrated Continuous Glucose Monitor (iCGM) sensor and is intended… .” Both the predicate device and the subject device include a mobile device application to display glucose. The predicate includes the iCGM while the subject device is interoperable with that iCGM as an alternative display. The addition of these words to the indications was made to precisely describe the Signos Glucose Monitoring System as the application which uses the iCGM, as opposed to the iCGM itself. The difference is not critical to the intended therapeutic use of the device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness of the device when used as labeled. The predicate also uses a mobile application, and both devices use the iCGM. The intended use of the predicate and the subject device remains in helping “to detect” and “understand” glycemic control.

The indications for the Signos Glucose Monitoring System include the statement “this information may be useful in helping users to maintain a healthy weight.” The difference is not critical to the intended therapeutic use of the device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness of the device when used as labeled. This is because this change does not change the general function and intent of the device, which is to track and trend glucose data. The intended therapeutic outcome of helping “to detect” and “understand” glycemic control, as found in the predicate indications, is good health which includes a healthy weight.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the association between glucose management and weight management.

# XIV. Discussion of the Non-Clinical Testing

# Software Testing

Verification testing was conducted to demonstrate that the Signos Glucose Monitoring System functions in a manner consistent with the design inputs. This evaluation demonstrated that the software requirements have been verified and that the data displayed by the Signos Glucose Monitoring System is the same as that which is transmitted by the biosensor and is therefore substantially equivalent to the predicate.

# Cybersecurity Testing

A study was conducted to demonstrate that the Signos Glucose Monitoring System was designed and engineered to meet all cybersecurity requirements. This study demonstrated that no unacceptable cybersecurity risks remain for the use of this device.

# Usability / Human Factors

A study was conducted to demonstrate that the Signos Glucose Monitoring System user interface was designed and engineered such that use errors that occur during use of the device that could cause harm or degrade device performance are either eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels. This study demonstrated that no unacceptable human factors risks remain for the use of this device.
