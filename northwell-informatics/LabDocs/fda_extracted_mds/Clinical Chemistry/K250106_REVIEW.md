# II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New device   
B Type of Test: Quantitative, amperometric assay (Glucose Oxidase)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Signos Glucose Monitoring System is an over-the-counter (OTC) mobile device application that receives data from an integrated Continuous Glucose Monitor (iCGM) sensor and is intended to continuously measure, record, analyze, and display glucose values in people 18 years and older not on insulin. The Signos System helps to identify normal (euglycemic) and low or high (dysglycemic) glucose levels. The Signos System may also help the user better understand how lifestyle and behavior modification, including diet and exercise, impact glucose excursions. This information may be useful in helping users to maintain a healthy weight.

The user is not intended to take medical action based on the device output without consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): OTC - Over The Counter

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Signos Glucose Monitoring System is a mobile device application that receives data from the Dexcom Stelo Biosensor iCGM and used to help people better understand their impact on their glucose results and how those glucose results impact other areas of their health.

The Signos Glucose Monitoring System consists of the smartphone application (on iOS or Android) and is paired with the Dexcom Stelo Glucose Biosensor System (distributed by Signos, Inc. upon payment and activation of the Signos Glucose Monitoring System). The application is obtained by downloading it from an App-Store (e.g. Google Play or Apple Store) and then activated by account setup with Signos, Inc.

Once activated, the Signos Glucose Monitoring System application functions as a primary display for a paired, off-the-shelf, Dexcom Stelo iCGM (K234070) by showing the user’s glucose reading along with a historic trend. The Signos Glucose Monitoring System is not intended to be used by people on insulin.

The Signos Glucose Monitoring System includes several algorithms that analyze glucose values. These algorithms are variously intended to help identify euglycemic and dysglycemic glucose levels, and to help users better understand how lifestyle and behavior modification, including diet and exercise, impact glucose excursions. These algorithms are not intended to aid in the management of any disease.
