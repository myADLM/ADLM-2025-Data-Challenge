# B. Purpose for Submission:

To obtain clearance for the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ instrument for the quantitative testing of total hemoglobin, methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin.

Quantitative assay performed by oximeter

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

$\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ is a small, portable, battery-powered system using rechargeable batteries to measure Total Hemoglobin, Methemoglobin and Carboxyhemoglobin using spectroscopic technology. The $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ user interface consists of a sample tab receiver, three pushbutton keys, a graphic LCD display and an audible beeper. The $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ is comprised of the following elements:

Tungsten lamp for illuminating the sample (wavelength range approximately $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ to $8 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ) A spectrometer with linear diode array of photo-detectors for measuring the amount of electro-magnetic radiation (EMR) transmitted through the sample • An electronic board which contains an amplifier, an analog-to-digital converter and a microcontroller for processing the information received by the photodetectors Disposable sample tabs and a sample slot in the unit for locating the sample tab • Primary calibration algorithms for each analyte in each device

2. Principles of Operation:

Samples are introduced in to the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ using disposable sample tabs. The sample tab well is filled with sample and then inserted into the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ unit’s sample slot. The unit automatically starts-up and runs its built-in self-test and then performs a measurement on the sample. The EMR transmitted through the sample is received by the spectrometer/linear diode array and is converted to an analog electronic signal. This signal is proportional to the time that the detector integrates the optical signal. The electronic signal is amplified by analog electronic amplifiers and converted to a digital signal by an analog-to-digital converter.

A reference measurement is taken after a sample measurement, with the sample tab removed, and this is used by the microcontroller to calculate the absorbance. An absorbance calculation is made from the reading of sample and reference light, sample and reference dark and their respective integration times. The algorithm in the unit uses this absorbance to calculate the respective analyte results.

3. Modes of Operation: The measurement operation is random access.

4. Specimen Identification: Samples are identified by a unique ID# plus time and date of measurement.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ uses disposable, single-use, polypropylene sample tabs that require no sample preparation or reagents. Samples collected in heparin or EDTA is introduced into the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ using the sample tabs. The blood sample should be mixed by inverting or rolling it between the fingers (10-20 times) before filling the sample tab well with approximately $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample. The snap press-fit cover is closed and it is then inserted into the sample tab receiver on the front of the HemoNIRLab™.

6. Calibration:

The $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ is factory calibrated and does not require any re-calibration by the user.

7. Quality Control:

To verify that the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ is operating within the specification, three QC Optical Filter sample tabs (High, Medium and Low) are supplied with each

Hemo ${ \mathrm { N I R } } _ { \mathrm { L a b } } \mathbf { \mathrm { T M } }$ unit with assigned values for Total Hemoglobin.

Additional external controls may be necessary to meet conformance with local, state, and federal regulations or accreditation requirements for quality control.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

Accuracy was determined by comparing the results obtained from the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ with a predicate device, Radiometer Co-Oximeter OSM 3. In an in-house, single-site study, untreated patient samples obtained from a local hospital, and additional whole blood samples were treated with carbon monoxide and sodium nitrite to obtain elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, respectively.

Treated samples: Blood samples from 6 normal adult males were treated and aliquotted for a total of approximately 101 independent testing specimens. For each day of testing, a blood sample was obtained from one person in 10 ml heparin or EDTA tubes. The blood was centrifuged and the plasma removed. Met-Hb concentration was increased by reacting the Hb in $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of blood with $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $1 0 \mathrm { g / L }$ sodium nitrite in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Carboxy-Hb concentration was increased by reacting the Hb in about $2 { \cdot } 4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of blood with carbon monoxide (CO) gas in a $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ Vacutainer: the air space in the tube was filled with CO and the sample was placed on a rocker for several minutes.

Untreated samples: A total of 144 samples, 68 male and 76 female adult patients, were obtained from a local hospital with no traceablity to patients. Samples included patients with renal diseases, sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.

Linear regression analysis was performed for the combined untreated and treated samples. The mean of the summary correlation statistics are as follows:

Total Hemoglobin: slope $= 1 . 0 1 3$ and $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 8 0$

Methemoglobin: slope $= 0 . 9 9 9$ and $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 6$

Carboxyhemoglobin: slope $= 0 . 9 8 6$ and $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 8 2$

An additional study method comparison study was conducted on whole blood samples collected at Milton District Hospital Laboratory, Ontario, Canada. Results from the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ were compared to the Radiometer OSM 3

Hemoximeter.

In order to obtain the desired range of abnormal values, approximately half of the whole blood samples were treated with sodium nitrate and carbon monoxide to obtain elevated levels of methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, respectively. Treatment of the samples (as described above) was performed at NIR Diagnostics and the treated samples transported back to the hospital for testing by hospital laboratory personnel.

A total of 109 samples, 51 untreated and 58 treated samples, were tested in parallel on two $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ units and one Radiometer OSM 3 unit within approximately two minutes.

Linear regression analysis was performed for comparison of the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ and Radiometer OSM 3 methods. The mean of the summary correlation statistics are as follows:

Total Hemoglobin: slope $= 0 . 9 9 2 5$ and $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 3 5$

Methemoglobin: slope $= 1 . 0 3 5$ and $\mathrm { { r } } = 0 . 9 9 7$

Carboxyhemoglobin: slope $= 1 . 0 1 4$ and $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 8 5$

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study for total hemoglobin was performed to assess the total precision of the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ by replicate measurements of quality control materials. Three optical filters representing low, medium and high total hemoglobin concentration levels were used as the quality control materials. Precision studies were performed for 20 days on four $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ units. Three replicate measurements were performed for each of the three optical filters each day, morning and afternoon.

For each quality control material and each $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ , the mean, standard deviation and $\%$ coefficient of variation were calculated. Results demonstrated acceptable measurement precision for total hemoglobin and indicated no systematic error due to drift over the 20 testing days.

Additional precision studies were performed to assess the within-run precision of the methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin parameters on the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ . Human whole blood samples were treated to obtain three concentration levels of methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, respectively. Replicate measurements (20) were run on the $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ , for each sample.

Total Hemoglobin: Mean and $\%$ CV for four instruments (average results)

High: Total- $\mathrm { \cdot H b } = 1 9 9 . 7 ~ \mathrm { g / L } , \% \mathrm { C V } = 3 . 2$

Medium: Total- $\cdot \mathrm { H b } = 1 5 6 . 5 ~ \mathrm { g / L } , \% \mathrm { C V } = 1 . 8$

High: Total- $\mathrm { \cdot H b } = 1 0 1 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } , \% \mathrm { C V } = 3 . 7$

# c. Linearity:

Linearity was evaluated by assaying a series of twelve samples, prepared from the whole blood of a single donor that covered a wide range of concentrations. All samples were tested in duplicate on four $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ units. Results were displayed graphically and examined for linearity by visual inspection. The $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ demonstrated linearity for the following ranges:

Total Hemoglobin $5 0 { - } 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ Methemoglobin $\scriptstyle 0 - 1 0 0 \ { \mathrm { g / L } }$ ; $\%$ Met-Hb is about $2 - 7 0 \%$ of Total-Hb Carboxyhemoglobin $\mathrm { 0 - 1 8 0 \ g / L }$ or $0 . 1 0 0 \%$ of Total-Hb

d. Carryover:

Not applicable e. Interfering Substances:

An interference study was performed to assess the effect of bilirubin, hemolysis, turbidity (Intralipid) and methylene blue on the accuracy of $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ measurements. A series of samples prepared from whole blood, that included three concentrations of the respective interferent and a baseline sample with no interferent were tested in duplicate on four $\mathrm { H e m o N I R _ { L a b } T M }$ units.

Results for samples containing interferents were evaluated relative to samples in which no interferent was present. The observed differences indicated that there was no effect at interferent levels that would reasonably be expected to occur in clinical situations.

Interference Summary Results: Total-Hb, Met-Hb and Carboxy-Hb “No effect” means the observed bias due to the interferent is less than $20 \%$ of baseline. Not applicable to Met-Hb.
