Name of Device:

1. Proprietary/Trade Name: Prostate-63 Cancer Diagnostic Test 2. Common Name: antibody to p63 protein in basal cells 3. Classification Name: Immunohistochemical reagent, antibody (monoclonal or polyclonal) to p63 protein in nucleus of prostatic basal cells

# DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE:

# Intended Use

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use. The Prostate-63 Cancer Diagnostic Test features a mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 4A4, that recognizes the human p63 protein in the nucleus of prostatic basal cells and urothelial tissues. This test is intended for laboratory use to qualitatively identify by immunohistochemistry the p63 antigen in histological sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of normal and/or pathological prostate tissue obtained by needle biopsy or surgical procedures. The presence or absence of p63 staining aids the pathologist in the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer in conjunction with morphological findings seen with hematoxylin and eosin staining complemented by proper controls. The clinical interpretation of any staining or its absence should be evaluated within the context of the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic tests by a qualified pathologist.

# Background

$\mathtt { p 6 3 }$ is a member of the p53 family, which also includes p73 (Yang et al., 1998; Yang and McKeon, 2000). p63 is strongly expressed in the basal or progenitor cells of a large number of epithelial tissues (Yang et al., 1998). These tissues include squamous, transitional, and glandular epithelia, such as prostate, breast, esophagus, bladder, airway, and epidermis, among others. In general, these p63 positive basal cells act as the progenitors or reserve cells in these regenerative epithelia (Parsa et al., 1999). p63- deficient mice lack all epithelial tissues in which p63 is highly expressed, such as prostate, breast and epidermis. p63 mutant mice also show severe defects in limb and craniofacial development (Yang et al., 1999). A similar pattern is observed in patients with EEC syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ectodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts, where affected patients are found to have dominant heterozygous p63 mutations (Celli et al., 1999). Recent studies support the utility of the 4A4 anti-p63 monoclonal antibody in the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer. (Signoretti et al., 2000; Weinstein et al., 2002; Shah et al., 2002; Davis et al., 2002; Shah et al., 2004).

# Performance Characteristics.

The Prostate-63 Cancer Diagnostic Test was developed as a tool to facilitate the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Recent studies have supported the utility of the 4A4 antip63 monoclonal antibody in prostate cancer diagnosis (Signoretti et al., 2000; Weinstein et al., 2002; Shah et al., 2002; Davis et al., 2002; Shah et al., 2004). The basis of the Prostate-63 Cancer Diagnostic Test is the use of the 4A4 anti-p63 monoclonal antibody that recognizes all known p63 protein isoforms. Basal cells of the prostate show dark staining with the p63 antibody whereas secretory and neuroendocrine cells of the prostate typically show no staining (Yang et al., 1998; Signoretti et al., 2000). The dark nuclear staining pattern of the p63 antibody in basal cells may offer advantages over traditional basal cell markers which yield a diffuse cytoplasmic stain (Shah et al., 2002).

The 4A4 anti-p63 monoclonal antibody recognizes all forms of p63 protein on western blots, and shows strong nuclear staining of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing p63 cDNAs but not BHK cells expressing control vectors (Yang et al., 1998). By immunohistochemistry in mouse tissues, the 4A4 anti-p63 monoclonal antibody recognizes basal cells of skin, breast, prostate, urothelia, among other tissues, but does not show significant staining in corresponding tissues of embryos lacking the p63 gene (Yang et al., 1999)

p63 stains prostatic basal cells of normal glands in needle biopsies with a sensitivity approaching $100 \%$ (Wu et al., 2004). Benign glands were also positive in 11 of 12 $( 9 5 \% )$ EPY sections derived from transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP; Shah et al., 2002). $\mathsf { p } 6 3$ does not stain neuroendocrine or luminal, secretory cells of the prostate (Signoretti et al., 2000).
