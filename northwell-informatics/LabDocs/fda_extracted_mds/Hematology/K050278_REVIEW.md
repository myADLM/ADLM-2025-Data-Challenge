# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

The HemosIL D-Dimer Latex Reagent is a suspension of latex particles coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the D-Dimer domain included in fibrin soluble derivatives. When plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with the D-Dimer Latex Reagent and Reaction Buffer, the coated latex particles agglutinate. The degree of agglutination is directly proportional to the concentration of D-Dimer in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of the transmitted light caused by the aggregates (turbidimetric immunoassay).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Not applicable for purpose of this submission. See data provided in previously 510(k) cleared predicate (K972696).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Not applicable for purpose of this submission. See data provided in previously 510(k) cleared predicate (K972696).

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable for purpose of this submission. See data provided in previously 510(k) cleared predicate (K972696).

e. Analytical specificity:

Not applicable for purpose of this submission. See data provided in previously 510(k) cleared predicate (K972696).

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable for purpose of this submission. See data provided in previously 510(k) cleared predicate (K972696).

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable for purpose of this submission. See data provided in previously 510(k) cleared predicate (K972696).

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: An outcome study was performed on 300 frozen samples from patients admitted consecutively to an emergency unit with suspected PE or DVT (frequency of venous thromboembolic disease : $2 6 \%$ ). Of the 300 samples, 78 were confirmed as VTE positive (47 PE and 31 DVT) by standard objective tests and the remaining 222 were confirmed as negative. Samples with insrument error results were not included in calculations.

The result are as follows (based on a cut-off of $2 3 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) :

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>InstrumentSystem</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sensitivity(96% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Specificity(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativePredicitiveValue</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ACL8000/9000/10000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>297</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%(95.2%-100%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38%(31.4%-44.6%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%(95.7%-100%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ACL TOP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>294</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%(95.1%-100%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>36%(29.6%-42.6%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%(95.4%-100%)</td></tr></table>

b. Clinical specificity: Refer to table above (3.a.).   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Refer to predicate (K972696) for normal range results for the ACL Family, and ACL Futura/ ACL Advance Systems.

Data was provided for a comprehensive normal range study on the ACL TOP System and the resultant data was used to update the product insert. However, the insert states that each laboratory should establish its own normal range.

The results of the normal range study are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% Limit</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90%CI</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lower</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>61.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>53.3 to 69.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Upper</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>231.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>223.8 to 239.9</td></tr></table>

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
