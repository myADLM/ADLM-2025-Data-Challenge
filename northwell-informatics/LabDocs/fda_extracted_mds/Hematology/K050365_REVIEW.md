# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not provided.

# L. Test Principle:

Protein C is an anticoagulant protein, which is dependant on Vitamin K. It inhibits and regulates coagulation through the specific cleavage of factors Va and VIIIa, suppressing their procoagulant cofactor activity.

Protein C in human plasma is measured following specific activation using Protac $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ an enzyme extracted from snake venom (Agkistrodon C Contortrix). The activated protein C (APC) then specifically cleaves the specific substrate SaPC-21, releasing

para-nitroaniline (pNA). The release of para-nitroaniline produces color, which is measured at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ . There is direct relationship between release of par-nitroaniline and the protein C activity in the tested plasma.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was performed on Protein C concentrations of $9 8 \%$ , $59 \%$ and $3 9 \%$ . The results are as follows:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was determined using the Protein C calibrator with values of 0, 20, 40, 60, and $100 \%$ activity. The linear regression results for two lots of Biophen Protein C reagent are as follows:

$\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 6$ $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$ $\begin{array} { r } { y = 0 . 0 0 9 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 2 2 } \\ { y = 0 . 0 8 1 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 5 6 } \end{array}$

The highest reportable value is $100 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability studies were performed on Protac (R1) and SaPC-21 substrate (R2) vials stored at room temperature $( 1 8 - 2 5 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } )$ or at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , reconstituted. The activity was tested, after storage periods of 1-4 weeks. In addition, they were tested at 3 and 7 months. This study determined that reconstituted R1 and R2 reagents are stable: 3 days at room temperature $( 1 8 - 2 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } ) }$ , 3 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

d. Detection limit:

Threshold detection testing was performed using two lots of reagent. The limit of detection was determined to be $5 \%$ activity.

e. Analytical specificity:

Not applicable.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Comparison studies using the Biophen Protein C assay and the predicate device were performed at two sites with patient samples presented for Protein C testing. The results are as follows:

Site 1 $\begin{array} { l l l } { \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 } & { \mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 8 4 } & { \mathbf { n } = 2 1 } \\ { \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 } & { \mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 5 \mathbf { x } + 7 . 9 } & { \mathbf { n } = 1 7 } \end{array}$   
Site 2

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected range was established in the literature. The $100 \%$ Protein C concentration corresponds to the concentration in a normal human citrate plasma pool, obtained by pooling plasma from healthy males or females aged from 18 to 55 years, and out of any medication. The Protein C concentration in adults is usually between 70 and $140 \%$ .

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
