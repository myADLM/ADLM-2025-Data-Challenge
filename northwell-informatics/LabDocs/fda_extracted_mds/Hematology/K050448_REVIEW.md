# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

Protein C in plasma is activated by a specific enzyme from Agkistrodon c. contortrix snake venom. The amount of activated protein C (APC) is determined by the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate pNAPEP 1566TI. The pNA release measured at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the protein C level in the range from $0 . 1 2 0 \%$ of normal plasma.

Chromopep Antithrombin is a kinetic assay based on competition between inhibition of factor Xa by the heparin-antithrombin complex and hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate by factor Xa which is present is excess. The amount of pNA released in the reaction measured at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ is inversely proportional to the amount of antithrombin present and this can be quantified using a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

\*Note: The performance characteristics for Chromopep Protein C 2.5 and Chromopep Protein C 5 were established from the data provided in the original 510(k) K023990 ChromoCheck™ Protein C 25 and ChromoCheck™ Protein C 5 submitted by Precision Biologic, Inc., and cleared on March 19, 2003.
