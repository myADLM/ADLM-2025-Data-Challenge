Device Trade Name:HemosIL D-Dimer HS

# Regulatory Information:

Classitication Name: Fibrinogen and Fibrin Split Products, Antigen, Antiserum, Control   
Device Class: Class   
Regulation No.: 864.7320   
Product Code: DAP   
Panel: Hematology

# Predicate Device:

HemosIL D-Dimer K972696

# Device Intended Use / Description:

HemosIL D-Dimer HS is an automated latex enhanced immunoassay for the quantitative determination of D-Dimer in human citrated plasma on the ACL TOP as an aid in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) [deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)].

The D-Dimer HS Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latcx particles of uniform size coated with the ${ \bf { F } } ( \mathfrak { a } \mathfrak { b } ^ { \prime } ) _ { 2 }$ fragment of a monoclonal antibody highly specific for the D-Dimer domain included in fibrin soluble derivatives. The use of the $\operatorname { F } ( \mathbf { a b } ^ { \prime } ) _ { 2 }$ fragment allows a more specific D-Dimer detection avoiding the interference of some endogenous factors like the Rheumatoid Factor. When a plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with thc Latcx Reagent and the Reaction Buffer included in the D-Dimer HS kit, the coated latex particles agglutinate. The degree of agglutination is directly proportional to the concentration of D-Dimer in the sample and is determined by mcasuring the decrease of the transmitted light caused by the aggregates (turbidimetric immunoassay).

# Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

HemosIL D-Dimer HS is substantially equivalent to the commercially available predicate device (HemosIL D-Dimer) in performance and intended use.

# Summary of Performance Data:

# Precision

Within run and total precision assessed over multiple runs using three levels of control plasma gave the following results:

<table><tr><td>ACL TOP:</td><td>Mean (ng/mL)</td><td>CV% (Within run)</td><td>(V% (Total)</td></tr><tr><td>D-Dimer Plasma Pool</td><td>179.6</td><td>8.3</td><td>11.0</td></tr><tr><td>HemosIL D-Dimer Low Control</td><td>313.8</td><td>3.7</td><td>7.0</td></tr><tr><td>HemosIL D-Dimer High Control</td><td>677.2</td><td>2.0</td><td>7.0</td></tr></table>

# Method Comparison

In a method comparison study on an ACL TOP using citrated plasma samples $\scriptstyle ( 1 1 = 2 2 9 )$ ) ranging in D-Dimer concentration from 87 to $\scriptstyle 2 0 8 6 9 \ n g / \mathrm { m L }$ , the correlation statistics for HemosIL D-Dimer HS versus the predicate device are shown below:

<table><tr><td>IL System</td><td>Slope</td><td>Intercept</td><td>r</td></tr><tr><td>ACL TOP</td><td>0.9492</td><td>-50.298</td><td>0.973</td></tr></table>

# Management Study

An outcome study was performed on 300 frozen samples from patients admitted consecutively to an emergency unit with suspected PE or DVT (frequency of venous thromboembolic disease: $2 6 \%$ . Of the 300 samples, 78 were confirmed as VTE positive (47 PE and 31 DVT) by standard objective tests and the remaining 222 were confirmed as negative.

Dear Mr. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
