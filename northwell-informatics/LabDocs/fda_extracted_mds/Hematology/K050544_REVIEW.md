# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The HemosIL D-Dimer HS is an automated latex enhanced immunoassay for the quantitative determination of D-Dimer in human citrated plasma on ACL TOP Coagulation Instrument as an aid in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE), [deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE)]

2. Indication(s) for use:

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

4. Special instrument requirements:

# I. Device Description:

The HemosIL D-Dimer HS Kit consists of a D-Dimer Calibrator (2 vials $\mathrm { ~ x ~ l ~ m L ~ }$ ), Latex Reagent (3 vials $\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 \mathrm { ~ m L }$ ), and Reaction Buffer.

The D-Dimer HS Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of uniform size coated with the F (ab’) $^ 2$ fragment of a monoclonal antibody highly specific for the D-Dimer domain included in fibrin soluble derivatives. The use of the $\vec { \mathbf { \tau } } ^ { \prime } ( \mathbf { a } \mathbf { b } ^ { \prime } ) \mathbf { \tau } _ { 2 }$ allows a more specific D-Dimer detection avoiding the interference of Rheumatoid Factor. The Calibrator is a lyophilized solution of D-Dimer partially purified from human fibrin digested with human plasmin containing bovine serum albumin, buffer, stabilizers, and preservative.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

Elevated levels of D-Dimer are found in clinical conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

When plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with the Latex Reagent and Reaction Buffer, the coated latex particles agglutinate. The degree of agglutination is directly proportional to the concentration of D-Dimer in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of the transmitted light

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

2 levels of controls and a prepared D-Dimer plasma pool, were assayed in duplicate twice a day for twenty days on two different ACL TOP instruments $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 8 0 )$ ) in accordance with NCCLS Document EP5-A.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Several studies were performed to demonstrate assay linearity.

1. Quantification Limit- HemosIL D-Dimer HS Calibrator (Calibrator 3500 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ diluted in saline containing BSA in concentrations of $8 6 - 2 0 7 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each dilution was assayed five times on two lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagents. Results supported the linearity claims in the product insert for HemosIL D-Dimer HS on the ACL TOP of $1 5 0 { - } 6 9 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

2. Linearity studies were performed on the ACL TOP with the auto rerun feature deactivated with the HemosIL D-Dimer HS Calibrator (Calibrator 3500 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ diluted in saline containing BSA in concentrations of $5 . 1 1 2 \%$ . Each dilution was assayed five times on two lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagents. Results supported the linearity claims in the product insert for HemosIL D-Dimer HS with the auto rerun feature off, on the ACL TOP of $1 5 0 { - } 3 6 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

3. . Linearity studies were performed on the ACL TOP, with the auto rerun feature activated, using dilutions of an internally prepared Prozone Control (D-Dimer concentration $> 1 0 0 0 0 0 { \mathrm { n g / m L } } )$ diluted in saline containing BSA in concentrations of $0 . 3 7 5 \substack { - 1 0 0 \% }$ . Each dilution was assayed five times on two lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagents. Results supported the linearity claims in the product insert for HemosIL D-Dimer HS with the auto rerun feature on, on the ACL TOP of $1 5 0 { - } 6 9 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls used in the performance studies were previously FDA cleared under K972696. The calibrator was cleared under K032419.

Stability data was presented that compared fresh vs. frozen samples $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 9 1 )$ ). Aliquots of each fresh sample were prepare and frozen at ${ < } . 7 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C }$ for 11 days and then tested with HemosIL D-Dimer HS. Slope and intercept were calculated by Passing and Babcock and the correlation coefficient was calculated by Pearson $( \mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 9 9 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 7 8 1 _ { . }$ ).

# d. Detection limit:

20 replicates of HemosIL Factor Diluent (physiologic saline) ran on ACL TOP using two different lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagents. The mean plus three standard deviations were calculated, and the maximum value was considered the limit of detection.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed in accordance with NCCLS Document EP6-A on ACL TOP by spiking the highest concentration of each interfering to be claimed into two samples (low and High D-Dimer concentrations) and comparing the results against the unspiked sample results. All samples were tested in ten replicates with a single lot of HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagents. Results supported labeling claims for no significant interference by hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ , bilirubin up to $1 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , triglycerides up to $1 3 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and rheumatoid factor up to $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { \ I U / m L }$

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

An in-house clinical study was performed comparing the HemosIL D-Dimer HS to the predicate $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } - 2 6 4 )$ ). Samples were analyzed in duplicate. 35 of the samples were removed form the study based on the following: 7 samples reported “baseline average alarm fail” errors with the predicated device due to turbidity, and 28 of the samples reported RF results above $1 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (a labeled interferent). Total number of samples used in final calculations $= 2 2 9$ . Slope and intercept were calculated by Passing and Babcock and the correlation coefficient was calculated by Pearson $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { y = } 0 . 9 4 9 \mathrm { x } - 5 0 . 2 9 8 )$ .

To demonstrate lack of variation between the mean results and the single value results, the correlation data were also calculated using the first replicate of the new test versus the first replicate of the predicate test. Single results (new vs. predicate) are comparable to the mean results $( \mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 5 7 \mathrm { x } - 5 0 . 2 5 4 )$ .

A field study was conducted comparing the HemosIL D-Dimer HS to the predicate using 166 frozen samples. Samples were analyzed in singlet. Slope and intercept were calculated by Passing and Babcock and the correlation coefficient was calculated by Pearson $\left( \mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 5 4 \mathrm { x } { - } 4 . 2 9 8 5 \right)$ .

4. Clinical cut-off:

The study involved 100 frozen samples from non-consecutive outpatients suspected of VTE. The samples were selected to include ${ \sim } \ a \ 3 0 \%$ prevalence of positive VTE samples and then sent to Biokit (HemosIL D-Dimer HS manufacturer) blinded, without the diagnosis information. Of the 100 samples 32 were confirmed positives for PE, and 68 were confirmed negatives. Each of the samples was evaluated with the HemosIL D-Dimer HS on the ACL TOP. Based on a cut-off of $2 3 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , a sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of $100 \%$ was obtained.
