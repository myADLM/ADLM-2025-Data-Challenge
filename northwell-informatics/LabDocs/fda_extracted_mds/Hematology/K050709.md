Device Name:

RESOLVE® Hemoglobin kit

Common Name:

Isoelectric focusing of hemoglobins

Classification:

Abnormal hemoglobin assay Class Il per 21 CFR $\ S$ 862.7415

# Product Code:

GKA

Predicate Device:

BioRad VARIANT Sickle Cell Short Program K924813   
BioRad VARIANT nbs Sickle Cell Program K051072

Device Description:

The preparation and separation of hemoglobin is accomplished through the application of a hemoglobin sample onto a precast agarose gel containing RESOLVE Ampholytes pH 68. RESOLVE Ampholytes are composed of low molecular weight amphoteric molecules with varying isoelectric points. When an electrical current is applied to the gel, these molecules migrate through the gel to their isoelectric points (pl's) along the gel, forming a stable pH gradient.

The hemoglobin variants also migrate through the gel until they reach the area where their individual pl's equal the corresponding pH on the gel.

At this point, the charges on the variants are zero and migration ceases. The electric field counteracts diffusion and the hemoglobin variant forms a discrete thin band.

Hemoglobin bands are visualized by using the JB-2 Staining System containing o-dianisidine. $^ { o }$ -dianisidine, the active component of the Gel Stain Concentrate, is oxidized in the presence of hydrogen peroxide at the site of hemoglobin. This reaction produces an insoluble, colored precipitate proportional to the amount of hemoglobin.

Indications for Use:

The RESOLVE® Systems Hemoglobin kit is designed to separate whole blood, cord blood or dried blood spot specimen for detection of normal and variant hemoglobins by isoelectric focusing. The kit is designed to be run on a flat-bed electrofocusing unit. This assay is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of neonatal and adult hemoglobinopathies.

Summary of the performance data to establish Equivalence:

Method comparison

The method comparison of the RESOLVE® Hb kit to predicate device was performed at three sites. Two of these used the BioRad's HPLC method VARIANT Sickle Cell Short Program (1) as a comparative method and one site used the VARIANT nbs Sickle Cell Program (2). The studied samples were either routine DBS samples or retrospective samples. More than half of the samples were normal samples (FA). The rest of the samples had hemoglobin combinations with Hb S or hemoglobin combinations with other Hb variants such as Hb C, Hb D, Hb E, Hb G-Philadelphia, a-thalassemia and $\beta \cdot$ -thalassemia.

# Precision

The precision study was based on the results obtained from the comparison studies with the predicate devices. The variation was estimated by measuring the distance of certain Hb bands of FASC controls used in the studies. The analysis of variance approach was used to calculate the following variations:

Substantial Equivalence:

The RESOLVE® Hb kit has the same Intended Use and Indications for Use as the Predicate Devices BioRad's HPLC method VARIANT Sickle Cell Short Program (K924813) and the VARIANT nbs Sickle Cell Program (K051072).

Based on the method comparison data and the precision results one may conclude that the RESOLVE® Hb kit is substantially equivalent to the cleared and currently marketed predicate devices BioRad's HPLC method VARIANT Sickle Cell Short Program and the VARIANT nbs Sickle Cell Program.

Dear Mr. Koskivaara:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
