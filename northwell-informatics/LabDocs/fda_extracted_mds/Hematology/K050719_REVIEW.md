# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY

INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE   
A. 510(k) Number: K050719   
B. Purpose for Submission: 510(k) for the addition of a new parameter for nucleated red blood cell count (NRBC), and an optional slide smearing and staining unit known as the SPS Evolution.   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Horiba ABX Pentra DX 120 Hematology Analyzer   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Quantitative   
E. System Descriptions: 1. Device Description: The ABX PENTRA DX 120 Automated Hematology Analyzer is an in vitro, bench-top, clinical laboratory instrument, providing a complete blood count (CBC), leukocyte differential count (DIFF), reticulocyte count (RET), and nucleated red blood cell count (NRBC). The optional slide preparation system (SPS Evolution) smears and stains slides. 2. Principles of Operation: The instrument is driven by a microprocessor, and uses cytochemistry, focused flow impedance, light absorbance, and fluorescence methodologies. 3. Modes of Operation: Automatic, open (stat mode)/closed tube modes

4. Specimen Identification: By keyboard and internal and external barcode

1. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

# Manual

1. Aspiration of $1 3 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of blood through the shear valve   
2. The Blood samples goes to detection cell, which triggers the sampling valve switch.   
3. Blood volumes contained in the valve loops are transferred to the measurement chambers   
4. Internal and external needle rinse

# Automatic

1. Cassette mixed   
2. Cassette identification and tube detection   
3. Tube extraction from the cassette and cap piercing   
4. Aspiration of $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of blood   
5. Aspiration of specimen through the commutation valve   
6. The Blood samples goes to detection cell, which triggers the sampling valve switch.   
7. Blood volumes contained in the valve loops are transferred to the measurement chambers

8. Internal and external needle rinse

Calibration: Commercially available calibration material

7. Quality Control: Electronic quality control (EQC) and external liquid controls

8. Software:
