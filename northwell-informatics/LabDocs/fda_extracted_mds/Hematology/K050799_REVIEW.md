# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The Triage D-Dimer Calibration Verification Controls and Triage D-Dimer Controls were prepared using EDTA plasma at various concentrations. The Level 1 and Level 2 Controls were tested 8 times each at 10 different time points using the Triage D-Dimer Controls. The $\%$ CV for the Level 1 control is $8 . 6 \%$ and the Level 2 control is $8 . 2 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

An open vial stability study was conducted to determine the stability of the control material once removed from frozen storage. Samples were thawed on a bench top with an ambient room temperature of $2 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Samples were tested on the same lot of randomized Triage devices at 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Samples were tested on 6 devices at each time point. Acceptance criterion for the study was defined as D-dimer values being within the expected range $\pm 2$ standard deviations. Acceptable performance was obtained when the controls were thawed between 10-120 minutes with 30 minutes being the recommended time point for a thawed vial.

Closed-vial stability studies are continual and are used to determine product expiration dating. The Triage D-Dimer Calibration Verification Controls and the Triage D-Dimer Controls were stored at ${ } - 2 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and data generated over the initial 9 months indicated that D-dimer present in the Triage D-Dimer Calibration Verification Controls and the Triage D-Dimer Controls are stable for at least 9 months at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable
