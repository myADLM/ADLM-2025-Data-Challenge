# 807.92 (a)(2): Device Name - trade name and common name, and classification

# Trade name:

CoagCare® Anticoagulation Management System (CoagCare)

# Common name:

Software accessory to prescription-home use prothrombin time (INR) devices for effective anticoagulation management with warfarin

# Classification:

CoagCare® is considered an unclassifed accessory to INR test systems; INR test systems are regulated under 21 CFR 864.7750, Class II: 81 GJS.

The device regulation for a "calculator/data processing module for clinical use" (21 CFR 862.2100) exempts such Class I devices from 510(k) requirements. This regulation is not entirely applicable, however, since the exemption only applies to data processors for clinical laboratory use, and not home use or use in clinic scttings.

# 807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate device

The CoagCare® Anticoagulation Management System is substantially equivalent to the Diacare® Monitoring System, K882001, cleared October 18, 1988; the Diacare system was cleared for the clinical management of diabetes mellitus.

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The CoagCare system is a software accessory to prescription-home use prothrombin time (INR) devices for effective anticoagulation management with warfarin. System Overview: The system consists of two components, the CoagCare Patient Interface and the CoagCare Caregiver Interface, both of which are accessed through an internet browser. The interface provides a structured therapeutic regimen developed for the individual patient. It prompts the patient for INR values, symptoms, and other disease related data, and provides the patient with recommended doses of warfarin and an INR testing schedule that can be adjusted based on parameters specified by the patient's caregiver. The patient is given recommendations for warfarin doses for each day until the next time of required INR testing. In cases of marked abnormal INR readings or disease signs or symptoms suggestive of over-treatment, the Patient Interface instructs the patient to contact his/her healthcare provider for further instructions.

The second component of the CoagCare system is the Caregiver Interface. The caregiver monitoring the patient's anticoagulant therapy accesses the Caregiver Interface at least daily. The Caregiver Interface is programmed to automatically identify patient problems such as patients who report thromboembolic or hemorrhagic symptoms, failure to check their INR on a prescribed day, etc. The Caregiver Interface prioritizes problems requiring the caregiver's attention. Once patients have checked their INRs and transmitted their results, if the caregiver agrees with the warfarin dosing instructions provided by the patient interface, no further interventions are required for that day. Patients with markedly abnormal results o r r ecurrent p roblems a re p rioritized for caregiver i ntervention, w hereas stable patients are listed with their results, eliminating the need for direct patient contact by the caregiver. The Caregiver Interface also allows the caregiver to override therapeutic instructions provided by the Patient Interface, or send a text message to the patient through the Patient interface. (For more emergent issues, the patient can be contacted directly by the caregiver by telephone.)

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended use

The CoagCare Anticoagulation Management System (CoagCare) is an interactive internet-based (web-based) software system for the long-term management of patients undergoing warfarin anticoagulation therapy. The system is an accessory to prescription home-use prothrombin time devices that measure International Normalized Ratios (INRs), and it facilitates remote clinical management between patient and caregiver.

# 807.92 (a)(6): Technological Similarities and Differences to Predicate

The following chart describes similarities and differences between the CoagCare system and the Diacare system (the predicate).

The differences between the two data management systems do not raise new issues of safety and effectiveness.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Non-clinical data

Non-clinical studies are not relevant to software accessories.

# 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Clinical Data

The CoagCare Anticoagulation Management System was evaluated in comprehensive clinical studies at three sites. Fifty-eight patients at Duke University Medical Center and 22 patients at the University of New Mexico Medical Center, and 20 patients from a private practice in Miami who had been on warfarin for at least six months were recruited for the study. Patients at the Duke and New Mexico sites were switched to home INR monitoring and followed with the CoagCare system for six months. Patients in the Miami site remained on the system from 3 to 4 months. The overall INRs of all patients averaged $6 2 . 5 \%$ time in therapeutic range (TTR) prior to the start of CoagCare. This value increased to $7 3 . 5 \%$ TTR during the study, an $1 1 \%$ and statistically significant improvement $\scriptstyle ( { \mathfrak { p } } = . 0 0 8 )$ . T he s ite e ffect w as n on-significant $( \mathtt { p } \mathtt { - } . 8 7 )$ , s uggesting that the improvement in TTR was not statistically distinguishable across the sites. The increase in TTR seen with the CoagCare system could reasonably interpreted to reflect a clinically important improvement. Caregivers at all 3 sites reported that it took between 15 and 25 minutes a day to manage between 20 and 58 patients. Due to the automation provided by CoagCare, managing 48 patients with CoagCare did not take much more time than managing 20. Between $9 2 \%$ and EY $100 \%$ of all patients reported that they preferred home management with CoagCare to traditional point-of-care treatment, that they felt that they were being monitored more closely with CoagCare and that their INRs were in better control with home management.

# 807.92 (b)(3): Conclusions from Clinical Testing

In summary, we have demonstrated that patients and caregivers can successfully use the CoagCare system to produce improved outcomes and a high degree of patient satisfaction. The studies show that the CoagCare system is safe and effective for intended use.

Dear Mr. Holdaway:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
