# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATIONDECISION SUMMARYINSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE

A. 510(k) Number: K050840 B. Purpose for Submission:

BioView, LTD is modifying the indications for use of the Duet™ system to include the detection and enumeration of urine specimen cells from subjects with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, probed by the Vysis UroVysion™ Bladder Cancer Recurrence Kit.

C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:

BioView LTD., Duet™ System

# D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

Detection and enumeration of urine specimen cells from subjects with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, probed by the Vysis Uro Vysion™ Bladder Cancer Recurrence Kit which has been cleared by the FDA.

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Duet System is a fully integrated imaging and scanning platform designed to enable identification and examination of cells of interest using a special dual-scan process. Cytological analysis experts can scan any slide, using both bright field and fluorescent illumination. While each type of scanning can be run by the Duet system independently, Duet has the ability to run both types of scans on the same slide, without losing the important data from either of the scans. Captured images from the first scan are saved as a “historical record” and can then be used for comparison during the second scanning stage. The images can be displayed sideby-side in a gallery of captured snapshots, referred to as targets.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The Duet System is software controlled and includes features such as: acquisition of images, views, editing, relocation, enhancement capabilities, automatic/manual counting and classification, printing, export of images and backups. The Duet System can also scan each field of view with several fluorescent filters instead of only one, generating and displaying a combined image for each field of view.

3. Modes of Operation:

a. Automatic scanning provides a gallery of targets that the system captures for all identified fields.   
b. Manual scanning provides interactive control over the microscope. This enables a user-controlled scan of any slide under either bright field or fluorescent illumination.

4. Specimen Identification:

Individual specimen slide case details are entered in a Slide Configuration dialog box where case details and a name are assigned to a slide. The scan process (fluorescent or brightfield), mode of scanning (automatic or interactive), scan task, and scan program (coordinates) details are entered.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Standardized cell preparations on peripheral blood, bone marrow, amniotic fluid, and urine specimens, are applied to microscope slides.

6. Calibration:

Calibration is recommended at least once every 6 months by Bio View service personnel.

# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

The Duet System is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis system. It is intended for in-vitro diagnostic use as an aiding tool to the pathologist in the detection, classification and counting of cells of interest based on color, intensity, size, pattern, and shape. The Duet System is intended to detect the following cell types: 1. Hematopoietic cells stained by Giemsa stain, Immunohistochemistry or ISH (with bright field and fluorescent) prepared from cell suspension; 2. Amniotic cells stained by FISH (using direct labeled DNA probes for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21); 3. Cells in urine specimens, stained by FISH (using the Vysis Uro Vysion™ Bladder Cancer Recurrence Kit for chromosomes 3, 7,17, and loss of the 9p21 locus) from subjects with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was determined using four slides, with each slide analyzed on three different systems and three times on one of these systems. The slides were selected to cover the range of the intended use, to include two negative slides, one positive slide, and one near the medical decision cutoff. Two operators performed the study at BioView Lab, in cooperation with Meir Hospital, Kafar Saba, Israel.

System reproducibility, measured by its consistency, was demonstrated by calculating the percentage of agreement between measurements. A high, value indicates a small variance between different runs on the same machine, relative to the differences between machines. The calculated results of the variance within the measurements using the same Duet System showed $100 \%$ agreement (12 out of 12), with $9 7 . 1 \%$ (11 out of 12) agreement between systems. The overall agreement level was $9 5 . 0 \%$ .
