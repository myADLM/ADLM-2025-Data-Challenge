# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY ASSAY ONLY TEMPLATE

A. 510(k) Number: K050928 B. Purpose for Submission:

To obtain clearance for Dade® Thrombin Reagent and Dade® Owren's Veronal Buffer for use in the measurement of fibrinogen. Dade Behring is modifying the packaging configuration of the Dade® Fibrinogen Determination kits so that the kit components Dade® Thrombin Reagent and Dade® Owren’s Veronal Buffer may be sold separately. No changes are being made to the operating principle or reagent composition.

1. Regulation section:   
21 CFR 864.7340

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product code:

4. Panel: 81 Hematology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): For use in the quantitative determination of fibrinogen in plasma and to accelerate coagulation of anticoagulated samples for immunohematology.

2. Indication(s) for use:

For use in the quantitative determination of fibrinogen in plasma and to accelerate coagulation of anticoagulated samples for immunohematology.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

4. Special instrument requirements:

# I. Device Description:

A quantitative assay for fibrinogen (Clauss method) is performed by measuring the clotting time of dilute plasma when excess thrombin is added. The clotting time obtained is then compared with that of a standardized fibrinogen preparation.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Dade® Fibrinogen Determination Reagents (pre-1976) Dade® Thrombin Reagent

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): BK 860038

3. Comparison with predicate:

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The enzyme thrombin converts the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen into its insoluble polymer fibrin. The clotting time for diluted plasma is inversely proportional to the fibrinogen concentration of the plasma. By using this principle, Clauss developed a simple procedure for determining fibrinogen based on measuring the clotting time of diluted plasma after the addition of thrombin. The clotting time obtained in this manner is then compared with that of a standardized fibrinogen preparation.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The Dade® Thrombin Reagent assay was used to measure fibrinogen concentrations ranging from 0.89 to $2 . 8 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ in Control Plasma N (K045333), Control Plasma P (K042209), low plasma pool (PPL), normal plasma pool (PPN) and Dade Data $\mathrm { F i } ^ { \mathfrak { P } }$ abnormal fibrinogen control (aFCP) (K811069). Eight determination per day over 5 days $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 4 0 )$ ) were performed using a Sysmex® CA-1500 analyzer. The following is a summary of precision data:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Not applicable

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed to determine the effect of icterus, lipemia, hemolysis, and heparin on the Dade® Thrombin Reagent assay. Normal and abnormal plasma sample preparations were spiked with increasing concentrations of each interferent. For each spiked level, the $\%$ recovery was determined [%Recovery $=$ (Test result / Baseline) $\textbf { x } 1 0 0 ]$ . The acceptance criterion was established as $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { g / L }$ relative deviation from the base pool.
