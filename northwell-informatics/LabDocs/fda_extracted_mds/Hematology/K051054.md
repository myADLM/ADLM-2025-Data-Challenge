# Summary Prepared:

April 25, 2005

Name of the Device:

VisuLizeTM Factor 1X Antigen Kit Common Name: Factor IX ELISA assay

# Classification of Device:

Class II   
21 CFR 864.7290, Factor Deficiency Test Subpart H, Hematology Kits and Packages Product Code: GGP

# Predicate Device:

Asserachrom 1X:AG, K854312 Diagnostica Stago (formerly American Bioproducts)

# Device Description:

The VisuLizeTM Factor IX Antigen kit is a sandwich enzymelinked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using a polyclonal antibody coated 96-microwell format. Plasma samples are diluted and applied to the pre-coated wells. After washing away unbound proteins, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labelled polyclonal antibody is applied to detect the captured Factor IX. A chromogenic substrate (TMB containing ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 } ]$ is added to allow for color development. The color formed is measured spectrophotometrically at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ , with the absorbance being directly proportional to the concentration of Factor IX that was in the sample.

Device Intended Use:

The VisuLize™m Factor IX Antigen Kit is an Enzyme Immunoassay for the quantitative determination of Factor IX Antigen in human plasma samples and Factor IX concentrates using the double antibody enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA).

# Clinical Performance Comparison:

The clinical performance of the VisuLize™M Factor IX Antigen Kit versus the Asserachrom IX:AG kit was compared to demonstrate substantial equivalence. Testing of clinical samples across the entire detection range was conducted internally and by two external testing sites. The results obtained by the three testing sites demonstrated excellent correlations between the proposed and predicate devices, as illustrated in the following table:

Dear Ms. Foulon:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
