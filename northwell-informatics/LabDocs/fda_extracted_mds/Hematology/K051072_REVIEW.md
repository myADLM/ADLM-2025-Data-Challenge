4. Special instrument Requirements: For Bio-Rad VARIANTnbs Newborn Screening System.

# I. Device Description:

This complete device consists of the Bio-Rad VARIANTTM nbs Sickle Cell Program (VnbsSCP) reagent kit, the Bio-Rad VARIANTTM nbs Newborn Screening System (VNBSS) instrument, and the Bio-Rad Genetic Data Management Software (GDM). The VNBSS instrument consists of a VARIANTnbs Neonatal Auto Sampler (VNAS) module for microwell plates and a VARIANTnbs Neonatal Chromatography Station (VNCS) module containing the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) hardware. The VnbsSCP reagent kit includes a specific analytical HPLC cartridge containing cation exchange resin, as well as two (2) buffer reagents for establishing an HPLC gradient. The GDM software is designed to execute the VnbsSCP assay protocol on the VNBSS instrument using the VnbsSCP reagent kit components for the purposes of qualitatively screening for the presence of normal hemoglobins F and A, as well as the abnormal hemoglobins S, D, C and E from neonatal heel stick blood, as collected on filter paper that is punched and eluted with deionized water. The VNBSS processes each sample individually. An eluted sample is aspirated directly from a microwell plate in the VNAS module with the punched filter paper disc still present, and transferred into the sample loop in the VNCS module. The contents of the sample loop are subsequently injected into the flow path of the VNCS module. The hemoglobins of interest are retained on the analytical cartridge in the presence of Elution Buffer 1. The ionic strength is subsequently raised by adding increasing amounts of Elution Buffer 2. The pre-programmed gradient is designed to have the hemoglobins of interest elute from the cartridge with retention times that fall within pre-determined windows characteristic of known normal and abnormal hemoglobins. The eluted hemoglobins are sequentially detected with a dual-wavelength filter photometer, which monitors hemoglobin absorbance at $4 1 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and corrects for any gradient induced absorbance changes at $6 9 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ . The software processed HPLC data is outputted in a printed report that contains: 1) sample identification, 2) date and time of analysis, 3) a table of peaks that includes: observed peak identification (hemoglobin type) name(s), retention time(s), peak height(s), peak area(s), and relative area percent(s), 4) total chromatogram area, 5) complete chromatographic display and 6) any error message(s) relating (if needed) to such data. Also reported is an optional “pattern assignment” for each hemoglobin based upon “pattern rules” derived from diagnostic hemoglobin literature.

# L. Test Principle:

Cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography with visible light detection.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1.Analytical performance:

a.Precision/Reproducibility:

The Bio-Rad VARIANTTM Sickle Cell Program device was based on NCCLS Protocol EP-05A (Vol. 19, No. 2 [1999]) and EP-05A2 (Vol. 24, No. 25 [2004]). Two analytical runs were performed per day on 20 days for a total of 40 runs on each of 3 separate systems. Each run included 4 replicates of two retention time positional QC controls. Within-run precision and within-device precision (formerly total precision) were determined. The reported predicate device retention time precision protocol included the same two retention time positional QC controls. However, the protocol did not strictly conform to NCCLS Protocol EP5-A2 guidelines, nor was within laboratory (or within-device) precision reported, as this was strictly a qualitative assay. The results of within run precision for both predicate and new devices was less than $1 \%$ for Hemoglobins F, A, E, D, S and C, and are presented in the following tables:

# d.Detection limit:

The Bio-Rad VARIANTTM Sickle Cell Program new device peak area limit of detection for hemoglobin variants (E, D, S and C) was determined using a total of 102 sample measurements bracketing the $1 \%$ peak area limit of detection for each variant, when the total chromatogram area was 1.5 million microvolt x second $\scriptstyle ( = { \mathrm { ~ \mathsf { \mu } ~ w o l t s } } \cdot { \mathrm { s e c } } )$ . The reported predicate device peak area limit of detection was $1 \%$ , when the total chromatogram area was 1.0 million $\mu \mathrm { v o l t s } { \cdot } \mathrm { s e c }$ . The results re: peak area limit of detection for hemoglobin variants (E, D, S and C) was $1 \%$ for both predicate and new device, and is documented in the following table:

2. Comparison studies:

a.Method comparison with predicate device:

Method correlation between predicate and -Rad VARIANT™nbs Sickle Cell Program new device was evaluated using 1025 unknown samples prepared from retrospective neonatal dried blood spot collection cards. Using a total area range of $0 . 9 0 – 6 . 3 0$ million μvolts·sec, there was $9 9 . 8 \%$ (1023/1025) agreement between test and predicate devices for all sample hemoglobin identifications. There was $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ (250/250) agreement between test and predicate devices for identifying hemoglobin S (HbS) in those samples that predicate device identified as containing HbS. In the two disagreements, the new device identified all hemoglobins identified by the predicate as well as one additional peak in each case. [See explanation below.] These results indicate satisfactory correlation between the predicate and test devices. The results are presented in the following tables

In one case of disagreement the predicate device reported FA with an “unknown” peak in the S window while the test device reported FAS. Independent iso-electric focusing results identified FAS in support of the test device results.

In the other case of disagreement the predicate device reported FAD while the test device reported FADC with a $2 . 6 \%$ peak area of HbC. Inspection of the test device chromatogram showed a low broad background in the C window without a resolved peak suggesting baseline noise.
