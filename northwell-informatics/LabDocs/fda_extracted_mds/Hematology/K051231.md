Accumetrics is claiming substantial equivalence of the VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay to other currently marketed, automated aggregation devices, specifically the CHRONO-LOG Whole Blood Aggregometer with CHRONO-PAR® ADP Reagent, as the predicate device. The CHRONO-LOG Whole Blood Aggregometer was cleared under k830749.

# Device Description:

The VerifyNow System is a turbidimetric based optical detection system, which measures platelet induced aggregation as an increase in light transmittance. The system consists of a stand-alone instrument and disposable assay device with reagents based on microbead agglutination technology.The quality control system includes an electronic control, an assay device intenal control, and two levelsof liquid control.The instrument controls assay sequencing, establishes the assay temperature, controls the reagent-sample mixing for the required duration, determines the degree of platelet function, displays the results and status information to the user, and performs self-diagnostics.

The assay devicecontains a lyophilized preparationfhuman frinogen coated beads, adenosine-5-diphosphate (ADP), a peptide, a fatty acid, buffer, and preservative. The patient sample is citrated whole blood, which is automatically dispensed from the blood collection tube into the assay device by the instrument, with no blood handling required by the user.

Fibrinogen-coated microparticles are used in the VerifyNow-P2Y12 assay device to bind activated platelet GP lib/la receptors.ADP is incorporated into the assay to activate platelets, and the reagent is formulated to specifically measure P2Y12 - mediated platelet aggregation.

When the activated platelets are exposed to the fibrinogen-coated microparticles, aggregation o reports results in P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU).

# Intended Use:

The VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay is a whole blood assay used in the laboratory or point of care setting to measure the level of platelet P2Y12 receptor blockade.

# Technological Characteristics:

The VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay is similar to the CHRONO-LOG Optical Aggregometer in that it employs an optical measurement method. Whereas the CHRONO-LOG Whole Blood Aggregometer measures impedance, it has been found to be substantially equivalent to the optical detection version of the aggregometer. The VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay is similar to the CHRONO-LOG Whole Blood Aggregometer in that it uses citrated, whole blood samples and measures platelet aggregation. The VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay adds the use of fibrinogen-coated microparticles, which are not used in the CHRONO-LOG aggregometry methods.

# Performance Characteristics:

The VerifyNow P2Y12 Assay was evaluated in patients treated with clopidogrel, a drug known to specifically block the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor. The VerifyNow Assay was compared to platelet aggregometry using a CHRONO-LOG Optical Aggregometer (Light Transmittance Aggregometry - LTA) with $5 \mu \ M$ ADP as the agonist. Testing was performed in clinical studies at 4 centers on 147 subjects with a history of vascular disease or risk factors

The following vertical histogram shows the distribution of PRU values in patients before and after clopidogrel administration.The figure demonstrates a clear separation in the subjects' baseline and their post-clopidogrel P212 assay values.The VerifyNow-P212 Assay measured changes in PRU ranging from a minimum of 18 PRU to a maximum of 435 PRU with a mean change of 185 PRU.

A reference range for the VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay was calculated at the $9 5 \%$ confidence level for the baseline (pre-clopidogrel) dataset, using NCCLS Guideline C28-A2. This is summarized in the following table.

The VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay is formulated to be specific to aggregation mediated by only the P2Y12 receptor, whereas in LTA, using ADP as the agonist, aggregation results are affected by both platelet ADP receptors - P2Y1 and P2Y12. Since clopidogrel acts only on the P2Y12 receptor site, LTA has a non-specific aggregation artifact due to P2Y1 mediated aggregation that is not seen in the VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay. In order to compare the clinical PRU and LTA results, post-clopidogrel data are expressed as percent inhibition, or percent reduction from baseline.

To accomplish the goal of having an assay with reduced non-specific aggregation, the VerNow PY2 assay uses aaditive  fatty acid) in addition to ADP omake the assy more sensitive and specific for the effects of ADP mediated by the P2Y12 receptor.

The following data illustrate the effect of the additive on LTA assay specificity to the P2Y12 receptor. Blood was drawn from 10 individuals, and a known specific P2Y12 inhibitor, 2- methylthio-AMP (2MeSAMP), was added to each blood sample at a concentration to achieve near maximal inhibition. LTA was performed using $1 0 \mu \mathsf { M }$ ADP, with and without addition of the additive. The VerifyNow-P2Y12 Assay was also run on these samples. The figure below shows that for all ten blood donors, the percent inhibition $\%$ decrease in aggregation) is less for aggregometry with ADP only $73 \%$ avg inhibition) than for aggregometry with ADP and the additive $9 5 \%$ avg inhibition). In addition, agreement between VerifyNow-P2Y12 and LTA using the additive was very good $( 9 3 \%$ vs $9 5 \%$ avg inhibition). This study demonstrates the benefit of using the additive to achieve P2Y12 specificity.
