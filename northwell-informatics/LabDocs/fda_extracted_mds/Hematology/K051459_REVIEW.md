E. System Descriptions:

1. Devise Description:

The Sysmex XE-2100DC is an automated hematology analyzer which can analyze 21 parameters in whole blood. These parameters include: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW-CV, RDW-SD, PLT, MPV, and NEUT%/#, LYMP $\%$ /#, MONO $\%$ /#, $\mathrm { E O \% } / \mathrm { { } }$ #, and BASO $\%$ /#.

The XE-2100DC system consists of four principle units and three printers, which are: (1) Main unit, which analyzes and controls samples, (2) Sampler Unit, which supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically, (3) Information Processing Unit (IPU), which processes data which gets from the Main Unit, (4) Pneumatic Unit, which supplies pressure and vacuum used by the Main Unit, (5) Color Graphic Printer, which prints a hadcopy of analysis results for screen of histograms, scattergrams, etc, (6) Data Printer, which prints analysis data in the examination ticket format, and (7) Page Printer, which prints lists of analysis information or results. Operator interface with the IPU is accomplished with the use of a 22-key panel keyboard. The analyzer processes approximately 113 to 150 samples per hour, depending on the mode used.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The XE-2100DC performs hematology analyses using the following methods : Sheath Flow DC Detection Method, Flow Cytometry Methods using a Semiconductor Laser and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) hemoglobin Method.

WBCs, are analyzed by the opitcal detector block based on the flow cytometry method using a semiconductor laser. RBCs and platelet count are analyzed by the RBC detector using the Hydro Dynamic Focusing (DC Detection) method. Hemoglobin(HBG) is analyzed by the HGB detector based on the SLShemoglobin detection method. Analysis data is displayed on the panel keypad LCD screen and IPU.

3. Modes of Operation: Manual, Capillary, Sampler (Automatic), Manual Closed

4. Specimen Identification: Specimen information is managed by four menu lists and specimen identification input is manual (by operator) or by barcode reader.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Whole blood tubes (corresponding to the amount of EDTA anticoagulant) are manually mixed by inversion before sampling.

6. Calibration:

The manufacturer’s instructions are to be followed for materials and frequency of calibration. Following installation calibration, it is requested to verify instrument calibration every six months or on an “as needed “ basis, and maintain good QC practices, to ensure the accuracy of the system.

7. Quality Control:

The manufacturer’s instructions are to be followed for materials and frequency of quality control analysis.

8. Software:

The role of the software on the XE-2100DC analyzer is to operate the instrument in order to analyze whole blood samples and to provide a way to store and review data. One of the software programs allows the user to set user-definable flags according to their laboratory protocol. The XE IPU PIM (Patient Information Manager) software analyzes the data and works in conjunction with the Windows 2000 operating system, which serves as an administrative function.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

Stability:

28 samples (normal and abnormal) were used to determine stability to 48 hours. Each sample collected was split into 2 aliquots, one held at room temperature $( 1 8 ^ { \mathrm { o } } – 2 6 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } )$ and the other held at low temperature $( 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Each sample was analyzed on the XE-2100DC and the designated Reference instrument at baseline (immediately or within 4 hours after blood collection), 24, 48 and 72 hours post collection. MCV results were expressed as percent deviation from the baseline measurement.

The XE-2100DC analyzer result for MCV at 48 hours for both $4 \mathrm { ^ { o } C }$ and room temperature samples exhibited ${ \leq } 8 \%$ deviation.
