# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle: The assay is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RIPA) technology. A d-dimer specific monoclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper. Sample is then added to the paper, and reacts with the antibody. A conjugate consisting of an enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that is directed against a second antigenic site on the d-dimer molecule is added onto the reaction zone of the paper. The enzyme labeled antibody reacts with the bound d-dimer, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is washed away. Because the wash solution contains substrate for the enzyme, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound faction increases directly with the concentration of D-dimer in the sample. The reaction rate is measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: 3 levels of citrated human plasma pools were tested in duplicate for 20 days. Within run and total coefficients of variation $( \% C V )$ were calculated following guidelines outlined in NCCLS Guideline EP5-

A. With-in run reproducibility ${ < } 4 . 0 \%$ , total reproducibility $< 6 . 0 \%$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

d. Detection limit:

e. Analytical specificity:

An extensive list of substances were found to have no significant effect $( < 1 0 \% )$ on the DDMR method when added t a plasma pool containing ${ \sim } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of D-dimer. Users should refer to the package insert for this information.

Antibody specificity was demonstrated through cross reactivity testing of fibrinogen and the following fibrinogen degradation fragments D and E. Results demonstrated no significant effect on the assay.

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

Assay cut-off of $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ was established through ROC curves. The study was performed by the manufacturer using 152 negative samples, and 26 positives. PE was ruled out for confirmed by ventilation-perfusion $\mathrm { ( V / Q ) }$ lung scan, pulmonary angiography scintigraphy and/or spiral CT. DVT was ruled out or confirmed by compression ultrasonography.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

b. Matrix comparison:

3. Clinical studies: Samples were collected from out-patients at three sites, presenting to the emergency department or thromboembolism unit with suspected DVT or PE. Diagnosis was determined by validated diagnostic algorithms utilized by each facility. A total of 832 patients (site $1 = 3 9 4$ patients, site $2 = 1 3 5$ , site $3 = 3 0 3$ ), between the ages of 19 and 99, was tested on the Dade Behring Stratus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS D-Dimer (DDMR). Sensitivity, Specificity, Negative Predictive Value, and Positive Predictive Value, was determined based on the previously determined cut-off value of $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .
