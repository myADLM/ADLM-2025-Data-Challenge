$\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Controls are intended for use on $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Series analyzers, with the optional $\mathrm { \bar { i } Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Module installed, as a control for evaluating body fluid RBC and nucleated cell counts. The device will consist of two levels of red blood cells and nucleated cells.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

4. Special instrument requirements:

# I. Device Description:

$\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Control is a stabilized suspension of human red blood cells and simulated white blood cells in a solution containing biological salts and antimicrobial preservatives. The product is packaged in glass vials containing $8 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ . The closures are polypropylene screw caps with polyethylene liners. Four vials are included in a set. Two vials are level 1 with a low cell count and the other two vials are level 2 with a higher concentration of cells. The vials are further packaged in a six (6) welled vacuum formed “clam-shell” container with the package insert / assay sheet. The product must be stored at $2 - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Controls were designed to provide a cell mixture that would be useful as positive controls for the Iris Diagnostics’ $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Module. The $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Module is an in-vitro diagnostic device used by a competent human observer to examine and count red blood cells and nucleated cells in cerebrospinal fluid and serous fluids. A trained technician uses $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Controls to verify that he or she can count red blood cells and nucleated cells accurately with the $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Module. When handled like a patient sample, $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Controls will provide RBC and nucleated cell counts within the expected ranges indicated on the assay sheet.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility studies were performed on three lots of each level of $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Controls. Each value is calculated from 10 consecutive replicates of each level for each pilot lot (a total of 10 data points per level). Repeat testing was conducted at an offsite location using one pilot lot and one patient sample. The mean, SD and $\%$ CV were calculated for the data.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Open Vial Stability:

Three pilot lots of reagent were set up to verify performance throughout the 30-day open vial dating. On specified days, during a 30-day period, analyses were conducted on the $\mathsf { \bar { i } Q } ^ { \mathbb { P } } 2 0 \mathsf { \bar { 0 } }$ analyzer (13 times, approximately 3 runs per week) from a single vial per level. Reagent vials were returned to refrigerated storage between analysis periods. All lots performed as expected, with parameter recovery within the established assay ranges.

Closed Vial Stability:

Three lots of reagent were set up to verify performance throughout the 40-day expiration dating. On specified days, during a 40-day period, analysis was conducted on the $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \textcircled { \mathtt { R } } } 2 \mathrm { 0 0 }$ analyzer. Each vial was analyzed three times in succession (one run per week for 3 to 4 weeks for each vial). Reagent vials were returned to refrigerated storage between analysis periods. The data demonstrated no significant trends and consistent recovery of values within the indicated assay range.

$\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Controls are stable through the expiration date when stored at $2 - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After opening, $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Controls are stable throughout the open-vial dating, as indicated on the assay sheet when store at $2 - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Alternate Site Testing:

Product samples were provided to an alternate site location at UCLA in Los

Angeles, CA. The two levels performed within the assay range.

4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The assigned values for red blood cells and nucleated cells were determined by replicate analysis of $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Body Fluids Controls on $\mathrm { i Q } ^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2 0 0$ Series Analyzers. The mean and expected ranges for both levels of each lot are included in the package insert. The ranges were calculated using all of the data for 40 days from each lot and multiplying the $\%$ CV by 2.5. The ranges were set at a minimum $3 \mathrm { f } \pm 2 0 \%$ or, if greater, rounded to the next higher hundred value, i.e.437 rounded to 500.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

1. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
