The concentration of the calibrator components have been adjusted to ensure optimal calibration of the appropriate Roche methods on clinical chemistry analyzers.

# Reactive components

Hemolyzed sheep blood, with chemical additives and material of biological origin as specified. The origin of the biological additives is as follows:

Analyte Hemoglobin HbA1c

Origin Sheep blood Human blood

# Non-reactive components

Preservatives and stabilizers

The concentrations and activities of the calibrator components are lot-specific and specified in the labeling. The values are also encoded in the calibrator barcode sheets for COBAS INTEGRA analyzers. The calibrators are designed to allow calibration to either the American NGSP system or the International IFCC system. The product has been tested and found negative by FDA accepted methods for HBV, HCV and HIV 1 and 2.

FDA Guidance for Industry “Abbreviated 510(k) submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators; Final”

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable. Formatted: Indent: Hanging: 18 pt b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Deleted: Not applicable. c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The sponsor states that the absolute Hemoglobin (Hb) values for the C.f.a.s. HbA1c are traceable to the CRM 522, through the use of the cyanomethemoglobin (CNMetHb) reference method. For more information see the following references:

(1) International Committee for standardization in hematology expert panel on hemoglobinometry. Recommendations for reference method for hemoglobinometry in human blood and specifications for international haemoglobin cyanide reference preparation. Clinical & Laboratory Hematology, 9, 78-79, 1987.   
(2) Preparation and certification of a reference material of haemoglobin cyanide for standardization of blood hemoglobin measurement CRM 522; Report EUR 16101 EN European Commission bcr information reference material 1995.

The sponsor also states, that the absolute HbA1c values are traceable to the IFCC reference method through the use of the IFCC calibrator set “Los Angeles 2004”, Levels 1-8.

Value assignment – Hb values: The value assignment process for the Hb values was performed in five laboratories. Each laboratory conducted three independent runs where 30 whole blood samples were measured:

in duplicate using CNMetHb reference method and in singleton using a commercially available method

Value assignment and transfer process - HbA1c values: Assigned values were verified using a commercially available assay against the IFCC Calibrator set (Levels 1-8) in five laboratories, with each lab performing three independent runs on Integra 800 analyzers.

Real-Time Shelf life stability was established by taking a set of stored calibrators $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and assaying them after 12, 24, and 30 months. The acceptance criterion was established at $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the initial assigned value.

Accelerated stability was established by taking C.f.a.s. HbA1c calibrator that was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and then stored for 5 days at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Five replicates of this ontest material was analyzed and compared to a reference material (fresh C.f.a.s. HbA1c). The average of the five replicates was calculated as a percentage of the reference value. The acceptance criterion is recovery of $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the reference value.

Stability of reconstituted calibrator was established by reconstituting the C.f.a.s. calibrator according to package insert directions and then store a $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 8 hours; at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2 days; and at $\mathrm { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ for 3 months. Five replicates of each ontest material were analyzed and compared to a reference material (freshly reconstituted C.f.a.s. HbA1c). The average of the five replicates was calculated as a percentage of the reference value. The acceptance criterion is recovery of $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the reference value.
