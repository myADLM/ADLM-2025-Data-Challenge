# Precision

ACTICLOT\* dPT'" and DVVtest" reagent and the DVVconfirm\* reagent precision studies were performed by American Diagnostica Inc. and one ficld trial laboratory using various coagulation analyzers: ACI \* 300R centrifugal analyzer, $\mathrm { B C T } ^ { \tilde { \mathbf { k } } , }$ , MLA\* 900C coagulation analyzer, and the STA Compact". LAtrol" Abnormal Control (catalogue number 816A) and LAtrol™" Normal Control (catalogue number 816N) were the controls that were tested for the precision evaluation. These precision studies included multiple tests performed over several days. The precision results from the subject device are shown in TABLE 2.

Precision data obtained from laboratory field tests and from testing at American Diagnostica Inc. show that ACTICLOT" dPT™" and DVVtest® and $D V V c o n f i r m ^ { \mathrm { \Large { k } . } }$ are substantially equivalent. The precision data obtained from each instrument is substantially equivalent because the intra-assay CVs were within $3 . 8 \%$ and the inter-assay CVs were within $7 . 2 \%$ . The mean clotting times from the precision studies are shown for informational purposes only. Clotting times of the two comparative methods are not epeed to be he same becaue both he predicate method and subject method have systematc bias(1) based upon differences in mechanism of initiation of clot formation and instrument system bias in assessing clot time of each method.

# Method Comparison (accuracy)

ACTICLOT\* dPT™" method comparison studies were performed at American Diagnostica, Inc. in Stamford, CT (Study 1) and at Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Fleurimont (Québec), Canada (Study 2). Patient samples were tested using ACTICLOT\* dPT™ and DVVtest" and DVVconfirm\*". The accuracy matrix of each study is displayed on TABLE 4 and TABLE 5.

# Conclusion Concerning the Method Comparison Studies:

The accuracy studies from the laboratory field test and from testing at American Diagnostica Inc. show that ACTICLOT® dPT™ and $D V V t e s t ^ { \mathrm { \bf \hat { k } } }$ and $D V V c o n f i r m ^ { \overbrace { n } . }$ are substantially equivalent. In Study 1, 49 out of 54 samples tested $( 9 0 . 7 \% )$ were in agreement. In Study 2, 81 out of 93 samples tested $( 8 7 . 1 \% )$ were in agreement. The accuracy or agreement of these two methods was between 87.1% and 90.7%.

# Sensitivity Studies:

Twenty-three prescreened LA positive samples were tested at the Haemotology Department at Univeristy College London, UK with the predicate device, the subject device, and a third commercially available aPTT sensitive LA test (Dade Actin\* FSL Activated PTT Reagent). The test results are shown on TABLE 6.

(a) Assays were performed using the ACL. 300R coagulation analyzer. (b) Assays were performed using the Sysmex\* CA-1500 coagulation analyzer.

# C'onclusion Concerning Sensitivity:

The London study shows that the sensitivity of ACTICLOT" dPT'" and $D V V t e s t ^ { \mathrm {  ~ \hat { ~ } { \ z } ~ } }$ and DVVconfirm\* are substantially equivalent because the subject method identified and the predicate method identified 18 of the $2 3 \mathrm { ~ L A }$ positive samples. The third method was included for informational purposes.

It is well known, in the haemostasis field, that no one LA test identifies all LA positive samples due to the biochemical heterogeneity among lupus anticoagulants and the heterogeneity among LA test reagents23. It is recommended that LA positive samples should be identified after testing with a combination of two or more LA tests23. When the test results from these three methods were combined, 21 of the $2 3 \ \mathrm { L A }$ positive samples were identified. The results from the combined tests are shown in TABLE 7. This increased the percent LA positive from $7 8 . 3 \% - \ 8 2 . 6 \%$ (with individual tests) to $9 1 . 3 \%$ when test results were combined.
