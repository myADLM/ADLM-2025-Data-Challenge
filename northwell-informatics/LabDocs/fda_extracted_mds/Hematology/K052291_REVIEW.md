Hematology (81)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit is designed for the separation of the normal hemoglobins (A, F and A2) and for the detection of the major hemoglobin variants (especially S, C, E or D), by electrophoresis in alkaline buffer $\mathrm { ( p H 9 . 4 ) }$ with the CAPILLARYS System. The CAPILLARYS performs all sequences automatically to obtain a complete hemoglobin profile for qualitative or quantitative analysis of hemoglobins. The assay is performed on red blood cells.

# 2. Indication(s) for use:

The CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit is designed for the detection and the characterization of hemoglobins in human blood with the Sebia CAPILLARYS system, for capillary electrophoresis. The CAPILLARYS performs all procedural sequences automatically to obtain a hemoglobin profile. The CAPILLARYS system automatically mixes the blood sample with hemolysing solution. The hemoglobins, separated in silica capillaries, are directly detected by their absorbance at $4 1 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ . The electrophoregrams are evaluated visually for the pattern abnormalities. Direct detection of the hemoglobins provides relative quantification of individual hemoglobin fraction of the normal hemoglobin fractions A, A2, F and for the detection of major hemoglobin variants as S, C, E and D using Capillarys electrophoresis. For in vitro diagnostic use.

# L. Test Principle:

The CAPILLARYS system uses the principle of capillary electrophoresis in a free solution. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their electrophoretic mobility in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation also occurs according to the electrolyte $\mathsf { p H }$ and electroosmotic flow. The CAPILLARYS system has capillaries functioning in parallel allowing 7 simultaneous analyses for hemoglobin quantification. A sample dilution with hemolyzing solution is prepared and injected by aspiration at the anodic end of the capillary. A high voltage protein separation is then performed and direct detection of the hemoglobins is made at $4 1 5 \mathrm { n m }$ at the cathodic end of the capillary. The resulting electrophoregrams are evaluated visually for pattern abnormalities. By using alkaline pH buffer, normal and abnormal (or variant) hemoglobins are detected.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was conducted using two blood samples (Control 1: normal Hb A and Hb A2 and Control 2: abnormal elevated Hb A2, Hb S and Hb F). The two control samples were mixed at different concentration. Linearity was determined for each fraction (Hb A, Hb A2, Hb S and Hb F). In addition, two blood samples were obtained containing different total hemoglobin concentration values of $1 0 . 6 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d l }$ and $1 2 . 5 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d l }$ . The samples were run neat, diluted 2, 3, and 5. The results demonstrated satisfactory linearity within the entire range of $2 . 1 - 1 2 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability studies were performed with the CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit for samples containing anticoagulants, EDTA, citrate and heparin. Samples were stored for up to 7 days between $2 - 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ . The percent of each fraction (HbA, HbF, HbS, HbA2 and Hb delta $\mathrm { \bf A } ^ { \prime } 2$ ) was measured. All three anticoagulants were found acceptable.

An additional study was performed on seventy (75) blood samples with hemoglobin variants, such as hemoglobin S, C, and E. This study also included the comparison of Hemoglobin A (Hb A). Gel confirmation studies were conducted on all samples tested.

Hemoglobin D studies were not conducted due to infrequency of the hemoglobin variant and sample availability.

All abnormal hemoglobins or abnormal levels detected were in agreement with the comparative method, hospital results and clinical diagnosis.

The blood samples and their diagnostic assessment used for all studies were provided by hospitals in Europe. The diagnosis was based on HPLC and/or on a routine alkaline gel and acid gel electrophoresis.
