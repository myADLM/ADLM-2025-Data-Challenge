B. Purpose for Submission: Original 510(k)   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Ikonisys, Inc., Ikoniscope™ fastFISH™ Amnio Test System   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

The Ikoniscope fastFISH Amnio Test System detects amniotic cells stained by FISH using commercially available direct labeled DNA probes or chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21.

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Ikoniscope fastFISH Amnio Test System is an automated scanning microscope system incorporating automated slide loading and handling, low and high magnification scanning to identify targets of interest and digital image acquisition, coupled with an image analysis workstation. Microscope slides, prepared according to the DNA probe manufacturers’ specifications, are placed into a multiple slide cassette, and loaded into the Ikoniscope fastFISH Amnio test system. The system unloads each slide, scans each one, and returns it to the cassette automatically. During scanning, images of cells exhibiting the predetermined characteristics for FISH signals are digitally photographed and stored. After all the slides are scanned, the workstation provides an image gallery for each slide that displays the image of each cell meeting predetermined characteristics and quantity. The operator/reader can then evaluate the cell nuclei, and make the diagnostic determination accordingly.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The Ikonisys fastFISH imaging system combines elements of existing technologies to perform its function. Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) uses commercially available DNA probes (not supplied with the test system) for marking chromosomes 13, 18, 12, X and Y. Automated cell locating/counting uses pattern recognition algorithms to identify the signal characteristics of interest. The Ikoniscope software automatically captures an image of each cell containing FISH signals and stores its location on the slide. These images are then presented to the operator, using a computer workstation for analysis.

3. Modes of Operation: N/A

4. Specimen Identification: Barcode

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Amniotic fluid samples should be collected, handled, and prepared according to the protocols for each clinical laboratory. Ikonisys cassettes hold one standard microscope slide.

6. Calibration: Calibration of the Ikoniscope is done at the time of installation by Ikonysis.

7. Quality Control: ProbeChek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ quality control slides provided by Abbott should be used with AneuVysion $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ probes as recommended by the probe manufacturer.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

The accuracy study was a clinical trial that evaluated samples of amniotic fluid obtained from women undergoing diagnostic amniocentesis. A total of 62 samples (124 slides) were evaluated. Samples were split and prepared for FISH assay in the usual way, using the Vysis Aneu Vysion $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ probes and following the approved Aneu Vysion protocol. Two sets of slides were prepared from each sample. One set was analyzed using standard manual microscopy and the other using the Ikonisys™ fastF $\mathrm { I S H T M }$ Amnio Imaging System. Trained cytotechnologists under blind conditions evaluated the samples. The study endpoint was the diagnostic evaluation. There was a $100 \%$ concordance of diagnostic results.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility study evaluated possible effects of operator, instrument, or run on the reproducibility of results using the Ikonisys™ fastFISH Amnio Imaging System. Slides for evaluation were prepared by the Sponsor and shipped to the laboratory for testing. Slides for the study were produced using two cultured human amniocyte cell lines. One line has the normal human chromosome complement and the other is trisomic for chromosome 18. Mixtures containing a low $( 1 0 \% )$ or high $( 7 0 \% )$ concentration of trisomic cells were prepared from cultures of these lines. Slides containing fixed interphase nuclei were prepared from these specimens following a standard Carnoy fixation protocol. Hybridization of the slides was undertaken at the testing laboratory using the Aneu Vysion $\mathbf { I M }$ Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Slide sets were assembled randomly with regard to high and lowconcentration samples. Two sets of 10 slides were evaluated on each of four separate instrument runs on different days. Two independent cytotechnologists, who scored the slides in a blind fashion, evaluated the image gallery produced for each slide. Of the 80 slides, 76 were able to be processed. The trial endpoint was the detection of trisomic cells. In only one case was there disagreement between the two independent technologists, yielding an agreement rate of $9 8 . 7 \%$ . There was no affect of instrument, operator, or run on the reproducibility of the results.
