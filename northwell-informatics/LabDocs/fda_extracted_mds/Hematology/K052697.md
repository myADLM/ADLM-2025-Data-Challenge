# Section 7, 510(k) Summary (continued)

The panels are assembled from its repository of frozen serum samples, with reactivity as determined by the (FDA cleared) GTI® PF4 ENHANCED® ELISA Assay test currently available within the United States. No preservatives are added. Samples are chosen to provide a broad range of reactivity and to include samples with low antibody levels and samples with high antibody levels. A "positive" identified serum panel has OD values greater than 0.400 as determined on the $\operatorname { G T I } ^ { \mathfrak { R } }$ PF4 ENHANCED ELISA Assay test.

Two types of kit configurations are available, specifically for use on the PFA  Heparin/Platelet Factor 4 Antibody Assay test systems:

# 2 Member QC Panel

This panel consists of 1 positive and 1 negative sera each approximately $1 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ in total volume. These are normally used for routine quality checks and to help determine if technical errors or reagent failures have occurred.

# Multi-Member Qualification Panel

This panel consists of either a 12-Member (10 positive and 2 negative sera) or 6-Member (5 positive and 1 negative sera). All panel member vials each contain approximately $1 5 0 ~ \mu \vert$ in total volume. These are normally sd r qaliying nd val $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { P I F A } } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ Heparin PF4 Antibody Assay test systems where a broad range of reactivity levels is desired. They provide comprehensive data for comparative analysis in regard to sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and lot-to-lot variability.

Data for comparative values on all panel members are available for reference only.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended use

The Heparin/Platelet Factor 4 Antibody Serum Panel is an assayed control, intended for use as a serum QC control to monitor and evaluate precision n accuray  te (qualive) $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { P I F A } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Heparin/PF4 Antibody Assay. Included are both confirmed positive and negative control panel members.

Section 7, 510(k) Summary (continued)

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Non-clinical data

Studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the Heparin/Platelet Factor 4 Antibody Serum Panels for reproducibility (stability, including freeze-thaw), and precision.

Study #1 was performed to test the reproducibility of the Heparin/Platelet Factor 4 Antibody Serum Panel through repetition of the testing procedure utilizing the PIFA® Heparin/Platelet Factor 4 Rapid Assay in conjunction with the $\mathrm { G T I } ^ { \{ \aleph \} }$ PF4 ENHANCED® ELISA Assay. This study also provided data supporting the ability of the Heparin/Platelet Factor 4 Antibody Serum Panel to remain stable after a number of freeze thaw cycles to mimic panel member handling conditions when utilized in the field. Included in the study were "borderline" samples that are near the cutoff range for positive and/or negative.

From testing each of the characterized samples in duplicate over a period of five days through a varying number of freeze-thaw cycles, the Heparin/Platelet Factor 4 Antibody Serum Panel consistently produced expected results from the ${ \sf P I F A } ^ { \langle \bar { \pmb { \mathfrak { s } } } \rangle }$ assay. In addition, the results consistently correlate with the O.D. values received when samples were run on the GT® PF4 ENHANCED® ELISA assay, indicating the ability of the serum panel member to remain stable through numerous freeze-thaw cycles.

Study $\# 2$ was conducted to support the quality of the serum panel members processed for use with the $\mathrm { P I F A } ^ { \mathrm { \bullet } }$ Heparin/Platelet Factor 4 Rapid Assay. Included in the study were "borderline" samples that are near the cutoff range for positive and/or negative.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Non-clinical data (continued)

From testing each of the characterized samples in multiple format and consistently receiving the expected results from the $\mathrm { P } \mathrm { I F A } ^ { \mathrm { \tiny \mathrm { ( \bullet ) } } }$ assay, the data reflects the precision provided by the assay. In addition, the results consistently correlate with the O.D. values received when samples were run on the $\operatorname { \dot { G } T I } ^ { \mathfrak { R } }$ PF4 ENHANCED\* ELISA assay, illustrating the ability of the serum panel member to deliver appropriate results through multiple testing procedures.

Dear Ms. Bagby:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
