# 3.0 Device Description

The product is an automated hematology analyzer capable of supplying a complete blood cell analysis and includes a differential leukocyte cell count. The product also provides automated reticulocyte analysis, enumeration of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in whole blood and leukocytes (WBC) and erythrocytes (RBC) in cerebrospinal fluid, serous fluids, and synovial fluid. The following reagents, with 510(k) numbers indicated where applicable, are qualified for use on the COULTER LH 750 Hematology Analyzer with Version 2B (or higher) software:

Intended for use in ensuring accurate instrument measurements.

# 4.0 Principle of Method:

The COULTER LH 750 Hematology Analyzers utilizes the Coulter Principle for enumerating and sizing blood cells, automatic diluting and mixing for sample processing and a single beam photometer for hemoglobinometry. They use COULTER VCS (volume, conductivity, light scatter) technology for WBC Differential analysis and classification and reticulocyte analysis. The analyzers use a reagent system consisting of an isotonic diluent, lytic reagents to lyse the red cells without significantly affecting the white cells and an instrument cleaner. Additionally, all systems include reagents used for reticulocyte staining and analysis.

For body fluids analysis, specimen is aspirated into the LH 700 Series Analyzer via the manual mode and is diluted in separate WBC and RBC baths. The Coulter Method of counting cells is used to detect and measure changes in electrical resistance when a cell, suspended in a conductive diluent, passes through a small aperture. Each suspended cell acts as an insulator. As the cell passes through the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between two submerged electrodes, one located on each side of the aperture. The resistance generates an electrical pulse. The accumulation of electrical pulses are channelized, processed for coincidence correction, and multiplied by a calibration factor, yielding the WBC and RBC counts.

The WBC result represents the TNC (total nucleated cell count) in the analysis of Body Fluids.

# 5.0 Indications for Use (Intended Use):

The COULTER LH 750 Hematology Analyzer is a quantitative, automated hematology Analyzer and leukocyte differential counter For In Vitro Diagnostic Use in clinical laboratories. The COULTER LH 750 Hematology Analyzer provides automated Reticulocyte analysis and enumeration of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) as well as an automated method for enumeration of RBCs and WBCs in body fluids.

# 6.0 Description of the modification:

The labeling for the marketed COULTER LH 750 hematology analyzer will be modified relative to draft product labeling submitted in the original premarket notification (K011342) to reflect new instructions for performing QC for NRBC determinations.

Dear Dr. Sugrue:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will alow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
