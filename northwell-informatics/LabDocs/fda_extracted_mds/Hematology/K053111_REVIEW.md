# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The APTT involves recalcification of plasma in the presence of a standardized amount of cephalin (platelet substitute) and a factor XII activator (polyphenolic component).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Intra-assay precision was assessed by testing 21 lyophilized normal and abnormal control plasmas with three different lots of $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ - Cephascreen® on the $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ analyzer. The CVs obtained for both samples using all three lots were $\leq 1 \%$ .

Inter-assay precision was assessed by testing lyophilized normal and abnormal control plasmas over 10 different test runs using $\mathrm { \dot { S } T A } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ - Cephascreen® on the $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ analyzer. The CVs obtained for both were $\leq 1 . 5 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Unopened vials remain stable for 15 months after the date of manufacture when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ as verified by real time stability studies utilizing three samples (normal and abnormal) and three different lots of Cephascreen® reagent. No clinically significant differences in clotting times were obtained between newly manufactured reagent and reagent stored for 9, 12, and 15 months post-manufacture.

Opened vials of $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ - Cephascreen® (with $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ - Reducer and perforated cap) is stable for 7 days $\mathrm { \nabla { \dot { S } } { \dot { T } } \mathbf { A } } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ - Cephascreen® 4) or 10 days (STA® - Cephascreen $^ { \mathfrak { P } } _ { 1 0 }$ ) on board $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ Analyzers. Normal and abnormal lyophilized plasmas were tested with three vials from three different lots of STA® - Cephascreen® 4 and $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ - Cephascreen® 10 when the reagent was immediately opened and then following 7 and 10 days respectively on board the STA analyzer.

Interference

Thirty four patient plasmas containing varying levels of FVIII as determined by $\mathrm { S } \mathrm { \dot { T } A } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ –Deficient VIII were tested with STA® - Cephascreen® on the $\mathrm { S } \mathrm { { T } } \mathrm { { A } } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ -R analyzer. For all samples tested with low FVIII levels, the APTT result was above the upper limit (34.9 seconds) of the expected reference range.

Twenty six patient plasmas containing varying levels of FIX as determined with $\mathrm { S \bar { T } A } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ –Deficient IX were tested with $\mathrm { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ - Cephascreen® on the $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ -R analyzer. Twenty four of the 26 samples tested with low FVIII levels had an APTT result above the upper limit (34.9 seconds) of the expected reference range.

To assess the responsiveness of $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ - Cephascreen® to unfractionated heparin (UFH), 60 patient plasmas containing UFH were tested on the STA® analyzer. Heparin levels were determined using $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ – Rotachrom Heparin. Study results indicated that the majority of samples with heparin levels in the therapeutic range $( 0 . 3 { - } 0 . 7 \mathrm { I U / m l } )$ had prolonged APTT values. Of the patients tested, only one sample with therapeutic levels of heparin had a normal APTT.

To assess the effect of Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) on STA® - Cephascreen®, 60 patient plasmas containing varying levels of LMWH, as determined by $\mathrm { S T } \bar { \mathbf { A } } ^ { \circledast }$ – Rotachrom Heparin, were evaluated on the $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ analyzer. The effect on the APTT was minimal.

To assess the sensitivity of STA® - Cephascreen ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { d } } 1 0 \mathrm { L A }$ positive plasmas (as determined by Rosner Index) of varying strength were tested on the $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ -R analyzer. LA positivity was determined by the Platelin LS reagent. Four of the 10 samples were within normal range. The $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ - Cephascreen® was developed to demonstrate relative insensitivity to LA.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ - Cephascreen® kits were compared with the predicate device STA® - C.K. Prest® (K792048). The two kits were run in parallel as described in their respective package inserts to determine the APTT in 125 plasmas comprised of the following: normal plasma, plasma from patients receiving UFH and LMWH, plasma from patient receiving oral anticoagulant therapy, LA positive plasma, and plasma from patients with factor VIII and IX deficiency. Studies resulted in a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.943 and regression equation of y (STA® - Cephascreen®) $= 0 . 7 8 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ ( $\operatorname { S T A @ }$ - Cephascreen®) $+ 8 . 2$ .

Additional correlation studies were performed at three locations in France between the predicate device and the proposed device on the STA or the STAR instruments. At each site 130-135 plasmas were collected from presumed normal individuals as well as individuals with a variety of pathologies including patients with known Factor VIII or IX deficiencies, Lupus Anticoagulants or patients receiving UFH, LMWH, or vitamin K antagonists. A total of 395 samples tested yielded the following correlation data: $\mathrm { Y } =$ $0 . 8 1 \mathrm { x } + 6 . 4 2$ , $\Gamma = 0 . 9 4$ .

Not assessed

b. Clinical specificity: Not assessed   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: User defined

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ - Cephascreen® reference range was determined by testing citrated plasmas obtained from 360 presumed healthy individuals (obtained from hospitals in France). Testing was performed on multiple days using three $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ analyzers and one STA- $\mathbf { \cdot R } ^ { \mathbb { \left( B \right) } }$ analyzer. The analyzers yielded a reference range of 23.7 – 34.9 seconds $( \pm 2 \mathrm { S D } )$ .

Each laboratory should establish its own normal ranges and acceptable controls values for their particular local patient population. In general, values are considered normal if they fall within the range of mean $\pm 2$ standard deviations.
