# Substantial Equivalence:

The ABX MICROS CRP 200 can be considered substantially equivalent to the predicate device ABX MICROS CRP cleared to market under K002646.

The fundamental scientific technology for the analyzer itself has not changed. All parameters for complete blood count, differential leucocyte count, the reagents and controls, measuring principles, and the principles of operation are the same as previously cleared by the FDA.

The dedicated CRP reagents used on the ABX MICROS CRP 200 can be considered substantially equivalent to those previously used on the ABX MICROS CRP.

In addition, an optional add-on, to provide an Information Management System (iM) through which the ABX Micros CRP 200 ensures file management.

The overall effects on the Safety and Effectiveness of the Micros CRP 200 and the associated CRP reagents, controls and calibrators have been evaluated in internal & external clinical studies and internal validation procedures.

There is no known risk to the device Safety and Effectiveness.

# Description:

ABX MICROS CRP 200 is an automated hematology analyzer that was developed by Horiba ABX (Montpellier, France). It utilizes cytochemistry, focused flow impedance, light scattering, and turbidity to provide quantitative information on complete blood cell and differential counts, in addition to other hematology parameters and conventional CRP.

CRP levels are measured in patients by reacting anti-CRP antibody coated latex particles with lysed blood, and determining the rate of the turbidimetric reaction in the near infrared spectrum.

# Intended Use:

The ABX MICROS CRP 200 is an open tube, automated (microprocessor controlled) hematology analyzer used for the in vitro diagnostic testing of whole blood & plasma specimens. The device operates in complete blood count (CBC) mode or in CBC & Creactive protein (CRP) mode.

Measurement of conventional CRP aids in the evaluation of infection, tissue injury and therapy & monitoring of inflammatory disorders.

For the CRP mode, the MICROS CRP 200 uses dedicated HoribaABX reagents (ABX CRP REA), controls (ABX CRP TROL I & II) and calibrator (ABX CRP STD).

The MICROS CRP 200 may be coupled, on option, with an information management (iM) system.

# Discussion of Performance Data:

The studies and data analysis were carried out in accordance with appropriate indications given by the FDA guidelines.

The data presented in this 510K Pre-market Notification demonstrate good precision in accordance with EP5-A (NCCLS guidelines) and is entirely acceptable for all available parameters.

The linearity claim for the parameters WBC (0  80 x 103/µL), RBC (0 - 7.5 x 106/µL), HGB (0 - 23g/dl), HCT (0 - 62.4%), PLT (0 - 900 x 103/μL), conventional CRP for whole blood (0  200 mg/L), and plasma (0 - 150 mg/L) are entirely supported by the clinical data provided in this submission

Accuracy (Inter-procedural Correlation) showed no evidence of significant bias between the ABX MICROS CRP 200 and the predicate devices.

The sample stability for leukocyte counts and the three part leukocyte differential is acceptable for over a 48 hour period from the time of blood collection at both room temperature and 4°C. For C-Reactive Protein determinations data assures there is sample stability over a 72 hour period at both room temperature and $4 \%$ .

No effect of contamination of the instrument was dissimulated by the clinical data of this study, supporting a carryover claim of $< 2 . 0 \%$ for WBC, RBC, HGB, PLT & CRP parameters.

# Conclusions for non clinical and clinical tests :

The clinical studies tests conclude that the safety and effectiveness of the device is not compromised. Clinical testing met all acceptance criteria.

The device meets with the IEC 61010-1 standard of the International Electro-technical Commission on electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use. As well as the EN 61326 standard for Electromagnetic Compatibility.

All clinical and non clinical tests show appropriate levels of safety and effectiveness.
