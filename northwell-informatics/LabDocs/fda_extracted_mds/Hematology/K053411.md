Predicate Device(s):

Tosoh G7 Automated High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analyzer: HbA1c Variant Analysis Mode.

# Device Description:

DR® Hemoglobin A1c Assay, including calibrators, is a homogeneous immunoassay that measures HbA1c in human whole blood using automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The assay is based on the measurement of light scattering from the agglutination of microparticles. Hemoglobin and HbA1c in samples bind to microparticles by adsorption nonspecifically at the same rate. When HbA1c specific antibody is introduced, the antibody binds to HbA1con the microparticles resulting in agglutination. The extent of agglutination is directly proportional to the percentage of HbA1c present in the total hemoglobin and can be monitored spectrophotometricaly. This technology used in the DRI hemoglobin A1c assay is an established method (ref 1).

DRI Hemoglobin A1c Assay kit contains reagent 1, 2a, 2b and a hemolysis buffer. All are in liquid format.

DRI Hemoglobin A1c Calibrator kit contains four lyophilized positive calibrators with different hemoglobir A1c concentrations and one saline solution that serves as negative hemoglobin calibrator.

# Intended Use:

The DRl® Hemoglobin A1c Assay is an in vitro reagent system for the quantitative determination of Hemoglobin A1c in human whole blood using automated clinical chemistry analyzers.It is intended to aid in monitoring long-term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.

The DRl® Hemoglobin A1c Calibrators are intended for use in the calibration of the DRI® Hemoglobir A1c Assay in human whole blood.

# DRI® Hemoglobin A1c Assay comparison to Predicate Device(s):

The DRl® Hemoglobin A1c Assay, including calibrators, is substantially equivalent to Tosoh G7 HPLC Analyzer in its intended use and in for the quantitative determination of HbA1c concentration in whole blood sample.

Dear Mr. Lam:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
