Name of Device and Classification:

Name: Guava EZCD4 System

Classification: Class II

# Predicate Devices:

The Guava EZCD4 Assay is substantially equivalent to the Becton Dickinson MultiTest CD3 FITC / CD8 PE/CD45 PerCP/CD4 APC Reagent (K974360) and TriTest CD3 FITC/ CD4 PE/ CD45 PerCP Reagent (K965053) when performed on the FACSCalibur.

# Description of Device:

Determination of the absolute number of CD4\* T cells circulating in the peripheral blood is used to monitor antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) as well as other immunodeficiency diseases. There is an urgent need for an accurate, low-cost, simple, fast, objective and easy-to-learn method for CD4\* T-cell enumeration. Cost containment in the US and Europe has become a primary concern as the reimbursement rates for cytometry-based tests have changed and the need for more CD4 testing to make good therapy decisions has increased. The Guava® EZCD4™m System was developed to meet those needs.

The Guava EZCD4 System is an optimized cell analysis system consisting of the Guava PCA instrument, EZCD4 software for data acquisition and analysis and an EZCD4 Reagent Kit consisting of optimized reagents and protocols. The Guava EZCD4 Reagent Kit is a two-color direct immunofluorescence kit used for the enumeration of mature $\mathsf { C D 4 } ^ { + } ~ \mathsf { T }$ lymphocytes in human blood. It consists of a monoclonal anti-human CD3 antibody conjugated to the tandem dye, phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy5 (PECy5) and a monoclonal anti-human CD4 antibody conjugated to PE. Guava 1X Lysing Solution and Guava Fixative are available in separate packaging and are added, after staining, to lyse erythrocytes and to preserve cells respectively.

The Guava PCA instrument includes a laptop computer. The Guava PCA incorporates a new technology termed micro capillary cytometry. The device is a 3-parameter flow cytometer that utilizes a solid state 532 nm green laser, a fixed optical & fluidic system, a self-aligning flow cell and a micro capillary delivery system to perform cell analysis. The micro-syringe stepper pump allows the use of small sample volumes and volumetric measurements for the determination of absolute counts per microliter. The advantages to small sample volumes are low reagent cost and generation of minimal biological waste materials.

The Guava PCA optic system detects forward scatter and two different wavelengths of fluorescence, 580/20 nm and 675/20 nm. It has a small foot print, 21.6 cm x 32 cm x 36.3 cm and is equipped with a network ready laptop computer with a 10GB hard drive and Windows 2000 operating system. The software is application specific with onscreen messaging enabling ease of use and facilitates short, effective training programs. Data is readily analyzed immediately after acquisition and is stored as electronic files on the hard drive.

# Description of Device Components

# Reagents:

Two antibody reagents and an antibody diluent are included in the EZCD4 reagent kit. The user is responsible for combining these reagents at the time the assay is performed. Anti-human CD4-PE reagent and anti-human CD3-PECy5 reagent are provided in $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ tubes. The Guava Antibody Dilution Buffer is included in a 1mL tube.

# CD4-PE

Clone Edu-2, a monoclonal Mouse anti-human CD4 antibody conjugated to PE. The CD4 antibody allows identification of human helper/inducer $\cos \theta 4 +$ T Cell (HLA Class I) reactive) and recognizes a 60,000 Da MW surface antigen. CD4 is also present on monocytes but at a much lower density and lack co-expression of the CD3 molecule. The CD4-PE monoclonal antibody is purchased directly from Diatec. Incoming QC is performed to ensure antibody meets specification.

# CD3-PECy5

Clone UCHT1, a monoclonal mouse anti-human CD3 antibody conjugated to tandem dye PE-Cy5 (PECy5). The CD3 antibody uniquely identifies T-cells and recognizes an epitope on the epsilon chain of the CD3/T Cell antigen receptor (TcR) complex. The CD3-PECy5 monoclonal antibody is purchased directly from Diatec. Incoming QC is performed to ensure antibody meets specification.

Antibody Dilution Buffer

1XPBS, $09 \%$ sodium azide and $0 . 2 \%$ BSA pH 7.4.

Guava 1X Lysing Solution

The Guava 1X Lysing solution is a premixed, fixative-free erythrocyte lysing solution. The lysing solution is considered a Class I, General Purpose Reagent (864.4010) and is produced for Guava by CalTag. The Guava 1X Lysing Solution is sold as a separate reagent.

# Guava Fixative

The Guava Fixative is a $20 \%$ Paraformaldehye, methanol free solution. Guava orders this component from the original manufacturer and does not perform further processing. The Guava Fixative is sold as a separate reagent.

Guava Check Beads

Guava Check Beads are a suspension of fluorescent imbedded particles at $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ particles/mL $\pm 0 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ and are a component of the Guava Check Kit. The Guava Check Kit also contains a buffer consisting of isotonic buffered saline solution with $0 . 2 \%$ bovine serum albumin and $0 . 0 2 \%$ sodium azide as a preservative.

# Instrument:

The Guava PCA is composed of a fused silica capillary, a syringe pump to draw fluorescently labeled cells through the capillary, a solid state laser to illuminate the cells as they are drawn through the capillary, detectors to detect scattered light and fluorescent light emitted by the fluorescently labeled cells as they are illuminated by the laser, a waste container into which the sample is pumped after analysis and controls, fluidics and electronics.

# Software:

Within the Guava CytoSoft 2.3 version software there are three modules; EZCD4, Guava Check and Clean and Shutdown. Guava Check software controls the instrument for the purpose of determining if the system is functioning properly. EZCD4 is designed to acquire and analyse data specifically for $\mathtt { C D 4 + }$ T cell results. Clean and Shutdown prepares the instrument for daily shutdown.

Guava Check software controls the acquisition and analysis of data when Guava Check reagent is used. This includes determining when the instrument is ready to start and adjusts instrument settings appropriately for performing a Guava Check run. Once settings are established the software resets the pump and then begins the first of three Guava Check runs. This involves establishing a steady reagent flow, acquiring data (counting events) and then calculating the data received. This cycle is performed three times.

Once the data has been acquired and the instrument is ready for the use, the operator reviews the Guava Check data to ensure it meets pre-determined requirements. If requirements are met, the operator can continue work and begin preparing specimens. If the requirements are not met, the operator must perform system maintenance as required by the operator manual and perform the Guava Check analysis again.

In addition, Guava Check includes a trending features to allow the operator to track instrument performance with Guava Check over time. The operator can track and trend for the last 30, 60 or 90 days. The Guava Check data is stored in a cumulative log.

The EZCD4 module within the CytoSoft version 2.3 software performs many of the same functions as Guava Check software but it is designed for use with actual specimens. The software controls the acquisition and analysis of data for clinical specimens. This includes determining when the instrument is ready to start and adjusts instrument settings appropriately. Once settings are established the software resets the pump and the operator may introduce a specimen for acquisition of data. Sample acquisition involves establishing a steady fluid flow, acquiring data (counting events), analyzing the results and generating a report for review by the medical director for subsequent delivery to the physician.

Clean and Shutdown automatically performs three cleaning cycles and two rinse cycles. Guava recommends running the Clean and Shutdown protocol after each instrument use.

# Intended Use / Indications for Use:

The EZCD4 Assay is intended to be performed on a Guava PCA System with CytoSoft 2.3 version software which includes three modules; EZCD4, Guava Check and Clean and Shutdown. The system is intended to identify and quantify the absolute counts of CD4 T-Lymphocytes in EDTA whole blood. The GuavaEZCD4 system is intended for the ongoing monitoring of patients with documented diagnosis of an immunodeficiency disease. The Guava EZCD4 system is intended for use only by trained laboratory professionals.

# Performance Data:

# Correlation Study

This study was conducted at four clinical trial sites in the US. In each site, the performance of the Guava EZCD4 System was compared with the predicate reagentinstrument system. One of two predicate systems were employed was the Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer with MultiTest™m CD3 FITC / CD8 PE / CD45 PerCP / CD4 APC reagents (K974360) or TriTestT™m CD3 FITC/ CD4 PE/ CD45 PerCP reagents with TruCount™m Absolute Tubes (K965053). $\cos \theta 4 +$ T cells enumerated with the Guava EZCD4 (CD3 PECy5\* CD4 PE\*) monoclonal antibody was compared with absolute counts enumerated with the Becton Dickinson CD4 (CD3 FITC\* CD4 APC\* or $\mathsf { P E ^ { + } } ,$ monoclonal antibody in all sites.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that:

1. The Guava EZCD4 System is substantially equivalent to the predicate flow cytometry system for the enumeration of $\complement \mathsf { D } 4 ^ { * }$ T lymphocyte counts.   
2. The Guava EZCD4 assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate assay for the detection of $\cos 4 ^ { + }$ T lymphocyte counts.

In each study site, approximately 90 whole blood samples were collected from abnormal donors in three $\mathsf { C D } 4 ^ { + }$ absolute count ranges. These included approximately 30 donors with counts with the low range (0-200), 30 within mid range (201-500) and 30 within high range (501-2000). The total number of abnormal samples collected and analyzed in the four clinical trial sites was 365.

The linear regression analyses obtained at the four clinical trial sites are summarized on the following table. The regression statistics reported indicate that the results are substantially equivalent.

# Linearity and Sensitivity Study

This study was designed to demonstrate the linearity of measurement of the Guava EZCD4 System. In this study, Expected versus Observed values for absolute $\cos \theta 4 +$ T cell counts were determined by the preparation of a series of blood cell aliquots, each aliquot consisting of a decreasing volume of a bulk blood sample of known "high range" absolute $\mathtt { C D 4 + }$ T cell counts and an increasing volume of a bulk blood sample of known "Iow range" absolute $\mathtt { C D 4 + }$ T cell counts.All cell aliquots were prepared in duplicate and a total of 22 aliquots (11 pairs) were prepared. Testing was performed at Guava Techhologies, Hayward, CA.

The known CD4+ T cell counts of both "high range" and "low range" bulk blood samples combined with the known volumes of bulk blood used to produce the series of blood cell aliquots were used to calculate Expected values for absolute $\mathtt { C D 4 + }$ T cell counts in each aliquot. Observed values for absolute $\cos \theta 4 +$ T cell counts in each aliquot were determined by flow cytometric analysis with the Guava EZCD4 System.

Specific indications were included in the study protocol for the concentration of absolute CD4† T cells required of the "low range" bulk blood sample (<50 CD4\* T cells/ul) and of the "high range" bulk blood sample (>2000 CD4\* T cells/µl), to also enable the dynamic range of the Guava EZCD4 System to be demonstrated in this study.

The linear regression analysis of the Expected versus Observed values for absolute CD4 T cell counts with the Guava EZCD4 System are shown in the following graph.

# Precision - Intra-Laboratory Reproducibility Study

Intra-laboratory reproducibility of the Guava EZ CD4 System was established by testing at four independent geographically distributed sites in the U.At each site, 10 replicate whole blood samples were prepared and analyzed from each of three abnormal donors representing each of three EZC\*absolute count ranges.These ranges were Low range (0-200), Mid range (201-500) and High range (501-2000) samples.

Means, standard deviations (SD) and coefficients of variation (CV) were determined for each site in each range and are shown on the following table.

# Carryover Study

The sample carryover study was designed to determine the presence or absence of sample carryover with the Guava EZCD4 System. The study was conducted in a manner that was most likely to reveal carryover, or the contribution of a previously analyzed sample to a subsequently analyzed sample during sample analysis. This study was conducted at Site 2.

In this study, analysis of three replicates of a low range sample for absolute CD4+ T cell counts (50-200 CD4\* T cells/µL) was immediately followed by the analysis of three replicates of a high range sample for absolute $\mathtt { C D 4 + }$ T cell counts (500-2000 CD4\*T cells/µL). The procedure of analyzing replicates of the low range sample followed by replicates of the high range sample was continued until seven replicates of the low range sample $( n = 2 1$ ) and six replicates the high range sample $( n = 1 8 )$ had been analyzed, beginning and ending with replicates of the low range sample.

The following table indicates absolute $\complement \lor 4 +$ T cell counts obtained for each of the low or high range sample replicates in the Sample Carryover Study.

The presence or absence of sample carryover was determined by statistical comparisons of low range samples that immediately precede the analysis of high range samples (Pre-High samples) and with low range samples that immediately follow the analysis of high range samples (Post-High samples). The means, standard deviations (SD) and coefficients of variation (CV) of Pre-High and Post-High low range samples are shown on the following table. The 1 sided p-value of the Wilcoxin-Mann-Whitney test for this comparison was 0.1474.

Based on the data and analyses shown above, the sample carryover study was interpreted to indicate that no significant sample carryover was demonstrated.

# Specificity Study

The sample specificity study was designed to determine the specificity of the Guava anti-CD3 (CD3 PECy5) and anti-CD4 (CD4 PE) monoclonal antibody reagents for human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In this study, EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood samples obtained from five healthy subjects were each stained with the Guava anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies and analyzed on the Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur™m flow cytometer. The major white blood cell components, lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes from each sample were separately gated and analyzed to determine the percent of antibody positive cells according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The following tables indicate the percent positive cells, means, standard deviations (SD) and ranges for the Guava anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies for each blood component for the five normal donors studied. A total of 15,000 events were collected for the analysis of each blood component for each donor.

Based on the data and analyses shown above, the sample specificity study was interpreted to indicate the expected specificity of the Guava anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody for peripheral blood lymphocytes.This study was also interpreted to indicate the expected specificity of the Guava anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody for peripheral blood lymphocytes, allowing for the known weak positive staining of CD4 antibodies for peripheral blood monocytes.

# Blood Sample Aging

The potential influence of blood sample aging on analysis with the Guava EZCD4 System was evaluated in two separate studies at site 3. In the first study, unstained EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood specimens were stored for defined periods of time and then stained and analyzed with the Guava EZCD4 System (Pre-Staining Study).In the second study, EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood samples were first stained, lysed and fixed, then stored for defined periods of time and temperature and then analyzed with the Guava EZCD4 System (Post-Staining Study).

# Pre-Staining Study

In this study, five EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood specimens were drawn from each of five healthy normal donors. Each of the five unstained blood specimens was stored at 18-25°C for 0, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Each of the five blood specimens was

immediately stained and analyzed with the Guava EZCD4 System for the determination of absolute $\cos \theta 4 +$ T cell counts at the end of their respective storage periods.

The absolute $\complement \lor 4 +$ T cell counts were determined for each blood sample from each donor at each storage interval. Means, standard deviations (SD), coefficients of variation $( \% 0 \% )$ and percent change over time were determined for each donor blood sample. These values are shown in the table ("Pre-Staining Study") on a following page. Also shown is a plot of the percent difference of samples evaluated over the indicated time intervals.

# Post-Staining Study

In this study, five EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood specimens were drawn from each of five healthy normal donors. Seven samples were stained for each of the five blood samples drawn, and were then pooled and stored at $1 8 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ for 0, 4, 8 and 24 hours. Each of the five pooled samples was analyzed with the Guava EZCD4 System for the determination of absolute CD4+ T cell counts at the end of their respective storage periods.

In this study, five additional EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood specimens were drawn from each of five healthy normal donors. Seven samples were stained for each of the five blood samples drawn, and were then pooled and stored at $2 - 8 \%$ for 0, 4, 8 and 24 hours. Each of the five pooled samples was analyzed with the Guava EZCD4 System for the determination of absolute CD4+ T cell counts at the end of their respective storage periods. In order to facilitate 0 hour testing, the same 0 hour blood samples were analyzed in the $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } C$ and $1 8 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ portions of this study.

The absolute CD4 T-cell counts were determined for each blood sample from each donor at each storage interval. Means, standard deviations (SD), coefficients of variation $( \% 0 \% )$ and percent change over time were determined for each donor blood sample. These values are shown in the table ("Post-Staining Study") on a following page. Also shown is a plot of the percent difference of samples evaluated over the indicated time intervals.

Based on the data and analyses shown, the Pre-Staining Study was interpreted to indicate that unstained EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood specimens may be stored for periods up to and including 72 hours, prior to staining and analysis with the Guava EZCD4 System.
