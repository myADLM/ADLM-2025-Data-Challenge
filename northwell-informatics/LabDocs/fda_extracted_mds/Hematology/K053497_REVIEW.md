# I. Device Description:

The Guava EZCD4 System is an optimized cell analysis system consisting of the Guava PCA instrument, CytoSoft software for data acquisition and analysis and an EZCD4 Reagent Kit consisting of optimized reagent and protocols. The Guava PCA instrument incorporates a new technology termed micro capillary cytometry. The device is a 3-parameter flow cytometer that utilizes a solid state $5 3 2 \mathrm { n m }$ green laser, a fixed optical and fluidic system, a self-aligning flow cell and a micro capillary delivery system to perform cell analysis. The micro-syringe stepper pump allows the use of small sample volumes and volumetric measurement for the determination of absolute counts per microliter. The instrument includes a laptop computer. The Guava EZCD4 Reagent Kit is a two-color direct immunofluorescence kit used for the enumeration of mature $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ T lymphocytes in human blood. It consists of a monoclonal anti-human CD3 antibody conjugated to the tandem dye, phycoerythrin (PE)- Cy5 (PECy5) and a monoclonal anti-human CD4 antibody conjugated to PE.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Class II Special Control Guidance Document: Premarket Notification for Automated Differential Cell Counters for Immature or Abnormal Blood Cells Final Guidance for Industry and FDA, December 4, 2001

# L. Test Principle:

The Guava EZCD4 Kit is a two-color direct immunofluorescence reagent kit for enumeration of mature $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ T lymphocytes in human blood. The kit consists of a monoclonal antihuman CD3 antibody conjugated to the tandem dye phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy5 (PECy5), a monoclonal anti-human CD4 antibody conjugated to PE, Guava 1X Lysing Solution to lyse erythrocytes and Guava Fixative to preserve the cells. The CD3 antibody uniquely identifies T cells and recognizes an epitope that is expressed on the epsilon chain of the CD3/T cell antigen receptor (TcR) complex. The CD4 antibody allows the identification of human helper/inducer $\mathrm { C D 4 + T }$ cell (HLA Class II reactive) and recognizes a 60,000 Da MW surface antigen. CD4 is also present on monocytes but at much lower density and lack co-expression of the CD3 molecule. The prepared specimen is acquired by the PCA instrument. The cells travel past a laser beam and scatter the laser light. The stained cells fluoresce and both the scatter and fluorescence signals are detected by the instrument and analyzed to give the final result.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Intra-Laboratory reproducibility was established by testing at four independent geographically distributed sites in the US. At each site, 10 replicate whole blood samples were analyzed from each of 3 abnormal donors representing each of three

EZCD $^ { 1 4 + }$ absolute count ranges. These ranges were Low range (0-200), Mid range (201-500) and High range (501-2000). Means, standard deviations (SD) and coefficients of variation (CV) were determined for each site in each range.

The results are as follows (Intra-laboratory Reproducibility):

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

In the linearity study, Expected versus Observed values of absolute CD4 T cell counts were determined by the preparation of a series of blood cell aliquots, each aliquot consisting of a decreasing volume of a bulk blood sample of known “high range absolute $\mathrm { C D } \mathbb { S } { + } \mathrm { T }$ cell count and an increasing volume of a bulk blood sample of known “low range” absolute $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ T cell counts. All cell aliquots were prepared in duplicate and a total of 22 aliquots (11 pairs) were prepared.

The linear regression analysis results are as follows:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 1 1 \mathbf { x } - 4 5 . 2 3 7 \quad \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 6 6 } \end{array}
$$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Open vial stability testing was performed and determined to be up to five weeks when stored at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Special indications were included in the linearity study protocol for the concentration if absolute $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ T cells required of the “low bulk blood sample $( < 5 0 \mathrm { C D } 4 +$ T cells/ $\mu \mathrm { L }$ ) and of the “high range” bulk blood sample $( { > } 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { C D } 4 +$ T $\mathsf { c e l l / \mu L }$ ), to

enable the dynamic range of the Guava EZCD4 System to be demonstrated. The dynamic range is determined to be 50 to $2 5 0 0 \mathrm { C D } 4 +$ T cells/ $\mu \mathrm { L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Comparison studies were performed at four geographically diverse clinical sites. A total of 365 abnormal donors in three $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ absolute count ranges were collected. These included approximately 30 donors with count within the low range (0-200), 30 within the mid range (201-500) and 30 within high range (501-2000) samples at each site. Results are as follow:

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Random access

2. Software:

The Guava PCA CytoSoft 2.3 version software includes three modules: EZCD4, Guava Check and Clean and Shutdown. The EZCD4 is designed to acquire and analyze data specifically for $\mathrm { C D 4 + T }$ cells results. Guava Check controls the instrument for purposes of determining if the system is functioning properly. Clean and Shutdown prepares the instrument for daily shutdown.

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X_ _ or No_

3. Specimen Identification: Instrument auto numbering

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Whole blood is collected aseptically by venipuncture into a sterile EDTA (lavender top) blood collection tube. Blood should be stained within 72 hours of collection for optimal results. Unstained anticoagulated blood should be maintained at 18 to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to sample processing. Samples should be acquired within 24 hours of staining.

5. Calibration:

The Guava Check Kit is used daily to verify the performance by assessing counting accuracy and fluorescence detection using a standard fluorescence bead reagent.

6. Quality Control:

Commercially available whole blood control should be run daily to optimize instrument settings and as a quality control check of the system
