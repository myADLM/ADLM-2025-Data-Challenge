Summary Prepared: December 15, 2005

Name of the Device: HemosIL ProS

# Classification Name:

864.7290 Factor Deficiency Test Class Ⅱ   
81GGP Test, Qualitative and Quantitative Factor Deficiency

# Identification of Predicate Device(s):

K011424 HemosIL ProS

# Description of the Modified Device:

HemosI ProS is a functional assay for the quantitative determination of free Protein S in human citrated plasma on I coagulation systems as an aid in the diagnosis of hereditary and acquired Protein S deficiency.

The reconstituted and onboard stability claims for HemosIL ProS on the ACL Futura (K951891) and ACL Advance (K002400) are being revised as a precautionary measure based on indications from internal QC release data on multiple product lots.

# Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

The performance of HemosIL ProS with modified stability claims for the ACL Futura and ACI Advance is not materially different from the FDA cleared device.

# Summary of Performance Data:

Based on additional stability testing on the ACL Futura/ACL Advance, we are revising the onboard claim to 1 hour and the reconstituted $2 { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ claim to 12 hours to ensure the optimal integrity of the product in the field.

All other performance testing was within specification and is consistent with the currently labeled claims in the product insert for HemosIL ProS.

Dear Ms. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified inaccordance with the provisions of the Federal FoodDrug and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use Statement

510(k) Number (i known): K053499

Device Name: HemosIL ProS

# Indications for Use:

HemosIL ProS is a functional assay for the quantitative determination of free Protein S in human citrated plasma on IL coagulation systems as an aid in the diagnosis of hereditary and acquired Protein S deficiency.

This in vitro diagnostic test determines the functional activity of free Protein S by measuring the degree of prolongation of a prothrombin time in the presence of the tissue factor, phospholipids, calcium ions and activated Protein C. The Protein S activity is proportional to the prolongation of the clotting time of a Protein S deficient plasma to which the diluted sample was added.
