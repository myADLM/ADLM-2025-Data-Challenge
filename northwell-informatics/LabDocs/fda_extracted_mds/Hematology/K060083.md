nRBC-Chex for LH   
Assayed Hematology Control   
Nucleated Cell and Red Blood Cell Control (864.8625)

Predicate Device: Para 12 Plus Retics (K000945) Manufactured by Streck

# Description:

nRBC-Chex for LH is stabilized suspension of human and animal blood, in a solution containing biological salts and anti-microbial preservatives.The product is packaged in plastic vials containing 4ml The closures are polypropylene screw caps with polyethylene liners.There are two different levels. Level 1 has a low count and Level 2 has a higher count.The vials wil be packaged in a x ( or twelve (12) welled vacuum formed "clam-shel" container with the package insert / assay sheet.The product must be stored at $2 - 1 0 ^ { \circ } C$ .

# Intended Use:

RBC-Chex for LH is an assayed whole blood control designed to evaluate the accuracy and precision If Beckman Coulter® LH 750 in its measurement of the nucleated red blood cell parameter.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

Para 12 Plus Retics and nRBC-Chex for LH are both multi-parameter hematology control materials. They both contain RBC, WBC, and NRBC components. Unlike Para 12 Plus Retics, nRBC-Chex for LH does not include reticulocyte or platelet components. The suspending diluents are similar. Both Para 12 Plus Retics and nRBC-Chex for LH have closed vial stability performance claims of 75 davs.

# Discussion of Tests and Test Results:

Four types of studies were conducted to establish performance of nRBC-Chex for LH. The four tests conducted were Closed Vial Stability, Open Vial Stability, Run to Run Reproducibility, and Site to Site recovery of values. All testing showed that nRBC-Chex for LH is consistently reproducible, substantially equivalent to the predicate product and stable for the shelf life claimed.

# Conclusions Drawn From Tests:

nRBC-Chex for LH is an effective quality control material for evaluating the accuracy and precision of the Beckman Coulter LH 750 in its measurement of the nucleated red blood cll parameter. It meets the claim of a 75 day closed vial, and a 14 day open vial stability and consistent run-to-run perormance.Reproducibiliy studies and Closed Vial Stability results confirm lot-to-lot consistenc the manufacture of nRBC-Chex for LH.Customers can be assured of a reliable quality control material that meets their expectations.
