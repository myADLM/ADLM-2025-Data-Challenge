Device Description:

The Dako CyAn™ DXD device is a bench-top flow cytometer system relying on multiple (up to three) laser stimulation of fluorescence tagged lymphocytes. It is used with the Dako MultiMix, a triple color reagent; one each to CD3, CD4 and CD8, conjugated to fluorochromes APC(allophycocyanin), r-phycoerythrin, and fluorescein isothiocynate, which are balanced to identify the dual positive T-cell populations $\{ \mathsf { C D 3 } + \mathsf { C D 4 } + $ and $C _ { Ḋ } \mathsf { Ḋ 3 + C Ḍ } \mathsf { Ḋ 8 + } Ḍ$ in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The instrument requires daily set-up with Dako FluoroSpheres consisting of a set of 5 bead populations having different fluorescent intensities and one nonfluorescent bead population. The combination of fluorochromes enables excitation by light of any wavelength from $3 6 5 { - } 6 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ . The CyAn DXD utilizes anti-human CD3 conjugated with FITC, RPE and APC to perform autocompensation.

Intended Use:

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use   

<table><tr><td>CyAn™ DXD</td><td>The CyAn DxD Flow Cytometer with Summit ™M software and user manual is intended for use as an In-Vitro Diagnostic device for identification and enumeration of the relative fraction of lymphocyte subsets in human peripheral whole blood using flow cytometry, i.e., identifies the relative percentages of CD4 and CD8 T-cells as demonstrated by gating on CD3 positive cells. TC-660, the three color combination, CD3, CD4 and CD8 is intended for use to identify the relative percentages of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells. Calibrators, Dako K0110 FluoroSpheres are intended for in vitro use on the Dako CyAn ™M DXD flow cytometer with Summit™ software to adjust detector voltages and monitor daily instrument performance. CD3 FITC (Dako F0818), CD3 PE (R0810), and CD3 APC (C7225) single antibody-fluorochrome conjugates are intended to be used for setting fluorescence compensation parameters using automated compensation.</td></tr></table>

Substantial Equivalence:

The Dako CyAn™ DXD flow cytometer is substantially equivalent to the BD FACS Calibur whereby these instruments are used to identify and enumerate lymphocyte subsets using fluorescence gating and automated quality control algorithms. These products share similar technology and testing methodology. The additional parameters offered by the CyAn DXD for identification and enumeration over the predicate device does not introduce any new issues of safety and effectiveness.

Performance Characteristics:

Performance characteristics evaluated in support of the CyAn DXD and its associated components include results on linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity and carryover. Results of all testing conducted have demonstrated a substantial degree of equivalency to the predicate devices listed above.

Therefore, based on the information provided in this premarket notification, Dako concludes that the devices listed above are safe, effective and substantially equivalent to their respective predicate devices in their indications for use, device design, materials, operational principles, and intended use.

Dear Ms. Almeroth:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
