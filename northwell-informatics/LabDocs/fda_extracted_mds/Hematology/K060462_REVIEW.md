The NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor (PR) (Clone SP2) Antibody is a semiquantitative immunohistochemical assay to identify PR expression in normal and neoplastic tissues routinely processed and paraffinembedded. The antibodies are available as ready-to-use and concentrated and are optimized for use on the Lab Vision Autostainer.

NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human PR Antibody (Ready-to-use) contains rabbit anti-human monoclonal antibody prediluted in $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ Tris-HCL, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 6$ containing stabilizing protein and $0 . 0 1 5 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ sodium azide. The specific antibody concentration is approximately $1 . 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human PR Antibody (Concentrate) contains 1 mL (or $0 . 1 \mathrm { m L }$ , $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ) concentrated tissue culture supernatant containing rabbit anti-human monoclonal antibody directed against PR antigen, with $0 . 0 5 \%$ sodium azide as a preservative. The specific antibody concentration is approximately 160 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

“Guidance for Industry: Guidance for Submission of Immunohistochemistry Applications to the FDA”

# L. Test Principle:

NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human PR Antibody, specifically binds to progesterone receptor antigen located in the nuclear region of a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues. Immunohistochemical staining is performed on routinely processed, paraffin-embedded specimens. Immunohistochemistry is a well established, widely accepted laboratory methodology. The specific antibody is localized by a biotin conjugated secondary antibody formulation that recognizes rabbit immunoglobulins. This step is followed by the addition of an avidin/streptavidin enzyme conjugate that binds to the biotin present on the secondary antibody. The specific antibody-secondary antibody-avidin/streptavidin enzyme

complex is then visualized with a precipitating enzyme reaction product, which is readily detected by light microscopy.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Intra-run Reproducibility

Ten serial sections were cut from each of three breast carcinoma blocks for a total of 30 slides. The slides were stained on the autostainer and staining intensity was evaluated. Each slide showed acceptable reproducibility to others in the test and there was no variation in staining intensity.

# Inter-run Reproducibility

Ten serial sections were cut from each of three breast carcinoma blocks for a total of 30 slides. One slide from each block was stained on the autostainer for each of 10 days. Each slide showed acceptable reproducibility over the 10 days. One block showed greater than one degree of staining intensity variation on one day. The other slides showed no variation in staining intensity.

# Inter-method Reproducibility

Ten different breast carcinoma blocks of varying positivity were stained using the manual method and the automated stainer to determine reproducibility between the different methods. There was acceptable reproducibility between the two methods.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

N/A

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Positive and negative controls should be performed with each staining run. The pathologist is responsible for assuring that the assay is performing properly.

d. Detection limit:

N/A

e. Analytical specificity:

A total of 90 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues covering a wide range of normal human tissue types were tested with the PR antibody. The antibody demonstrated negative immunoreactivity with most tissues. Positive immunoreactivity was noted with some normal tissues which are typically positive, like uterus, ovary and ductal epithelial cells of the breast.

f. Assay cut-off:

A positive staining result is defined as more than $10 \%$ of tumor cells with stained nuclei of any intensity.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Comparison of the Neomarkers PR antibodies was performed with the predicate device using breast carcinoma tissue arrays.

A total of 250 tissues were tested. There was $9 5 . 2 \%$ (238/250) total agreement $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } , 9 1 . 7 7 \mathrm { - } 9 7 . 5 \% )$ between NeoMarkers PR antibody and the predicate device. The positive percent agreement was $9 8 . 8 3 \%$ (169/171) ( $9 5 \%$ CI, $9 5 . 8 4 \mathrm { - } 9 9 . 8 6 \% )$ . The negative percent agreement was $8 7 . 3 4 \%$ (69/79) ( $9 5 \%$ CI, $7 7 . 9 5  – 9 3 . 7 6 \%$ .

In addition, Cano et.al1 investigated the PR status on 40 paraffin sections from breast cancer patients using the NeoMarkers PR antibody in comparison to the predicate device. Total agreement was observed: sensitivity was $100 \%$ (18/18), specificity was $100 \%$ (22/22), and accuracy was $100 \%$ (40/40).
