2. Device Name/ Classification: Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PFA- $\textstyle 1 0 0 \circledast$ Platelet Function Analyzer and Dade $\textcircled{8}$ PFA-100® Reagents / Automated platelet aggregation systems, Class II (21 CFR $\ S 8 6 4 . 5 7 0 0 \rangle$

3. Identification of the Legally Marketed Device:

Dade® PFA-100@ Platelet Function Analyzer (K970505 and K002885)

# 4. Device Description:

The PFA- $\mathsf { 1 0 0 }$ system provides a tool for clinicians to use in the detection of platelet dysfunction induced by intrinsic platelet defects, von Willebrand factor (vWF) functional deficiencies, or exposure to platelet inhibiting agents. The PFA- $1 0 0 \textcircled { \mathbb { R } }$ system simulates, under high shear stress, the interaction of platelets with an injured blood vessel. These conditions allow the PFA- $\pmb { 1 0 0 }$ system to measure in vitro platelet function as related to primary hemostasis.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

The Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PFA- $100 \textcircled{8}$ Platelet Function Analyzer and associated reagents are in vitro diagnostic devices intended to aid in the detection of platelet dysfunction in citrated human whole blood.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The modified Dade® PFA- $\mathsf { 1 0 0 } \textcircled { \mathsf { R } }$ system is substantially equivalent in intended use and performance to the currently marketed Dade® PFA$\mathfrak  t o o o$ system.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

Different studies conducted by independent organizations have shown results that suggest good performance of the system when testing pediatric populations and good assessment of DDAVP treatment.

A summary of the different studies used in support of this submission is included in this section.

Dear Mr. Riesgo:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices markcted in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Devicc Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (scec above) into cither class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Codc of Federal Rcgulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labcling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
