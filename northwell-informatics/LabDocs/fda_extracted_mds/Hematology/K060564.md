# Device Name

Trade or Proprietary Name: INFINITI™ System Assay for Factor II & Factor V

Common or Usual Name: Factor II (Prothrombin) G20210G and Factor V Leiden G1691A Mutation Detection System

Classification Name: 21 CFR 864.7280 Factor V Leiden DNA mutation detection systems

# Predicate Device

Roche Factor V Leiden Kit Roche Factor II (Prothrombin) G20210A Affymetrix GeneChip Microarray Instrumentation System

# Device Description

The INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V is an in vitro diagnostic device which utilizes proprietary film-based microarray technology combined with process automation, reagent management and software technology for the detection and genotyping of the Factor II (Prothrombin) G20210A mutation and the Factor V Leiden G1691A mutation from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from human whole peripheral blood samples.

The INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V is comprised of the BioFilmChip" Microarray, the Intellipac™ Reagent Module, and the INFINITI Analyzer with the Qmatic™" Operating Software.

The BioFilmChip Microarray consists of a polyester film coated with proprietary multi-layer components designed for DNA analysis. The layers have been designed to provide a versatile surface to enhance test performance. There can be up to 240 spots per microarray with each spot representing a different allele. The microarrays are designed to be assay specific.

The Intellipac Reagent Module which acts as a communication link contains up to eight reservoirs that house the test reagents and has an integrated memory chip. The assay protocol resides in this memory chip and upon request is loaded to the INFINITI Analyzer. Information such as expiration date of reagents, volume usage, time of use and operation parameters are archived in the memory chip and appear on the worklist (run report).

The INFINITI Analyzer is an instrument used for clinical multiplex systems intended to measure and sort multiple signals from a clinical sample. The INFINITI Analyzer is designed to measure fluorescence signals of labeled DNA target hybridized to BioFilmChip microarrays. The INFINITI Analyzer automates the Factor II and Factor V assays and integrates all the discrete processes of sample (PCR amplicon) handling, reagent management, hybridization, detection, and results analysis. The assays are processed automatically and read by the built-in confocal microscope. Results are analyzed and presented in numerical and graphical format.

The INFINITI Analyzer has two main components: pipetting and optics modules. A variety of electronic components inside the instrument are used for its operation. These include multiple stepper motors, heating and cooling devices, a barcode reader, a photomultiplier tube, and a camera all connected to USB ports

Pipetting Module - The pipetting module performs all the operations related to dispensing and aspiration of reagent and processing the amplified sample to be dispensed on the microarray. When the sample has been processed and hybridized to the microarray, it is transferred to the optics module for scanning and reading.

Optics Module - The optics module is a lightproof assembly comprised of a 3-axis stage; camera, lasers, and a photo multiplier tube (PMT). It is the enclosed casement into which the microarray is transported automatically prior to being processed on the stringency station. The optics' stage follows X-Y-Z motions that can be stepped at a very precise rate (2.0 micron per step). Using excitation wavelengths of a $7 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ laser diode, the camera takes a $1 . 2 \mathbf { x } 1 . 2 \mathbf { m } \mathbf { m }$ picture for each registration spot of a fluorescent die. Analyses of these pictures allow the

location of three registration spots to be determined. With respect to the position of the three registration spots, coordinates of all the bio-spots can be located. While scanning, the stage moves along the Z-axis to focus the chip and the X and Y-axes to locate the individual spots on the microarray.

The INFINITI Analyzer hardware is controlled by the QmaticTM operating software, which is installed with-in the on-board computer and utilizes a LCD screen display. The INFINITI Analyzer modules are controlled by multitasking real time software. The Qmatic operating software has a schedule manager that is capable of controlling all operations of the INFINITI Analyzer such as assay protocol, fluid handling, robotics, optical detection and result analysis. Results are available for review via the LCD screen. Management reports include results in numerical and graphical format. The operator can also print the displayed results in tabular form (printer not included with INFINITI Analyzer).

# Intended Use

The INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V is an in vitro diagnostic device that consists of reagents and instrumentation which includes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, hybridization matrices, a thermal cycler, an imager, and software for detection and genotyping of Factor II (Prothrombin) G20210A and Factor V Leiden G1691A point mutations in DNA obtained from human blood samples. The INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V is a qualitative assay for use in clinical laboratories upon prescription by the attending physician.

# Indication for Use

The INFINITI System Assay for detection and genotyping of Factor II & Factor V is indicated for use as an aid to diagnosis in the evaluation of patients with suspected thrombophilia.

Substantial Equivalence

Comparison studies indicate that the INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V gives equivalent results to the FDA cleared Roche Factor II G20210A and Factor V Leiden Kits. $9 8 . 6 \%$ agreement between the two methods was observed when 208 samples were tested for the Factor II G20210A mutation. $100 \%$ agreement between the two methods was observed when 175 samples were tested for the Factor V Leiden G1691A mutation.

The INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V and the Roche Factor II and Roche Factor V Kits are based on the same principle: isolation of DNA from human blood sample, PCR amplification of the purified DNA, hybridization of the amplified product, staining of the bound product, and signal detection using fluorescence. The INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V is a multiplex assay which detects Factor II and Factor V mutations simultaneously while the Roche Factor II and Factor V Kits are separate assays detecting each gene mutation.

Instrumentation used in the INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V is the INFINITI Analyzer which is similar in design and principle to the FDA cleared Affymetrix GeneChip® Microarray Instrumentation System. Both are multiplex systems designed to measure fluorescence signals of labeled targets hybridized to microarrays and perform hybridization, washing, scanning, and data analysis of microarray chips.

Instrument reproducibility data for the INFINITI Analyzer is comparable to those reported in the $5 1 0 ( \mathbf k )$ Summary of the Affymetrix GeneChip Microarray Instrumentation System. See Performance Characteristics for the Reproducibility data for three INFINITI Analyzers tested using a standard microarray chip.
