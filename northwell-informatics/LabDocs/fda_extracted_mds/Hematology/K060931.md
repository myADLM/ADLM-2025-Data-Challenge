Summary Prepared: April 4, 2006

Name of the Device: HemosIL PT-Fibrinogen HS PLUS

# Regulatory Information:

864.7750 Prothrombin Time Test Class II   
81GJS Test, Time, Prothrombin   
864.7340 Fibrinogen Determination System Class II   
81GIS Test, Fibrinogen

# Identification of Predicate Device(s):

K933252 HemosIL PT-Fibrinogen HS PLUS

# Device Description:

HemosIL PT-Fibrinogen HS PLUS is a very high sensitivity calcium thromboplastin for simultaneous determinations of Prothrombin Time (PT) and Fibrinogen (Fib), for evaluation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway and monitoring Oral Anticoagulant Therapy in human citrated plasma on the IL Coagulation Systems.

# Reason for Submission:

The expected value ranges for PT and Fibrinogen on the ACL Futura/ACL Advance provided in the product insert for HemosIL PT-Fibrinogen HS PLUS are being updated based on data from a new normal range study.

# Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

The performance of HemosIL PT-Fibrinogen HS PLUS with the new expected value ranges for the ACL Futura and ACL Advance is not materially different from the FDA cleared device.

Summary of New Expected Values Data:   

<table><tr><td>Assay</td><td>System</td><td>N</td><td>Range (units)</td></tr><tr><td>PT</td><td>ACL Futura/ACL Advance</td><td>119</td><td>11.1 - 14.5 (seconds)</td></tr><tr><td>Fibrinogen</td><td>ACL Futura/ACL Advance</td><td>119</td><td>262 - 433 (mg/dL)</td></tr></table>

These results were obtained using a specific lot of reagent. Due to the many variables which may affect clotting times, each laboratory should establish its own reference range.

Dear Ms. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus. permits your device to proceed to the market.
