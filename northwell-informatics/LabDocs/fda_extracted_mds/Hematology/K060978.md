# ) Device name

Proprietary name: CoaguChek $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XS System Common name: Prothrombin time test Classification name: Prothrombin time test

# Predicate device

The Roche Diagnostics CoaguChek XS System is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the Roche Diagnostics CoaguChek S System (K020831).

# )Device Description

The CoaguChek XS is a $3 ^ { \mathfrak { r d } }$ generation CoaguChek meter which measures prothrombin time in fresh capillary or non-anticoagulated venous whole blood samples.

The CoaguChek XS System incorporates many of the perspectives shared by FDA during reviews of our previous systems, including but not limited to integrated quality control and a blood application area that is outside the meter.

The CoaguChek XS System includes a meter and CoaguChek XS PT test strips. Each box of test strips has its own code chip that you insert into the meter. The code chip contains important information about the test strips such as their expiration date and lot number. The meter and test strips work together to provide a safe and reliable system for testing blood-clotting time.

The CoaguChek XS System is intended for use by professional healthcare providers for quantitative prothrombin time testing for the monitoring of warfarin therapy. The CoaguChek XS System uses fresh capillary or nonanticoagulated venous whole blood.

The CoaguChek XS System is similar to the predicate CoaguChek S System in the following items:

Dear Ms. Tribbett:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class ⅡI (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed

Page 2 -

predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150, or at its Internet address
