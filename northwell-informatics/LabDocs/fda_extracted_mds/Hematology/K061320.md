Device Class:

Predicate Device: R&D Systems CBC-5D Hematology Control, K983032 manufactured by R&D Systems, Inc. 614 McKinley Place N.E., Minneapolis, MN 55413

Description: This control is a tri-level control for use in monitoring the performance of Coulter $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ hematology instruments and other auxiliary methods.

Intended use: R&D LH-nRBC Hematology Control is a tri-level control for usein monitoring the performance of Coulter $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ hematology instruments and other auxiliary methods. Refer to assay sheet for specific instrument models.

Comparison: Both products are used to monitor Coulter $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ multi-parameter hematology instruments. The R&D LH-nRBC added new parameters.

Discussion: Laboratory testing of 3 validation lots has shown R&D LH-nRBC Hematology Control to have substantial equavalence in performance, precision and stability to the predicate device. R&D LH-nRBC Hematology Control passed the acceptance criteria of remaining within the assay range over the life of the product. R&D LH-nRBC Hematology Control has demonstrated precision as indicated by the small standard deviation and % CV's obtained during laboratory testing. Expiriation dating has been established at 75 days (closed vial) and 14 days (open vial) when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and handled according to instructons for use.

Conclusion: R&D LH-nRBC Hematology Control is a safe and effective control for the above intended use when used as instructed in the package insert.

Dear Hogancamp:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into eitherclass II (Special Controls) orclass II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
