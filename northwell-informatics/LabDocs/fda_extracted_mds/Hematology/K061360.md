# Device Information:

Device Classification Name: Immunohistochemistry Assay, Antibody, Estrogen Receptor   
Common/Usual Name: Antibody for detection of estrogen receptor in histological tissue sections   
Proprietary Name: NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor Antibody (Clone SP1)   
Regulation Number: 21 CFR§864.1860   
Product Code: MYA   
Regulatory Class: Class II

# Predicate Devices:

NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor Antibody (Clone SP1) is substantially equivalent to the Ventana ER Primary Antibody (Clone 6F1 1) (K984567) for its stated intended use.

# Device Description:

Lab Vision's NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor (ER) Antibody (Clone SP1) binds to ER in the paraffin embedded tissue section. The specific antibody is localized by a biotin conjugated secondary antibody formulation that recognizes rabbit immunoglobulins. This step is followed by the addition of an avidin/streptavidin enzyme conjugate that binds to the biotin present on the secondary antibody. The specific antibody secondary antibody avidin/streptavidin enzyme complex is then visualized with a precipitating enzyme reaction product, which is readily detected by light microscopy. Each step is incubated for a precise time and at room temperature. At the end of each incubation step, the Lab Vision automated slide stainer (Lab Vision Autostainer) washes the sections to stop the reaction and remove unbound material that would interfere the desired reaction in subsequent steps.

# Intended Use:

NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human ER Antibody (Clone SP1) is an immunohistochemical (IHC) assay intended for laboratory use for the qualitative detection of ER antigen by light microscopy in sections of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded normal and neoplastic tissues on a Lab Vision automated slide stainer. It is indicated as an aid in assessing the likelihood of response to therapy as well as in the prognosis and management of breast cancer patients.

# Comparison to Predicate Device(s):

NeoMarkers Rabbit Monoclonal Anti-Human ER Antibody (Clone SP1) is substantially equivalent to the Ventana ER Primary Antibody (Clone 6F1 1) (K984567) for its stated intended use.

Dear Ms. Chang:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA). it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
