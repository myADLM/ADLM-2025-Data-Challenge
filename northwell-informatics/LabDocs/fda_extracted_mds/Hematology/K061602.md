# 5.13 Intended Use / Indication for Use:

The DuetTm System is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis system. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aiding tool to the pathologist in the detection, classification and counting of cells of interest based on color, intensity, size, pattern, and shape. The Duet™M System is intended to:

• Detect Hematopoietic cells stained by Giemsa stain, Immunohistochemistry or ISH (with bright field and fluorescent) prepared from cell suspension. Detect amniotic cells stained by FISH (using direct labeled DNA probes for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18 and 21). Detect cells in urine specimens, stained by FISH (using the Vysis UroVysionTM Bladder Cancer Recurrence Kit for chromosomes 3, 7, 17 and 9p21 locus), from subjects with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Detect and quantify chromosome 17 and the HER-2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the Vysis $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PathVysionTM HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. The Duet™m is to be used as an adjunctive automated enumeration tool, in conjunction with manual visualization, to assist in determining HER-2/neu gene to chromosome 17 signal ratio.

# 5.14 Device Description:

The DuetTM System is a fully integrated imaging and scanning platform that automates time-consuming and difficult laboratory tasks of slide screening by making a significant reduction in time and labor currently required.

The DuetTM System workstation integrates a microscope, CCD camera, motorized stage, computer, keyboard, mouse, joystick, monitor and a dedicated software program.

The Duet™M System scans in high resolution and in full color cell samples at high speed both in bright light illumination and in fluorescent illumination.

The Duet™M System suggests classification of the cells according to their morphological features, their staining (Giemsa, IHC) and fluorescent signals, and allows the user to quickly examine the results, correct them as needed and generate a report summarizing the sample's data. The unique feature of the Duet™M System allows the combined presentation of morphological and specific staining information of the same cell, for all the cells of the sample.

# 5.15 Substantial Equivalence:

# Intended Use

The intended use of the DuetTm System is expanded to include the detection and quantification of chromosome 17 and the HER-2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the Vysis® PathVysionTM HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (the PathVysionTM Kit). The Duet™M is to be used as an adjunctive automated enumeration tool, in conjunction with manual visualization, to assist in determining HER-2/neu gene to chromosome 17 signal ratio. Besides the additional indication, the Intended Use and Indication for Use statement of the DuetTM System were not changed.

Detection, classification and counting of HER-2/neu gene amplification via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the PathVysionTM Kit, are routinely performed manually at the specialized laboratories using conventional microscopes, according to the instructions provided with the approved kit. The claim of an automated aiding tool for the detection and enumeration of FISH signals is also claimed by the $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ -cleared automatic enumeration predicate devices, the Vysis $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AutoVysionT System, the Ariol $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ HER-2/neu FISH and the previously cleared Duet™M System. Both the Vysis AutoVysionTM System and the Ariol $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ HER2/neu FISH, similar to the DuetTM System, are intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection, classification, and counting of cells of interest based on particular color, intensity, size, pattern, and shape. In particular, the specific indication of HER-2/neu gene amplification detection via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the PathVysionTM Kit, is common to the DuetTM System and to both these predicates.

The new intended use was supported by a comparative performance study demonstrating that the operation of the DuetTm System is safe and effective for this application in comparison to manual microscopy. This study, which is summarized below, further confirms that any minor differences between the manual and the automated DuetTM System do not raise any issue of safety or efficacy.

# Technological Characteristics and Mode of Operation

The current Duet™M System is the same system as the 510(k)-cleared Duet™m System. No change was required to be incorporated to the system's hardware to support the new indication, and only minor software changes, including new algorithm for the automatic calculation of the overall amplification ratio of HER-2/neu gene, were made. All these changes were fully verified and validated through software verification and validation. The performance study described below further confirms that any minor differences between the manual and the automated Duet™M System do not raise any issue of safety or efficacy.

# 5.16 Performance Characteristics of the Duet™M System:

A performance evaluation study was performed in order to evaluate the performance of the DuetTM System for the detection of amplification of the HER-2/neu gene via FISH in human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the PathVysionTM Kit, in terms of its accuracy in comparison to the manual system, and its reproducibility and repeatability.

The performance evaluation study report is comprised of the following four studies, which are summarized below:

Study 1 - Methods Comparison - a comparison of the Duet™M System method to manual scoring method.

Study 2 - Precision/Reproducibility Performance - an evaluation of the performance of the DuetTM System in terms of reproducibility and repeatability, within a system and across systems.

Study 3 - The Optimal Number of Fields of View - a determination of the optimal number of Fields of View required to be captured by the system for accurate sampling of the specimen.

Study 4 - Methods Comparison at the Borderline Range. A comparison of the DuetTm System method to manual scoring method at the borderline range.

# 5.16.1 Methods Comparison with Predicate Device

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the accuracy of the Duet™M System method for detection of amplification of the HER-2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the PathVysionTM Kit, in comparison to the manual scoring method.

The study was conducted in four (4) sites, which followed the same study protocol. A total of 56 specimen slides, prepared from human breast cancer tissue specimens in various stages of the disease, representing the entire intended use population, were probed by the PathVysionTM Kit according to the manufacturer instructions. Each slide was screened both manually and using the Duet™M system.

For the purpose of the agreement analysis between the manual and the Duet™M System, 'Amplification' scoring ("FISH positive") was defined as a ratio of $\geq 2 . 0$ and 'No-Amplification' scoring (FISH negative") was defined as a ratio of $< ~ 2 . 0$ , in accordance with the definition of the PathVysion™M Kit's package insert.

The statistical analysis performed for the pooled results included levels of agreement, positive predictive accuracy (PPA), negative predictive accuracy (NPA) and Kappa coefficient (along with associated $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals). High correlation was found between the manual method and the results of the Duet™M System method, showing excellent accuracy in detecting normal and abnormal samples, as defined by the PathVysionTM Kit, as summarizes in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Proportion</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% Lowerconfidencelimit</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95%Upperconfidencelimit</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NPA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>91%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PPA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>82%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Overall</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>94%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Kappa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td></tr></table>

Analysis of Agreement between Methods and Predictive Values, Pooled Results. (PPA, Positive Predictive Accuracy; NPA, Negative Predictive Accuracy; Overall, Overall Percentage Agreement) - 3 FOVs Analysis

No significant differences between the studies in the four (4) sites were found rendering the pooled analysis valid.

In addition, the linear regression and bias estimation performed according to [NCCLS-EP9] further demonstrates the high level of agreement between the Duet™M System and the manual method throughout the entire range of the intended use population.

Further analysis of the pooled results of Study-1 (randomly selected samples, representing the entire intended-use population) and the additional samples of Study-4 (pre-selected to represent the borderline of 1.5-2.5), "Analysis of all Methods Comparison Studies Results" is presented in Section 15.16.4 below.

# 5.16.2 Precision/Reproducibility Performance

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the precision of the Duet™ System, for its performance with the PathVysion™M Kit, in terms of reproducibility and repeatability within a system and across systems and sites. For this purpose, the Duet™M System was evaluated using the following three (3) studies:

Within Run: Each slide was analyzed three times in succession on the same system, within the same day   
Day-to-Day: Each slide was analyzed three times, each time on a different day

• Site-to-Site: Each slide was analyzed three times, each time in a different site

Five (5) slides, which represent the range of the intended use were included in this study: two (2) slides of the PathVysion™M Negative control (target ratio 1.0), two (2) slides of PathVysion™M Mid-low Amplified Control (target ratio 1.8, near the medical decision point), and one highly amplified slide (target ratio $> 2 . 3 \AA ,$ . All slides were prepared according to the probe manufacturer's instructions.

The statistical analyses performed include estimating the average value, standard deviation and percent coefficient of variation (CV) for each slide separately for repeatability, lab reproducibility and day reproducibility.

Test results obtained for three (3) FOVs analysis demonstrated that CV values were usually low and ranged between 0.56 and $1 2 . 9 0 ~ \%$ for all cases. Only one exception was seen is laboratory reproducibility for one of the sample with a CV of $3 1 . 9 2 \%$ , resulted from very high amplification, which avoided accurate spot counting. Considering this objective problem of accuracy, good repeatability and reproducibility for the Duet™M System was demonstrated.

Therefore it can be concluded that the Duet™M System was proven to have high values of repeatability within run, between days and between sites, for three (3) FOVs analyses.

# 5.16.3 The Optimal Number of Fields of View

Method comparison studies and reproducibility and repeatability studies were conducted using both 3 and 6 FOVs to evaluate the optimal performance of the Duet System using a minimal number of FOVs. The correlation between results obtained from the Duet System 3 and 6 FOV analyses revealed a correlation of .996, with R-square $=$ .993. In addition, the constant was near 0 (0.0084) and non-significant (t = 0.207, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 8 3 6 \rangle$ . Therefore, 3 FOV provides results that are sufficient for the effective performance of the Duet System.

# 5.16.4 Methods Comparison at the Borderline Range

The purpose of this study was to further demonstrate the accuracy of the DuetTM System method for detection of amplification of the HER2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the PathVysion™M Kit, in comparison to the manual scoring method, in the borderline range.

For this purpose, a total of 21 human breast cancer tissue specimen slides, representing a borderline range [1.5-2.5], were selected, including the seven (7) borderline samples of this range from Study-1 and additional new fourteen (14) borderline samples collected from additional site.

A combined analysis of these results with the results of the seven (7) borderline samples from Study-1 was performed. All slides used for the analysis were human clinical specimens prepared from breast cancer tissues, probed by the PathVysionTM Kit according to the manufacturer instructions and which were found to be in the predefined borderline range [1.5-2.5].

For the purpose of the analysis of the agreement between the manual and the Duet™M System, the same criteria used in Study-1 (Method Comparison) were used. Thus, 'Amplification' scoring ("FISH positive") was defined as a ratio of $\geq 2 . 0$ and 'No-Amplification' scoring ("FISH negative") was defined as a ratio of $< 2 . 0$ , as defined in the PathVysion Kit's package insert.

The statistical analysis performed, summarized in the table below, included levels of agreement, positive predictive accuracy (PPA), negative predictive accuracy (NPA) and Kappa coefficient (along with associated $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals) demonstrates high correlation between the manual method and the results of the Duet™M System method at the borderline range, showing excellent accuracy in detecting normal and abnormal samples.

# Analysis of the Results of Method Comparison Studies (Studies 1 and 4)

Statistical analysis of all method comparison studies, including all results from Study-1 (randomly selected samples, representing the entire intended-use population) as well as all the additional fourteen (14) samples of Study-4 (pre-selected to represent the borderline of 1.5- 2.5) was performed. This analysis included levels of agreement, positive predictive accuracy (PPA), negative predictive accuracy (NPA) and Kappa coefficient (along with associated $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals).
