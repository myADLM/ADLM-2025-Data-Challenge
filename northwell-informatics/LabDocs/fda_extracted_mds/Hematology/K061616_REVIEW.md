# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Premarket Notifications for Automated Differential Cell Counters for Immature or Abnormal Blood Cells; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA

# L. Test Principle:

CBC analysis is based on the established Coulter principle method of automated cell counting and spectrophotometric hemoglobin determination. The Coulter method counts and sizes cells by detecting and measuring changes in electrical resistance when a particle (such as a cell) in a conductive liquid goes through a small aperture.

Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an insulator. As each cell goes through the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between two submerged electrodes, one located on each side of the aperture. This causes an electrical pulse that can be counted and sized. While the number of pulses indicates particle count, the size of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell volume.

Differential and reticulocyte analysis is based on the Coulter volume, conductivity and light scatter technology (VCS). Differential analysis classification and reticulocyte analysis occur in the flow cell, where: Low-frequency current measures volume; High-frequency current senses cellular internal content through measuring changes in conductivity; Light from the laser scattered off the individual cells characterizes cellular surface, shape, and reflectivity.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

In order to demonstrate substantial equivalence of the LH 780 Hematology Analyzer to the $\mathrm { L H } 7 5 0$ hematology analyzer, the LH 750 Body fluids Application and Sysmex XE-2100 Hematology Analyzer (for RDW-SD) experiments were designed and executed based on accepted industry standards and internal product development procedures. The performance protocols for data collection adhere to CLSI/NCCLS documents, ICSH/ISLH recommended reference methods, FDA guidance documents, and scientifically valid procedures.

Data was collected internally using normal and clinical samples at the Beckman Coulter, Inc. Systems and Applications Support Laboratory in Miami, Florida. Normal whole blood

specimens were obtained from the in-house blood center using a screened pool of donors. Clinical samples were obtained by arrangement with local hospitals, using spent specimens from routine laboratory analyses. For external site testing, clinical samples were obtained by using spent specimens from routine laboratory analysis.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
