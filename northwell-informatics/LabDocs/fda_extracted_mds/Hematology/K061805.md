# Predicate Device

LAC Screen and Confirm manufactured by Instrumentation Laboratories (K990302).

# Intended Use/Device Description

The STA®-Staclot® dRVV Screen and STA®-Staclot® dRVV Confirm kits are intended for the detection of lupus anticoagulants (LA) in plasma by the dilute Russell's viper venom method (1) performed with analyzers of the $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { Q } }$ line suitable to these reagents.

# Technological Characteristic Summary

The in vitro diagnostic device presented in this 510K submission, $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ -Staclot dRVV Screen and $\operatorname { S T A } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ -Staclot® dRVV Confirm, is substantially equivalent to the IL Test LAC Screen and Confirm manufactured by Instrumentation Laboratories. A comparison of the two kits is summarized in the following table.

Ninety plasmas obtained from patients with various clinical pathologies were tested with both kits at two sites. The percent agreement was $9 2 \%$ .

Re: k061805 Trade/Device Name: STA® STACLOT® dRVV Scrcen and Confirm Regulation Number: 21 CFR $\$ 864.8950$ EY Regulation Name: Russel viper venom reagent Regulatory Class: I Product Code: GIR Dated: October 25, 2006 Received: October 26, 2006

Dear Dr. Worfolk:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, thereforc, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In 'addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administecred by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will alow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
