# K. Standard/Guidance Document referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

Lupus anticoagulants are antibodies directed against phosholipid/protein complexes.

Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen test is performed with a low phospholipids concentration reagent to screen samples. If lupus anticoagulants are present, the clotting time will be prolonged.

The Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Confirm Reagent contains a higher phospholipids concentration to neutralize the LA present in the plasma to be tested. The clotting time obtained with the Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Confirm Reagent will be shorter than the one observed with the Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen reagent.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

3 lots of Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen and Confirm were used to determine withinrun precision using LA positive and negative control plasmas. Each control was assayed 21 times on each lot. A CV of less than $1 . 0 \%$ was obtained for all lots.

Inter-assay precision was assessed using lyophilized positive and negative LA samples on 1 lot of Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen and Confirm. Positive and negative samples were assayed on the Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen, and a positive sample was assayed on the Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Confirm. Samples were assayed in 10 runs over 6 days. $\mathrm { C V } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { s } \leq 4 . 1 \%$ was obtained for the Screen and Confirm reagents.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Stability data supported the reagent shelf life.

d. Detection limit:

# e. Analytical specificity:

Samples from patients on heparin may give a falsely elevated clotting time using the Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen and Confirm assays. The Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen and Confirm Assay contains a heparin inhibitor that will neutralize the effects of heparin up to $0 . 8 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . To verify this claim a normal plasma pool and a LA positive plasma were spiked with known quantities of UF. The plasmas were then tested with three lots of Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen and Confirm reagents. No significant difference was seen in the Screen, Confirm, and Normalized ratios up to $0 . 8 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

To assess the effect of LMWH on the Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen and Confirm assays, a normal plasma pool and a LA positive plasma were spiked with known quantities of Fragmin. The plasmas were then tested with three lots of Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen and Confirm reagents. No significant difference was seen in the Screen, Confirm, and Normalized ratios up to o.8 anti-Xa IU/mL fragmin.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The device was compared to the predicate at a 2 site study. At site one samples were collected from several hospitals in France, and assayed at Diagnostica Stago. Site 2 testing was performed at a hospital reference laboratory in Canada. Results demonstrated $92 \%$ agreement with the predicate device.

b. Matrix comparison:

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

b. Clinical specificity:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:

27 normal plasmas were tested with the Staclot $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVV Screen and Confirm assays. A normal reference sample was also tested with each batch of test plasmas. Testing was performed over multiple days on the STA-R. The mean Staclot Screen and Confirm ratio was 1.04 and 1.08.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
