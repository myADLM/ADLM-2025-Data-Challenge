# Device Description:

An ELISA for the detection of urinary 11-Dehydro Thromboxane $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ $( 1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 } )$ . Goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, PA) is coated onto 96- microwell plates. Reference, control, and patient samples are diluted in a Tris-based sample diluent $( \mathsf { p H } 9 . 0 )$ and added to the microwells. An ${ \bf 1 1 d h T x B _ { 2 } }$ tracer $\{ \mathbf { i } \mathbf { i d h T x B _ { 2 } }$ linked to alkaline phosphatase, (AP); Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, Ml) is then added to all wells except assay blanks, followed by the addition of an anti- ${ 1 } \operatorname { l d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ murine monoclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical Company) to all wells except assay blanks. The maximum binding wells $\left( \ B _ { 0 } \right)$ contain sample diluent, tracer, and monoclonal antibody, but no unlabeled ${ \bf \ l } { \bf \ l d h ^ { \prime } r } { \bf x B } _ { 2 }$ . The plate is then covered with the plastic sheet provided in the kit, and incubated at room temperature on a rotary shaker at $3 0 0 { - } 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { r p m }$ for two hours. The AP-Tracer and unlabeled ${ \bf 1 } { \bf 1 d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ from the reference curve/controls/samples compete for binding to the anti- ${ \bf l } 1 \mathrm { d } { \bf h } \mathrm { T } { \bf x } { \bf B } _ { 2 }$ monoclonal antibody, which is bound to the plate by the goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody. After incubation, the reaction solution is removed from the wells followed by five washes with TBS/Tween 20. The pNPP substrate is then added and the plate is covered and incubated with shaking for 30 minutes. The reaction is stopped by the addition of Stop Solution (0.1M EDTA) to the wells, and the plate is read at $4 0 5 { \ - } 4 2 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ,Results are compared to the reference curve and expressed in $\mathbf { p } \mathbf { { g } } / \mathbf { m } \mathbf { { l } }$ , Patient results are then normalized using the creatinine concentration of the sample, as measured by a separate assay.

# Intended Use:

The AspirinWorks Test Kit is an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) to determine levels of 11-Dehydro Thromboxane $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ $( 1 1 \mathrm { d } \mathbf { h } \mathrm { T } \mathbf { x } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 } )$ in human urine, which aids in the qualitative detection of aspirin effect in apparently healthy individuals post ingestion. For professional use only.

Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

The AspirinWorks Test Kit was compared to the Accumetrics® VerifyNow™M Aspirin Assay (K042423) as the predicate device. The AspirinWorks Test Kit is a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) that detects $1 1 \mathbf { d h T x B _ { 2 } }$ in urine. It is run in 96-well microtiter plates that have been coated with goat anti-mouse antibodies. To these wells samples, controls, or reference solution is added, followed by an $1 \mathbf { l } \mathbf { d h T x B _ { 2 } } \mathbf { - }$ alkaline phosphatase-linked tracer, and a monoclonal antibody specific for ${ \bf { 1 } } \mathrm { { i d h T x B _ { 2 } } }$ During the two-hour incubation, the ${ 1 } \mathrm { i } \mathbf { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ monoclonal antibody forms a complex with either endogenous ${ 1 } \mathbf { i d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ or the ${ 1 } { \mathrm { 1 d h T x B } } _ { 2 }$ tracer, and this complex is bound to the plate by the anti-mouse antibodies. After washing, a substrate is added for 30 minutes, the reaction is terminated by addition of a stopping solution, and otial density at $4 0 5 { \cdot } 4 2 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ is measured. The concentration of ${ \bf 1 } { \bf 1 d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ is indirectly proportional to the amount of yellow color measured at $4 0 5 { \cdot } 4 2 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ b ${ 1 1 \bf { d h T x B } _ { 2 } }$ is a metabolite of thromboxane $A _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { T } \mathbf { x } \mathbf { A } _ { 2 } )$ , which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation. Because $\mathbf { T } \mathbf { X } \mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ has a short half-life, the more stable urinary ${ \bf l l d h T x B _ { 2 } }$ metabolite is used as a direct measure of concentrations of $\mathbf { T } \mathbf { \mathbf { \hat { x } } } \mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ and therefore platelet aggregation.

The Accumetrics VerifyNow Aspirin Assay is a turbidimetric-based optical detection system which measures platleinduced agregation.The system uses he agonist arachidonic acid to induce platelet response n is based on the ability of $\mathrm { T x A } _ { 2 }$ -activated platelets to bind fibrinogen-coated beads. Light transmittance increases as activated platelets bind and aggregate the beads, and the instrument measures this change in optical signal caused by aggregation.The optical signal is measured as aspirin resistance units, or ARU (an arbitrarily assigned unit), and the normal response to aspirin results in ARU values of $< 5 5 0$ .

The manual AspirinWorks Test Kit measures urinary $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 } ,$ while the automated Accumetrics VerifyNow Aspirin Assay is a turbidimetric-based optical detection system which measures platelet-induced aggregation in whole blood. The two devices have similar intended uses in that they both measure aspirin effct.The AspirinWorks kit detects a metabolite of $\mathbf { T } \mathbf { X } \mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ , a direct inducer of platelet aggregation, while the Accumetrics kit measures ex vivo platelet aggregation caused by $\mathbf { T } \mathbf { X } \mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ by artificially inducing aggregation and measuring an optical signal Ultimately, both are analyzing aspirin's effect through the reduction of $\mathrm { T } \mathbf { \mathbf { \vec { x } } } \mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ production or the resulting inhibition of platelet aggregation.Despite the differences between kits (manual .automate, urine vs. whole blood, ELISA vs. platelet aggregation turbidometry), no new issues of saety or effectiveness are raised as shown by the performance characteristics and predicate comparison between the two devices. Thus, the Accumetrics VerifyNow Aspirin Assay is a good predicate device for which to compare the AspirinWorks Test Kit. In addition, the AspirinWorks Test Kit minimizes the influence of preanalytical variables that may affect the Accumetrics device.

# Summary of Non-Clinical and Clinical Studies:

Two different clinical studies were employed for the evaluation of the AspirinWorks Test Kit. Results from these studies established a cutoff for aspirin effect at $\leq 1 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g } \ 1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { m g }$ creatinine. Further analysis revealed that 180/204 $( 8 8 . 2 \% )$ of samples from individuals not taking aspirin were above the cutoff value. Analysis of samples from individuals taking various doses of aspirin revealed that 7/163 $( 4 . 3 \% )$ of 81 mg/day aspirin users indicated a lack of aspirin effect $\mathbf { ( > 1 5 0 0  p g ~ 1 1 d h T x B _ { 2 } / m g }$ creatinine) and 4/38 $( 1 0 . 5 \% )$ of the 325 mg/day aspirin users indicated a lack of aspirin effect. In total, 11/201 $( 5 . 5 \% )$ of all aspirin users tested indicated a lack o aspirin effect.These percentages are consistent with those in published literatue for aspirin non-responsiveness or lack of aspirin effect.

Non-clinical studies show a detection range for the AspirinWorks Test Kit of $3 0 0 - 4 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L } ,$ while intraand inter-assay precision $\% \mathbf { C V } ^ { \bullet } \mathbf { s }$ are all $\textless 2 0 \%$ . Recovery across the range of detection is within $10 \%$ of expected values, and no interference was caused by physiologically excessive concentrations of materials likely to be found inhuman urine.Finally, linearity testing at different sample dilutions confimed that matrix effects do not affect measured levels of $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$

The clinical and non-clinical studies demonstrate that the AspirinWorks Test Kit is a safe and effective metod  determining levels ofuriary 1dTxB2 s an aid in the assesment o aspiri effectinappaety healthy individuals.
