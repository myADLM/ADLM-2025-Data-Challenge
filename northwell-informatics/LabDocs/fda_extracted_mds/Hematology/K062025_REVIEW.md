# I. Device Description:

A competitive ELISA for the detection of urinary 11-Dehydro Thromboxane ${ \bf B } _ { 2 }$ $( 1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 } )$ ). Each AspirinWorks kit contains goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody coated onto 96-microwell plates, Sample Diluent, Reference Solution, three levels of control, purified $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, purified anti$1 1 \mathrm { T x B } _ { 2 }$ antibody, chromogenic substrate, stopping solution and wash concentrate. Purified mouse monoclonal antibody and purified $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ conjugated to alkaline phosphatase compete for binding with the $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ present in the sample. The intensity of color development following addition of chromogenic substrate (pNPP) is inversely proportional to the concentration of $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ in the urine sample read at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ . Results $\mathrm { ( p g / m l ) }$ are calculated against a reference curve. Final patient results are normalized by urine creatinine concentration, as measured by a separate assay.

# L. Test Principle:

The AspirinWorks® Test Kit measures urinary $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ and is performed as a competitive ELISA. Diluted samples (Reference Solution, controls and patient urine), purified $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (AP), and purified mouse monoclonal antibody directed to $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ are combined and incubated in microwells coated with a polyclonal anti-mouse antibody. Incubation allows the endogenous $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ present in the samples to compete with the purified APconjugated $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ for binding to the mouse monoclonal anti11dhTxB2 antibody. The monoclonal antibody then binds to the polyclonal anti-mouse antibody coated on the microtiter plate. The complex formed on the plate is composed of monoclonal antibody and endogenous or AP-conjugated $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ . After removal of unbound complexes by washing, the bound AP-11dhTxB2 conjugate is assayed by the addition of para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) chromogenic substrate. The intensity of color development in the wells is inversely proportional to the sample urine concentration of $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ , and is read at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ . Results $\mathrm { ( p g / m L ) }$ are calculated against a reference curve prepared from the Reference Solution provided in the kit. Final results are reported as pg $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ per mg creatinine to normalize results for urine concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The AspirinWorks Test Kit was evaluated for repeatability and within-laboratory precision. Three urine samples were run on 24 wells per plate over three plates per lot, repeated on three lots for a total of 216 measurements per urine sample. A test outcome is defined as the average of two measurements, so the study design results in 108 test measurements (12 per plate over three plates per lot run on three lots of plates) on which to base the precision calculations shown in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Urine #</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean11-DehydroThromboxaneB2 Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Repeatabilityas %CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within-LaboratoryPrecision as %CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>424 pg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1399 pg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3380 pg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10%</td></tr></table>

Repeatability and within-laboratory precision for the AspirinWorks Test Kit is acceptable for each of the three pilot lots according to the Product Specifications set by Corgenix (all $C V \%$ less than $20 \%$ ).

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was performed following the CLSI EP-6 guideline. A low and high value urine sample were diluted together and the samples were run in quadruplicate on the AspirinWorks Test Kit. Mean values of the range of dilutions for linearity assessment were $3 5 2 - 4 4 7 5 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ . The detection range for 11-Dehydro Thromboxane ${ \bf B } _ { 2 }$ assay is $3 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m l }$ urine.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability testing was performed in real time and tested throughout the shelf life of the kit. Lot specific components were used for testing. Data was provided for 11 months real time stability to date. Acceptable ranges for the lot of urine-based controls were $2 1 6 { - } 4 1 6 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ for Control 1, $5 9 8 { \cdot } 9 1 6 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ for Control 2, and $1 4 8 0 { - } 2 2 2 0 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ for Control 3. Values were determined to be within acceptable ranges.

Room temperature, $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and freeze-thaw stability testing was performed as follows: five urine samples collected from apparently healthy volunteers. Aliquots of the samples were then stored either at room temperature or $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the times specified, or frozen and thawed. The samples were run on the AspirinWorks Test Kit immediately (time zero) or after the times/freezethaws.

Real time stability testing on samples has also been performed. For these studies, 37 samples spanning the range of the assay were collected from apparently healthy volunteers. Aliquots were made and samples were frozen at $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . These samples were then measured for $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ levels (in $\mathsf { p g } / \mathrm { m l } ,$ ) quarterly over a period of one year. Results reveal that frozen samples remain viable for $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ measurement for up to one year at $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Stability analysis will be monitored for up to two years.

Value assignment of Reference Solution was performed using a panel of 12 urine samples (obtained from three bulk urine samples) with lot specific plates from the beginning, middle and end of each coating of each of three pilot lots. Two operators each ran four assays using beginning, middle and end plates of the coating run. The raw data was transferred into a controlled spreadsheet and the mean OD, standard deviation, and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated for each sample on each plate. A minimum of six of the eight assays must pass all specifications for $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ , $\% C V _ { i }$ , control values, assay blank and non-specific binding according to the kit Product Specifications. The Reference Solution correction factor was then calculated from this data.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined to be $1 5 1 \mathrm { \ p g / m l }$ and the Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined to be $2 2 2 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ based on the protocol in CLSI EP17-A.

To determine the LoB, two urine samples with minimal levels of $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ were used as blanks and run by 3 operators across 3 plate lots for a total of 72 measurements. The mean of the blank measurements was $9 1 . 4 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ with a pooled standard deviation of $3 6 . 1 \ \mathrm { p g / m l }$ . The Limit of Blank (LoB) was calculated based upon the blank mean plus the pooled standard deviation multiplied by the $\mathrm { c _ { \beta } }$ of 1.651 to obtain the ${ \mathfrak { G } } _ { \beta }$ and was determined to be 151.0 $\mathrm { p g / m l }$ .

To determine the LoD, four urine samples with low levels of $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ were run by 3 operators across 3 plate lots for a total of 144 measurements. The pooled mean of the low samples was $2 0 4 . 4 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ with a pooled standard deviation of $4 3 . 1 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ . The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated based upon the LoB plus the pooled standard deviation multiplied by the $\mathrm { c _ { \beta } }$ of 1.648 to obtain the ${ \mathfrak { G } } _ { \beta }$ and was determined to be $2 2 2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m l }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Two urines were measured without the presence of any interferent (labeled “Control”), as well as in the presence of two different concentrations of interferents (in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 1x and 0.5x). The difference in values (“diff”) is the amount of $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ (in $\mathrm { p g / m L }$ ) different from the control value. The percent recovery is in relation to the control value. The raw data was calculated from duplicate well from each interferent. The spiked samples used for interference testing include common agents that could be found in the urine of patients submitting specimens for the AspirinWorks test acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid, caffeine, gentisic acid, glucose, hemoglobin, protein (BSA), and salicylic acid. No significant interference $( \leq 2 5 \%$ difference from control) was caused by physiologically excessive concentrations of the substances for the levels tested.

Recovery experiments were performed using four different samples containing a high value of $1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ diluted into the range of the assay. The samples were then serially diluted 1:1.25 in sample diluent for a final panel of 11 – 12 serial dilutions spanning the range of the assay and run on the AspirinWorks Test Kit pilot lots. The expected concentrations of each dilution were calculated based on the value obtained for the top dilution of each sample. Observed values were compared to expected values, and a ratio of observed/expected values was calculated.

f. Assay cut-off:

11-Dehydro Thromboxane ${ \bf B } _ { 2 }$ concentrations were measured and normalized in 405 patients (210 samples from individuals on aspirin and 204 samples from individuals not on aspirin. Analysis of the frequency distribution of the samples resulted in a cutoff of $1 5 0 0 \ p \mathrm { g } \ 1 1 \mathrm { d h T x B } _ { 2 }$ per mg urinary creatinine.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Results for the AspirinWorks Test Kit compared the predicate device at one study site for detection of aspirin effect in apparently healthy subjects. In total, 173 urine samples were analyzed both on and off aspirin, and all were used to compare the AspirinWorks Test Kit to the predicate device. In the study, 44/49 $( 8 9 . 8 \% )$ of the AspirinWorks Baseline $8 1 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ samples were above cutoff compared to 47/49 $( 9 5 . 9 \% )$ with the predicate. For the Baseline $3 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ samples, 34/38 $( 8 9 . 5 \% )$ were above cutoff for the AspirinWorks kit, while 38/38 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ were above cutoff for the predicate. Of those that had ingested $8 1 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ aspirin per day, 3/47 $( 6 . 4 \% )$ of the AspirinWorks samples were above $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ creatinine, while 1/48 $( 2 . 1 \% )$ of the samples measured by the predicate were above the assay cutoff. In patients taking 325 mg ASA per day, 4/37 $( 1 0 . 8 \% )$ of the samples were above cutoff for the AspirinWorks kit, while 3/38 $( 7 . 9 \% )$ were above cutoff for the predicate.
