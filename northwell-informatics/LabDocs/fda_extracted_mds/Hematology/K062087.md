# Device Name / Classification

Name: BD FACSCanto II system Classification: Class II (21 CFR 864.5220)  Automated differential cell counter

# Substantially Equivalent / Predicate Device

The BD FACSCanto II system is substantially equivalent to the BD FACSCanto system with BD FACSCanto clinical software and BD FACSDiva software (premarket notifications K041074 and K040725).

# Device Description

The BD FACSCanto II system is comprised of a flow cytometer, a fluidics cart, and a computer workstation. The fluidics cart contains operational fluids, the flow cytometer acquires and analyzes the sample, and the computer displays and prints the analysis. The flow cytometer utilizes three subsystems: fluidics, optics, and electronics. The computer workstation runs two software packages: BD FACSCanto clinical software for automatic immunophenotyping of assays prepared using the lyse/no-wash method, and BD FACSDiva software for manual immunophenotyping of assays prepared using the lyse/wash method.

The BD FACSCanto II system can optionally be used with the BD FACS Loader for automatic sample introduction, a standalone barcode reader for data input into BD FACSCanto clinical software, and with the BD FACS Sample Prep Assistant II for automatic sample preparation of assays utilizing the lyse/no-wash method.

The BD FACSCanto II system is a modification of the BD FACSCanto system, bearing the same intended use, indications for use, and operating principle as its predicate device. Modifications have been made to the fluidics, optics, and electronics subsystems. Changes were also made to the samplc introduction system, the BD FACS Loader option, and to the two software applications. Thesc changes have been made to enhance the system's usability.

# Intended Use

The BD FACSCanto II system is intended for use as an in vitro diagnostic device for the identification and enumeration of lymphocyte subsets in human cells in suspension.

# Technological Characteristics

Dear Mr. Navarro:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150, or at its Internet address
