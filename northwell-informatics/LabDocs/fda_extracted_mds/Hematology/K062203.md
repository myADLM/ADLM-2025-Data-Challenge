# Device Name

Proprietary name: Tina-Quant D-Dimer Test System on Roche Hitachi and COBAS Integra Analyzers

Common name: D-Dimer Test System

Classification name: Fibrinogen/Fibrin Degradation Products Assay

# Description

The Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer test system is an immunoturbidimetric assay for the in vitro quantitative determination of fibrin degradation products including D-Dimer and X-oligomers. Latex particles of uniform size are coated with monoclonal antibodies (F(ab')2 fragments) to the D-Dimer epitope. The antigen/antibody complexes produced by the addition of samples containing D-dimer lead to an increase in the turbidity of the test reactants, which can be determined turbidimetrically. The calibrator is DDimer calibrator and the recommended control material is D-dimer Control I/II.

# Intended use

for the in vitro quantitative determination of fibrin degradation products including D-Dimer and X-oligomers. In conjunction with a non-high clinical probability assessment, a normal $( < 0 . 5 \ \mu \mathrm { g } \ \mathrm { F E U / m l } )$ result excludes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) with high sensitivity.

# 510(k) Summary, Continued

# Substantial equivalence

The Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer Test System on the Roche Hitachi and COBAS Integra Analyzer is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution. We claim equivalence to the currently marketed Tina-quant $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ DDimer Test System cleared under K030740. For purposes of the intended use extension, we also claim equivalence to the Biomerieux Vidas $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer Exclusion Assay, cleared under K040822.

The purpose of this submission is to extend the intended use of the TinaQuant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer Test System on the Roche Hitachi and COBAS Integra analyzers to include exclusion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) exclusion. We also provide notification of a minor change to the reagent formulation (a pH change of the R2 buffer matrix) which has occurred since the device clearance. This change did not result in any labeled performance changes.

The change in reagent composition was validated according to design control procedure.

Published clinical guidelines and several clinical studies exist which demonstrate and support the clinical utility of the Tina-Quant D-Dimer test in the evaluation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with suspected DVT or PE. A guidelines summary and systematic review of published clinical studies were presented as clinical support for this claim extension. Specific support for the exclusion claim came from two management studies, as follows.

# Clinical performance in the exclusion of DVT:

Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer was used in a multicenter management study involving 812 outpatients with suspected DVT . Using the Wells probability assessment score , patients were classified as having a high $( \geq 3 )$ or non-high $( < 3 )$ pretest probability of DVT. The Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer test was then performed using a cutoff of $0 . 5 \mathrm { u g } \mathrm { F E U / m L }$ Those patients having a normal (negative) D-Dimer test result and a non-high pretest probability had no further diagnostic testing and were followed up for 3 months for development of DVT. Only one of 176 such patients developed DVT during the follow-up period. The sensitivity, negative predictive value, and failure rate of the Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer assay in conjunction with a non-high pretest probability is summarized below:

Sensitivity: $9 9 . 3 \%$ Negative Predictive Value: $9 9 . 4 \%$ Failure Rate: $0 . 6 \%$ .

# Clinical performance in the exclusion of PE:

Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer was used in a management study involving 168 outpatients with suspected PE . Using the Wells clinical model for PE probability, patients were classified as having a low, moderate, or high pretest probability of PE. The Tina-Quan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer test was then performed using a cutoff of $0 . 5 \mathrm { u g } \mathrm { F E U / m L }$ . Those patients having a normal (negative) DDimer test result and a non-high (low or moderate) pretest probability had no further diagnostic testing and were followed up for 3 months for development of PE. No patients developed PE during the follow-up period. The sensitivity, negative predictive value, and failure rate of the Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ DDimer assay in conjunction with a non-high pretest probability is summarized below:

Sensitivity: E $100 \%$ Negative Predictive Value: EPY $100 \%$ EPY Failure Rate: EPY $0 \%$ .

Dear Ms. Bush:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The al controls provisions theAcinclude reqirements r ual registration,sg o devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class ⅢI (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
