21 CFR 864.7320

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product code: GHH

4. Panel: 81 Hematology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Roche diagnostics Tina-Quant D-dimer assay is an immunoturbidimetric assay for the in vitro quantitative determination of fibrin degradation products including ddimer and x-oligomers in human plasma. In conjunction with a non-high clinical probability assessment, a normal $( < 0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ FEU/mL) result excludes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) with high sensitivity.

2. Indication(s) for use:

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

4. Special instrument requirements: Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers

# I. Device Description:

The Roche Tina-quant D-dimer is an immunoturbidimetric assay consisting of a ready to use tris buffer and a ready to use anti-d-dimer latex suspension.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The Tina-quant D-Dimer Test System is based on a particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric method. Latex particles of uniform size are coated with monoclonal antibodies $( \mathrm { F } ( \mathrm { a b } ^ { \prime } ) 2$ fragments) to the D-dimer epitope. The antigen/antibody complexes produced by the addition of samples containing D-dimer lead to an increase in the turbidity of the test reactants, which can be determined

turbidmetrically.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

DVT Exclusion

Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-dimer was used in a multicenter management study involving 812 outpatients with suspected DVT. Patient pre-test probability (PTP) was assessed following Wells probability score. Patients were classified as high $( \geq 3 )$ or non-high $( < 3 )$ , and the Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-dimer test was then performed using a cutoff of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { F E U / m L }$ . Those patients with a normal (negative) ddimer, and a non-high pretest probability had no further diagnostic testing and were followed for 3 months for development of DVT. 1 of 176 such patients developed DVT during the follow-up period. Sensitivity, NPV and Failure rates were determined as follows:

Sensitivity: $9 9 . 3 \%$ NPV $9 9 . 4 \%$ Failure Rate: 0.6%

PE Exclusion

Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer was used in a management study involving 168 outpatients with suspected PE. Patient pre-test probability (PTP) was assessed following Wells probability score for PE. Patients were classified as having a low, moderate, or high pretest probability of PE, and the Tina-Quan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Ddimer test was then performed using a cutoff of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { F E U / m L }$ . Those patients with a normal (negative) d-dimer, and a non-high (low or moderate) pretest probability had no further diagnostic testing and were followed for 3 months for development of PE. No patients developed PE during the followup period. Sensitivity, NPV and Failure rates were determined as follows:

Sensitivity: $100 \%$ NPV $100 \%$ Failure Rate: 0% b. Clinical specificity:
