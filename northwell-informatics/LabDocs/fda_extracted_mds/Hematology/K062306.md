# Trade Name:

R2 Diagnostics PlasmaCon N, PlasmaCon L-1, PlasmaCon L-2

Common Name:

Controls, Plasma, Normal and Abnormal for Coagulation

Classification Name:

Control, Plasma, Normal and Abnormal (per 21 CFR section 864.5425)

Comparison Device:

Normal Coagulation Control Plasma K895262   
Abnormal Coagulation Control Plasma Level-1 K895260   
Abnormal Coagulation Control Plasma Level-2 K895261

# Description of the Device

The PlasmaCon Control Plasma devices contain lyophilized citrated human plasma, for use in the verification of system performance for PT and aPTT assays. The PlasmaCon Control plasmas should only be used in an appropriate clinical laboratory by qualified laboratory professionals. The tests may be performed manually, or using semi-automated and automated coagulation analyzers.

# Statement of the Intended Use

PlasmaCon N is a human lyophilized plasma control intended for use as a normal control with citrated plasma to monitor the performance of the Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) tests.

PlasmaCon L-1 is a human lyophilized plasma control intended for use as a mid-level abnormal control with citrated plasma to monitor the performance of the Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) tests.

PlasmaCon L-2 is a human lyophilized plasma control intended for usc as a high level abnormal control with citrated plasma to monitor the performance of the Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) tests.

Summary of Substantial Equivaience Comparisons   
R2 Diagnostics' PlasmaCon Control Plasmas are substantially equivalent in intended use and performance to Normal and Abnormal Control Plasma devices currently marketed by Trinity Biotech. Both the predicate device and the proposcd product for in vitro   
diagnostic use in routine patient screening tests. Both are formulated from citrated human plasma.

Precision studies were performed to establish Within Run and Between Run CVs according to the following procedure developed under NCCLS EP-15A: User Demonstration of Performance for Precision and Accuracy; Approved Guidelines. For within run, 10 vials of each sample were pooled, tested, and recorded in duplicate or triplicate. For between run, 2 vials of each sample were pooled, tested in duplicate, and recorded each day for 5 days.

In comparison studies normal and abnormal control plasma controls were tested using PT and aP'T reagents from multiple manufacturers on multiple instrument types to include:

Diagnostics Phospholin ES on the ACL3000+, MLA1000c and ACL Advance. Diagnostics Phosphoplastin RL on the ACL3000+, MLA1000c and ACL Advance.   
• Dade-Behring Thromborel S on the Dade BCS.   
. Dade-Bchring Pathromtin SL on the Dade BCS.   
$\cdot \bullet$ Stago Neoplastine $\mathbf { C I } \mathbf { + }$ on the Stago STA. Stago Auto PTT on the Stago STA.

Within-run and between-run precision studies were performed and CV's of less than $1 5 \%$ were obtained for the proposed device. CV's of less than $1 5 \%$ are reported for the predicate device in this study.

Conclusion: Substantial Equivalence Statement In Summary, the similar intended use, technological characteristics and the performance data provided in this premarkel notification deinonstrate that R2 PlasmaCon N, PlasmaCon L-1, and PlasmaCon L-2 are substantially equivalent to (Trinity Biotech) Medical Diagnostic Technologies, Normal Coagulation Control Plasma, Abnormal Coagulation Control Plasma 1, and Abnormal Coagulation Control Plasma 2.

Dear Ms. Young:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can b fund inhe odef FederalRegulations, T, arts 80 to 98In dition, FAy publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97).
