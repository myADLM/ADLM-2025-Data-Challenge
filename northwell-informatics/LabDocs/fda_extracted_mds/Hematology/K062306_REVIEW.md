4. Special instrument requirements:

# I. Device Description:

The PlasmaCon Control Plasma devices contain lyophilized citrated human plasma for use in the verification of system performance for PT and aPTT assays. The PlasmaCon Control plasmas are packages in 10 vials each containing $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of reagent. Controls plasmas should only be used in an appropriate clinical laboratory by qualified laboratory professionals. The tests may be performed manually or using semi-automated and automated coagulation analyzers.

PlasmaCon N is prepared from a pool of fresh citrated plasma from donors with normal coagulation parameters. The pooled plasma is buffered with Hepes and lyophilized to maximize stability of all plasma constituents.

PlasmaCon L-1 and PlasmaCon L-2 are prepared from a pool of fresh citrated plasma from donors with normal coagulation parameters. The pooled plasma is depleted of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. The control plasma is buffered with Hepes and lyophilized to maximize stability of all plasma constituents.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Points to Consider Guidance Document on Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material, February 3, 1999.

# L. Test Principle:

PlasmaCon Control reagents can be used in all testing in the same manner as may citrated plasma sample. Tests may be performed manually or using semi-automated and automated coagulation analyzers.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Data was collected for within run and between run precision using three levels of lyophilized controls according to procedures developed under CLSI EP15- A approved guidelines. Within run and between run precision studies obtained CV values of less than $1 5 \%$ .

For within run, 10 vials of each sample were pooled, tested in duplicate and recorded in duplicate or triplicate.

For between run, 2 vials of each sample were pooled, tested in duplicate and recorded each day for 5 days.

In comparison studies, normal and abnormal control plasma controls were tested using PT and aPTT reagents from multiple manufacturers on multiple instrument types to include:

• $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 }$ Diagnostics Phospholin ES on the ACL3 $0 0 0 +$ , MLA1000c and ACL Advance   
• $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 }$ Diagnostics Phosphoplastin RL on the ACL3 $0 0 0 +$ , MLA1000c and ACL Advance   
• Dade Behring Thromborel S on the Dade BCS   
• Dade Behring Pathromtin SL on the Dade BCS Diagnostica Stago Neoplastine $\mathrm { C I ^ { + } }$ on the Stago STA Diagnostica Stago Auto PTT on the Stago STA

The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ ranges for all instrument and reagent combinations are:

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

The value assignment protocol was determined by testing the PlasmaCon N reagent, the $\mathbf { A C L 3 0 0 0 + }$ , and the Phosphoplastin RL (PT) reagent and Phospholin ES (APTT) reagent in the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assays. Ranges were determined based on a $9 7 . 5 \%$ confidence interval; thus 3SD ranges around the mean were calculated. The manufacturer recommends that each laboratory establish the mean values and expected control ranges for their particular laboratory’s instrument-reagent system.

Open vial and closed vial real time stability tests were performed. Results are determined by pass/fail criteria.

Open vial stability studies were conducted PlasmaCon N, PlasmaCon L-1 and PlasmaCon L-2. Seven vials of test control plasma was stored at room temperature was run at the following intervals: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 hours (or until three consecutive failed tests) in a PT and APTT assay.

Closed vial stability studies were conducted PlasmaCon N, PlasmaCon L-1 and PlasmaCon L-2. One vial of test control plasma was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was run monthly for 3 months, once on months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 (or until three consecutive failed tests) in a PT and APTT assay. Data was provided through month 7.
