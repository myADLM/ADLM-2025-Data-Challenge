Summary Prepared: August 17, 2006

Name of the Device: HemosIL Liquid Antithrombin

# Regulatory Information:

864.7060 Antithrombin III Assay Class II   
81JBQ Antithrombin III Quantitation

# Identification of Predicate Device(s):

K033775 HemosIL Liquid Antithrombin

# Device Description:

HemosIL Liquid Antithrombin is an automated chromogenic assay for the quantitative determination of Antithrombin in human citrated plasma as an aid in the diagnosis of hereditary and acquired Antithrombin deficiency and to monitor Antithrombin substitution therapy. This in vitro diagnostic test is based on a synthetic chromogenic substrate and on Factor Xa inactivation. As a consequence, it is specific and not influenced by Heparin Cofactor I. Antithrombin levels in patient plasma are measured automatically on IL Coagulation Systems.

# Reason for Submission:

The Expected Values section of the HemosIL Liquid Antithrombin inserts (same formulation, different kit configuration size) are being modified to reference a normal range from published literature, reinforcing the need for each laboratory to establish its own normal [reference] range due to the many variables which may affect results.

# itatement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

HemosIL Liquid Antithrombin with the modified Expected Values section in the product inserts is not materially different from the FDA cleared device.

# Summary of Expected Values Section to the Modified Product Insert:

Antithrombin activity levels in healthy individuals are approximately in the range of 83  128%. Antithrombin levels are low in neonates/infants and increase to adult levels by approximately 1 year of age; levels are then slightly higher than in adults up to age 16 year.\*

Due to many variables which may affect results, each laboratory should establish its own normal range.

Dear Ms. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing o devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
