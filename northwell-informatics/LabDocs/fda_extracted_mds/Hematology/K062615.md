Re: k062615 Trade/Device Name: Vision BioSystems Progesterone Receptor Clone 16 Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.1860 Regulation Name: Immunohistochemistry Reagents and Kits Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: MXZ Dated: August 25, 2006 Received: September 5, 2006

Dear Mr. Lagerquist:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantialy equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97).

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number K062615

Device Name:

Vision BioSystems Progesterone Receptor Clone 16 (PGR Clone16) • Novocastra ™ Lyophilized Mouse Monoclonal Antibody • Novocastra ™ Liquid Mouse Monoclonal Antibody • Novocastra ™ Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Origin T Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Bond ™ Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody

Indications for Use:

Vision BioSystems Progesterone Receptor Clone 16 (PGR Clone 16) Mouse Monoclonal antibody is intended for laboratory use to qualitatively identify by light microscopy, progesterone receptor (PGR) antigen in sections of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue. PGR Clone 16 specifically binds to the PGR antigen located in the nucleus of PGR positive normal and neoplastic cells.

PGR Clone 16 is indicated as an aid in the management, prognosis and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. The clinical interpretation of any staining or its absence should be complemented by morphological studies using proper controls and should be evaluated within the context of the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic tests by a qualified pathologist.

Novocastra™ antibodies are intended for manual use. Origin ™ antibodies are optimized for use with the Ventana® Medical Systems, $N e \times E S ^ { \textregistered }$ and BenchMark ™m Immunohistochemistry Staining Systems in combination with Ventana® Detection Kits. Bond ™ Ready-to-Use Primary Antibodies are optimized for use on the Vision BioSystems Bond-max ™ system.
