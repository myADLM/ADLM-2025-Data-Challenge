“Guidance for Submission of Immunohistochemistry Applications to the FDA”

# L. Test Principle:

Vision BioSystems Progesterone Receptor (Clone 16), specifically binds to progesterone receptor antigen located in the nuclear region of a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues. Immunohistochemical staining is performed on routinely processed, paraffin-embedded specimens allowing the qualitative identification by light microscopy of the antigens. Prior to staining, endogenous peroxidase activity is blocked and sections are subjected to epitope retrieval. The section is subsequently incubated with the primary antibody. For the Novacastra ™ and Origin™ products, a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody formulation that recognizes mouse immunoglobulins is used to detect the primary antibody. A streptavidin- or ABCperoxidase conjugate is then applied and binds to the biotin present on the secondary antibody. For the Bond™ product, a polymer refine detection system is used. This system utilizes a controlled polymerization technology to prepare polymeric HRPlinker antibody conjugates. Sections are then incubated with the substrate/chromogen, $^ { 3 , 3 ^ { \prime } - }$ diaminobenzidine (DAB). Reaction with the peroxidase produces a visible brown precipitate at the antigen site. Sections are counter stained with hematoxylin and cover slipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope

e. Analytical specificity:

Novacastra™ Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies and Origin™ Ready-To-Use Primary Antibody: Specificity was evaluated on a range of normal tissues. Characteristic staining was observed in the nuclei of cells that express high levels of the protein: a proportion of endometrial, ovarian, and myometrial cells, and normal breast ductal cells. Negative tissues included adrenal, bone marrow, brain (cerebellum), brain (cerebrum), colon, esophagus, heart, kidney, liver, lung, mesothelial cells, parathyroid, peripheral nerve, salivary/submandibular gland, skeletal muscle, skin, small intestine, spleen, spinal cord, stomach, testis, thymus, and thyroid. Weak staining was observed in ovary stromal cells and occasional islet cells of the pancreas.

Bond™ Ready-To-Use Primary Antibody: An evaluation on a panel of normal tissues was conducted using the Bond™ Ready-To-Use Clone 16 primary antibody in conjunction with Bond™ Refine Detection System on the Vision BioSystems Bond-max™ slide staining system. A total of 85 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues covering a wide range of normal human tissue types were tested with the ER antibody. The antibody demonstrated negative immunoreactivity with most tissues. Positive immunoreactivity was noted with some normal tissues which are typically positive, like uterus, ovary and ductal epithelial cells of the breast. Positive staining was also observed in ovary stromal cells, islet cells of the pancreas, the muscle layer of the small intestines and the capsular region of the testis.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Slides are scored using the Quick Score System. The tumor is scored according to the proportion on cell nuclei stained (1-5) and the intensity of the staining (0-3). A score of 3 or over is classified as receptor positive.
