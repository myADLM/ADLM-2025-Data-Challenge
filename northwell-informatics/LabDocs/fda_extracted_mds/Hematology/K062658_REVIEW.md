# L. Test Principle:

The Primus A1care assay used the boronate affinity in a patented two-phase optical assay. The sample is mixed in an optical cuvette with a suspension of the solid phase particles in a fluorescent buffer. The buffer also contains a lysing agent to break up the red blood cells. After the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) adheres to the solid phase, gel particles with A1C attach separately by sedimentation. The HbA1C –gel sedimentation process is monitored by an optical system examining fluorescence intensities generated between the suspension and the settled solid phase, the proportion of which is factory calibrated to give results comparable to known standards. Optical measurement of hemoglobin is by fluorescence quenching. The wavelength of light absorbance by hemoglobin overlaps the wavelength of excitation of the fluorescent dye. In the presence of hemoglobin there is less light available to excite fluorescence (the quenching effect), and this effect is linear with hemoglobin concentration. The patented two phase assay optically examines the position where the solid phase particles settle. The measurement is made before settling for total hemoglobin, and after complete settling for Hemoglobin A1c only. Optical measurements are automatically completed, calculations automatically performed, and the patient’s HbA1c test value is displayed.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A recovery study was performed according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline using two EDTA whole blood samples. The first sample has an A1c value of $1 7 \%$ by HPLC method and was diluted with various amount of a low liquid control $5 . 4 \%$ A1c) to yield a series stretching from $1 7 \%$ down to $6 \%$ . The second sample has an A1c value of $5 . 2 \%$ by HPLC method and was diluted with various amount of a non-A1c (A0) blood sample to yield a series down to $2 . 6 \%$ . All samples were tested on the TRI♦stat™ instrument in triplicates. The mean percent recovery ranges from $9 3 . 4 \%$ to $1 1 0 . 6 \%$ . A straight line is observed in the regression plot from $2 . 6 \%$ to $1 7 \%$ . The correlation coefficient equation is $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 6 1 \mathrm { X } - 0 . 0 5$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 8$ .

Based on the linearity study and the method comparison study, the sponsor claimed that the linearity/reportable range are $2 . 6 { - } 1 7 \%$ A1c with hemoglobin in the normal range of $1 1 - 1 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Primus A1Care assay is traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) Method for Measurement of HbA1c. HbA1c values are reported according to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) recommendations at the DCCT level.

The sponsor has documented traceability to the NGSP’s recommended accuracy base for Hbg A1c by performing a direct comparison with a Secondary Reference Laboratory (SRL) using 40 fresh human specimens. NGSP certifications expire after one year. Current certifications are posted on the NGSP website at: http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html

A whole blood sample (EDTA) stability study was performed to show that EDTA sample is stable up to 14 days when stored in the refrigerator.

d. Detection limit:

See linearity study above.

e. Analytical specificity:

i.) Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere with the A1Care assay. The interfering substances were evaluated in whole blood EDTA samples that had different Hgb A1C concentrations (from a normal patient and a diabetic patient). The sponsor’s acceptable criterion is that the analyte recovery should not vary from the base recovery $6 \mathrm { y } \pm 1 0 \%$ . No significant interference was defined as the $\%$ recovery of $\leq 1 0 \%$ .

The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference by the following interferents:

• Bilirubin up to $1 5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Protein up to $6 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ • Triglycerides up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Acetate up to $3 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$

ii.) To study the interference from labile A1c on the A1Care assay, two EDTA whole blood patients’ samples representing normal and diabetic A1c levels were split into aliquots. These aliquots were supplemented by the addition of an aqueous glucose stock solution; up to $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of glucose solution was tested. The samples were incubated for three hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to facilitate formation of labile A1c. The samples were then run on the TRI♦stat™ instrument. The acceptance criterion is $\leq 1 0 \%$ recovery between the tested and the control conditions.

The sponsor concluded that labile A1c concentrations up to $5 . 2 \%$ in non-diabetic patients and up to $1 0 . 9 \%$ in diabetic patients do not interfere with the assay.

The sponsor claimed that Hemoglobin variants such as Hgb S, C, Chicago, and E do not affect their device because it has been shown that affinity method do not have interference on these Hgb variants according to the literature.\* Reference: “National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program. In Factors that interfere with GHB (HbA1c) Test Results.” http://www.ngsp.org/prog/factors.htm

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison studies were performed internally by the manufacturer and externally at three Point-of-care sites. Precision studies were performed according to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.

Internal study performed at Primus

A method comparison study was performed in-house using 117 venous EDTA samples on the TRI♦sta $t ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ instrument against the HPLC reference method (predicate method). Sample range tested was $4 . 8 \%$ - $1 5 \%$ with Hgb value of $\mathrm { 1 1 - 1 6 \ m g / d L }$ . The linear regression correlation was calculated as follows:

$\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 1 5 5 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 3 8 , \mathrm { r } { = } 0 . \mathrm { \Omega }$ $\mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 7 4$ . ( $\mathrm { X = }$ HPLC method, $\mathrm { Y = }$ TRI♦stat™ method)

In addition, 35 capillary samples were collected and run on the TRI♦sta $t ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ instrument and results were compared to the venous samples on the HPLC reference method.

Sample range tested was $4 . 8 \% \cdot$ - $12 . 5 \%$ with Hgb value of $\mathrm { 1 1 - 1 6 \ m g / d L }$ . The linear regression correlation was calculated as follows:

Y= 1.0686X - 0.6093, $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 5 2 7$ . ( $\mathrm { X } ^ { = } .$ HPLC method, $\mathrm { Y = }$ TRI♦stat™ method)

# External study

Nine untrained point-of care operators from three different sites performed a method comparison against the HPLC method. A total of 85 patients were used in collecting the finger-stick samples. Each patient tested provided two finger-stick samples (one sample for the POC operator to run on the candidate device and one sample for the HPLC method, which is the predicate device). In addition, the venous whole blood samples from the same individuals were tested on the TRI♦stat™ instrument vs. the HPLC method. The linear regressions results were summarized as follow:

For finger-sticks samples:

TRI♦sta $t ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ instrument (candidate device) vs. HPLC method (predicate device):

$\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 5 8 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 9 4 6$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 2 8$ , ${ \Nu } { = } 8 5$ , sample range was $4 . 9 \mathrm { - } 1 5 . 1 \%$

For venous whole blood samples:

TRI♦sta $t ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ instrument (candidate device) vs. HPLC method (predicate device):

$\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 7 5 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 8 1 7 .$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 4 7$ , ${ \Nu } { = } 8 5$ , sample range was $5 . 1 \mathrm { - } 1 5 . 5 \%$

Finger-stick samples vs. venous whole blood samples on the TRI♦stat™ instrument:

$\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 5 8 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 3 6 6$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 6 1$ , ${ \Nu } { = } 8 5$ , sample range was $4 . 9 \mathrm { - } 1 5 . 5 \%$

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

See method comparison studies above. The sponsor claimed that whole blood samples from finger-stick or EDTA venous samples are the recommended samples.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): See 2.a. above

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected $\%$ HbA1c value for patients with diabetes will depend on physician discretion. The American Diabetes Association’s (ADA) most recent Clinical Practice Recommendation of diabetes specifies a treatment goal of $7 \%$ or less and suggests additional action when the HbA1c level is above $8 \%$ .

The table below provides ADA guidelines5 and NGSP standardized A1c test determinations to DCCT values6 . A test result in the “Action Suggested” category should be promptly reviewed with a physician and as directed.

# N. Instrument Name:

Primus TRI♦stat™ instrument

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

This is a small analyzer with the capability of running three samples at the same time. The reagent tube contains all the reagents necessary for the determination of the analyte to be measured. The sample material is collected using the blood collection device, which is a capillary manufactured to draw the exact sample volume $( 4 \mu \mathrm { l } )$ from either a fingerstick or a venous sample. The blood collection device is placed directly back into the reagent tube before the reagent tube is insert into the Primus TRI♦sta $t ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ instrument. The analyzing process is fully automated after inserting the reagent tube into the analyzer; the process starts by inserting the reagent tube in a barcode scanning station. Up to three reagent tubes can be run at a time.

All assay and lot specific information necessary for the analyzer to process a test is read from the barcode fixed to the reagent tube. All reagent tubes are single use and shall be disposed after use.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ____X____ or No _

The sponsor referenced FDA’s Guidance Document for software:

http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/comp/guidance/1553.html

Level of Concern: Moderate

3. Specimen Identification:

Samples are identified by manually labeling the reagent tube and by logging the patient ID into the analyzer prior to inserting the reagent tube into the analyzer, or during the analyzing process. The patient ID cannot be read by the analyzer.

# 4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The sample is collected using the blood collection device, which is a capillary manufactured to draw the exact sample volume from a finger-stick or a sample tube. The blood collection device is placed back into the reagent tube before it is inserted into the analyzer. All further processing of the sample is performed inside the reagent tube.

# 5. Calibration:

The TRI♦stat™ instrument is factory calibrated and is not field or user adjustable. However, each lot of reagent tubes comes supplied with a Key Card (barcode) for automatic transfer of lot specific information into the instrument for use.

6. Quality Control:

The TRI♦stat™ instrument has an internal quality control system that performs operational self-checks at power on and during the processing of each sample. Corresponding error messages are displayed. Primus recommends that controls be periodically tested and resulting values verified and follow federal, stat, and local requirements for quality control testing. External quality control materials must be purchased separately from Primus. The manufacturer recommends that two levels of external controls (a low and a high) be ran daily to verify the performance of the device. It also recommends that controls are run:

• Before the first use of a new instrument.   
• For the first use of each new lot of reagents.   
• For any doubt about the validity of a test result. Before use following long periods of instrument or reagent storage.

# P. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# Q. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
