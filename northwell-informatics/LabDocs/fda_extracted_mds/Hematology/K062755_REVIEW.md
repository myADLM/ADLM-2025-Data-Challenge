C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Ikonisys, Inc. Ikoniscope $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ oncoFISH™ Bladder Test System   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

#

The Ikoniscope oncoFISH Bladder Test System detects cells of interest from urine samples, stained by FISH using commercially available direct labeled DNA probes or chromosomes 3, 7, 17, and loss of 9p21 locus.

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Ikoniscope onco FISH Bladder Test System is an automated scanning microscope system incorporating automated slide loading and handling, low and high magnification scanning to identify targets of interest and digital image acquisition, coupled with an image analysis workstation. Microscope slides, prepared according to the DNA probe manufacturers’ specifications, are placed into a multiple slide cassette, and loaded into the Ikoniscope oncoFISH Bladder Test system. The system unloads each slide, scans each one, and returns it to the cassette automatically. During scanning, images of cells exhibiting the predetermined characteristics for FISH signals are digitally photographed and stored. After all the slides are scanned, the workstation provides an image gallery for each slide that displays the image of each cell meeting predetermined characteristics and quantity and places scanned nuclei into scorable categories, established according to the specifications in the DNA probes FDA cleared labeling. The operator/reader can then evaluate the cell nuclei, and make the diagnostic determination accordingly.

2. Principles of Operation:

The Ikoniscope oncoFISH Bladder Test System combines elements of existing technologies to perform its function. Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) uses commercially available, FDA cleared, DNA probes (not supplied with the test system) for labeling chromosomes 3,7,17, and the loss of $9 \mathsf { p } 2 1$ locus (UroVysion $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multicolor DNA Probe Kit, Vysis, Downer’s Grove, IL). Automated cell locating/counting using pattern recognition algorithms to identify the signal characteristics of interest. The software incorporated in the system automatically captures an image of each cell containing FISH signals and stores its location on the slide. These images are then presented to the operator, using a computer workstation, for analysis. Images are displayed in scorable categories according to the specifications of the probe developer.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

The Ikoniscope $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ oncoFISH™ Bladder Test System was evaluated in a clinical trial to determine the accuracy of the system compared with FISH analysis of the same samples using standard manual evaluation. In this trial, results of FISH analysis of 100 patient samples evaluated using the Ikoniscope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ oncoFISH™ Bladder Test System were compared with the results of the evaluation of the same samples using standard manual analysis to perform the FISH analysis. In this trial there was a $9 9 \%$ concordance between the two methods in terms of diagnostic result.

Results: One hundred consecutive samples were analyzed as the study samples. 96 samples were identical as compared to the manual method. Of the four samples that did not concur, three were read as inconclusive and the manual method identified it as negative. This would indicate a requirement for a manual review of the sample. The oncoFISH Bladder Test system demonstrated a $9 9 \%$ concordance rate.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

A trial, designated the reproducibility trial, tested between system agreement. A total of 50 individual patient slides processed as part of the accuracy study were evaluated on each of two test systems, with the order of the evaluation determined randomly.

Results: Of the 50 samples analyzed 49 of the samples were concordant. The one slide that was not concordant was a negative and an inconclusive. The most probable reason for this is sample degradation. There was $9 8 \%$ concordance of diagnostic outcome between the two evaluations for all of the slides

c. Linearity:

d. Carryover: N/A   
e. Interfering Substances: N/A

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

a. Comparison of manual dot count with automated dot count.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that oncoFISH dot counting is equivalent to the fastFISH auto/amniocyte dot counting. Two independent-expert cytotechnologists evaluated images of nuclei obtained using the oncoFISH system and compared those results to the results of automated scanning of the same images. The sample consisted of scan data for five slides of which a minimum of 1200 nuclei were to be selected and reviewed.

Results: The study provides evidence that automated scanning, signal recognition and enumeration software produces FISH signal counts that are in agreement with those determined by experienced cytotechnologists that have examined the same images. The overall agreement of the human evaluators and the automated evaluations was $7 9 \%$ and higher for each chromosome signal analyzed.
