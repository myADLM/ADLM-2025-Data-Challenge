# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods: Approved Guideline – Second Edition, NCCLS

# L. Test Principle:

Control samples are to be used in place of patient samples. Approximately $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of the control material is added to the sample port on the Triage Protein C Test

Cartridge. The Control sample reacts with the Protein C antibody conjugate within the reaction chamber of the Test Cartridge. The Test Cartridge is inserted into the Triage Meter. The Meter automatically performs the Protein C analysis after the sample has reacted with reagents contained within the Protein C Test Cartridge. Total test time approximately 15 minutes. The result is displayed on the Meter screen and can be printed. Internal assay controls (positive and negative controls) and automatic endpoint detection technology is used to indicate assay completion.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A study was performed using 240 control samples. The samples, consisting of the Low Level $( 1 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l } )$ , Medium Level $( 2 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } \ : / \mathrm { m l } )$ and the High Level $( 4 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l } )$ were tested in duplicates, twice a day, for 20 days at each of three testing sites. Testing was conducted by one operator at each site using the same single lot of Triage Protein C test reagent and one Triage Meter. The total Coefficient of Variation varied from $1 1 \%$ to $1 7 \%$ .

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Value assignment:

The concentration of bulk Protein C solution is verified. The control materials are tested twice per day over a two day period (replicates of eight using eight Triage Protein C Test lots in each assay run). The results are averaged together to yield an overall Protein C concentration for the bulk solution that must fall within a pre-defined specification.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

An open vial stability study was performed using Controls 1 (Calibration Verification Control Level A) and Control 2 (Calibration Verification Control Level B) using three lots of product to support the one hour time point specified in the package insert.

A closed vial stability study was performed using three lots of Protein C High and Low Controls to determine shelf-life stability when stored at $< 2 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C }$ . Results demonstrated that the Protein C Controls are stable for two months.

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable. b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable. c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Results should fall within the expected ranges provided on the enclosed Expected Value Card that is specific for each lot number.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
