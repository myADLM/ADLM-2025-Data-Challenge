# ) Submitter name, address, contact

Roche Diagnostics Corporation 9115 Hague Rd. Indianapolis, IN 46250

Contact Person: Luann Ochs

Date Prepared: January 29, 2007

# Device name

Proprietary name: CoaguChek $\mathfrak { B }$ XS System Common name: Prothrombin time test Classification name: Prothrombin time test

# Predicate device

The Roche Diagnostics CoaguChek XS System (patient self-testing) is substantially equivalent in materials, design and function to other products that measure prothrombin time INR in human blood. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the Roche Diagnostics CoaguChek XS System (professional). In fact, it is identical in materials, design and function to the CoaguChek XS System (professional) except the labeling has been modified and validated for patient self-testing.

# Device Description

The CoaguChek XS is a $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ generation Roche Diagnostic's CoaguChek meter which was cleared for professional use under premarket notification K060978.

This premarket notification is being submitted to obtain clearance for patient self-testing.

# 5) Intended Use

The CoaguChek XS PT test strips are part of the CoaguChek XS System. The CoaguChek XS System measures blood-clotting time for people who are taking anticoagulation medications such as Coumadin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ or warfarin. The CoaguChek XS System uses blood from a finger stick. The system is intended for properly selected and suitably trained users or their caregivers on the prescription or other order of the treating doctor. Users should be stabilized on anticoagulation medications such as Coumadin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ or warfarin prior to self-testing with the CoaguChek XS System.

# ) Comparison to Predicate Device

The following characteristics have been previously submitted, reviewed and cleared under the premarket notification for the CoaguChek XS System (K060978):

Factor Sensitivity   
Heparin Sensitivity   
Hematocrit Effect   
Interfering Substances   
Normal Range   
Measuring Range   
Test Strip Stability   
Integrated Quality Control   
Instrument Failsafes   
Calibration   
Software Development

These characteristics are not impacted by the new user population.

The use of the system by self-testers was validated by an external user study that was conducted as the system is intended to be used. Following self-directed training, the subjects self-tested in the home setting for up to 8 weeks. The subjects also had 3 scheduled visits to their study site to collect user vs. technician data as well as user vs. reference method (Dade Innovin on a Sysmex analyzer) data.

The study results successfully demonstrated that self-trained subjects can obtain results that are equivalent to healthcare professionals and to the reference method. This study also demonstrated that self-tester results are consistent over time.

The performance characteristics that are impacted by the new user population were evaluated. The following information has been incorporated into our draft patient self-testing insert.
