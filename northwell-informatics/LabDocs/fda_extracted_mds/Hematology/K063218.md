# Names of Device:

Trade Name: Common Name: Classification Name:

e-CHECK (XE) TM   
Assayed hematology control   
Hematology quality control mixture (§ 864.8625)

# Predicate Devices:

$\scriptstyle { \theta } \mid$ CHECK manufactured by Streck

# Description:

e-CHECK (XE) is a suspension of stabilized human and animal blood packaged in glass vials, containing $4 . 6 \mathsf { m L }$ volumes. Closures are injection molded polypropylene screw top caps. The device will consist of three levels: Low CBC/High Retic (Low Level), Normal CBC/Intermediate Retic (Normal Level), and High CBC/Low Retic (High Level).The vials are packaged in a welled vacuum formed clam-shell container with the package insert and assay sheet.

# Intended Use:

e-CHECK (XE)T is intended to be used as a control for complete blood cell count (CBC), white blood cell differential, reticulocyte and nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) parameters on Sysmex XE - series instruments.

# Comparison with Predicate Devices:

Like e-CHECK, e-CHECK (XE) is intended to enable the user to verify satisfactory performance of Sysmex XE Series hematology instruments in recovery of CBC and white cell differential parameters on whole blood specimens. Both devices contain stabilized human red blood cells, human white cells, and simulated platelets, which properly mimic human whole blood components on Sysmex analyzers.

Unlike e-CHECK, e-CHECK (XE) contains simulated human nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs). This allows the user to verify proper performance of NRBCs on the Sysmex XE - 2100. The addition to NRBC is the difference between the two products.

# Discussion of Tests and Test Results:

Three studies of $\ominus$ CHECK (XE) were conducted:   
I) Lot to Lot Reproducibility and Comparison to Whole Blood; I) Long Term Stability; and ) Open Vial Stability.Study results showed $\boldsymbol { \mathscr { e } }$ CHECK (XE) to be consistently   
reproducible, substantially equivalent to the predicate products, and stable for the entire product dating.

# Conclusions Drawn From Tests:

Study results show e-CHECK (XE) to be consistently reproducible, substantially equivalent to the predicate product, and stable for the entire product dating. e-CHECK (XE) is a safe and effective product, which fulfills its intended use when used as instructed in the product package insert.

Dear Ms. Oetter:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class ⅡI (Special Controls) or class ⅢI (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97).
