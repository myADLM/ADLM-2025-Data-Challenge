ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips

# Common Name:

Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips

# Regulation Section and Classification:

21 CFR § 862.1510 Nitrite (Non-Quantitative) Test System   
21 CFR $\ S$ 864.7675 Leukocyte Peroxidase Test

Class I: Urinary Leukocytes, Nitrite

# Product Code:

LJX Test, Urine Leukocyte JMT Nitrite (urinary, non-quant.) test system

# Medical Specialty:

Clinical Chemistry

# Predicate Device:

Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis, K905396 Bayer Corporation, marketed by Bayer Corporation, located at Elkhart, IN 46515, USA.

# Device Description:

The ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips for Leukocytes and Nitrite are urine test strips of which Nitrite and Leukocyte reagent pads are affixed onto the plastic strips. The reagent pads react with the urine and provide a visible color reaction. Results are obtained by direct comparison of the test strip with the color blocks printed on the bottle label. The product is packaged with a drying agent in a plastic bottle. The entire reagent strip is disposable when the disposal directions are followed exactly. Laboratory instrumentation is not required. These tests are intended for over-the-counter home use with human urine.

# Intended Use:

The ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips is for the qualitative detection of Leukocyte a Nitri n urie s n id  the seein  rinay ract ifecton UT.It is intenr over-the-counter home use only.

# Tests Principles:

Nitrite: This test depends upon the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram negative bacteria in the urine. In an acidic medium, nitrite in the urine reacts with $\mathbf { p }$ -arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1 N-(1- naphthyl)-ethylenediamine to produce a pink color. Nitrite is not detectable in normal urine. The nitrite area will be positive in some cases of infection, depending on how long the urine specimens were retained in the bladder prior to collection. Retrieval of positive cases with the nitrite test ranges from as low as $40 \%$ in cases where little bladder incubation occurred, to as high as approximately $80 \%$ in cases where bladder incubation took place for at least 4 hours.

Leukocytes: This test reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases. The esterases cleave a derivatized pyrazole amino acid ester to liberate derivatized hydroxy pyrazole. This pyrazole then reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color. Normal urine specimens generally yield negative results. Trace results may be of questionable clinical significance. When trace results occur, it is recommended to retest using a fresh specimen from the same patient.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips for Leukocytes and Nitrite are substantially equivalent to the Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis (K905396).

Characteristic of the ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips are compared with the Bayer Multistix 10 SG system (K905396) in the following table:

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

The clinical studies were conducted at Beta sites using the ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips (Section 20, page 43 of this submission). Clinical data were presented evaluating clinical accuracy of results. Clinical study results indicate that the inexperienced lay users were able to obtain comparable testing data compared to those obtained by the professionals when using the ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips and the legally marketed Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis (K905396).

# Conclusion:

The performance characteristics of the ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips were verified by sensitivity study, reproducibility study, interference studies, temperature flex study, read time flex study, and stability studies. Testing results indicate that the ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips are robust and can perform satisfactorily when used according to the "Directions for Use" statement specified in the package insert.

Thelaboratory testinresults and clinicalstudie demonstrated a substantial equivaleny performance between the ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips and a legally marketed product, Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis (K905396), with similar product features and intended use.
