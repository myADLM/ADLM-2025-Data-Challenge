The sponsor did not indicate any deviations from these guidances.

# L. Test Principle:

Prior to placing the patient samples on the ACE clinical chemistry analyzer whole blood samples require a pretreatment step. The red blood cells in the sample are lysed by the Hemoglobin Denaturant and the hemoglobin chain hydrolyzed.

For determination of HbA1c, a latex agglutination inhibition assay is used. In the absence of HbA1c in the sample, the agglutinator (synthetic polymer containing the immunoreactive portion of HbA1c) in the HbA1c Agglutinator Reagent and the antibody-coated microparticles in the HbA1c Antibody Reagent will agglutinate. The presence of HbA1c in the sample competes for the antibody binding sites and inhibits agglutination. The increase in absorbance, monitored monochromatically at $5 9 2 \mathrm { n m }$ on the ACE clinical chemistry system, is inversely proportional to the HbA1c present in the sample. For the determination of total hemoglobin, all hemoglobin derivatives in the sample are converted to alkaline hematin. The reaction produces a green colored solution, which is measured bichromatically at $5 7 3 \ \mathrm { n m } / 6 9 2$ nm. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the total hemoglobin concentration in the sample. The ratio between HbA1c and total hemoglobin is then calculated to obtain the percent HbA1c value.

For the determination of total hemoglobin, all hemoglobin derivatives in the sample are converted to alkaline hematin. Total Hemoglobin Reagent is first loaded on the ACE analyzer. After instrument calibration is performed with the Alfa Wassermann Total Hemoglobin Calibrator, controls and patient samples are loaded on the instrument. The instrument then mixes the sample and reagent in a cuvette, and after an incubation period the absorbance change in the cuvette is monitored. The reaction is measured bichromatically at $5 7 3 ~ \mathrm { n m } / 6 9 2 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ . The intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the total hemoglobin concentration in the sample. The ACE analyzer calculates the concentration of total hemoglobin in the sample using the total hemoglobin calibration standard curve.

After both the concentration of HbA1c and total hemoglobin are determined using calibration curves, the ACE analyzer calculates the ratio of the two tests and the result is reported as percent HbA1c.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were done according to CLSI EP5-A Guidelines. Precision was measured on a normal $6 . 3 \%$ A1c) and elevated ( $12 . 2 \%$ A1c) patient sample using the ACE clinical chemistry system. The within-run CV for the normal patient was $2 . 9 \%$ and for the elevated patient was $3 . 0 \%$ . The total CV for the normal patient was $7 . 0 \%$ and for the elevated patient was $5 . 9 \%$ .

Precision studies were also done in three separate Physician Office Laboratory (POL) sites. These studies were conducted by personnel without formal medical technology education. The studies consisted of running three EDTA whole blood samples (the same three samples were run at each of the three labs) with varying levels of HbA1c in triplicate on five different days.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity of the ACE Hemoglobin A1c assay was evaluated using the CLSI, EP6 Guideline. Five different samples with $\% _ { \mathrm { \tiny { H b A l c } } }$ assigned values of $0 . 5 \substack { - 1 6 . 9 \% }$ were tested on the ACE clinical chemistry system. In a separate study, six different samples with assigned $\%$ HbA1c values ranging from $5 . 4 \%$ to $2 1 . 4 \%$ were measured. Linear regression analysis confirmed the claim of linearity between $3 . 0 \% { - } 1 8 . 0 \%$ HbA1c. The results supported device specification of $1 \%$ HbA1c (in HbA1c units) or $5 \%$ (in percent).

The measuring range for total hemoglobin was verified using a whole blood sample. The sample was serially diluted using the packed cells and plasma from the blood sample. Sample results, ranging from $1 0 { - } 2 1 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ fell within $10 \%$ of the expected value using $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor’s calibrators and controls are specifically identified for use.

The sponsor claims that the calibrators are traceable to a NGSP reference method. Currently, the $\mathbf { A C E @ }$ Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Reagent used on the ACE analyzer has not been certified by the NGSP.

Multiple analyzers and lots of reagent are used to analyze control materials for the purpose of establishing their published acceptable ranges. Traditional statistical calculations are used, i.e., mean $+ / - 2$ standard deviations.

Users are instructed in the package insert to follow federal, state, and local guidelines concerning QC practices.

# Stability

Stability studies are summarized for the calibrators and/controls. The sponsor specifies the method used to analyze the material, environmental storage conditions, frequency of testing, baseline against which measurements are compared, and acceptance criteria for the study. Accelerated studies are used by the sponsor to estimate the expiration date, and on-going real time studies are being performed. Results vary less than $10 \%$ from the expected values throughout the expiration date.

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity:

For interference testing, CLSI EP7A Guidelines were used. To evaluate the effects of bilirubin interference, unconjugated bilirubin was added to a whole blood sample in various concentrations ranging from $1 . 6 { - } 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Recoveries of $\%$ HbA1c at the various concentrations ranged from 96.7 to $1 0 1 . 3 \%$ . Using a specification of less than a $10 \%$ change in recovery of $\% _ { \mathrm { \tiny { H b A l c } } }$ from the control (no bilirubin added), studies demonstrated that bilirubin up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ did not interfere with the assay.

For the lipemia interference study, six normo-lipemic and lipemic whole blood samples (up to $2 8 0 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ triglycerides) were tested for $\% _ { \mathrm { \tiny { H b A l c } } }$ on the ACE clinical chemistry system. Packed cells from each sample were washed three times with saline and the samples were re-assayed. Using the specification of less than a $10 \%$ change in recovery from the washed $\% _ { \mathrm { \tiny \mathrm { ~ H b A l { c } } } }$ value, the change in $\% _ { \mathrm { { H b A l c } } }$ ranged from $0 \%$ to $10 \%$ . Studies demonstrated that lipemic samples with triglyceride levels up to $2 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ did not interfere with this assay.

To evaluate the performance of the assay for testing hemoglobin variants, whole blood samples were obtained which contained Hb C, Hb E, Hb F and Hb S. These samples had previously been characterized by reference methods known to be unaffected by variants. The samples were run on the ACE clinical chemistry system for $\%$ HbA1c. The percent recovery was greater than $10 \%$ difference in all cases, with the exception of Hb F, where the percent recovery averaged $106 \%$ $\mathrm { \Delta } ( { \bf n } = 3$ , range 91 to $1 1 6 \%$ ). Results of this study support the sponsor’s claims, i.e., that Hb C, Hb E and Hb S interfere with this method and that Hb F may interfere with this method by giving higher than expected results.

For the labile HbA1c interference study, two whole blood samples (one with a normal and one with an elevated $\%$ HbA1c level) were incubated with zero (control) and increasing levels of glucose at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ for four hours. The samples were then run on the ACE clinical chemistry system. For both the normal and elevated samples, $\%$ HbA1c results for all glucose concentrations tested were less than $10 \%$ lower than the control results compared to the reference method.
