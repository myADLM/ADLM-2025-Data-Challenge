# L. Test Principle:

Patient plasma samples are diluted and incubated with tPA solution to allow for the tPA and PAI-1 in the sample to react. Acetate buffer is added to the sample to destroy α-2- antiplasmin which would interfere with the assay. Next, the samples are incubated with a chromogenic substrate for plasmin (PAR), so that residual tPA activity in the sample catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn hydrolyzes the chromogenic substrate. The amount of color developed in inversely proportional l to the amount of PAI-1 activity in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Intra and inter-assay variability with 3 control samples. In Study 1, three PAI-1 controls were assayed 4 times per run for 20 total runs. In study 2, 3 PAI-1 levels were assayed 4 times per run for 5 total runs. Two lots were tested.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Five samples of known PAI concentrations were prepared from samples of known PAI concentrations. Low $\left( 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m l } \right)$ , mid low (10, $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m l } )$ , mid high $\left( 3 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m l } \right)$ , and high $( 4 0 \mathrm { U / m l } )$ samples were run using the Spectrolyse $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PAI-1 assay in replicates of four. A least squares regression line was fit to the PAI-1 $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ (Y) vs theoretical concentrations of PAI-1 samples (X) data. $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 8 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 1 , \mathrm { r } =$ 0.998.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method): The PAI 0 standard is calibrated against a Primary Standard according to SOP CHRO21_A, Determining the Activity of tPA Standard.

d. Detection limit:

The 0 Standard and a patient sample known to have a result between 0 and 10 PAI, was assayed 20 times. Results $\mathrm { U / m L }$ . were analyzed according to the recommendations in NCCLS guideline EP17-A, and the LoB was calculated to be $2 . 6 \ : \mathrm { U / m L }$ , and the LoD was calculated to be 4.6

e. Analytical specificity:

Seven patient samples (untreated with antibody) were assayed in duplicated using ADI Spectrolyse $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PAI-1 assay. Each patient sample was mixed with an anti-PAI antibody or with an anti-FVIII antibody negative control antibody. Results demonstrated that PAI-1 levels were essentially the same in untreated samples and samples treated with control antibody. Samples treated with anti-PAI-1 antibody had significantly reduced PAI-1 levels.
