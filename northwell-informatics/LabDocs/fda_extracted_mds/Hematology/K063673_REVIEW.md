4. Special instrument requirements:

# I. Device Description:

The Innovacon Flipcard™ Fecal Occult Blood Test Device is a rapid test intended for the qualitative detection of low levels of fecal occult blood. The test uses a double antibody sandwich assay to selectively detect fecal occult blood at $5 0 \ \mathrm { n g \ h H b / m L }$ buffer or $3 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } \mathrm { h H B } / \mathrm { g }$ feces.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The Flipcard FOB Test Device is a qualitative, lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of human occult blood in feces. The membrane is pre-coated with antihemoglobin antibody on the test line region of the test. During testing, the specimen reacts with the particle coated with anti-hemoglobin antibody. The mixture migrates upward on the membrane chromatographically by capillary action to react with antihemoglobin antibody on the membrane to generate a colored line. The presence of this colored line in the test region indicates a positive result, while its absence indicates a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear in the control line region, indicating that the proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Intra-Assay: Using three different lots, three spiked positive samples and three negative samples were tested with the same lot in replicates of 10, for a total of 180 tests. Results were read as positive or negative as specified in the package insert. Sample results were correct and in agreement for each of the 18 samples.

Inter-Assay: Ten different negative and ten different positive samples were tested on three lots. Results were read as positive or negative as specified in the package insert. All three lots yielded correct results and were in

agreement for each of the samples.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The candidate device detected blood at levels up to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ whole blood per $_ { 1 0 0 \mathrm { g } }$ feces.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Internal (Procedural) Control: Is included in the device. A colored line appearing in the Control line region (C) indicates that adequate sample volume and reagens were used and both have migrated properly. If the C-line does not form the test is considered invalid and the test should be repeated. External Controls: The positive and negative external controls should be run every 25 tests. External Positive and Negative Controls are supplied in the kit.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical cut-off for the Flipcard™ FOB test is $5 0 \ \mathrm { n g \ h H b / m L }$ buffer or $3 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } \mathrm { h H b } / \mathrm { g }$ feces.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Studies were done to investigate the cross reactivity of the Flipcard™ FOB test. Diluted extracts of the following substances were added to positive and negative controls. No cross reactivity was observed.

Physician Office Lab (POL) Studies:

Additional studies were conducted at three POLs and performed by personnel with various educational backgrounds. Each office tested a randomly coded panel of samples. Ninety hemoglobin free stool extracts were collected and separated in 5 groups of 18. Each group of samples were spiked with a known level of human hemoglobin to result in the following concentrations: $0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ $\mathrm { { h H b / g } }$ feces, $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } \mathrm { h H b } / \mathrm { g }$ feces. $2 2 5 \mu \mathrm { g h H b } / \mathrm { g }$ feces, $3 7 5 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { h H b } / \mathrm { g }$ feces, and $4 5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } \mathrm { h H b / g }$ feces. There was an $89 \%$ correlation with expected results. $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } 8 4 \ – 9 2 \% )$ ).
