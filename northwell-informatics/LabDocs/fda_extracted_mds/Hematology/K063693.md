Trade or Proprietary Name: Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test

Common/Usual Name:   
Lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for detection of human hemoglobin or fecal occult   
blood in feces

Device Classification Name: Immunoassay of human hemoglobin or fecal occult blood

Regulatory Name: Human Hemoglobin or Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test System

# Predicate Devices:

Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test is substantially equivalent to WHPM Hemosure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test cleared by FDA (K041202) for its stated intended use.

# Device Description:

Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test is a qualitative, sandwich colloidal gold conjugate immunoassay for the determination of human hemoglobin in feces. The method employs a unique combination of monoclonal antibodies to selectively identify hemoglobin in test sample with a high degreeo sensitivity. In less than 5minutes, elvatd levels of human hemoglobin as low as 50 ng/ml can be detected, and positive results for high levels of hemoglobin can be seen in the test as early as two to three minutes. As the test sample flows through the absorbent device, the Colloidal Gold labeled antibody- conjugate binds to the hemoglobin in the specimen forming an antibody-antigen complex. This complex binds to another anti-hemoglobin antibody in the positive reaction zone and produces a pink-ross color band when hemoglobin concentration is greater than 50 ng/ml. In the absence of hemoglobin, there is no line in the positive reaction zone. The reaction mixture continues flowing through the absorbent device past the positive reaction zone and negative control zone. Unbind conjugate binds to the reagents in the negative control zone, producing a pink rose color band, demonstrating that the reagents and device are functioning correctly.

A NEGATIVE specimen produces one distinct color bands in control area. A POsITIVE see produ  or band n the control and test are There  o mnarbu to color or its intensity for either line.

# Intended Use:

Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test is a rapid, immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of intact hHb (human hemoglobin) in fecal specimens. It is a convenient and hygienic method for detecting human fecal occult blood, which may be in dicative of gastrointestinal disease associated with bleeding such as colorectal carcinoma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and colon polyps in humans.

# Summary:

The information provided in this pre-market notification demonstrates that Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test is substantially equivalent to WHPM Hemosure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test. Substantial equivalence was demonstrated through comparison of intended use and physical properties to the commercially available and analytical predicate devices. The information supplied in this pre-market notification provides reasonable assurance that the Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test is safe and effective for its stated intended use.

Dear Mr. Berlie:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of ln Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150, or at its Internet address
