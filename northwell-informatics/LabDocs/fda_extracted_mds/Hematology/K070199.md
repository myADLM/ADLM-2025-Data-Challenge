Retic-Chex Linearity manufactured by Streck

# Description:

Retic-Chex Linearity for BC is a suspension of stabilized human red blood cells and simulated human reticulocytes packaged in plastic vials, containing $3 . 0 \mathsf { m L }$ volumes. The device consists of five levels of reticulocyte percentage range from 0 to $2 9 . 5 \%$ Closures are injection molded polypropylene screw top caps. The vials are packaged in a welled vacuum formed clam-shell container with the package insert and assay sheet.

# Intended Use:

Re-Chex Linerity or BC is anssaydnearitycnrol k which can eused oss instrument's accuracy and to verify patient reportable ranges of automated hematology instrumentation capable of enumerating reticulocytes.

# Discussion of Tests and Test Results:

Three studies of Retic-Chex Linearity for BC were conducted:   
)Run to Run Reproduciblity and Comparison to Whole Blood; I) Long Term Stability; and I) Ve reducible ubstantial quivalent to he predicate products, an stable or he enti ouc dating.

# Conclusions Drawn From Tests:

Study results show Retic-Chex Linearity or BC to be consistently reproducible, substantially a for BC is a safe and effective product, which fulfill itsintended use when used as instruct the product package insert.

Re: k070199 Trade/Device Name: Retic-Chex Linearity for BX Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.8625 Regulation Name: Hematology Quality Control Mixture Regulatory Class: Class ⅡI Product Code: JPK Dated: January 19, 2007 Received: January 22, 2007

Dear Ms. Oetter:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class ⅢI (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
