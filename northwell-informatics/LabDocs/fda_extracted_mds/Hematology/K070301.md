# Regulatory Information:

864.7060 Antithrombin III Assay Class II   
81JBQ Antithrombin III Quantitation

Identification of Predicate Device(s): K980499 HemosIL Antithrombin

# Device Description:

HemosIL Antithrombin is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative determination of Antihrombin in human plasma to monitor the administration of heparin in the treatment of thrombosis and as an aid in the diagnosis of thrombophilia (a congenital deficiency of Antithrombin).

# Reason for Submission:

The Expected Values section of the Hemos Antithrombin insert is being modified t reference a normal range from published literature, reinforcing the need for each laboratory to establish its own normal [reference] range due to the many variables which may affect results.

# Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

HemosIL Antithrombin with the modified Expected Values section in the product insert is no1 materially different from the FDA cleared device.

# Summary of Expected Values Section to the Modified Product Insert:

Antithrombin activity levels in healthy individuals are approximately in the range of $8 3 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 2 8 \%$ . Antithrombin levels are low in neonates/infants and increase to adult levels by approximately 1 year of age; levels are then slightly higher than in adults up to age 16 year.\*

Due to many variables which may affect results, each laboratory should establish its own normal range.
