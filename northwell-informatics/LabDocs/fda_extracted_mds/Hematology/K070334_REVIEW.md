# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

It is established laboratory practice to use a stable control to monitor the performance of diagnostic tests. This control is composed of stable material that provides a mean of monitoring the presence of sickling hemoglobin S in solubility tests. It is sampled in the same manner as the patient specimen.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

Open and closed vial stability testing was performed on three lots of negative and positive controls $2 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ volumes). Vials were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for closed vial storage and $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ }$ for open vial storage. All controls performed as expected.

Open Vial Stability: 100 days Closed Vial Stability: 6 months

Value assignment: Human packed red cells are received from vendor and tested once if certification is provide and twice by two different technicians if certification is not provided. A commercial sickle cell test kit is used for this Hemoglobin S testing, and units are processed accordingly to achieve the Control 1 (negative) and Control 2 (positive) product.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Sickle QC Hematology Control is designed to be handled in the same manner as a patient specimen. The positive control will appear as a cloudy turbid suspension as descried in the reagent test kit instruction for use. The negative control will appear as a nearly transparent solution as described in the reagent test kit instruction for use.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
