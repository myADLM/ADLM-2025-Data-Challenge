# Testing To Establish Substantial Equivalence:

# Accuracy:

Method correlation between the new VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program (270- 2101NU) and current VARIANT II Hemoglobin $\mathbf { A } _ { 1 \mathfrak { c } }$ Program (270-2101) was evaluated using 42 EDTA whole blood patient samples ranging from $4 . 2 \%$ to $1 0 . 9 \%$ $\mathrm { H b A } _ { { \mathrm { i c } } }$ The results are presented in the following regression table.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>RegressionMethod</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Least Squares</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.989</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.056</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.105</td></tr></table>

# Precision:

The following table provides comparison data on the precision between the new VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c (270-2101NU) and VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c (270- 2101) Programs, each utilizing low and high EDTA whole blood patient samples, and both tested against samples with moderate (5.4/5.5) and high (8.8- 13.7) $\%$ Alc content.

Method precision was performed using a protocol based on the NCCLS Evaluation protocol, Vol.24, No. 25, EP5-A2 (2004) for the new VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c (270-2101NU) and NCCLS Evaluation protocol, Vol.12, No. 4, EP5-T2 (Mar. 1992) for the current VARIANT II Hemoglobin $\mathbf { A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ Program (270-2101). The protocols for both the new VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c and current VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Programs are similar.

For the new VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program protocol, six VARIANT II Hemoglobin Testing Systems at three Bio-Rad sites were utilized. Each site was provided with the same sample set and performed two replicates of each sample on each of 2 runs/day for 10 days.

For the current VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program protocol, 40 runs (2 per day) were performed on one VARIANT II Hemoglobin Testing System over 20 working days. In each duplicate daily run, one aliquot of low HbA 1c and one aliquot of high HbA1c patient samples were each analyzed per run.

Although the precision samples are different, since they were run at different time periods, the precision results between the new VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c (270- 2101NU) and the current VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program (270-2101) are equivalent. A summary of combined comparative precision results is presented in the following precision table.

# Conclusion:

When considering the similarities of the intended use, the general characteristics of the two assays, the use of the same technology and the similar correlation, accuracy and linearity between the two methods, it can be concluded that the new VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program (270-2101NU) is substantially equivalent to the cleared and currently marketed predicate, VARIANT II Hemoglobin $\mathbf { A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ Program (270-2101).

Dear Ms. Buckley:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490.
