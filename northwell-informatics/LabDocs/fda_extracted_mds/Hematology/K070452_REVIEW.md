# L. Test Principle:

The VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program is based on chromatographic separation of HbA1c on a cation exchange cartridge. The various forms of hemoglobin exhibit charge differences (positive) at the acidic $\mathsf { p H }$ of the mobile phase, and thus can be separated on a support that is negatively charged (cation exchange). The use of ionexchange chromatography allows molecules to be separated based upon their charge. Separation is optimized to eliminate interferences from hemoglobin variants (HbS, HbC, HbD and HbE), labile A1c, hemoglobin F and carbamylated hemoglobin.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Normal patient, normal control, diabetic patient and diabetic controls were run in the precision study. The precision study was performed on six instruments in three laboratories over 10 days. Each site was provided with the same sample set and directed to perform two replicates of each sample on each of 2 runs/day (morning and evening) for 10 days. Each site conducted the study on two instruments. The position of the precision specimens in each run was

randomized. The results were analyzed by nested Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with the hierarchical levels of labs, instruments, days, and runs. The estimates of imprecision obtained from the analysis are given in the table below. Patient samples are EDTA human whole blood.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity across the reportable range was performed using low $( 3 . 1 \% )$ and high $( 1 8 . 6 \% )$ EDTA whole blood patient samples. These were mixed together in varying ratios (i.e. 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3) and the measured values were compared to the theoretical values based upon the dilution factor. The measured values were all within $0 . 0 5 \%$ of the predicted values. A linear regression was performed and resulted in a slope of 0.998 and a y-intercept of 0.006.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability Hemoglobin A1c IFCC Reference standards (Kyoto 2002) were obtained from the IFCC Working Group on Standardization on Hemoglobin A1c. These standards and the Manufacturer Reference Calibrators were run on multiple VARIANT II Hemoglobin Testing Systems to assign values to the Manufacturer Reference Calibration materials. The Manufacturer Reference Calibrators are used to transfer IFCC/NGSP traceable values to product calibrators for the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Calibrator/Diluent Set. Both IFCC and NGSP calibrator value assignments are provided in the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program Calibrator/Diluent Set packaging.

# Stability

Real time stability and accelerated stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range is 3.1 to $1 8 . 5 \%$ HbA1c. See the linearity study above for data on recovery of samples across the measuring range.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Several interfering substance studies were performed which include Labile A1c, carbamylated A1c, bilirulin, lipemia, hemoglobin F, and hemoglobins S, C, D and E. Whole blood pooled samples with normal and diabetic levels of HbA1c were supplemented with bilirubin, Hemoglobin F, labile A1c. The samples were analyzed in duplicate on the VARIANT II Hemoglobin Testing System. The specification for no interference was less than or equal to $0 . 3 \%$ change in HbA1c value. No interference was seen from bilirubin up to 20 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin F concentrations up to $10 \%$ , and labile A1c at biological levels.

To test the level of interference of carbamylated hemoglobin patient EDTA whole blood specimen pools with normal and diabetic levels of A1c were split into two aliquots. The Red Blood Cells (RBCs) of both aliquots were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). One aliquot of each level was incubated with a $0 . 0 5 { \mathrm { M } }$ potassium cyanate solution until the carbamylated hemoglobin level increased by approximately 1, 2, 3, and $4 \%$ . Both aliquots from each level were analyzed in duplicate on the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c program on two instruments. The specification for interference was that the difference in $\%$ HbA1c must be less than or equal to $0 . 3 \%$ for a normal sample up to an increase of $3 . 0 \%$ CHb and less than or equal to $0 . 5 \%$ for a diabetic sample up to an increase of $3 . 0 \%$ . No interference was seen at these levels.

To test for Hemoglobin AD (AD) and Hemoglobin AE (AE) interference 20 AD samples and 23 AE samples were analyzed compared to values obtained by NGSP SRL Boronate affinity method. Least squares linear regression was performed on the data points collected from this study, comparing VARIANT II HbA1c values with NGSP HbA1c values. The specification for no interference from hemoglobins D and E was that the predicted value of the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c result should be within $10 \%$ of the NGSP value. All specifications were met.

To test for interference from Hemoglobin AS (AS) and hemoglobin (AC) 20 AS samples and 15 AC samples were analyzed and compared to values obtained by an NGSP SRL Boronate affinity method. Least squares linear regression was performed on the data points collected from this study, comparing VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c values with NGSP HbA1c values. The specifications for no interference from hemoglobins S and C were that the predicted value of the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c result should be within $10 \%$ of the NGSP value. All specifications were met.

To determine the effect of lipemia on results generated on the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program, two pooled EDTA whole blood patients samples representing normal and diabetic HbA1c levels were centrifuged and the plasma fraction was removed from each sample. Serum samples were obtained from a commercial laboratory with normal $( 8 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and abnormal $( 6 0 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ triglyceride concentrations and used to prepare serum pools. Aliquots of the normal and diabetic patient specimen red blood cells were then combined with an equal volume of the triglyceride serum pools and analyzed in duplicate. The specification for no interference was less than or equal to a $0 . 3 \%$ change in the HbA1c value. No interference was seen.

To study the effects of EDTA on the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program, samples for the determination of HbA1c were collected from normal and diabetic patients. One milliliter aliquots of patient samples were supplemented with 11 times the EDTA concentration by transferring of the samples to empty potassium EDTA tubes. The controls and supplemented samples were then analyzed in duplicate with the VARIANT II Hemoglobin A1c Program. The results showed a change of less than $0 . 1 \%$ was seen between the controls and samples with up to 11X EDTA.

A study was performed to verify that there is no carryover interference from a variant S, C, D or E sample. The normal quality control material was run in triplicate as patients with variants S, C, D and E samples placed throughout the run in triplicate locations. The specification for carryover interference from hemoglobin variants was that the difference in $\%$ HbA1c must be less than or equal to $0 . 3 \%$ . The maximum change in HbA1c was $0 . 0 7 \%$ in the samples after HbAC, and $- 0 . 0 7 \%$ change in the sample after the HbAS samples. The samples after HbAE and HbAD samples showed no change in HbA1c.
