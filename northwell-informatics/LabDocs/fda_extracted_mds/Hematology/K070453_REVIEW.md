# L. Test Principle:

The Olympus D-Dimer assay system is based on the decrease in transmitted light due

to absorbance by insoluble d-dimer-/anti d-dimer aggregates which form in the reaction mixture when latex particles coated with monoclonal mouse anti-human ddimer react with d-dimer fragments from the patient sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was assessed according to CLSI EP5-A2 by testing a low, medium, and high analyte human plasma pool. 2 runs of duplicates were assayed each day for 20 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ). All results were within acceptable limits $( < 1 0 \% )$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was established based on CLSI Guideline EP6-P2. At least 10 serial dilutions of a high sample pool was prepared and assayed in quadruplicate. The mean result of each dilution was plotted against the analyte concentration. The AU400, AU640, and AU2700 instruments were evaluated and the Olympus D-Dimer assay system was determined to be linear from 0.15 to 8.00 µg FEU/mL

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Olympus D-Dimer calibrators are bi-level calibrators derived from human serum. Values are based on an in-house master calibrator that is traceable to a gravimetric standard and converted from $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $\mu \mathrm { g } \ : \mathrm { F E U / m L }$ . The assignment value protocol is located in Section 8 of the submission.

The Olympus D-Dimer controls are bi-level controls, and are derived from a lyophilized human based matrix. Controls values are assigned per lot for each matched set of reagents, and are based on the mean of ${ \ge } 8$ runs of the control serum.

# d. Detection limit:

An analyte free sample was tested 20X on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700. The analytical sensitivity was determined to be $0 . 1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ FEU/mL by calculating the absolute mean plus 3 standard deviations.

# e. Analytical specificity:

To assess analytical specificity, the mean analytical result of the sample containing the interferent is compared with that for the non-spiked sample. The Olympus D-dimer assay demonstrated no significant inference with Bilirubin (up to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), hemolysis (up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin), lipemia (up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), rheumatoid factor (up to $1 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) and heparin (up to $1 . 5 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ).

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The Olympus D-dimer assay was compared to the predicate device and evaluated using linear regression $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 1 0 4$ , $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 1 0 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 7 9$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 6$ ). In addition, the performance of the Olympus D-Dimer assay on the AU640 was compared to performance of the assay on the AU400 $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 1 0 4 }$ , $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 4 \mathrm { x } -$ 0.029, $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 8$ ) and the AU2700 $\mathrm { \Delta } _ { \mathrm { n } } = 1 0 4$ , $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 0 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 3 7 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 \uparrow$ ).

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

Matched heparin (y) and citrated samples (x) were tested in single replicates $\left( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 1 \right)$ ) and the results analyzed using linear regression $( \mathrm { y } = 1 . 1 6 7 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 4 8 $ , $\mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 8 )$ .

Although the results demonstrated good correlation, d-dimer concentrations in citrated samples are generally lower than d-dimer concentrations in heparinzed samples by $1 6 \%$ . For harmonization a conversion factor of 0.84

for heparin plasma is recommended. This recommendation is reflected in the device labeling.
