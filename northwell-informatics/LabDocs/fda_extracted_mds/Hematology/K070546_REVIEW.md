# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

No standards or guidance documents were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment for the Lyphochek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Diabetes Control Material was conducted by assaying 20 replicates per level per analyte over a period of 10 days using various lots of reagents. The values listed in the package insert are the average values from three reference laboratories specific for the product lot. The ranges vary and are set at $+ / -$ $20 \%$ of the average values.

Open vial stability study time is defined to be at least $20 \%$ longer than the claimed open vial stability for the product and is determined at a minimum of three time points $( \mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { z e r o } } , \mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { f i n a l } }$ and $\mathrm { T _ { f i n a l + 2 0 \% } }$ ). Controls are assayed to ensure the accuracy and precision of the testing methods. The sponsors’ failure criteria are defined as the $\mathrm { T _ { f i n a l } }$ being $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of the $\mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { z e r o } }$ . The sponsors open vial stability claim is 7 days when stored tightly capped at 2-8 C.

The sponsor conducted accelerated stability testing on pilot lots at elevated temperatures (i.e. $4 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $4 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $5 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) in order to observe changes in product performance more rapidly than would be seen under normal storage conditions of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Controls are assayed to ensure the accuracy and precision of the testing methods at several time points for each temperature to predict shelf life using a stability model with activation energy of the $2 0 \mathrm { - k C a l / m o l }$ or Arrhenius Model predictions. The sponsors’ shelf life claim is 3 years when stored tightly capped at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The sponsors real time stability testing is determined by storing the product under the recommended storage conditions $\left( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ for the life of the product. These studies are conducted on production lots and are long-term studies. Several vials of each level are tested at each time point and the results of the real time samples are compared to the results of reference vials store at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Failure is assumed to have taken place when the product’s analyte concentration has changed by greater than or equal to the established acceptance recovery criteria. Real time stability studies are ongoing.
