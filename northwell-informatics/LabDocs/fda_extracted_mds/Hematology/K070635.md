Summary Prepared: March 22, 2007

Name of the Device:HemosIL ProClot

# Regulatory Information:

864.7290 Factor Deficiency Test Class II   
81GGP Test, Qualitative and Quantitative Factor Deficient

# Identification of Predicate Device(s):

K912711 HemosIL ProClot

# Device Intended Use:

HemosIL ProClot is an automated functional clotting Protein C assay for the quantitative determination of Protein C in human citrated plasma on the IL Coagulation Systems.

# Device Description:

The ProClot kit is a functional clotting Protein C test, based on the prolongation of an APTT assay in presence of activated Protein C. The use of the APTT test to measure the anticoagulant efect of activat protei is ue nsiivity VandV levelsctivated rotei  pa copperhead snake Agkistrodom contortrix contortrix.

# Reason for Submission:

The Expected Values section of the Hemos ProClot insert is being modified to reference a normal range from published literature, reinforcing the need for each laboratory to establish its own normal [reference] range due to the many variables which may affect results.

Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

Hemos roClot with the modifie Expecte Values section i the product inser  not matially different from the FDA cleared device.

Summary of Expected Values Section to the Modified Product Insert:

Protein C activity levels in healthy individuals are approximately in the range of $7 0 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 4 0 \%$ Protein C levels are low in neonates and infants and increase to adult levels during adolescence.\*

Due to many variables which may affect results, each laboratory should establish its own normal range.

Dear Ms. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

# Indications for Use Statement

510(k) Number (f known): K0 70635

Device Name: HemosIL ProClot

# Indications for Use:

HemosIL ProClot is an automated functional clotting Protein C assay for the quantitative determination of Protein C in human citrated plasma on the IL Coagulation Systems. Protein C deficiency is associated with recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, especially in young adults. Acquired deficiencies of Protein C are associated with hepatic disorders, oral anticoagulant therapy and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
