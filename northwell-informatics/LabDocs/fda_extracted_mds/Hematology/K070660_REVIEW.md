# I. Device Description:

The INSTANT-VIEW $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Rapid Test is a one-step lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. The test strip is contained in a cassette and consists of a burgundy-colored conjugate pad containing colloidal gold coupled with mouse anti-human hemoglobin monoclonal antibodies and a nitrocellulose membrane containing a test line (T line) and a control line (C line). The T line is coated with anti-human hemoglobin antibodies, and the C line is coated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies.

# L. Test Principle:

This test kit is one-step lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. The test consists of three burgundy colored conjugate pads containing mouse anti-hHb antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold and a nitrocellulose membrane containing the test line. The human hemoglobin line appears as a visible burgundy line if the concentration of hHb in the specimen at or above $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ .

A fecal sample is collected and prepared for testing in a sample collection tube containing extraction buffer. The extracted sample is added directly to the test device and migrates by capillary action through the test strip. If the level of hemoglobin in the fecal specimen is at or above the cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of hemoglobin in the fecal specimen is below the cutoff, no T line develops.

The control line is a internal procedural control. Goat anti-mouse IgG is used for the “Control Line” coating. When the gold conjugate reagent flows to the “Control Line” area, the goat anti-mouse IgG reacts to form a burgundy colored band regardless of the presence of hemoglobin.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Human stool extraction samples were spiked with hHb at the following concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . 4 samples were tested at each concentration with three lots of the AlfaScientific FOBT. Samples with concentrations below $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ hHb tested negative with the candidate device while samples at and above $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ tested positive.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

Internal Control: Procedural controls are included in the test device. A magenta line appearing the control region in considered as internal procedural control. It confirms sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and correct procedural technique. External Control: Controls are not provided with this kit. It is recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper test performance.

d. Detection limit:

The minimal detection limit is $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ of hHb in buffer or $5 0 ~ \mu \ g$ $\mathrm { { h H b / g } }$ in stool.

e. Analytical specificity:

Positive and negative stool samples were spiked with the following substances: Beef, chicken, fish (meat extract), horse, goat, pig, rabbit, and sheep hemoglobin; horseradish peroxidase; red radish; raw turnip; cauliflower; broccoli; parsnip; cantaloupe; Vitamin C; and iron. Addition of these substances had no effect on the test results.

f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

a. Forty human stool extraction samples were spiked with hHb at the following concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ .

The candidate device was compared to the predicate at each of the concentrations and agreed $100 \%$ of the time with the predicate and the expected results.

b. The candidate device was evaluated at three physician office laboratories and one medical laboratory by personnel with diverse educational backgrounds and work experience. One hundred human stool extraction samples were spiked with hHb at the following concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . (20 at each concentration) Results obtained from three POL sites agreed $9 7 . 7 \%$ with the expected results and results from the medical laboratory agree $9 9 \%$ with the expected results. Overall agreement was $9 8 \%$ .

c. The candidate device was evaluated in a consumer study of 120 lay individuals with various educational levels. $1 2 0 \mathrm { h H B }$ spiked phosphate buffer saline (PBS) samples at the following concentrations: 0, 37.5, 62.5 and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , were tested.

Consumer results agreed $9 5 \%$ with the expected results, while professional results agreed $100 \%$ with the expected results.
