# L. Test Principle:

The VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program is based on the chromatographic separation of HbA1c on a cation exchange cartridge. The various forms of hemoglobin exhibit charge differences (positive) at the acidic pH of the mobile phase, and thus can be separated on a support that is negatively charged (cation exchange). The use of ion-exchange chromatography then allows molecules to be separated based upon their charge. Separation is optimized to eliminate interferences from hemoglobin variants (HbS and HbC), labile A1c, hemoglobin F and carbamylated hemoglobin.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The first precision study was performed at Bio-Rad on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program using EDTA whole blood patient samples tested with normal and diabetic hemoglobin A1c content. The method of precision analysis was performed using a protocol based on CLSI Evaluation Protocol, Vol.24, No. 25, EP5-A2 (2004) “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices”. In this study, 40 runs (2 per day) were performed on one VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System over 20 working days. In each run, one aliquot of normal HbA1c and diabetic HbA1c patient samples, controls and four (4) patient samples used as filler to reproduce normal run

conditions were each analyzed in duplicate. The position of the precision specimens in each run was randomized.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To demonstrate the linearity of the HbA1c measurement on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program throughout the reportable range, low $( 4 . 1 \% )$ and high $( 1 7 . 6 \% )$ , EDTA whole blood patient samples were assessed following CLSI EP6-A guideline “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach”. The diabetic specimen was mixed with the normal specimen in varying ratios (i.e.3:1, 1:1 and 1:3) and the measured values were compared to the theoretical values based upon the dilution factor. Polynomial regression analysis (for first, second, and third order polynomials) was performed to determine the statistical significance of the non-linearity. These mixed samples were analyzed in duplicate on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program using the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System with Sysmex HST-N conveyor. Linear regression analysis calculated a slope of 1.0039, an intercept of 0.0541, and a correlation coefficient of 0.9996. The measured results for each dilution were within $\pm 1 . 0 \%$ of the predicted values.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrators were previously cleared under k040872.

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range is 4.1 to $1 7 . 6 \%$ HbA1c (see linearity section above)

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interfering substance studies performed included labile A1c, carbamylated hemoglobin and hemoglobin F. Studies such as bilirubin, lipemia and hemoglobin S and C were filed with the VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin A1c Program k040872. These studies were not repeated because the reagents are the same.

Labile A1c concentrations up to $4 . 7 \%$ in non-diabetic patients $( 4 . 2 7 - 6 . 0 \%$ HbA1c) and up to $6 . 4 \%$ in diabetic patients do not interfere with the assay.

Hemoglobin F concentrations up to $5 \%$ do not interfere with the assay.

Carbamylated hemoglobin concentrations up to $3 . 1 \%$ in non-diabetic patients (4.27- $6 . 0 7 \%$ HbA1c) and up to $5 . 5 \%$ in diabetic patients do not interfere with the assay.

To test the level of interference of carbamylated hemoglobin on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program, patient EDTA whole blood specimen pools with normal and diabetic levels of A1c were split into two aliquots. The Red Blood Cells (RBCs) of both aliquots were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). One aliquot of each level was incubated with a $0 . 0 5 { \mathrm { M } }$ potassium cyanate solution until the carbamylated hemoglobin level increased by approximately 1, 2, and $3 \%$ . Aliquots from each level were analyzed in duplicate on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program on one VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System with Sysmex HST-N converyor. The specification for interference states that the difference between a normal control (without spiked CHb) and a normal test sample (with spiked CHb) with up to $1 . 5 \%$ CHb is not greater than $^ +$ $0 . 3 \%$ HbA1c and the difference between a diabetic control (without spiked CHb) and a diabetic test sample (with spiked CHb) with up to $1 . 5 \%$ CHb is no greater than $+ 0 . 5 \%$ HbA1c. Carbamylated hemoglobin concentrations up to $3 . 1 \%$ in non-diabetic patients $( 4 . 2 7 - 6 . 0 7 \%$ HbA1c) and up to $5 . 5 \%$ in diabetic patients did not interfere with the assay.

To determine if HbF interferes with HbA1c quantitation on the VARIANT IITURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program, two pooled EDTA whole blood patient samples representing normal and diabetic HbA1c levels were split into two aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with approximately 3, 5, 10 and $1 5 \%$ purified HbF. The samples were run on a VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System with Sysmex HST-N conveyor. The difference in $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ value between a normal control (without spiked HbF) and a normal test sample (with spiked HbF) had to be $< 0 . 3 \%$ to be defined as showing no interference. The difference in $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ value between the diabetic control (without spiked HbF) and diabetic test sample (with spiked HbF) had to be $<$ $0 . 5 \%$ to be defined as showing no interference. The results indicated that HbF levels up to $5 \%$ have no significant effect on HbA1c determination.

To study the interference from labile A1c on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program, two EDTA whole blood patients samples representing normal and diabetic A1c levels were split into aliquots. These aliquots were supplemented by the addition of an aqueous glucose stock solution. The samples were incubated for three hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to facilitate formation of labile A1c. The samples were then run on a VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System with Sysmex HST-N conveyor, and the samples that were closest to 1, 2, and $3 \%$ labile A1c were selected. The specification for no interference is that the difference in HbA1c value between a control and test sample with up to $3 \%$ labile A1c is no greater than $+ 0 . 3 \%$ HbA1c. The results indicate that the difference in HbA1c was $0 . 2 \%$ between spiked samples and the control for the normal sample. There was no difference between spiked samples and the control sample for the diabetic sample. Labile A1c concentrations up to $4 . 7 \%$ in non-diabetic patients $( 4 . 2 7 -$ $6 . 0 7 \%$ HbA1c) and up to $6 . 4 \%$ in diabetic patients do not interfere with the assay.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

To demonstrate accuracy across the measuring range of 4.1 to $1 7 . 6 \%$ A1c, the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program was compared to the predicate VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin A1c Program. 22 EDTA whole blood patient samples and 29 spiked EDTA whole blood samples were run in singlicate on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program and the VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin A1c Program. The range of samples run on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program was 3.9 to $1 7 . 3 \ \% \mathrm { A l c }$ . A linear regression analysis of the results calculated a slope of 0.961, an intercept of 0.303, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999.

A second study performed at a current customer site evaluated the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program compared to the VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin A1c Program. A comparison of 180 EDTA whole blood patient samples with values distributed from 4.2 to $1 4 . 0 \%$ HbA1c were run in singlicate on both systems. A linear regression analysis of these results calculated a slope of 0.983, an intercept of 0.225, and a correlation coefficient of 0.998.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Hemoglobin A1c Expected Value Range was determined from literature (American Diabetes Association. Standards of Medical Care for Patients with Diabetes Mellitus. Diabetes Care 2001, 24 (Suppl. 1), 33-43). Hemoglobin A1c $>$ $8 \%$ Action is suggested. Hemoglobin A1c $< 7 \%$ is the goal. Hemoglobin A1c $<$ $6 \%$ is non-diabetic level.

# N. Instrument Name:

VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System in combination with an automated transport system, such as the Sysmex HST-N System, can run a closed tube in different modes. It can run a STAT sample, batch of samples or continuous feed of samples

# 2. Software:

The VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System incorporates a dedicated software package, called CDM 4.1, of instrument control, data control, results analysis, calibration, quality control and service software. Software documentation has been included in this submission for CDM 4.1

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X____ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Samples are identified on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System by barcodes on each primary sample tube, corresponding to the sample's accession identification. Non-patient samples (microvials with controls, calibrators, primer, etc) have specific barcodes that indicate sample type (e.g. Cal 1 for Calibrator 1).

As a rack moves toward the VARIANT II TURBO Link VSS (VARIANT

Sampling Station), the barcode reader attempts to read the tube barcode. If the barcode is successfully read, and there is an A1c order for the sample, then the barcode, rack, and rack position are provided to the VARIANT II TURBO Link VSS. The VARIANT II TURBO Link VSS provides this information to the CDM 4.1 software, which inserts the information into a Worklist of samples and links the results to this particular identifiier.

If the barcode is missing or cannot be read, the sample can either be skipped (assume an A1c order is absent) or processed (assume an A1c order is present). If the sample is processed, then a sequential ERR barcode number is generated, along with the rack and rack position for the sample. It is then handled by the VSS and CDM as noted above.

# 4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The Instructions for Use for the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program instruct the user that there is no sample preparation necessary, except for abnormal size tubes. The Primary sample tubes (EDTA whole blood) are loaded into the Sysmex HST-N sample racks and placed on the Sysmex HST-N transport line. For sample identification, it is necessary to use adapters (provided by BioRad) when processing microvials for use of prediluted samples. Microvials with pierceable caps are used to prevent spillage.

5. Calibration:

Calibration is performed at regular intervals. For each VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program, Bio-Rad provides calibrator sets of known analyte concentrations. New analytical or guard cartridges require two levels of calibration before patients or controls can be processed to provide concentrations of percent hemoglobin A1c.

# 6. Quality Control:

External Quality Control materials must be purchased separately. In keeping with good laboratory practice, diabetic and non-diabetic control specimens should be included in each run. A repeat run is indicated when expected control values are not obtained.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
