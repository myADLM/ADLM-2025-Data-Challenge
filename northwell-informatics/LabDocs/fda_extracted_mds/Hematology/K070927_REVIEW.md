# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A

# L. Test Principle:

The assay is based on the decrease of the transmitted light caused by the aggregates which form when a patient plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with latex particles coated with monoclonal antibody. The degree of agglutination is directly

proportional to the concentration of D-Dimer in the sample.

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

HemosIL D-Dimer HS was used in a multi-center management study involving 668 samples from patients admitted consecutively to the emergency unit with suspected DVT or PE. 307 patients were suspected of DVT and 361 patients were suspected of PE.

The Wells model was used to assess PTP (pre-test probability) score. The patients were classified as having a high, moderate, or low probability of DVT or PE.

Patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a low PTP score underwent no further diagnostic testing and were followed-up after 3 months for development of DVT or PE.   
For patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a moderate PTP, it was the physician’s decision whether to follow-up after 3 months or to undergo imaging techniques. Data indicated that all patients with a negative D-Dimer test and a moderate PTP received either 3 months of follow-up, or imaging with 3 months of follow-up if the imaging result was negative.   
Patients with a positive D-Dimer test result or a high PTP score were imaged.   
As of the 3 month follow-up, none of the patients that were negative through D-Dimer testing had developed DVT or PE.

Previously established clinical cutoff of $2 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for HemosIL D-Dimer HS (K050544) was used for calculation. Statistical evaluation of the respective data sets from the four sites was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to verify whether the three PE sites could be pooled and the three DVT sites could be pooled. The result was within acceptable limit $\mathrm { ( p { > } 0 . 0 5 ) }$ .

DVT samples: Of the 307 total DVT suspected patients (179 females, 128 males). The overall prevalence of DVT in the total population of samples was $2 0 . 2 \%$ (62/307).   
PE samples: Of 361 total PE suspected patients (204 females, 157 males). The overall prevalence of PE in the total population of samples was $1 6 . 1 \%$ (58/361).

The sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) of HemosIL D-Dimer HS for DVT and PE is summarized below with the corresponding $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI):
