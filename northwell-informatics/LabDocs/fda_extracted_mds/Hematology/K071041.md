# Device Name

Proprietary name: CoaguChek $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XS Plus System

Common name: Prothrombin time test

Classification name: Prothrombin time test

# Device Description

The CoaguChek XS Plus system is a portable coagulation monitoring system to monitor prothrombin time (PT) in patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy. The system uses the amperometric detection of thrombin in the blood sample. A test strip is used to determine a PT value from $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { u L } }$ of whole blood. Onboard quality control is available on every test strip and the system also features an optional external quality control material (CoaguChek XS PT Control).

# Intended use

Intended for use by professional healthcare providers for quantitative prothrombin time testing for the monitoring of warfarin therapy. The system uses fresh capillary or non-anticoagulated venous whole blood.

# Predicate Device

The Roche Diagnostics CoaguChek XS Plus System is substantially equivalent to to the previously cleared CoaguChek XS System (K060978).

Re: k071041 Trade/Device Name: CoaguChek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ XS Plus System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.7750 Regulation Name: Prothrombin time test Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: GJS Dated: April 11, 2007 Received: April 12, 2007

Dear Dr. Bush:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150, or at its Internet address
