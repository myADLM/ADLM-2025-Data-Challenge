# L. Test Principle:

The Tosoh G8 Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC–723G8 uses a cation exchange column and separates the usual hemoglobin components in the blood into six fractions, A1a, A1b, F, L-A1c, SA1c and A0. The separation is done by eluting the hemoglobins from the column with a gradient of three elution buffers containing different salt concentrations.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run precision was evaluated at two sites, one instrument per site. Each site was provided with the same sample set. The first study consisted of two levels of controls and three patient whole blood samples in the normal, high and very high %HbA1c range. Patient samples are EDTA human whole blood. The estimates of imprecision obtained from the analysis are given in the table below.

Between-run precision was evaluated on five samples and two controls at two sites, one instrument per site. In the first study two controls and three whole blood samples, representing both normal and abnormal levels of $\% _ { \mathrm { { H b A l c } } }$ were analyzed on 20 non-consecutive days. Each site was provided with the same sample set and directed to perform one sample per day on one instrument. The estimates of imprecision obtained from the analysis are given in the table below.

The second study at a different site consisted of diluted whole blood patient samples at low, and high $\% _ { \mathrm { { H b A l c } } }$ values analyzed on 20 non-consecutive days. The estimates of imprecision obtained from the analysis are given in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity across the reportable range was performed using whole blood samples collected in EDTA with low $( 2 . 2 \% )$ HbA1c and high $( 1 6 . 9 \% )$ HbA1c levels. The observed values of the neat specimens were verified by HPLC. The theoretical value was calculated based upon mixing two samples at differing ratios and dividing by the dilution factor. The diluted samples were run in triplicate on the G8 Analyzer. The observed values were all within $10 0 \pm 5 \%$ of the theoretical values. The results of the study are below.

A second linearity study was performed using four levels of commercially available linearity material tested in triplicate. The assigned values were compared to the mean of the observed values. The observed values were within $\pm 5 \%$ of the expected values for all samples tested. The results submitted demonstrated linearity across the claimed reportable range of 4.0 to $1 6 . 9 \%$ A1c.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Hemoglobin A1c reference materials were obtained from the Reference Material Institute for Clinical Chemistry Standards, Japan. The reference materials and calibrators were run on multiple G8 analyzers and other predicate Tosoh analyzers to assign Japanese Diabetic Society (JDS) A1c values to the calibrators. The JDS values are aligned to IFCC A1c values and NGSP A1c values according to an IFCCJDS publication and the IFCC-NGSP Master Equation.

Real time stability and accelerated stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support stability of the Calibrators for two years at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range is 4.0 to $1 6 . 9 \%$ HbA1c. See the linearity study above for data on recovery of samples across the measuring range.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Several interfering substance studies were performed which included Labile A1c, carbamylated A1c, icterus, lipemia, acetaldehyde, acetylsalicylic acid and EDTA. Whole blood pooled samples with normal and diabetic levels of HbA1c were initially analyzed without the spiked material. Then each sample was spiked with glucose, bilirubin, triglycerides, sodium cyanate, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaldehyde and EDTA to determine interference. The specification for interference was variance in the HbA1c value greater than the assigned value x $1 . 0 0 \pm 0 . 0 5$ . No interference was seen from labile A1c up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , icterus up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , lipemia up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , carbamylated A1c up to $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , acetaldehyde up to $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , acetylsalicylic acid up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and EDTA up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

A hemoglobin $\left( \mathrm { H b } \right)$ variant interference study was performed using a high HbF human whole blood sample and commercially available controls for HbAE, HbAD, HbAS and HbAc. Two pooled whole blood patient samples representing normal and abnormal HbA1c levels were used. A dilution series of each variant Hb was prepared with the patient samples and measured on the Tosoh G8 Analyzer. The acceptance criteria were that a variant Hb is considered to interfere with the G8 Analyzer when the variance percent $( \% )$ or recovery percent $( \% )$ is greater than $10 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ . The results of this study show that HbAE was not distinguished from the other peaks and therefore does interfere with sA1c measurement. No interference was observed for HbF up to a concentration of $10 \%$ . No interference was observed for HbAD, HbAS and HbAC up to a concentration of $30 \%$ . Hemoglobins AD, AS, and AC elute after the A0 peak and are subtracted when calculating sA1c.
