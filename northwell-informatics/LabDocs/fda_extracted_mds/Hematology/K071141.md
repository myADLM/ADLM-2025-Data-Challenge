2.0 Device Name and Classification a) BD ™Tritest CD3/CD4/CD45 with Trucount Absolute count Tubes b) 864.5220 Automated differential cell counter, GKZ class II

3.0 Intended Use

The BD TriTEST ™ CD3FITC/CD4PE/CD45 PerCP reagent is a threecolor, direct immunofluorescence reagent for identifying and enumerating percentages of T lymphocytes $( \mathsf { C D 3 + } )$ and Thelper/inducer $( \mathsf { C D 3 + C D 4 + } )$ cells in erythrocyte-lysed whole blood (LWB). When used with TruCounT ™ Absolute Count Tubes, the product produces absolute counts in $\mathsf { c e l l s } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ .

4.0 Basic description of the device

The BD TriTEST ™ CD3FITC/CD4PE/CD45 PerCP reagent is a threecolor, direct immunofluorescence reagent for identifying and enumerating percentages of T lymphocytes $( \cos 3 + )$ and Thelper/inducer $\scriptstyle \left( \mathbf { C D 3 + C D 4 + } \right)$ cells in erythrocyte-lysed whole blood (LWB). When used with TruCounT ™ Absolute Count Tubes, the product produces absolute counts in $c e l l s / \mu L$ . If used with Becton

Dickinson flow cytometers, the product can eused with MultiET™ software for analysis as an accessory, or customers may perform analysis using CELLQuest ™, CELLQuest Pro™ or LYSYS™ I software.

The reagent vials and counting bead vials are packaged separately. Each vial of this reagent yields 50 tests. Each package of counting bead tubes yields 50 tests.

# 5.0 Predicate Device

The BD™MTritest CD3/CD4/CD45 with Trucount Absolute Count Tubes currently in distribution was originally cleared by CDRH in 1997 under the 510(k) number of K965053.

# 6.0 Comparison to the Predicate(s)

The modifications to the legally marketed device (BD ™MTritest CD3/CD4/CD45 with Trucount Absolute Count Tubes) intends to extend the sample stability claim for EDTA from 48 to 72 hours

The Intended use and the indications of the modified device, as described in its labeling are the same as the intended use and indications for the original predicate device.

# 7.0 Summary of Performance Data

Performance data from validation testing supports equivalency.

This Summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of compliance with SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

Re: k071141 Trade/Device Name: BD Tritest CD3/CD4/CD5 with BD Trucount Absolute Count tubes Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.5220 Regulation Name: Automated differential cell counter Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: GKZ Dated: April 20, 2007 Received: April 24, 2007

Dear Mr. Nakajima:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will alow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
