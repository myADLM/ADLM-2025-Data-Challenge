# L. Test Principle:

The HemoCue WBC System consists of the HemoCue WBC Analyzer together with specially designed microcuvettes, HemoCue WBC Microcuvettes. The microcuvette (single-use only) serves both as a sample container and a reaction chamber. A blood sample of approximately $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ is drawn into the cavity by capillary action. A hemolysing agent lyses the red cells in the microcuvette and a staining agent colors the white blood cells. An image is taken of the stained white blood cells and the number of cells is counted by image analysis. The result is presented within 3 minutes on the analyzer’s display.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-Run and Total precision was determined using four HemoCue WBC Microcuvette batches and five HemoCue Analyzers. Commercially available controls at three different levels were used. The WBC count concentration was measured in duplicate twice a day, during 20 consecutive days. Additionally, a study was performed using fresh blood samples. The study was performed on venous whole blood samples run in duplicate. The results are as follows:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Nine different WBC levels were prepared from a whole blood sample and a buffy coat. All levels were analyzed with five replicates on five HemoCue WBC systems. The evaluation of seven levels determined that the HemoCue WBC system is linear between $0 . 3 - 3 0 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$ $( = 0 . 3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Microcuvette Stability (Open Vial): Stability testing was performed using whole blood samples with a WBC concentration of $4 { \cdot } 1 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 9 / \mathrm { L }$ on three batches. The vials were opened ten times during the testing period. Four microcuvettes per storage condition were taken out and analyzed on three different analyzers. The open vial stability has been verified for three months when stored at $1 5 - 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 5 9 { - } 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ , $- 9 0 \%$ condensing humidity.

Whole Blood: Stability testing was performed on six different venous blood samples with low $( 3 { - } 4 \mathrm { x } ~ 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ ), normal $( 5 { - } 1 0 \mathrm { \dot { x } } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ ) and high WBC levels $( > 1 3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ ). The samples were analyzed initially, after 24 hours and after 48 hours. The samples were stored in room temperature and refrigerator, respectively. The results confirmed that specimens are stable 48 hours, both in refrigerator and room temperature.

d. Detection limit:

Functional Sensitivity (FS) is estimated as the mean concentration for a spiked sample whose CV is $20 \%$ . The FS has been determined to be ${ 0 . 3 } ~ \mathrm { x } { 1 0 } ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

396 venous specimens were analyzed in duplicate at four sites for the HemoCue System and Sysmex 1000i. Total mean difference was $0 . 5 \%$ and the correlation between methods was $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 2$ .

111 venous specimens were collected from two sites and analyzed on both the HemoCue WBC system and the manual light microscope WBC method. The HemoCue WBC fulfilled the accuracy, precision and outlier acceptance criteria. The correlation was between the methods was $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 2$ .

b. Matrix comparison:

Capillary whole blood was collected in EDTA Microtainer tube from 68 donors. Venous whole blood was collected in EDTA Vacutainer tubes from 28 of the same 68 donors. The capillary whole blood was analyzed in parallel on HemoCue WBC system and Sysmex XS-1000i. The venous whole blood was analyzed in parallel on The HemoCue WBC system and Sysmex XS-1000i. It was concluded that there is no statistical difference between the systems when analyzing venous and capillary samples.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected values stated below are expected normal ranges for WBC count for individuals within each group.

Adults: $4 - 1 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$ Children 1 year: $6 . 0 - 1 6 . 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$ Children 2-6 years: $5 . 0 { - } 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$ Children 6-12 years: $5 . 0 { - } 1 3 . 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$ Infants 1 month: $5 . 0 { - } 1 9 . 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$ Infants 2 months: $5 . 0 { - } 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$ Infants 3-6 months: $6 . 0 { - } 1 8 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L }$

N. Instrument Name: HemoCue WBC Analyzer

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Random access: The microcuvettes serve as sample container and a reaction chamber.

2. Software:

The HemoCue WBC Analyzer performs the WBC count by taking an image of the stained cells, and then counting them using a specially designed algorithm. The results are presented for the user on a display. Additionally, the user may attach a printer. The software application embedded in the analyzer provides the full functionality of the device. This software handles and controls the following: User Interface, Measuring hardware, Measuring algorithm, Communication via a RS232 interface (i.e. printer).

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes _X_ _ or No

3. Specimen Identification: Manual recording of specimen identification is required.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Capillary Blood sampling is performed by a fingertip puncture and applied directly to the HemoCue WBC Microcuvette.

Venous Blood should be sampled at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 5 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } )$ . If refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { \ i } }$ , can be stored for 48 hours) allow to warm to room temperature. Sample tubes should be mixed thoroughly on a mechanical mixer for at least 2 minutes or inverted 8-10 times by hand. A drop of blood should be placed on a hydrophobic plastic or glass slide using a pipette or other suitable transfer device. The HemoCue WBC Microcuvette should be filled in on continuous process from this drop of blood.

# 5. Calibration:

The system was designed and developed to establish agreement with manual light microscopy method for WBC count. The system is factory calibrated and needs no further calibration.

# 6. Quality Control:

The HemoCue WBC Analyzer has an internal quality control, the “self-test.” Every time the analyzer is turned on, it will automatically verify the measurement performance. If additional quality control is required for regulatory reason, it is recommended to contact HemoCue, Inc. or the local distributor for current recommendations of suitable control material.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Interference studies were preformed taking sample abnormalities, drugs, metabolites, sample additives and dietary substances into consideration. A list of substances were tested and found not to interfere. This list is included in the labeling (with highest concentration or percentages tested). Nucleated RBCs was the only condition that may interfere to cause the results to be falsely high.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
