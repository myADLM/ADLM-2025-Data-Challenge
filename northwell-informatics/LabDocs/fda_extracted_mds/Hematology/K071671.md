# 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3): Legally marketed predicate device to which substantial equivalence is claimed:

Predicate Device: Automated Cellular Imaging System ("ACIS") and ACIS HER2 software application

Manufacturer: ChromaVision Medical Systems, Inc.

Predicate Device k#: k032113

# 21 CFR 807.92(a)(4): Description of the device that is the subject of this premarket notification:

System: The ScanScope $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System is an automated digital slide creation, management, viewing and analysis system. The ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System components consist of an automated digital microscope slide scanner, computer, color monitor, keyboard and digital pathology information management software. The system capabilities include digitizing microscope slides at high resolution, storing and managing the resulting digital slide images, retrieving and displaying digital slides, including support for remote access over wide-area networks, providing facilities for annotating digital slides and entering and cditing metadata associated with digital slides, and facilities for image analysis of digital slides. Image analysis capabilities include the ability to detect and quantify characteristics useful to Pathologists, such as detecting and quantifying certain proteins revealed by immunohistochemical stains applied to histology specimens. The remote digital slide viewing capabilities of the system support reading digital slides on a computer monitor, enabling Pathologists to make clinically relevant decisions analogous to thosc they make using a conventional microscope. Specifically, the system supports the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of HER-2/neu (cerbB-2) by manual examination of the digital slide of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue immunohistochemically stained for HER-2 receptors on a computer monitor.

Hardware Operation: The ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XT digital slide scanner creates high resolution, color digital slide images of entire glass slides in a matter of minutes. High numeric aperture $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ or $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ objectives, as found on conventional microscopes, are used to produce high-quality images. The ScanScope XT employs a linear-array scanning technique that generates digital slide images that have no tiling artifacts and that are essentially free from optical aberrations along the scanning axis.

Software Operation:The Spectrum™ software is a full-featured digital pathology information management system. The software runs on a server computer called a Digital Slide Repository (DSR), which stores digital slide images on disk storage such as a RAID array, and which hosts an SQL database that contains digital slide metadata. Spectrum includes a web application and services which encapsulate database and digital slide image access for other computers. The Spectrum server supports the capability of running a variety of digital slide image analysis algorithms on digital slides, and storing the results of analysis into the database. Spectrum also includes support for locally or remotely connected image workstation computers, which run digital slide viewing and analysis software providcd as part of Spectrum.

Overview of System Operation: The laboratory technician or opcrator loads glass microscope slides into a specially designed slide carrier with a capacity of up to 120 slides. The scanning process begins when the operator starts the ScanScope $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ scanner and finishes when the scanner has completed scanning of all loaded slides. As each glass slide is processcd, the system automatically stores individual "striped" images of the tissue contained on the glass slide and integrates the striped images into a single digital slide image, which represents a histological reconstruction of the entire tissue section. After scanning is complcted, thc operator is able to view, interpret and perform certain analytical tests on the digital slides.

# 21 CFR 807.92(a)(5): Intended use and labeled indications for use:

The ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System is an automated digital slide creation, management, viewing and analysis system. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the display, detection, counting and classification of tissues and cells of clinical interest based on particular color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.

The IHC HER2 Manual Read of Digital Slides application is intended for use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of HER-2/neu (cerbB-2) by manual examination of the digital slide of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue immunohistochemically stained for HER-2 receptors on a computer monitor. HER2 results are indicated for use as an aid in the management, prognosis and prediction of therapy outcomcs of breast cancer.

The IHC HER2 Manual Read of Digital Slides application is intended for use as an accessory to the Dako HercepTestTM to aid the pathologist in the detection and semiquantitativc measurement of HER-2/neu (cerbB-2) by manual examination of the digital slide of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue immunohistochemically stained for HER-2 receptors on a computer monitor. When used with the Dako HerccpTcstTM, it is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom HERCEPTIN $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (Trastuzumab) treatment is being considered. Note: The actual correlation of the Dako HercepTestTM to Herceptin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical outcome has not been cstablished.

# 21 CFR 807.92(a)(6): Technological characteristics:

The design, construction, energy source and other characteristics of the ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System candidate device are considered to be substantially equivalent to the relevant featurcs of the predicate device. A summary of the technological characteristics of the ScanScope $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System candidate device in comparison to the predicate device follows:

Method of cell detection. The method of cell detection is by colorimetric pattern recognition by microscopic examination of prepared cells by size, shape, hue and intensity as observed by a computer-automated, microscopic digital slide scanner system and/or by visual observation by a health care professional.

System Components. The system components comprising the ScanScope $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System candidate device are substantially equivalent to those in the predicate devicc; i.c., a computer-automated digital microscope slide scanner, computer, color monitor, and keyboard.

Energy Source. The elcctrical service is 100vAC  240vAC, $5 0 \mathrm { H z } / 6 0 \mathrm { H z }$ 2 amp, which is similar to the predicate device electrical service requirements.

Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The method comparison study was performed to compare the manual examination or rcading" of digital slides on a computer monitor (hereinafter characterized as "reading" of digital slides) to conventional manual microscopic examination of glass slides with respect to the quantification of HER2 expression in breast tissue.

A total of one-hundred and eighty (180) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brcast tissue specimens from two (2) clinical sites were used for this study; eighty (80) specimens f thrscinicale wit npxiately equal distribution  side  he different HER2 scores $( 0 , 1 + , 2 + , 3 + )$ and one-hundred (100) specimens from the second clinical site taken from their clinical operation, representing the typical workflow distribution of cases encountered in a clinical setting. All specimens were immuoitochemically stained using Dako's FDA approved HercptTest (P980018).

Three (3) different Pathologists at cach clinical site performed a blinded manual examination of each glass slide using a conventional light microscope in accordance with the reagcnts' instructions for use. The Pathologists reported the HER2 scores of 0, $1 + _ { _ { \cdot } }$ $2 +$ or $^ { 3 + }$ for cach of the glass slides examined. The glass slides from each of the two clinical sites respectively were scanncd using a different ScanScope $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ scanner instrument. After a wash-out period of over one (1) week and subsequcnt randomization of the slides, the same three (3) Pathologists at each clinical site performed a blinded manual read of each digital slide displayed on a computer monitor using the ScanScope XT System's remote viewing capability. The Pathologists reported a HER2 score of 0, $1 +$ $2 +$ or $^ { 3 + }$ for each of the digital slides corresponding to their respective clinical site.

Statistical analyses are provided for a trichotomous categorization of the HER2 scores combining 0 and $^ { 1 + }$ and leaving $^ { 2 + }$ and $^ { 3 + }$ uncombined. Percentage Agreement (PA) along with an exact $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval (CI) are presented overall for all trichotomous HER2 score categories combined.

# Analytical Performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

This precision study was not done on the manual read of the digital slides but using Aperio's IHC HER2 image analysis algorithm. The image analysis algorithm detects and quantifies the same cell features and uses the same scoring scheme as the pathologists reading IHC HER2 slides and was used to quantify objectively the variability of the digital slides provided by the ScanScope systems.

Eight HER2 slides with two slides per HER2 score 0, $1 + , 2 +$ and $^ { 3 + }$ were sampled from one of the clinical sites to be used in a suite of precision studies. The slides were sampled in sequential order using the rounded avcrage score of the manual microscopy scores provided by the three pathologists.

HER2 scores provided by 3 Pathologists for the sampled slides.

Separate studies were conducted to analyze the system introduced variability separately from the variability introduced by the pathologists. Pathologist precision studies werc only performcd to be able to put the system variability into perspective to the variability introduced by the pathologists.

System precision studies used the same tumor regions for analysis over all runs to climinate the influcnce by the pathologists. Pathologist precision studies used the same digital slides to eliminate the influence of the system.

The precision studies analyzed thc changes in the system response by extending the analysis of the HER2 score to the underlying cumulative percentages of $^ { 3 + }$ , $^ { 2 + }$ and $^ { 1 + }$ cells on which the HER2 score calculations are based. Cumulative percentages of $^ { 3 + }$ , $^ { 2 + }$ and $^ { 1 + }$ cells are defined as the percentages of $^ { 3 + }$ cells, $^ { 3 + }$ and $^ { 2 + }$ cells and $^ { 3 + }$ , $^ { 2 + }$ and $1 +$ cells.

Note that only the acuracy of the HER2 scores was evaluated in the Clinical Comparison to Manual Microscopy.

# Intra-System
