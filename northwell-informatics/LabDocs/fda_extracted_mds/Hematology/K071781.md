GTI-PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (K053559)

IV. Description of Device:

The $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay is an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The PF4 $\mathrm { I g G ^ { T M } }$ ELISA is intended to detect IgG antibodies in human serum that react with Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) when it is complexed to heparin or other polyanionic compounds. The $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ kit contains all of the reagents necessary to perform the assay.

Antibodies that react with PF4 when it is complexed to heparin are found in some patients undergoing heparin therapy. The presence of these antibodies has been shown to be associated with heparin induced thrombocytopenia Type II (Type II HIT). Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse reaction that can occur in patients that are undergoing heparin therapy. HIT occurs in up to $3 \%$ of patients that are receiving heparin and can result from treatment with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). HIT is usually associated with thrombocytopenia and in some cases the more severe complications of arterial or venous thrombosis. The pathophysiology of HIT is linked to the formation of antibodies which are specific for epitopes formed when heparin binds to PF4. These antibodies can subsequently bind to platelets via the FeyRIla receptor resulting in platelet activation.

It has been previously shown that antibodies which bind to PF4/heparin complexes also bind to PF4 when it is complexed with other polyanionic compounds such as polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS). In the $\mathsf { P F 4 ~ I g C ^ { T M } }$ assay, a complex of PF4/PVS, which has been immobilized in the microwells serve as a targct for the binding of antibodies associated with Type II HIT.

In the $\mathsf { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay, patient serum is first diluted (1:4), with the specimen diluent provided in the kit. The diluted sample is then added to microwells to which Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) complexed to polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS) has been immobilized. The sample is then incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .If an antibody which recognizes a site on PF4/PVS complex is present in the patient sample, binding will occur. Following this incubation, a wash step then removes any unbound antibodies. A goat anti-human IgG  alkaline phosphatase conjugate is then added to the wells. The conjugate is incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Following this incubation, a wash step then removes any unbound conjugate. The alkaline phosphate substrate, $\mathfrak { p }$ -nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) is then added to the microwells. After a 30 minute incubation at room temperature $( 2 2 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , the reaction is stopped by addition of the stopping solution (3 M sodium hydroxide). The optical density of the color that develops is measured in a spectrophotometer at 405 or $4 1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ using a reference wavelength of $4 9 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# V. Intended Use

PF4 $\mathrm { I g G ^ { T M } }$ is a qualitative solid phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed to detect antibodies reactive with Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) when it is complexed to polyanionic compounds such as polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS). These antibodies are found in some patients undergoing heparin therapy.

The similarities between these two products can be summarized as follows:

Both $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { r m } }$ and PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ have similar intended uses and the same indications for use   
EPY $\mathrm { P F 4 \ i g G ^ { T M } }$ and PF4 ENHANCED $\cdot ( \widehat { \mathbb { R } } )$ use the same technology (ELISA) and assay steps   
$\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ and PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ have identical reagents with the exception of the conjugate used for antibody detection

The difference between the two products can be summarized as follows:

The PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ kit utilizes a conjugate that detects bound human IgG, IgA, and/or IgM antibodies (goat anti-human $\mathrm { I g } \mathrm { G } { + } \mathrm { A } { + } \mathrm { M }$ conjugated to alkaline phosphatase). The PF4 $\mathrm { I g } \mathrm { G } ^ { \mathbf { r } \mathbf { M } }$ kit utilizes a conjugate that detects bound human IgG (goat anti-human IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase).

# VI. Support of substantial equivalence with performance data:

The details of each of the following studies are covered in Section 7: Performance Data of this 510(k). Only a brief summary of these studies is provided in this section.

# Assay Precision

# Description of Study

Three samples of varying antibody concentrations were prepared by diluting a patient sample (sera) containing a high level of an anti-PF4/heparin antibody into a pool of normal serum containing no PF4/heparin antibody. This sample was diluted to obtain 3 separate samples that had low positive reactivity (approximately $0 . 5 \mathrm { O . D }$ or $0 . 1 0 . 5$ units above the cutoff), medium positive reactivity, and high positive reactivity. In addition to these samples, the positive and negative controls provided in the kit were used for this study. The positive control consists of a human serum containing a PF4/heparin IgG antibody, whereas the negative control consists of a sera sample containing no PF4/heparin antibody.

Each sample or control was tested in duplicate in the $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { \mathrm { T M } } }$ assay in 10 separate assays.

# Results and Analysis

To obtain imprecision of the O.D. values, the data were analyzed by ANOVA according to CLSI Document EP-5A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline. In addition, the reportable result (positive or negative) was analyzed for agreement within and between runs according to CLSI Document

EP 12-A Vol. 22, No 14, User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance;   
Approved Guideline.

The calculations of imprecision for the O.D. values showed that the assay demonstrated $\leq 1 0 \%$ cv total imprecision for samples of all levels of PF4/PVS antibody reactivity. In addition, the correct reportable result was obtained for each result of each assay. There was $100 \%$ agreement between all reportable results (within-run and between-run) for each sample tested.

# Conclusions

The $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay showed acceptable assay imprecision of the O.D. values as well as the reportable results.

# Normal Range and Assay Cutoff

Description of Study:

One hundred and twenty serum samples were obtained from normal healthy individuals and were tested (in duplicate) in the $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ and the PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ assays. The mean of the duplicates was obtained for each sample tested and the results were analyzcd for normality of the distribution of the O.D. values.

Results and Analysis:

The results showed that neither set of data were normally distributed. A nonparamctric analysis was used to determine the normal range for each assay. The normal ranges were calculated to be $0 . 1 4 2 \cdot 0 . 3 5 2$ for PF4 $\mathrm { I g } \mathrm { G } ^ { \mathrm { { T M } } }$ and $0 . 3 3 2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 0 . 4 0 7$ for PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ . The calculations were based on a non-parametric $9 5 \%$ reference interval with a $9 0 \%$ confidence. The cutoff for the assays was then taken to be the upper end of the normal range (0.352 for PF4 $\mathrm { I g } \mathrm { G } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ and 0.407 for PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ). Calculations for the normal range were performed by GTI's Manager of Clinical and Scientific Affairs (Melissa Pressman, Ph.D.), using the Med Calc software program.

# Conclusions:

While statistically different, the upper end of the normal ranges for the PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and the $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { \mathrm { T M } } }$ assays were not significantly different. Therefore, the cutoff of $\ge 0 . 4 0 0$ was confirmed for the PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ assay and established for the $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay.

# Comparison of Methods Study

Accuracy was demonstrated by a study in which $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ was compared to both the PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ assay and the Serotonin Release Assay (SRA). The following provides a

description of the study, the results, and conclusions. This study was conducted as an internal study at GTI.

# Description of Study:

The samples used in the method comparison study consisted of a set of 229 different sera obtained from the BloodCenter of Wisconsin (BCW). Each sample was provided in a single aliquot and was stored frozen at $- 8 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ until the time it was tested. These samples were obtained from patients receiving heparin treatment and were originally tested by the BCW for the presence of PF4/heparin antibodies by the SRA. The SRA is an "in house assay" that detects the presence of antibodies in serum that are capable of activating platelets. The SRA is considered to be the gold standard for testing for antibodies that can cause HIT.

Samples were tested in duplicate in the PF4 $\mathrm { I g G ^ { r m } }$ and PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ assays at GTl. The mean of the O.D. values for each sample was obtained. Results were considered to be positive in the $\mathsf { P F 4 \ l g G ^ { T M } }$ and PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ assays if the mean of the O.D. value was $\ge 0 . 4 0 0$ . Results from the SRA were based on the data provided by the BCW.

# Results and Analysis:

Analysis of the data was performed using 2x2 tables. The $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay results were compared to the PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and the SRA. In addition, the PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ assay results were compared to those of the SRA. The calculations for co-positivity, conegativity, and $\%$ agreement for each comparison are shown in the table below.

# Conclusions:

The $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay showed excellent specificity (co-negativity), and agreement with the predicate device (PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Although the sensitivity (co-positivity) of the PF4 $\mathrm { I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay compared to the predicate device was only $74 \%$ , some of these discordant results could be explained by the fact that some of these samples may contain only IgM and/or IgA antibodies. However, more importantly, the PF4 $\mathrm { l g G ^ { T M } }$ assay showed an improved specificity (co-negativity) over the PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ assay when compared to

# GTI. DIAGNOSTICS

the Serotonin Release Assay (SRA). The SRA is considered to be the gold standard for detection of antibodies that result in HIT.

# Stability

No additional stability studies were conducted on the PF4 $\mathrm { I g G ^ { r m } }$ kit since this kit consists of reagents that are used in other kits manufactured by GTI for which stability has already been demonstrated. All of the components of PF4 $\mathrm { I g } \mathrm { G } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ kit with the exception of the anti-human IgG conjugate are identical to those of the PF4 ENHANCED $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ for which stability of each component has already been established. The anti-human IgG conjugate used in the PF4 $\mathrm { I g G ^ { \mathrm { T M } } }$ kit is used in other GTI kits for which stability has also been established. These kits have previously cleared by FDA (GTI QuikScreen $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ; BK950005 and GTI BScreen $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ; BK 990043). The expiration of the $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ kit is determined by the expiration dating of the component with the least expiration date.

# VIII. Conclusion:

Based on comparison with the predicate device, (PF4 ENHANCED $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ), these data demonstrate that $\mathsf { P F 4 ~ l g C ^ { T M } }$ performs comparable to the predicate device and the $\mathsf { P F 4 \mathrm { ~ I g G ^ { T M } } }$ kit does not present new issues of safety and effectiveness.
