# L. Test Principle:

Heparin induced antibodies are immunoglbulins which are present in the patient’s serum suspected to have a Type II heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Type II HIT is an adverse drug reaction caused by platelet-activating antibodies that are produced as a result of heparin therapy.

Antibodies which bind to PF4/Heparin complexes also bind to PF4 when it is complexed with other polyanionic compounds such as polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS).

In the PF4 IgG™ assay, test serum is diluted 1:50 and is then added to microwells to which platelet Factor 4 (PF4) complexed to polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS) which has been immobilized. The sample is incubated for 30 mins during which any antibodies present in the test serum that recognizes a site on the PF4/PV complex will bind. Following incubation, a wash step removes any unbound antibodies. A goat anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate is then added to the wells. Following incubation, another wash step is performed to remove any unbound conjugate. An alkaline phosphate substrate is added to the microwells, and following incubation, the reaction is stopped and the optical density of the color that develops is measured in a spectrophotometer at 405 or 410 nm using a reference wave length of 490 nm.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three samples were prepared by diluting a sample containing a high antiPF4/heparin antibody. The sample was diluted to obtain 3 separate samples that had a low, medium, and high positive reactivity. These samples along with the positive and negative control provided in the kit, were tested in duplicate in the PF4 $\mathrm { I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay in 10 separate assays.

The data were analyzed by ANOVA according to CLSI Document EP-5A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline. The reportable result (positive or negative) was also analyzed for agreement within and between runs according to CLSI Document EP-12A Vol 22, No 14, User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance; Approved Guideline. There was $100 \%$ agreement between the reportable results within run and between run for each sample tested.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

n/a

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Positive Control is prepared from the serum of individual(s) known to contain an anit-PF4/heparin antibody based on a positive result in the Serotonin Release Assay. Assay OD values should be $\leq 0 . 3 0 0$ .

The Negative Control is prepared form polls of normal human serum. Assay values should be $\ge 1 . 8 0 0$ .

d. Detection limit:

n/a

e. Analytical specificity:

Interferants was spiked into a negative sample that contained no PF4/heparin antibodies, and 3 positive samples that contained varying reactivity (low, medium, and high) of PF4/heparin antibodies. The following concentrations were evaluated: hemoglobin – $- 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , triglycerides $- 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and bilirubin- $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . An equivalent aliquot of the compound used to prepare the interferant was also spiked in to a separate sample and used as the control. Samples containing the interfering substance and the control sample were tested in replicates of 5 in the PF4 $\mathrm { I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay. Results demonstrated no significant difference in the mean value obtained for each of the test spiked samples when compared to the control.

f. Assay cut-off:

Assay cut-off was determined from the normal range study to be $\geq 0 . 4 0 0$

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A two site clinical study was conducted in which the $\mathrm { P F 4 ~ I g G ^ { T M } }$ assay was compared to the predicate (PF4 Enhanced $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ), and the Serotonin Release Assay (SRA). At site 1, $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 2 2 9 )$ ), and tested at GTI. At site 2 $\mathrm { ( n { = } 1 7 1 }$ ). All samples were collected from patients receiving heparin treatment, and frozen until testing. The SRA assay was conducted at the external sites.
