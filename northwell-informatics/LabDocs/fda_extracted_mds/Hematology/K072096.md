# Predicate Device

R&D Systems CBC-5D Hematology Control, (K983032) manufactured by R&D Systems, Inc. 614 McKinley Place N.E., Minneapolis, MN 55413.

# Description of Device

CBC-5D Plus Retics is an in vitro diagnostic control composed of human erythrocytes, simulated leukocytes, and mammalian platelets in a plasma-like fluid with preservatives. It is composed of stable materials that provide a means of monitoring the performance of Coulter® hematology analyzers. It is sampled in the same manner as a patient specimen.

# Intended Use:

The CBC-5D Plus Retics is a control designed tomonitor values on Coulter® hematology analyzers. Refer to assay sheet for specific instrument models.

# Technological Comparison to Predicate

The new device has the same technological characteristics as the legally marketed predicate device. Both products are used to monitor Coulter® hematology instruments. Both are used to perform quality controls assays. The CBC-5D Plus Retics Hematology Control has an additional parameter.

# Summary of Performance Data

Laboratory testing of 3 validation lots has shown the CBC-5D Plus Retics Hematology Control to have substantial equivalence in performance, precision and stability to the predicate device. The CBC-5D Plus Retics Hematology Control passed the acceptance criteria of remaining within the assay range over the life of the product. The CBC-5D Plus Retics Hematology Control has demonstrated precision as indicated by the small standard deviation and $\%$ CV's obtained during laboratory testing. Expiration dating will be established at 105 days (closed vial) and 14 days (open vial) when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \subset$ and handled according to instructions for use.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusion

The data demonstrates that the CBC-5D Plus Retics Hematology Control is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device.

Dear Ms. Ring:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have beenreclassified inaccordance with the provisions of he Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
