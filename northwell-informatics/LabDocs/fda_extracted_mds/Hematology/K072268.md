HC WBC Control is an assayed whole blood control designed to monitor values obtained from analyzers that measure white blood cell counts in whole blood. Refer to the assay table for specific instrument models.

# Technological Comparison to Predicate

The new device has the same technological characteristics as the legally marketed predicate device. Both products are used to monitor values from analyzers that measure white blood cll counts in whole blood.Both are used to perform quality controls assays. The HC WBC Hematology Control has monitors a single parameter.

# Summary of Performance Data

Laboratory testing of 3 validation lots has shown the HC WBC Hematology Control to have substantial equivalence in performance, precision and stability to the predicate device. The HC WBC Hematology Control passed the acceptance criteria of remaining within the assay range over the stated life of the product. The HC WBC Hematology Control has demonstrated precision as indicated by the standard deviation and $\%$ CV's obtained during laboratory testing.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusion

The data demonstrates that the HC WBC Hematology Control is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device.
