# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

It is established laboratory procedure to use stable controls to monitor the performance of diagnostic tests. This control is composed of stable materials that provide a means of monitoring the performance of hematology blood cell counters. It is sampled in the same manner as a patient specimen.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Two to four runs were completed on two analyzers every fourteen days for all three levels of control (3 lots) for 15 – 18 weeks. The goal was to ensure the reproducibility of the control throughout the shelf life of 105 days. The CV values for all three levels were $< 5 . 5 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Assay value assignment:

Two HemoCue WBC analyzers were used for analyte assignment and stability testing. The target values are chosen to span the expected medically relevant decision points as well as to incorporate user needs. The Low Level means is targeted at $2 . 7 - 3 . 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ , the Normal Level is targeted at $7 . 7 - 8 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ $1 0 ^ { \frac { \pi } { 3 } } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the high level mean is targeted at $2 0 . 0 - 2 \breve { 4 } . 0 \mathrm { \times } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { \mu L }$ . The HC WBC Control Value assignment protocol is based on current R&D assay ranges for the same or similar instrumentation on other R&D products and competitor’s assay ranges for the same instrument.

The number of repetitive runs is determined by a protocol that is based on the reproducibility of that particular analyzer. Samples are analyzed throughout the process for quality control checks. The product is assayed over a two-day period, using two analyzers, two vials, and each sample run in duplicate.

Closed Vial Stability: Three lots of control material (low, normal, high) were stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested at real time points on two instruments. All data points were within the established range and no significant changes in the mean or variability. Expiration dating reflects the validated time period that assures adequate performance throughout shelf life of 105 days.

Open Vial Stability: Three lots of control material (low, normal, high) were tested at the end of their shelf life. The lots were stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . One lot has been evaluated through 14 days. No significant changes in the mean or variability were observed. Two lots, nearing the end of their shelf life, will be validated before release to support the label claim of 14 days.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The target values are chosen to span the expected medically relevant decision points as well as to incorporate user needs. The Low Level means is targeted at $\mathrm { \dot { 2 } } . 7 - 3 . 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ , the Normal Level is targeted at $7 . 7 - 8 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the high level mean is targeted at $2 0 . 0 - 2 4 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { \bar { \mu L } }$ .

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
