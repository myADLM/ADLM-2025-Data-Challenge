# Submission Purpose and History

The Tina-Quant Hemoglobin Alc Gen.2 assay was originally cleared for use as K052464. The purpose of this submission is to modify the device by extending the labeled measuring range for the HbA Ic portion of the %HbAlc measurement in the application for Integra 800 analyzers.

Since the clearance of K052464, a number of changes have taken place to the device, for which an additional filing was not deemed necessary. We hereby provide notification of these changes:

Inclusion of additional anticoagulant type (potassium fluoride/ Na2- EDTA) in the Specimen Collection and Preparation section of the labeling (supported via internally documented data)

# Device Name

Proprictary name: Tina-Quant® Hemoglobin Alc Gen.2 test

Common name: Hemoglobin Alc test

Classification name: Glycosylated hemoglobin assay

# Device Description

With the Tina-Quant Hemoglobin Alc Gen.2 test system, the anticoagulated whole blood specimen is hemolyzed prior to determination of HbAlc by an turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (TINIA). Liberated hemoglobin (Hb) in the hemolyzed sample is converted to a derivative having a characteristic absorption spectrum and measured bichromatically. The instrument calculates the $\%$ HbAlc from the HbA1c/ Hb ratio according to a user selected protocol.

# Intended use

The Tina-Quant Hemoglobin Alc Gen.2 test is in vitro diagnostic reagent system intended for use on the COBAS INTEGRA 800 analyzers for the quantitative determination of percent hemoglobin Alc in hemolysate or whole blood. HbAlc determinations are useful for monitoring of long-term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.

# Predicate Device

We claim substantial equivalence to the Tina-Quant $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Hemoglobin Alc Gen.2 cleared as K052464.

Re: k072714 Trade/Device Name: Tina-Quant $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Hemoglobin Alc Gen.2 Test System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.7470 Regulation Name: Glycosylated hemoglobin assay. Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: LCP Dated: March 19, 2008 Received: March 20, 2008

Dear Dr. Bush:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf k )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
