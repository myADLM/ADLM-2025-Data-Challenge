# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATIONDECISION SUMMARYINSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE

A. 510(k) Number: K072727   
B. Purpose for Submission: Special 510(k) for hardware and software modifications   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: HemoSense, INC   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Prothrombin Time Test   
E. System Descriptions: 1. Device Description:

The INRatio 2 PT Monitoring System consists of a monitor, disposable test strips, user guide, quick reference guide, training video/DVD, and testing supplies.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The INRatio 2 PT Monitoring System performs a modified version of the one-stage prothrombin time test using a recombinant human thromboplastin reagent. The clot formed in the prothrombin time reaction is detected by a change in the electrical impedance of the sample during the coagulation process.

3. Modes of Operation: Manual mode.

4. Specimen Identification: Manual input

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Capillary blood is added directly to the test strip

6. Calibration:

Factory calibration. The monitor performs self-checks at start-up and throughout the testing process.

7. Quality Control: On board bi-level controls

8. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes for this line of product types:

Yes___X_ _ or No_

# F. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section:   
21 CFR 864.7750

2. Classification: Class II

3 Product code: GJS

4. Panel: 81 Hematology

# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

The INRatio 2 PT Monitoring System is used for the quantitative measurement of prothrombin time (PT) in fresh, capillary whole blood. The INRatio 2 PT Monitoring system is intended for use outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people taking warfarin and other oral anticoagulant (blood thinning) therapy who need to monitor the clotting time of their blood. The INRatio 2 PT Monitoring system is not intended to be used for screening purposes.
