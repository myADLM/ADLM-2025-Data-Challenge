# Device Information

Proprietary Name: CSF AUTOMATED CONTROL   
Common Name: Hematology Controls   
Classification 21 CFR 864.8625   
Classification Name: Hematology Quality Control Mixture   
Product Code: JPK   
Device Class: I1   
Panel: Hematology (81)

# Predicate Device

Bayer Diagnostics (now Siemens) ADVIA TESTpoint CSF Controls (K022968)

# Description of Device

CSF AUTOMATED CONTROL is an in vitro diagnostic reagent composed of human erythrocytes and bovine leukocytes suspended in a cerebrospinal like fluid with preservatives. It is an assayed whole blood control designed to monitor values obtained using hematology instruments that measure CSF (cerebral spinal fluid) samples. It is sampled in the same manner as a patient specimen.

# Intended Use:

CSF AUTOMATED CONTROL is an assayed whole blood control designed to monitor values obtained using hematology instruments that measure CSF samples. Refer to the assay table for specific instrument models.

# Technological Comparison to Predicate

The new device has the same technological characteristics and intended use as the legally marketed predicate device. Both products are used to monitor values from analyzers that measure CSF samples. Both are used to perform quality control assays on the same parameters.

# Summary of Performance Data

Laboratory testing of 3 validation lots has shown the CSF AUTOMATED CONTROL to have substantial equivalence in performance, precision and stability to the predicate device. The CSF Automated Hematology Control passed the acceptance criteria of remaining within the assay range over the stated life of the product.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusion

The data demonstrates that the CSF AUTOMATED CONTROL is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device.

Dear Ms. Ring:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class ⅢI (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
