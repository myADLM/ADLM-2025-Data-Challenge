3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A

b. Clinical specificity:

N/A

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Expiration dating is established at 105 days (closed vial) and 14 days (open vial) when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and handled according to instructions for use. Three lots of two levels were tested for open and closed vial testing.

4. Clinical cut-off:

N/A

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The target mean values for manufacturing are initially specified at $3 { - } 7 \ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ for the WBCs $5 { \cdot } 1 5 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ for the RBCs for level 1, and $1 8 0 { - } 2 2 0 \ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ for the WBCs, $10 \%$ Mononuclears, $70 – 9 0 \%$ Polymorphonuclears, ${ \sim } 5 \%$ Monocytes, and $1 8 0 { - } 2 2 0 \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ for the RBCs for level 2. Each different analyzer will have its own protocol to establish ranges.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
