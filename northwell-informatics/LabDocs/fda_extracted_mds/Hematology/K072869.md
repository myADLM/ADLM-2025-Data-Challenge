# 4. Device Description

The PointCare NOW System is a compact bench top immune hematology system that from analysis of a whole blood sample reports the hematology parameters identified within the Intended Use section below. The PointCare NOW System consists of an analysis instrument with an integrated touch screen interface and a commercially available tape roll printer.

The CD4NOW Gold Pack is used within the PointCare NOW System and all assay steps are performed on whole blood with capped bar-coded reagents designed for use on the PointCare NOW System. All assay aspiration, dispensing and mixing steps are automated. The PointCare NOW System reports parameter results on the basis of software analysis of light scatter measurements with the use of non-fluorescent reagents. Automated cell population cluster analysis is performed by the software and results provided with no operator interpretation.

# 5. Intended Use

The PointCare NOW System is an automated hematology system intended for in vitro diagnostic use in performing the direct enumeration of major white blood cell populations, certain T-lymphocyte subsets, and hemoglobin concentration from human whole blood.

Whole blood samples can be analyzed with the PointCare NOW System for the following parameters:

• White Blood Cell Count (Changed principle from FlowCare)   
• Lymphocyte Count (Unchanged from FlowCare)   
• Lymphocyte Percentage (of White Blood Cells) (Unchanged from FlowCare)   
• CD4 T-Lymphocyte Count (Unchanged from FlowCare)   
• CD4 Percentage (of total Lymphocytes) (Unchanged from FlowCare)   
• Monocyte Count (New parameter not on FlowCare)   
• Monocyte Percentage (of White Blood Cells) (New parameter not on FlowCare)   
• Neutrophil Count (New parameter not on FlowCare)   
• Neutrophil Percentage (of White Blood Cells) (New parameter not on FlowCare)   
• Eosinophil Count (New parameter not on FlowCare)   
• Eosinophil Percentage (of White Blood Cells) (New parameter not on FlowCare)   
. Hemoglobin Concentration (New parameter not on FlowCare)

The PointCare NOW System and its methods for immune hematology analysis are intended for in vitro diagnostic use in clinical laboratory settings.

# 6. Technological Characteristics And Substantial Equivalence

The system reports it's parameters on the basis of software analysis of light scatter measurements with the use of non-fluorescent reagents. The PointCare NOW System and predicate devices are all intended for the determination of well-established parameters. All of the devices utilize anticoagulated whole blood as the initial specimen. Additionally, all of the devices employ flow-based technologies.

The PointCare NOW System is a single compact instrument whereas the predicate hematology analyzers and flow cytometers are larger, more complex systems that must be used in conjunction with each other to provide results for the twelve parameters included in this 510(k) Premarket Notification.

# 7. Performance Testing

# Electrical Testing

The PointCare NOW Instrument underwent electrical safety testing and electromagnetic compatibility testing. The instrument was found to be in compliance with applicable requirements of CFR 47 Part 15 Class A, IEC 61000, UL 61010, and EN 61326.

# Nonclinical Testing

A precision study was performed to assess the within-run and total precision of the PointCare NOW System by replicate measurements of control materials for three days. On each day, testing consisted of three separate runs of three replicates each with each level of control material. In addition, another precision study was performed to assess within-day precision using whole blood samples. The samples were analyzed in ten replicates each over the course of one day. Results of these studies demonstrated acceptable precision of the PointCare NOW System.

A linearity study was performed to assess the performance of the PointCare NOW System over a wide range of cell concentrations for the measured parameters. WBC count and Hemoglobin were further evaluated in the low range. The results were tested for linearity and least squares regression analysis was performed. Linearity was demonstrated in all cases.

A carryover study was performed to assess the effect of a whole blood sample on background counts in subsequent analyses for the measured parameters. Negligible carryover was observed.

# Clinical Testing

A multi-site prospective study was conducted at four investigational sites to evaluate the performance of the PointCare NOW System with other commercially available methods. A total of evaluable samples were analyzed across all participating sites. Data analyses were performed for comparison of the PointCare NOW method to the reference methods. The analyses of the pooled data showed comparable means and ranges for the PointCare NOW and reference method parameters.

Dear Mr. Doire:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket
