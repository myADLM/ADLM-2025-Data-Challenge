HemosIL D-Dimer HS

# Device Intended Use:

HemosIL D-Dimer is an automated latex enhanced immunoassay for the quantitative determination of D-Dimer in human citrated plasma on IL Coagulation Systems for use in conjunction with a clinical pretest probability (PTP) assessment model to exclude venous thromboembolism (VTE) in outpatients suspected of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

# Device Description:

The D-Dimer Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of uniform size coated with a monoclonal antibody highly specific for the D-Dimer domain included in fibrin solublc derivatives. When a plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with the Latex Reagent and the Reaction Buffer included in the D-Dimer kit, the coated latex particles agglutinate. The degree of agglutination is directly proportional to the concentration of D-Dimer in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of the transmitted light at 405 nm caused by the aggregates (turbidimetric immunoassay).

# Technological Characteristic Summary:

The HemosIL D-Dimer assay is equivalent to the currently marketed HemosIL D-Dimer assay (K050278), except for the Intended Use. For purposes of the Intended Use expansion, we also claim equivalence to the HemosIL D-Dimer HS assay (K070927).

# Performance Data:

A multi-center management study was performed at four hospitals on patients admitted consecutively to the emergency unit with suspected DVT or PE using representative IL Coagulation Systems: an ACL TOP (632 samples) and an ACL ELITE (629 samples). 302 patients on the ACL TOP and 298 patients on an ACL ELITE were suspected of DVT; 330 patients on the ACL TOP and 331 patients on the ACL ELITE were suspected of PE. As part of the study, patients underwent a PTP (pretest probability) assessment using the Wells model and were classified as having a high, moderate, or low probability of DVT or PE. Patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a low PTP score underwent no further diagnostic testing and were followed-up after 3 months for development of DVT or PE. For patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a moderate PTP, it was the physician's decision whether to follow-up after 3 months or to undergo imaging techniques. Patients with a positive D-Dimer test result or a high PTP score underwent imaging techniques.

There was one case during the study where a patient with a moderate PTP score and a negative D-Dimer test result on the ACL ELITE was confirmed for PE through imaging techniques. This same sample gave a positive D-Dimer test result on the ACL TOP.

The overall prevalence of DVT in the total population of samples was $1 9 . 5 \%$ (59/302) on the ACL TOP and $2 0 . 5 \%$ (61/298) on the ACL ELITE. The overall prevalence of PE in the total population of samples was $1 5 . 2 \%$ (50/330) on the ACL TOP and $1 5 . 1 \%$ (50/331) on the ACL ELITE.

The sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) of HemosIL D-Dimer on the ACI TOP and ACL ELITE for DVT and PE using the previously established clinical cut-off of $2 3 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m I } }$ is summarized below with the corresponding $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI):

Dear Ms. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed

predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your dcvice to procced to the market.

If you dcsire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), pleasc contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450.Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarkct notification" (21CFR Part 807.97).
