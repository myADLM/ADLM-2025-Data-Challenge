# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

It is established laboratory practice to use a stable control to monitor the performance of diagnostic tests. This control is composed of stable material that provides a mean of monitoring the performance of automated, semi-automated and manual hematocrit methods. It is sampled in the same manner as the patient specimen.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Three lots of control material were tested between 31 and 41 times to yield an average of less than $5 \%$ CV.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment: The HCT Hematology Value Assignment protocol is based on current R&D assay ranges for the same or similar instrumentation on other R&D products. One HemataSTAT II, one Microhematocrit Centrifuge, and one Sysmex XE-2100 Automated Hematology Analyzer were used for the value assignment. Means and ranges are chosen at extended stability of the parameter and shifts in instrument calibration. Three lots each of Level I and II were tested by the three methods (with multiple vials and replicate testing) over approximately 4 days. The data was analyzed using linear regression. All CV values were acceptable.

Open vial stability testing was performed using three lots of Level I and Level II controls on one instrument of each method. Each lot was stored at 2- $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ , allowed to warm to room temperature for 15 minutes, analyzed, and returned to $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Data was collected for 6-10 days over the 21 day period. All levels were with in the established range.

Closed vial stability testing was performed on three lots of Level I and Level II (stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { o C } )$ ) and tested at real time points on one instrument of each method. All levels were within the established range. Expiration dating reflects the validated time period that assures adequate device performance throughout shelf life of 75 days.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The target mean values are initially specified at a hematocrit $5 7 - 6 3 \%$ for Level I and $6 6 - 7 4 \%$ for Level 2. Ranges around the mean are set at $\pm 5 \%$ for Level 1 and $\pm 6 \%$ for Level 2. Users are instructed to refer to the assay table in the labeling for specific instrument models ranges. It is recommended for greater sensitivity that each laboratory should establish its own mean and acceptable range.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
