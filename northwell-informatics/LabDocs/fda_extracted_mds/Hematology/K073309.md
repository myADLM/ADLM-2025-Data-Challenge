# Description:

All the reagents, controls and calibrators included in this submission are for use on the ABX PENTRA 400 (K052007), which is a discrete photometric benchtop clinical chemistry analyzer.

The ABX PENTRA HbA1c WB is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of Hemoglobin A1c in human whole blood based on a turbidimetric and colorimetric test. The assay is composed of the following vials:

$1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 3 \mathrm { ~ m l }$ vial (R1) $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 3 \mathrm { ~ m l }$ vial (R2) $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ l ~ l ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ m l ~ }$ vial (R3) $2 \times 2 1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ vials (R4) $1 \ \mathrm { x } \ 2 5 \ \mathrm { m l }$ vial (R5)

Reagent R1 is prepared from substances of animal origin and purified with human material. Reagents R2 and R3 are prepared from substances of animal origin and chemical solutions. R4 and R5 are chemical solutions with additives.

The ABX PENTRA HbA1c Cal is a liquid multi-calibrator prepared from chemical solutions. It is used for the calibration of the HbA1c assays. The assigned values are given in the notice. This calibrator has six levels and is provided in one vial of 8 ml and five vials of $2 \mathrm { m l }$ .

The ABX PENTRA HbA1c Control is a lyophilized assayed control prepared from human whole blood. It has 2 levels (Normal and Pathological) to be used for the quality control of HbAlc assays. The assigned values are given in the enclosed annex. Each level of this calibrator is provided in two vials of $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ . The kit contains also a $2 \mathrm { m l }$ reconstitution buffer vial.

The ABX PENTRA HbA1c WB Hemolysis Reagent is a chemical solution for use in the lysis of red blood cells with the HbA1c HORIBA ABX methods on the ABX Pentra 400 system. It is provided in a $1 1 0 \mathrm { m l }$ vial.

# Intended Use:

ABX Pentra HbA1c WB reagent is intended for use on the ABX PENTRA 400 for the quantitative in-vitro determination of HbA1c using whole blood and hemolysate. The controls, calibrators and additional reagents are intended for use in association with the above reagents.

Re: k073309 Trade/Device Name: HbA1c Reagent on the ABX Pentra Clinical Chemistry Analyzer Regulation Number: 21 CFR $\ S 8 6 4 . 7 4 7 0$ Regulation Name: Glycosylated hemoglobin assay Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: LCP, JIX, JJY Dated: September 30, 2008 Received: October 2, 2008

Dear Mr. Ducamp:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
