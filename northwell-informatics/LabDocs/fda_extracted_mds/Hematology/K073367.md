Device Name:HemosIL Fibrinogen-C

# Regulatory Information:

KQJ System, Fibrinogen Determination 864.7340 Fibrinogen Determination System

Class II

# Predicate Device:

K931721 HemosIL Fibrinogen-C

# Device Intended Use:

HemosIL Fibrinogen-C is intended for the quantitative determination of fibrinogen, based on the Clauss method, in human citrated plasma on IL Coagulation Systems.

# Device Description:

The Fibrinogen-C kit uses an excess of thrombin to convert fibrinogen to fibrin in diluted plasma. At high thrombin and low fibrinogen concentration, the rate of reaction is a function of the fibrinogen concentration.

# Reason for Submission:

The HemosIL Fibrinogen-C test parameters on the ACL TOP are being modified as follows:

Separate low-end and high-end reflex test parameters are being added to expand the linearity claims on the ACL TOP from the current labeled $\mathrm { 8 0 { - } 7 0 0 \ m g / d L }$ to $3 5 { \mathord { - } } 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . • The calibration levels are now prepared by aspirating the calibrator directly from the calibrator vial (direct dilution instead of serial dilution). • The robustness of the assay is increased by optimizing the incubation time and math model.

# Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

The performance of the optimized test parameters for HemosIL Fibrinogen-C on the ACL TOP is substantially equivalent to the performance of the current legally marketed test parameters.

Th ea changes to the instrument system software, intended use, operating principle or labeled performance claims with this submission.

Dear Ms. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
