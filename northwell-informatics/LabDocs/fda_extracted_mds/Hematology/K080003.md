TRADE NAME BinaxNOW® G6PD Test

COMMON NAME   
BinaxNOW® G6PD Test, BinaxNOW® G6PD, Binax NOW® G6PD Test, Binax NOW®   
G6PD, $N O W ^ { \infty }$ G6PD Test, NOW® G6PD

CLASSIFICATION NAME Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (Erythrocytic), Screening (per 21 CFR 864.7360)

PREDICATE DEVICE   
Trinity Biotech Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) Deficiency reagent set, #K933934.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The BinaxNOw® G6PD test device consists of a lateral flow test strip comprised of a white sample pad and a reaction pad, which is located at the top of the strip (2 U.S. patents pending). The reaction pad contains the reagents necessary for the G6PD enzymatic reaction and the subsequent reduction of a nitro blue tetrazolium dye into its concomitant blue formazan product. The resulting color change on the strip indicates enough G6PD activity is present to presume the sample is not deficient.

To perform the test, a whole blood sample is mixed with red blood cell (RBC) lysing reagent in a sample preparation vial and then transferred to the test device sample pad. The lysed blood sample migrates up the test strip, reconstituting reagents in the reaction pad. When the sample front (or liquid migration) covers the entire reaction pad, the device is closed.

Test results are read visually. If no change in the red color of the sample front is observed at the test read time, the sample is presumed to be deficient in G6PD enzyme activity. Samples normal in G6PD activity produce a distinct color change - the red sample color changes to a brown / black color on the upper half of the reaction pad.

# INTENDED USE

The BinaxNOW® G6PD (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) Test is an in vitro enzyme chromatographic test for the qualitative detection of G6PD enzyme activity in human venous whole blood, collected in heparin or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The BinaxNOW® G6PD Test is a visual screening test used for differentiating normal from deficient G6PD activity levels in whole blood and is intended to aid in the identification of people with G6PD deficiency. Samples which generate deficient results should be assayed using a quantitative G6PD test method to verify the deficiency.

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The BinaxNOW® G6PD Test and the predicate Trinity Biotech Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) Deficiency reagent set utilize different technologies. The BinaxNOw® test uses lateral flow, enzyme chromatographic technology, while the Trinity Biotech G-6-PDH Deficiency reagent set is a liquid system fluorescing "spot" assay. Both tests are qualitative tests for the visual determination of G6PD deficiency in whole blood.

# PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

Clinical Sample Performance - BinaxNOW® G6PD Test Method Comparison The performance of the BinaxNow® test was compared to a commercially available quantitative G6PD test in a prospective study conducted in 2007-2008 in the U.S. Both heparinized and EDTA whole blood specimens were collected from 246 subjects and were evaluated on the BinaxNOW® test.

All of the samples that generated a value less than or equal to 2.0 U/gHb on the comparative method generated deficient results on the BinaxNOW G6PD test.

The percent agreement analyses and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for the BinaxNOw G6PD test results for detection of G6PD enzyme activity deficiency, as compared to the comparative method, on both heparinized and EDTA blood samples, is provided below. For both sample types, a comparative method cut-off value of 4.2 U/gHb was used in the analysis. For all results less than or equal to 4.2 U/gHb on the comparative method, a deficient BinaxNOW result was considered a correct result. Likewise, for all comparative method results greater than $4 . 2 ~ \cup / g H b$ , a normal BinaxNOW result was considered a correct result.

<table><tr><td>Comparative Deficient</td><td>Method → Normal</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>190</td></tr></table>

"Deficient result" percent agreement $= 4 8 \ : / 4 9 = 9 8 . 0 \%$ $( { \mathsf { C l } } = 8 9 . 3 - 9 9 . 6 \% )$ "Normal result" percent agreement $\equiv$ 190 / $1 9 4 = 9 7 . 9 \%$ $( { \mathsf C } | = 9 4 . 8 - 9 9 . 2 \% )$ Overall percent agreement $= 2 3 8 / 2 4 3 ^ { \ast } = 9 7 . 9 \%$ $\langle \mathsf { C l } = 9 5 . 3 - 9 9 . 1 \% \big )$ (\* 3 invalid tests)

# $\%$ AGREEMENT WITH EDTA SAMPLES:

<table><tr><td>Comparative Deficient</td><td>Method → Normal</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>191</td></tr></table>

"Deficient result" percent agreement $=$ 49 / $5 0 = 9 8 . 0 \%$ $( { \mathsf { C l } } = 8 9 . 5 - 9 9 . 6 \% )$ "Normal result" percent agreement $\mathbf { \equiv }$ 191 / $1 9 6 = 9 7 . 4 \%$ $\langle \mathsf { C l } = 9 4 . 2 - 9 8 . 9 \% \rangle$ EY Overall percent agreement $= 2 4 0 / 2 4 6 = 9 7 . 6 \%$ $\begin{array} { r } { \langle \mathsf { C l } = 9 4 . 8 - 9 8 . 9 \% , } \end{array}$ .

Additionally, BinaxNow® test results on the heparin samples were the same as the resuits on the EDTA samples for 240 of the 243 subjects, whose samples generated valid results on both sample types, yielding a percent agreement of $9 9 \%$ .

# Interfering Substances

The BinaxNOW® G6PD test was evaluated for possible interference from high levels of endogenous blood components. Whole blood samples were tested that contained bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), triglycerides, total cholesterol, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase, or glucose at concentrations above physiological levels. None of the endogenous blood components affected test performance. The presence of an elevated level of copper sulfate, which is known to inhibit G6PD enzyme activity, was also evaluated and did not affect test performance.

Blood samples with abnormally low and high hematocrit levels $( 1 7 - 1 8 \%$ and $54 - 6 5 \%$ EY respectively) were evaluated, and test performance was affected as described in the Limitations section of the package insert.

# Reproducibility Study - Multiple Operators

A blind study of the BinaxNOw® G6PD Test was conducted at 3 separate sites using panels of blind coded specimens, which included G6PD normal and deficient samples. Participants tested each sample multiple times on 3 different days. There was $9 8 . 4 \%$ (123/125) agreement with expected test results, with no significant differences within run (replicates tested by one operator), between run (3 different days), between sites (3 sites), or between operators (6 operators).

# Precision Study - Single Operator

Blood samples from two individuals were drawn into both EDTA and heparin collection tubes, and all 4 samples were tested in duplicate on the BinaxNOW test on ten successive days by a single operator. The samples collected from one individual were interpreted as normal $100 \%$ of the time. The samples collected from the other individual were interpreted as deficient $100 \%$ of the time.
