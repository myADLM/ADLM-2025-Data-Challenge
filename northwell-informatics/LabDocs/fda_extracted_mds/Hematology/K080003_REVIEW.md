# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The BinaxNOW® G6PD (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) Test is an in vitro enzyme chromatographic test for the qualitative detection of G6PD enzyme activity in human venous whole blood, collected in heparin or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The BinaxNOW® G6PD Test is a visual screening test used for differentiating normal from deficient G6PD activity levels in whole blood and is intended to aid in the identification of people with G6PD deficiency. Samples which generate deficient results should be assayed using a quantitative G6PD test method to verify the deficiency.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A

# L. Test Principle:

The BinaxNOW® G6PD Test uses lateral flow, enzymatic chromatographic technology. It is a qualitative test based on for the visual determination of G6PD in whole blood. The test consists of a test strip comprised of 2 pads: a white sample pad and a reaction pad. The reaction pad contains reagents necessary for the G6PD reaction and the subsequent reduction of a nitro blue tetrazolium dye into its concomitant formazan product. The change of color on the strip indicates the sample is normal in G6PD enzyme activity. The sample is presumed to be deficient if there is no change in color.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

• Inter-assay precision study: One lot of reagent was used in the study to evaluate two different whole blood samples (normal and deficient) collected in heparin and EDTA tubes. Each sample was run in duplicate over 10 days by a single operator. Results generated from both heparin and EDTA samples were correct $100 \%$ of the time. Reproducibility: The study was conducted at 3 sites, two operators at each site over 3 days using a different lot of reagent to evaluate blood samples with varying levels of G6PD activity. 125 test results generated $9 8 . 4 \%$ agreement with expected results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): N/A

d. Detection limit: N/A e. Analytical specificity:

Interference study was conducted using whole blood samples with varying levels of G6PD. The effects on the BinaxNOW® G6PD Test on lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, triglyceride, cholesterol, and copper sulfate at concentrations above normal levels were evaluated. The BinaxNOW® G6PD Test generated expected results. The BinaxNOW® G6PD Test performance was also evaluated on low (17- $1 8 \%$ ), normal $( 3 5 . 4 6 \% )$ , and high $( 5 4 - 6 5 \% )$ hematocrit blood samples with deficient and normal G6PD. Test results demonstrate that abnormally low and high hematocrit levels affect test performance.

f. Assay cut-off: N/A

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

World Health Organization defines severe G6PD deficiency activity is $< 1 0 \%$ of a normal activity level and moderate G6PD deficiency is $10 \mathrm { - } 6 0 \%$ of a normal enzyme activity of the conventional reference range. Binax developed its test such that samples with $< 2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { U / g H b }$ enzyme activity will generate deficient test results, and majority of samples with activity levels between 2 and $4 . 0 \ : \mathrm { U / g H b }$ will generate deficient test results.

The method comparison study includes 246 subjects. Both heparin and EDTA whole blood samples were evaluated on the BinaxNOW® test and compared to a quantitative G6PD test, which spanned the range from $0 . 0 - 1 5 . 1 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { g H b }$ . All of the samples that generated a result $\leq 2 . 0 \mathrm { U / g H b }$ on the comparative method generated deficient results on the BinaxNOW® G6PD test. The comparative method cutoff value of $4 . 2 \ : \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { g H b }$ was used in the percent agreement analysis for both heparin and EDTA samples, the results are as follows:

% Agreement with heparin samples:

- Deficient result: percent agreement $= 4 8 \ : / \ : 4 9 = 9 8 . 0 \%$ $\mathrm { ( C I } = 8 9 . 3 - 9 9 . 6 \% $ - Normal result: percent agreement $= 1 9 0 / 1 9 4 = 9 7 . 9 \%$ $\mathrm { C I } = 9 4 . 8 - 9 9 . 2 \% $ - Overall: percent agreement $= 2 3 8 / 2 4 3 ^ { \ast } = 9 7 . 9 \%$ $\mathrm { ( C I = 9 5 . 3 - 9 9 . 1 \% ) }$ ( $^ * 3$ invalid tests: sample front fails to completely cover the top of the reaction pad)
