nRBC-Chex for ADVIA®   
Assayed Hematology Control   
Nucleated Cell and Red Blood Cell Control (864.8625)

Predicate Device: nRBC-Chex for LH (K060083) Manufactured by Streck

# Description:

nRBC-Chex for ADVIA® is stabilized suspension of human and animal blood, in a solution containing biological salts and anti-microbial preservatives.The product is packaged in plastic vials containing cos  polyy cewps poltylee e  in levels.Level 1 has a low count and Level 2 has a higher count.The vials will be packaged in a two ( oelve ) welled vacu formed clam-shel container with the package insert / assay sheet.h product must be stored at $2 \cdot 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ .

# Intended Use:

nRBC-Chex for ADVIA® is an assayed whole blood control designed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the Siemens HealthcareDiagnostics nc. hematology analyzers in themeasurement  the nucleated red blood cell parameter. Refer to product assay sheet.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

nRBC-Chex for LH and nRBC-Chex for ADVIA® are both multi-parameter hematology control materials. They both contain RBC, WBC, and nRBC components.Unlike the 75 day closed vial stability of nRBCChex for LH, nRBC-Chex for $A D V \mid A ^ { \otimes }$ m he claim   day closed vi stability RBC-Chex f AVIAvaluauc  s e heatology analyzers listed on he products assay and RBC-Chex r  was designed r h Beckman Coulter® LH 750/LH 755.

# Discussion of Tests and Test Results:

For types  stuies were conducted stablish perforanc RBC-Chex ADVIA® Tfou tests conducted were Closed Vial Stability, Open Vial Stability, Run to Run Reproducibility, and Site to S ho -h V substantially equivalent to the predicate product and stable for the shelf life claimed.

# Conclusions Drawn From Tests:

nRBC-Chex for ADVIA® is an effective quality control material for evaluating the accuracy and precision of the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. ADVIA® 2120 in its measurement of the nucleated red blood cell parameter. It meets the claim of a 45 day closed vial, and a 14 day open vial stability and consistent run-to-run performance.Reproducibility studies and Closed Vial Stability results confirm lotto-lot consistency in the manufacture of nRBC-Chex for ADVIA®. Customers can be assured of a reliable quality control material that meets their expectations.

Dear Ms. Johnson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
