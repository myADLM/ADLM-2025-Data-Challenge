Summary Prepared: December 17, 2007

F. Proprietary and Established Name: DIMERTEST

G. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section: 864.7320

2. Classification: Class I1

3. Product code: DAP

4 Panel: Hematology

H. Intended Use:

The DiMERTEST® Latex Assay is intended for the rapid qualitative or semi-quantitative evaluation of circulating derivatives of cross-linked fibrin degradation products (D-dimer) in human plasma.

# I. Device Description:

The DiMERTEST® Latex Kit is a qualitative and semi-quantitative latex agglutination slide test for cross-linked fibrin degradation products in human plasma. The active ingredient in the DIMERTEST® product is the latex reagent. This reagent consists of highly specific D-dimer monoclonal antibodies attached to polystyrene latex particles. When mixed with the latex reagent, the presence of antigen (D-dimer) in a plasma sample results in agglutination of the latex particles which can be seen with the unaided eye. A semi-quantitative estimate of the Ddimer concentration can be made by preparing dilutions of a plasma sample. The concentration is determined according to a titration matrix.

Plasma from normal individuals is not expected to agglutinate DiMERTEST® Latex. Reactive fibrinolysis will be demonstrated by latex agglutination at a plasma concentration of approximately 200 ng/mL D-dimer.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A

L. Test Principle:

The assay is based on a visible agglutination that occurs when a patient plasma containing DDimer is mixed with latex particles coated with monoclonal antibodies.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Intra-assay (within run) reproducibility was determined by testing 10 replicates from three plasma pools that contained D-dimer titers ranging from O to 4. The test results for all ten replicates from each pool had the same values.

Inter-assay (run-to-run) reproducibility was determined by testing 10 plasma pools that had Ddimer titers ranging from 1 to 16. The assay values of the replicates from 10 runs of each plasma pool tested over a 28-day period did not vary by more than 1 titer.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The reportable range for the semi-quantitative assay is 200 to 3,200 ng/mL D-dimer.

c. Traceability, Stability, and Expected Values:

The DIMERTEST® kit contains a positive control and a negative control.

The vial labels contain the expiration dates. Reagents are stored between $\mathsf { \Omega } ^ { \mathsf { o o c } }$ and $8 0 \textcircled { < }$

Normal plasma samples give negative results.

d. Analytical specificity:

The DIMERTEST® reagent showed no assay interference when plasma samples were spiked with interferents at the following concentrations:

Bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL Lipids (triglycerides) 30 mg/dL Hemoglobin 5.0 mg/dL Protein (gamma globulin) 0.06 g/mL

The DIMERTEST® reagents are insensitive to rheumatoid factor.

e. Assay cut-off:

200 ng/mL D-dimer

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method Comparison of the Modified DIMERTEST® Reagent versus the Predicate DIMERTEST® Reagent:

Specificity Comparison

An in-house comparative study of 170 Blood Bank donor plasma samples from ostensibly healthy volunteers was performed. $9 5 . 3 \%$ of the normal results were negative by the modified DIMERTEST® reagent compared to $9 7 . 6 \%$ negative by the predicate DIMERTEST® reagent.

Sensitivity Comparison

145 plasmas from hospital patients who had a high probability of thrombotic conditions were analyzed in an in-house comparative study.

# Clinical Cut-off Change

The new value of the diagnostic cut-off for the modified DIMERTEST® reagent was calculated to be 200 ng/ml D-dimer with the linear curve generated from the ${ \tt N } { = } 1 4 5$ sensitivity study plasma samples. The D-dimer values that were determined with the predicate DIMERTEST® reagent were plotted as the x-axis and the D-dimer values that were determined with the modified DIMERTEST® reagent were plotted as the y-axis. With a slope of 1.19, the new cutoff was calculated to be approximately $20 \%$ less than the predicate DIMERTEST® reagent cut-off of 250 ng/mL D-dimer.

The new cut-off value was validated with an additional 373 patient plasmas that were tested by the modified DIMERTEST® reagent and also tested concurrently by the FDA cleared Dimertest Gold EIA method (K945642).

# N. Conclusion

The modified DIMERTEST® product is substantially equivalent to the predicate DIMERTEST® product based on the comparison summary and the performance characteristics.

Dear Ms. Ayres:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements or annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice reqirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
