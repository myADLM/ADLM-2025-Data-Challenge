# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY

A. 510(k) Number: K080254   
B. Purpose for Submission: Marketing product in the U.S.   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Aperio Technologies, Inc. ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XT System, IHC PR Breast Tissue Manual Read of Digital Slides   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Manual interpretation of digital images for immunohistochemistry Progesterone Receptor (PR) stained slides

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XT System is an automated digital slide creation, management, viewing and analysis system which consists of an automated digital microscope slide scanner, computer, color monitor, keyboard and digital pathology   
information management software and image analysis software. For this particular application slides are scanned and a digital image is generated that the pathologist may use for semi-quantitative assessment of PR   
immunohistochemistry stained histological specimens. This assessment may be performed without use of the image analysis software and the system software makes no independent interpretations of the data.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XT System is intended to provide digital images to the pathologist to supplement the quantitative interpretation of PR immunohistochemistry stained breast cancer specimens. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded breast cancer specimens are stained with the Dako Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor (Clone $\mathrm { P g } \mathrm { P } 6 3 6$ ) and Ventana CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (Clone 16) according to the package inserts. Slides are then scanned and digitized at high resolution using the ScanScope XT digital slide scanner. The pathologist manually reads and interprets the digital image without use of image analysis software. The slide is then interpreted for progesterone receptor status using the percent positivity of tumor nuclei and/or staining intensity according to the laboratory’s established interpretation criteria.

3. Modes of Operation: Computer-assisted interpretation

4. Specimen Identification:

Specimens are identified by slide label (a digital image is taken of the slide label and stored with the digital slide) or by barcode, if provided by the user’s laboratory information system.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Immunohistochemical stained microslides can be loaded in the ScanScope XT manually (one at a time) or automatically. The ScanScope XT can automatically scan 120 slides contained in slide racks.

6. Calibration:

Calibration of the ScanScope XT is an automated process which is re-verified as part of the scanning process for every scanned slide. If the calibration is not within predefined limits, then the user is prevented from scanning the slide and must take steps to assure that the scan is within acceptable limits.

When the user scans a slide, the controller software automatically performs a “prescan”. The prescan is a scan of a small region of the slide which contains clear glass or “white space”. The brightness and color characteristics of the image are used to correct the resulting scanned image. The main functions of the prescan process are to automatically verify that no significant tissue is present, flatten the illumination field, correct the white balance, and measure bulb brightness.

7. Quality Control:

The accuracy of the system depends on the laboratory following the quality control instructions recommended in the labeling of the IHC PR test kits.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

# a. Accuracy:

The substantial equivalence study was based on comparison of manual reads of the digital slide to conventional manual microscopy. Specimen for the study were immunohistochemically stained at the clinical sites using Dako in vitro diagnostic (IVD) FDA cleared Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor (Clone PgR 636) (K020023). All manual scoring was performed in accordance with the reagent vendor’s instructions for use.

Two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) qualified clinical sites participated in the study. Prior to their participation in the study each clinical site obtained exemption status from an Institutional Review Board (IRB).

A total set of 180 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue specimens from both clinical sites were used for the study; 80 slides from the first clinical site and 100 slides from the second clinical site.

The specimens at the first clinical site were selected based on their clinical scores on file to provide an equal distribution of PR slides in the percentage of positive nuclei ranges $0 \%$ , $1 \%$ to $4 \%$ , $5 \%$ to $9 \%$ , $10 \%$ to $49 \%$ , and $50 \%$ to $100 \%$ . The specimens at the second clinical site were routine specimens taken from their clinical operation, representing the true target population of cases in a typical clinical setting.

The study was performed primarily at the participating clinical sites and all parts except the scanning of glass slides were performed at their facilities using their typical workflow. The glass slides were prepared in the sites’ clinical laboratories and read by board certified staff pathologists. For the scanning of glass slides ScanScope XT instruments were operated in a simulated clinical setting at Aperio (designed to be representative of a typical lab environment).

All ScanScope XT instruments used in the study were production units and were delivered, installed, and maintained in accordance with the approved procedures, per Aperio’s QSPs (Quality Systems Procedures), and as described in product documentation and labeling.

At each site, three pathologists performed a blinded read of the glass slides using a microscope and reported the percentage of positive nuclei $[ 0 \% , 1 \% , \dots 1 0 0 \% ]$ and overall average intensity score $[ 0 , 1 + , 2 +$ , or $3 + { \bf \bar { \Phi } }$ ] for each of the slides. The glass slides were scanned at Aperio using a different ScanScope for each site, and after a wash-out period of over one week and randomization of the slides, the same three pathologists remotely viewed and performed a blinded read of the digital slides on a computer monitor and reported the percentage of positive nuclei and overall average intensity score for each of the slides.

Based on the manual microscopy average percentages of positive nuclei from the three pathologists, the glass slides used for the PR study provided the following percentages of positive nuclei distribution.

<table><tr><td>Percentage</td><td>Clinical Site 1</td><td>Clinical Site 2</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>0%</td><td>29</td><td>33</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>[ 1%- 5%)</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>[ 5%-10%)</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>[10%-50%)</td><td>15</td><td>11</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>[50%-100%]</td><td>16</td><td>47</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>80</td><td>100</td><td>180</td></tr></table>

Based on the manual microscopy average intensity scores from the three pathologists, the glass slides used for the PR study provided the following average intensity score distribution.

As it can be seen from the ER and PR percentage of positive nuclei distributions, it was not possible to obtain an equal distribution of the percentage of positive nuclei in the range from $1 \%$ to $10 \%$ . This difficulty was founded in the limited representation of this percentage range in the true target population of cases.

All glass slides were scanned using a different ScanScope XT instrument for each clinical site.

The statistical analyses are presented across all slides for each of the methods: manual microscopy and reading digital slides on a computer monitor, and comparatively between methods for manual microscopy against reading digital slides on a computer monitor.

# Percentage of Positive Nuclei - Progesterone Receptor (PR)

Statistical analyses are provided for each of the three commonly used clinical relevant cut-off thresholds $2 1 \%$ , $5 \%$ , and $10 \%$ that are applied to the percentage of positive nuclei.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

This precision study was not done on the manual read of the digital slides, but using Aperio’s IHC PR image analysis algorithm. The image analysis algorithm detects and quantifies the same cell features and uses the same scoring scheme as the pathologists reading IHC PR slides and was used to quantify objectively the variability of the digital slides provided by the ScanScope systems. The intensity scores are derived by the algorithm from a range of threshold values per category as delineated in the table below. Intensity values are values from 0 to 255 where 0 indicates no intensity and 255 indicates the maximum intensity. The intensity values were used only for the precision studies and are not for clinical use.

10 PR slides with two slides in each of the percentage of positive nuclei ranges: $0 \%$ , $1 \%$ to $4 \%$ , $5 \%$ to $9 \%$ , $10 \%$ to $50 \%$ , and $51 \%$ to $100 \%$ were sampled from site 1 to be used in a suite of precision studies. The slides were sample in sequential order using the rounded average score of the manual microscopy scores provided by the three pathologists.

Separate studies were conducted to analyze the system introduced variability separately from the variability introduced by the pathologists. Pathologist precision studies were only performed to be able to put the system variability into perspective.

System precision studies used the same tumor regions for analysis over all runs to eliminate the influence by the pathologists. Pathologist precision studies used the same digital slides to eliminate the influence of the system.

Aperio’s image analysis algorithm is capable of calculating percentages of positive nuclei smaller than $1 \%$ in which case the algorithm also calculates the average intensity of those nuclei. As a percentage of positive nuclei smaller than $1 \%$ is considered to be completely negative, the intensity scores were corrected to be 0 and intensity values to be $\mathrm { N } / \mathrm { A }$ for all cases where the percentage of positive nuclei was smaller than $1 \%$ .

If using the intensity score alone to determine PR status, the user should be aware that percentages of positive nuclei smaller than $1 \%$ may affect test results.

Intra-System: The slide scores provided by image analysis over 10 consecutive scans were analyzed for all 10 PR slides.

Percentage of Positive Nuclei

The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of $0 . 5 4 \%$ (maximum $1 . 4 7 \%$ ) and average range (maximum – minimum) of $1 . 0 6 \%$ (maximum $4 . 7 8 \%$ ) for the percentage of positive nuclei $[ 0 . 0 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 . 0 \% ]$ across all runs.

Intensity Scores

The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of 0.9 (maximum 1.60) and average range (maximum – minimum) of 2.48 (maximum 4.27) for the intensity values [0-255] across all runs.

Inter-Day/Intra-System: The 10 PR slides were scanned on the same ScanScope system over 20 times on different days.

Percentage of Positive Nuclei

The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of $0 . 5 4 \%$ (maximum $1 . 0 9 \%$ ) and average range (maximum – minimum) of $1 . 5 2 \%$ (maximum $3 . 9 0 \%$ ) for the percentage of positive nuclei $[ 0 . 0 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 . 0 \% ]$ across all runs.

# Intensity Value

The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of 1.44 (maximum 2.43) and average range (maximum – minimum) of 5.29 (maximum 11.39) for the intensity values [0-255] across all runs.

Inter-system: The slide scores provided by image analysis over 10 consecutive scans on three different ScanScope XT instruments were analyzed for all 10 PR slides.

Percentage of Positive Nuclei

Intra-Pathologist: One pathologist read the same 10 PR slides 5 times using manual microscopy and 5 times using a manual read of digital slides on a computer monitor. A wash-out period of over four days was used between the pathologist’s reads.

# Percentage of Positive Nuclei

The manual microscopy results show an overall average standard deviation of $6 . 7 3 \%$ (maximum $1 6 . 7 3 \%$ ) and average range of $9 . 8 \%$ (maximum $40 \%$ ) and the manual read of digital slides results show an overall average standard deviation of $1 1 . 8 1 \%$ (maximum $2 8 . 7 2 \%$ ) and average range of $1 6 . 2 \%$ (maximum $7 5 \%$ ).

# Intensity Scores

The manual microscopy results show 8 outliers out of 50 scores $( 1 6 \% )$ and the manual read of digital slides results show 9 outliers out of 50 scores $( 1 8 \% )$ . Outliers are defined as scores that are different from the median values of the scores provided by the pathologist over 5 runs of the method.

Inter-Pathologists: Three pathologists read the same $1 0 \mathrm { P R }$ slides using manual microscopy and using a manual read of digital slides on a computer monitor (this data was taken from the clinical comparison to manual microscopy study).

# Percentage of Positive Nuclei

The manual microscopy results show an overall average standard deviation of $1 3 . 3 0 \%$ (maximum $3 2 . 1 5 \%$ ) and average range of $1 7 . 2 \%$ (maximum $60 \%$ ) and the manual read of digital slides results show an overall average standard deviation of $1 1 . 3 \%$ (maximum $2 0 . 8 2 \%$ ) and average range of $1 6 . 0 \%$ (maximum $40 \%$ ).

# Intensity Scores

The manual microscopy results show 7 outliers out of 30 scores $( 2 3 \% )$ and the manual read of digital slides results show 7 outliers out of 30 scores $( 2 3 \% )$ . Outliers are defined as scores that are different from the median values of the scores provided by the three pathologists.
