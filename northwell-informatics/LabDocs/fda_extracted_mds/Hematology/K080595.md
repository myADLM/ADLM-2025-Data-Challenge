Device Name CellaVision DM96 with the body fluid application

Classification: 21 CFR 864.5220 and 21 CFR 864.5260 Class I medical devices.

Equivalent Device Identification:

CellaVision AB believes that DM96 with the additional body fluid application is substantially equivalent to the DM96 for peripheral blood regarding technology and function. The additional intended use of body fluid is substantially equivalent to the Romanowsky stain manual light microscopic process for cell classification (21CFR 864.3600 Class I exempted from pre-market notification procedure)

# Device Description:

The CellaVision DM96 with the body fluid application is a laboratory instrument used to perform differential analysis by locating, digitally storing and displaying cells in human body fluid preparations.

The CellaVision DM96 with the body fluid application is a new intended use that follows the same process as the currently cleared DM96 with white blood cell differential, RBC characterization and platelet estimation (K033840).

Intended Use: DM96 is an automated cell-locating device.

The body fluid application is intended for differential count of white blood cells. The system automatically locates and presents images of cells on cytocentrifuged body fluid preparations. The operator identifies and verifies the suggested classification of each cell according to type.

DM96 is intended to be used by skilled operators, trained in the use of the device and in recognition of blood cells

# Summary of Testing:

The CellaVision DM96 was cleared by the FDA in 2004. The intended use has been modified to include presentation of white blood cells on cytocentrifuged body fluid preparations.

Tests on cytocentrifuged body fluid preparations including specimen types such as cerebrospinal fluid, serous fluid and related fluids were conducted and successfully completed.

Tests were also conducted to validate performance including accuracy, precision and celllocation.

# Conclusion:

Based on extensive performance testing including comparison to the predicate devices, it is the conclusion of CellaVision AB that DM96 with the body fluid application is substantially equivalent to devices already on the market (cleared by the 510(k) process) and presents no new concerns about safety and effectiveness.

Dear Ms. Bundy:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
