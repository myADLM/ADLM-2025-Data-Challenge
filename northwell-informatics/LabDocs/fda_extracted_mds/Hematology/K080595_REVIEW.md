A. 510(k) Number: K080595   
B. Purpose for Submission: Expanded intended use   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: CellaVision AB, CellaVision DM 96 with the body fluid application   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: White Blood Cells (differential), RBC characterization and Platelet estimation

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

CellaVision DM96 consist as of a slide feeder unit, an optical unit consisting of a microscope and camera (referred to as a slide scanning unit), a computer system contains the acquisition and classification software CellaVision DM software.

CellaVision DM96 with the body fluid application is substantially equivalent to the DM96 for peripheral blood regarding technology and functionality. The intended use of the body fluid application is substantially equivalent to the Romanowsky stain manual light microscopic method of cell classification.

The body fluid application functionality:

• Presents an image on a screen of every located cell or object Organizes and suggests cell classification (reclassification) for the located blood cells Makes it possible to identify, confirm or modify (reclassification) the suggested classification of the located cells

2. Principles of Operation:

Twelve slides can be loaded into each magazine. The magazine used for the body fluid application is identified through the color and the barcode on it.

The magazines are put onto a conveyer belt and are automatically transported to the slide scanning unit. The analysis process consists of an overview image processing and a cell-location step. The body fluid overview image displays the entire sample area. The overview image can be used to find cells of interest and for getting an overall impression of the sample. The overview image can either have one 10x zoom level or both $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ and $5 0 \mathrm { x }$ zoom levels. The cell-location step uses the optical unit and a camera taking images of the identified images and stores the images of the located cells and the results in a database, and displays the images in an organized manner.

3. Modes of Operation:

The DM96 is an automated cell-locating device. The system also has Remote Review Station capability with network access to the main DM96 device.

4. Specimen Identification: Glass microscope slides are labeled with barcodes. Twelve slides fit into a barcoded labeled magazine.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Body fluid is cytocentrifuged and stained outside the device on standard rectangular glass slides by standardized stained with Romanowsky stain.

6. Calibration: Not applicable.

7. Quality Control:

The system performs self-tests during startup of the software, and at certain points during the operation of the system. Both hardware and software components are tested. The Cell location test is used to verify the slide preparation process and the system hardware. Running the test once or twice a day is a recommended interval at the high-load laboratory.

8. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes for this line of product types:

4. Panel: Hematology (81)

# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

DM96 is an automated cell-locating device.

The body fluid application is intended for differential count of white blood cells. The system automatically locates and presents images of cells on cytocentrifuged body fluid preparations. The operator identifies and verifies the suggested classification of each cell according to type.

DM96 is intended to be used by skilled operators, trained in the use of the device and in recognition of blood cells.

2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Not applicable.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

A mixture of 156 samples (89 CSF and 69 BF) was identified according to EP9A-2 from two sites. All samples were initially analyzed on a cell counter or counted in a hemocytometer to get the leukocyte concentration. From each sample two cytocentrifuged smears were prepared. 200-cell differential counts were performed (400 cells/sample) with both methods and analyzed. The same examiners analyzed the same slides. The accuracy was tested through scatter-plots for each cell class.
