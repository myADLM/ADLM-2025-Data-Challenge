# L. Test Principle:

The single tube assay is performed by staining the specimen with the ready-to-use BD FACSCount CD4 reagents. When whole blood is added to the reagent tube, fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in the reagents bind specifically to white blood cell surface antigens, and a fluorescent nuclear dye binds to the nucleated blood cells. After a fixative solution is added, the sample is run on the instrument. During sample acquisition, the cells are exposed to the laser light, which causes the fluorochromelabeled and fluorescently dyed cells to fluoresce. This fluorescent light provides the information necessary for the instrument to identify and count the CD4 lymphocytes and other (CD4 negative) lymphocytes. With the fluorescent nuclear dye bound to all nucleated blood cells, CD14 and CD15 conjugates in the reagent move granulocytes and monocytes away from the CD4 positive and negative lymphocytes population. The reagent tube also contains a known number of fluorescent reference beads, which are used as a fluorescence and quantitation standard for calculating the absolute count of CD4 positive lymphocytes. A precise volume of whole blood is stained directly in the reagent tube, and the results are provided automatically.

The processed sample is introduced to the FACSCount instrument and transported by the sheath fluid to the flow cell as a narrow sample stream. Therein, the elements of the sample, including cells, beads, and debris, are exposed to a focus laser beam. The exposure causes the sample elements to emit fluorescent light, which is collected and processed by the system.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The design of this study was based on the CLSI Guideline, EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved Guideline. The within-run standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV), and the With-in device

SD and CV of the following measurements were computed for:

CD4 absolute count CD4 percentage

Precision of the CD4 absolute count and CD4 percentage was characterized as follows:

• Three BD FACSCount instruments and three operators were used. BD Multi-Check Control and Multi-Check CD4 Low control were stain in duplicate with BD FACSCount CD4 reagent. Two separate runs per day for a period of 21 days.

Within-device and within-run precision of CD4 absolute counts (cells/ µL)   

<table><tr><td></td><td>Low control CV</td><td>Normal control CV</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(cell/μL)</td><td>(cells/μL) 4.28</td></tr><tr><td>Within device</td><td>4.82</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Within run</td><td>4.04</td><td>3.46</td></tr></table>

BD FACSCount CD4 reagents met acceptance criteria of precision study and demonstrated acceptable precision performance.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

One set with eleven artificially-prepared normal blood specimens with equally spaced $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ T-lymphocyte concentrations was used in the linearity evaluation. The study was designed to cover the entire reportable range of 50 - $5 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The artificially prepared 11 blood samples with different $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ T-lymphocyte concentrations were stained in 3 replicates with FACSCount CD4 reagents and acquired for evaluating assay linearity on three BD FACSCount instruments with BD FACSCount CD4 Clinical software. The linearity range for the FACSCount CD4 reagent was $3 7 { - } 5 8 1 2 \ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ for CD4 absolute count.

Summary of linearity evaluation resulted in linear ranges   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Actual Lower Limit ofLinear Range</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Actual Upper Limit ofLinear Range</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average Coefficient ofDetermination (R²)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CD4 absolutecount</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>37 cells/μl</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5812 cells/μl</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td></tr></table>

Linearity was assessed and observed to be linear within the reportable $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ absolute count range $( 5 0 - 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L ) }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

A study was performed to generate product claim data for stability of whole blood specimens and stained samples. Specimens were collected at the 2 external sites, and specimen that met protocol requirements were included in the analysis. Each sample was collected in duplicates for each time point of T0/T0, T24/T0, T24/T24, T0/T48 and T24/T48. The protocol was established to cover the analytical range. The FACSCount CD4 reagents met the acceptance criteria of Age of Blood and Age of Stain study and demonstrated acceptable performance up to T24/T48. The Age of Blood claim will be 24 hours, and Age of Stain claim will be 48 hours in the product labeling.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: A comparison study was performed at 3 sites to demonstrate an agreement of the test method to the predicate by using a comparative evaluation of the same specimens stained in parallel with the BD FACSCount CD4 Reagents and the predicate. (Using lyse/ no-wash preparation procedure for predicate and nolyse/no-wash procedure for test method, according to each product package insert). Samples were stained within 24 hours of venipuncture and analyzed within 24 hours of staining. System configuration: Test: BD FACSCount Flow Cytometer with BD FACSCount CD4 clinical software v1.0 with BD FACSCount CD4 Reagents, Predicate: BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer with Multiset software with BD TriTEST CD3/CD4/CD45 reagents with Trucount absolute count tubes.
