807.92 (a)(2): Device name- trade name and common name, and classification

Trade name: Avie™M A1C Test System

Common Name: Glycosylated hemoglobin assay

Classification: CFR §21.864.7470

807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate device The AvieTM A1C Test System is substantially equivalent to other A1C test systems, and specifically, the G5 I/II HbA1C Test System (Provalis Diagnostics, Ltd.), most recently cleared under premarket notification K041635 on August 16, 2004.

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The Avie A1C test system is for the quantitative measurement of $\% \Delta 1 \mathrm { { C } }$ in fingerstick whole blood at the point-of-care (Professional or Physician Directed Home Use). The system consists of a small instrument ("Reader), a single-use diluent solution vial, single-use reagent test cartridges, and control levels I and II solutions.

To perform one test, the Reader is turned on by the push of a button on its top surface, and a self-check (optics and software) is performed automatically. If a

malfunction is detected, the Reader displays an error message on the LCD display. When the LCD display denotes "Ready" a test cartridge is inserted into an unambiguous slot in the reader. About four $\mu \mathrm { L }$ of whole blood is delivered into a vial containing wash solution or diluent, via a transfer pipette, and the vial is inverted five times for mixing. At the instruction of the reader (LCD read-out), three drops of blood mixture are applied to a well in the cartridge; the reactions then proceed automatically. There are no further procedural steps, and results in %A1C are displayed on the reader's LCD screen in approximately three minutes. The concentration of A1C is expressed as a percentage of the total hemoglobin as follows: %HBAIC (HBA1C $\div$ TOTAL HB) $\times 1 0 0$

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use

The AvieTM A1c test is a point of care system that quantitatively measures $\% \mathrm { A l C }$ (glycated hemoglobin) in capillary whole blood samples. The test is for Professional and Physician Directed home use to monitor glycemic control in people with diabetes.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Nonclinical Data

Studies were done that evaluated precision, linearity, interference, operational condition limits, and NGSP traceability for the Avie A1C Test System. The Avie A1C Test System demonstrates precision within $5 \% C V$ at each of two levelsnormal and abnormal $\% \mathsf { A l C }$ . The Avie A1C Test System is linear between 5 and $1 4 \% \mathbf { A } 1 \bar { \mathbf { C } }$ . The Avie A1C Test System is insensitive to high physiological levels of triglyceride and bilirubin, high therapeutic levels of various over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, and hemoglobin levels ranging from approximately $9 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ to 20 $\mathrm { g / d L }$ . The system is sensitive to high levels of Metformin and glybenclamide (greater than $0 . 3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $0 . 0 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , respectively), as well as high levels of hemoglobinopathies. The Avie AlC Test System may be operated between temperatures of $1 8 ^ { \circ } C$ to $2 8 ^ { \circ } C$ NGSP issued a certificate of traceability granting manufacturer certification to MEC Dynamics, Corporation.

# 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Clinical Data

Clinical studies were conducted across four sites with approximately 150 subjects.   
Subjects first performed one Avie A1C test on themselves, and this was followed by a second Avie A1C test performed by a health care professional at the site.   
Venous blood was collected and sent to the NGSP laboratory in Columbia, MO.   
The regression statistics from this testing are described below.

P $\mathrm { r o f e s s i o n a l : A v i e } = 0 . 9 5 ~ ( \mathrm { N G S P } ) + 0 . 0 0 4 ~ \mathrm { \bf ~ r } = 0 . 9 4$ Self: Avie $= 0 . 9 9$ (NGSP)+ 0.001 r = 0.94

Clinical sensitivity testing of professional vs. self testing conducted at four sites with 109 subjects within the linearity range combined results were:

$$
\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 8 5 { + } 0 . 0 0 3 ~ \mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 4
$$

The ability of untrained non-laboratory physician office staff was evaluated in an additional clinical sensitivity study conducted at three sites with 42 subjects. Testing comparing at least 2 untrained operators given only documented instructions and one trained operator per site resulted in the following combined values for trained vs. untrained operators:

$$
\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 5 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 8 9 9 ~ \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 = } 0 . 9 5
$$

807.92 (b)(3): Conclusions from Nonclinical and Clinical Testing Nonclinical and clinical testing was performed for the AvieTM A1C Test System. The test system was shown to be safe and effective for its intended use.

A comparison test of the AvieTM A1C Test System to the A1C Now+ was run at one site with 60 subjects with the following results:

A comparison of venous to capillary samples using the AvieTM A1C Test System on 60 subjects results were:

Dear Mr. Mpock:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
