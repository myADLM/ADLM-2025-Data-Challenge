# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Submission of Immunohistochemistry Applications to the FDA; Final L. Test Principle:

Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor α (ERα) antibody, Clone SP1, may be used in the semi-quantitative detection of human estrogen receptor in tissue sections of human breast cancer by immunohistochemistry. The information gained by this assay can aid in assessing the likelihood of response to therapy as well as in the prognosis and management of breast cancer patients. Steroid receptors exhibit a high affinity and specificity for their ligands. The human estrogen receptor (ER) is a dimeric protein of $6 5 \mathrm { k D a }$ located primarily in the nucleus and belongs to a class of trans-acting proteins which stimulate transcription by binding to specific DNA elements, also known as hormone response elements. Through binding estrogen, the ER is induced to stimulate gene transcription, hence is also known as an inducible enhancer factor.

Immunohistochemical staining is performed on routinely processed, paraffinembedded specimens. Immunohistochemistry is a well established, widely accepted laboratory methodology. The assay detects the presence of Estrogen receptor (ER) through first, the binding of an antibody to the ER antigen and second, visualization of the bound primary antibody through a reagent based on dextran technology. This reagent consists of both secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody molecules and horseradish peroxidase molecules linked to a common dextran polymer backbone, thus eliminating the need for sequential application of link antibody and peroxidase conjugate. The enzymatic conversion of the subsequently added chromogen results in formation of a visible reaction product at the antigen site. The specimen is then counterstained and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Serial sections from each of three different formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks of breast carcinoma were collected for testing from the Dako tissue bank. Test slides from the same specimen must not display staining intensity deviation $\mathrm { o f } \pm 0 . 5$ grade for a total of 1 grade variation on a 0-4 scale.

Intra-run Precision: Three slides from each tissue block were stained with Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Human ERα Clone SP1 by three analysts. Concurrently one slide from each block was stained with a negative control reagent.

Inter-run Precision: One slide from each tissue block was stained on two additional days by one analyst. Concurrently, one slide from each tissue block was stained with a negative control reagent.

The precision experiment results met the acceptance criteria described above. Additionally, the estimated percent of tumor cells stained was evaluated and all results were in agreement.

# Reproducibility:

Fifteen breast carcinoma specimens (5 Negative, 1 Low Positive, and 9 Positive) were stained with Dako Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Human ERα, Clone SP1 and scored at 3 sites. Between each site comparison pair, $100 \%$ $9 5 \%$ C.I. $78 . 2 – 1 0 0 \%$ ) overall agreement was obtained.   
$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Positive and negative controls should be performed with each staining run. The pathologist is responsible for assuring that the assay is performing properly.   
d. Detection limit: Not applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: A total of 87 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues covering a wide range of normal human tissue types were tested with the ER antibody. The antibody demonstrated negative immunoreactivity with most tissues. Positive immunoreactivity was noted with some normal tissues which are typically positive, like uterus, ovary and ductal epithelial cells of the breast.   
f. Assay cut-off: A positive staining result is defined as more than $1 \%$ of tumor cells with stained nuclei of any intensity.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Estrogen receptor status was evaluated at two sites on a total of 228 cases using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cases of breast carcinoma. ERα, SP 1 testing was performed with EnVision™ FLEX and scored with positive staining result defined as more than $1 \%$ of tumor cells with stained nuclei of any intensity. ER 1D5/2-123 was performed using the ER/PR pharmDx™ Kit and scored using the Allred scoring guideline. Method comparison data are presented below:

Clone SP1 has been noted in the literature to have a higher sensitivity than Clone 1D5.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology was used to establish clinical performance of Dako Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor $\mathfrak { a }$ (ER α) antibody, Clone SP1. Estrogen receptor status was evaluated in 4,150 breast cancer patient samples on formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue samples with anti-ERα, Clone SP1 and anti-ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , Clone

1D5. The rate of positivity for SP1 was $6 9 . 5 \%$ compared to $6 3 . 1 \%$ for 1D5. For SP1 the weighted estimate for ten-year Breast Cancer Specific Survival (BCSS) for $\geq 1 \%$ nuclear staining in tumor cells is $7 6 . 5 \%$ $9 5 \%$ C.I.: 73.9- $7 9 . 0 \% )$ and for $< 1 \%$ nuclear staining in tumor cells is $65 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ C.I.: $6 2 . 6 8 \%$ ).1

A bridging study was performed to establish that there was no difference between the immunostaining protocol cited in the publication and the protocol used to stain Dako anti-ERα, Clone SP1. Twenty-seven formalin-fixed paraffin embedded breast carcinoma tissue specimens with percent tumor cells stained ranging from $1 \%$ to $100 \%$ were tested with both protocols. Results showed $100 \%$ agreement between the two protocols and the published study can therefore be used to support the clinical performance of the Dako antiERα, Clone SP1 (see below):
