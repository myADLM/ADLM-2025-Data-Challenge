Device Description:</td><td colspan="2">The Sysmex® XS-1000iC is part of the XS-Series instrument line. It is a multi-parameter hematology analyzer intended to perform tests in anti- coagulated blood. The instrument consists of three principal units: (1) Main Unit which aspirates, dilutes, mixes and analyzes blood samples; (2) Auto Loader that supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information Processing Unit) which processes data from the Main Unit and provides the operator interface with the system.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">The XS-Series instruments provide accurate and precise test results for up to 21 analysis parameters in whole blood. These include: WBC White Blood Cell Count RBC Red Blood Cell Count Hemoglobin Hematocrit MCV Mean Cell Volume MCH Mean Cell Hemoglobin MCHC Mean Cell Hemoglobin Concentration Platelet Count MPV Mean Platelet Volume RDW-SD RBC Distribution Width-SD RDW-CV RBC Distribution Width-CV NEUT%/# Neutrophil Percent and Count LYMPH%/# Lymphocyte Percent and Count MONO% /# Monocyte Percent and Count</td></tr></table>

The instrument processes approximately 60 samples per hour, depending on the mode used. The XS display various scattergrams, along with data for the reportable parameters. It displays the following analysis results on the IPU screen: WBC 5DIFF, White blood cells/Basophils, RBC pattern data of cell size distribution curves for platelet and analysis parameters. Analysis results and graphics can be printed on any of the available printers or transmitted to a Host computer. Sample abnormalities are indicated by abnormal marks, flags and error messages which appear on the LCD display screen and on the printout. This is an indication that the sample is not within the acceptable range and requires further review and investigation. There are two discrete testing options---CBC and CBC with Diff.

The XS performs analyses using the following methods: Sheath Flow DC Detection Method, Flow Cytometry Methods using a Semiconductor Laser and SLS-hemoglobin method. Blood cells pass through the aperature of the detector surrounded by sheath fluid using the sheath flow method. The principle of flow cytometry is also used. A semiconductor laser beam is emitted to the blood cells passing through the flow cell. The forward scattered light is received by the photodiode, and the lateral scattered light and lateral fluorescent light are received by the photo multiplier tube. This light is converted tinto electrical pulses, thus making it possible to obtain blood cell information. Hemoglobin is measured with the SLS-hemoglobin method using Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which is an analysis method used in our previous instrumentation.

A modification kit will be installed on a standard XS-1000i instrument where samples $> 4 8$ hours are analyzed. This modification kit includes software and hardware changes and includes a modified reagent, Cellsheath (C). In this modification, the RBC/PLT dilution process will now be diluted using the Cellsheath (C) reagent after being warmed past $\mathsf { 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ Software and hardware modifications include changes to the instrument's tubing and modification of the heating block. This only impacts the RBC/PLT dilution step. The WBC and HGB parameters are not impacted. This modification kit was not a change due to recall or corrective action, labeling change, technology or performance 1
