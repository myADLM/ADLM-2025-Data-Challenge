# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Sysmex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XS-1000iC Analyzer is a quantitative, automated hematology analyzer for in vitro diagnostic use. The instrument analyzes and provides 21 parameters of a blood sample: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PLT, MPV, RDW-SD, RDW-CV, NEUT%, NEUT#, LYMPH%, LYMPH#, $M O N O \%$ , MONO#, $\mathrm { E O \% }$ , EO#, $B A S O \%$ , and BASO#.

The system is comprised of an analyzer and a reagent system. The reagent system consists of diluent, lyse, and stain. The analyzer provides two modes of blood sampling: whole blood and capillary. The XS-1000iC consists of three principle units: (1) Main Unit, which processes, and analyzes blood samples, (2) Auto Loader, which supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically, and (3) Information Processing Unit, which processes data generated from the Main Unit. The analyzer provides two options: CBC and CBC with Differential. Graphic printer and barcode reader are optional.

2. Principles of Operation:

The Sysmex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XS-1000iC Analyzer performs analysis of CBC and 5-part differential using the following methods:

- WBC and differential: flow cytometry method using a semiconductor laser - RBC and platelets: RBC detector using the Hydro Dynamic Focusing method - Hemoglobin: HGB detector based on the Sodium Lauryl Sulfate hemoglobin detection method

3. Modes of Operation: Manual Mode, Capillary Mode, and Sampler Mode.

4. Specimen Identification: Manual or by barcode reader.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

a. Manual Mode and Capillary Mode: whole blood tubes and diluted blood are manually mixed prior to sampling. b. Sampler Mode: whole blood tubes are mixed automatically.

6. Calibration: Manual and automatic calibration using fresh blood.

7. Quality Control: Specified commercial control blood and normal blood sample are used to monitor the performance of the analyzer. The following QC methods are used:

a. Control material: X-bar control and L-J control.

c. Linearity: RBC linearity was evaluated on the XS-1000iC over the range of 0.300 to $7 . 9 1 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ , using 6 levels of dilution of Range Check Linearity Kit. Replicate of three was measured at each level. The results were linear with the slope of 1.000, the intercept of 0.013, and within Allowable Systematic Error of $0 . 3 6 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

d. Carryover: Carryover was evaluated by assaying a sample with a high cell count three consecutive times, followed immediately by testing a low count sample consecutively three times. Zero carryover result was generated for RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT.

e. Interfering Substances: N/A

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

a. Stability: To evaluate the stability of the MCV parameter to 48 hours, 29 samples with normal and abnormal MCV were used. Each sample was split into two aliquots, one was stored at room temperature $( 1 8 ^ { \circ } { - } 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and the other was stored at low temperature $( 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Each aliquot was analyzed at baseline (0 hrs), 24 hrs, and $4 8 \ \mathrm { h r s }$ . Percent deviation from the baseline was used to determine the MCV stability. Data indicated that the MCV parameter was stable up to 48 hours for samples stored at room temperature and $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Manufacturer specification: ${ \leq } 8 \%$ deviation.

b. Reference Intervals: To verify the reference interval, 20 samples were analyzed and compared to the existing reference values, which were established on the XS-1000. Normal samples from this study fell within these established reference ranges. The manufacturer recommends that each

laboratory establishes or verifies its own expected reference intervals.
