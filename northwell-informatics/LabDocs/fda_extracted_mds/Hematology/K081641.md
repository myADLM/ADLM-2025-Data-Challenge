COULTER LIN-X linearity controls are stabilized human blood components whose WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT concentrations span the instrument's reportable range Results from repeated measurements for each concentration are compared to the established expected range to assess the instrument's calibration and verify the reportable range

# 60 Intended Use:

COULTER LIN-X linearity controls are intended to assess calbration and verify the reportable range of COULTER cellular analysis systems listed in the TABLE OF EXPECTED RESULTS in conjunction with specific COULTER reagents Refer to your Product Manuals or On-line Help System

# 70 Comparison to Predicate(s):

COULTER LIN-X linearty controls are essentially identical to the current COULTER LIN-C linearity controls with the exception of an additional level covering an extended cellular component range, the analyzers on which it may be used and an expanded intended use for calibration assessment

# 8 0 Summary of Performance Data:

Stability, calibration assessment, value assignment and range determination studies were conducted and demonstrate acceptable performance per manufacturing specifications The data in the Premarket Notification on safety and effectiveness supports a finding of substantial equrvalence to products already in commercial distribution

This summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requrements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 and the implementing regulation 21 CFR 807 92
