# I. Device Description:

COULTER LIN-X Linearity Control is a reference product prepared from treated, stabilized human erythrocytes in an isotonic medium. LIN-X Linearity Control also contains a stabilized, platelet-sized component, and fixed erythrocytes to simulate leukocytes. The WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT concentrations span the instrument’s reportable range. Results from repeated measurements for each concentration are compared to the established expected range to assess the instrument’s calibration and verify the reportable range.

COULTER LIN-X Linearity Control is a multi-level control product manufactured in vial $( 3 . 3 \mathrm { m l } )$ configurations (levels 0-11).

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

CLIA requires that laboratories establish and verify the performance specification, accuracy, precision and reportable range, of new instrumentation upon installation, following significant preventive maintenance, unusual trends / shifts in control recovery or when recommended by the instrument manufacturer. COULTER LIN-X Linearity controls can be used on calibrated instruments to comply with these guidelines. The product's WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT concentrations span the instrument’s reportable range. Results from repeated measurements for each concentration are compared to the established expected range, to asses the instrument's calibration and to verity the reportable range.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility and precision is captured within the range determination study with data generated from two studies: 1) closed vial stability and 2) open vial stability.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment: Value assignments for each lot are determined on validated systems using Beckman Coulter reagents on appropriate instruments. One hundred ten (110) vials from each lot are taken randomly throughout the production run. For each values assignment process, two assay runs are required on the appropriate instrument on separate days. Four to six sample tubes are analyzed for each assay run. An assay computer system is used to determine the number of replicates required for each assay run and analyze the data in real time. Zero biased, equilibration adjusted data and the raw instrument assay run data is used to determine the final value assignment. The value assignments are confirmed by analyzing one to two tubes for a total of 10 aspirations on the appropriate instrument.

Open vial stability: Open vial testing consists of six aspirations from two vials per level repeated once a month. Multiple lots of the new level of LIN-X Linearity Control (Level 10) were tested monthly. Two vials were evaluated at each time point. For samples analyzed on the LH 750, 1:1 dilutions were prepared at each time point since the Platelet count exceeded the linear range of the instrument. On the LH 750 Hematology Analyzer, a single run was performed on Day 1 to initiate the open vial condition followed by six runs on

Day 7 to validate the open vial claim of seven days. On the DxH 800 Cellular Analysis System, six runs were performed on both Day 1 and Day 7. The mean recovered values were compared to the assay values and expected ranges for the additional level.

Closed vial stability: Closed vial testing consisted of six aspirations taken from one vial per level approximately 3 times per month. Multiple lots of the new level of LIN-X Linearity Control (Level 10) were tested 3 times per month. For samples analyzed on the LH 750, 1:1 dilutions were prepared at each time point since the Platelet count exceeded the linear range of the test instrument. The mean recovered values were compared to the assay values and expected ranges for the additional level.

Calibration Assessment Study: LIN-X linearity controls and CBC-Line linearity controls (predicate) were tested on four instruments to demonstrate that they yield equivalent results for calibration assessment / verification. LIN-X linearity control results were assess against the assay values and expected ranges.
