# 510(K) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS (As required by 21 CFR 807.92)

# Trade Name:

HemoPoint® H2 Hemoglobin Measurement System

Common/Classification Name:

Automated Hemoglobin System

Device Classification:

Class: II CFR: 21 CFR 864.5620 Product Code: GKR

Manufacturer:

Stanbio Laboratory 1261 North Main Street Boerne, Texas 78006

# Device Description / Procedure Principle:

The HemoPoint® H2 Hemoglobin Measurement System is comprised of a HemoPoint® H2 Hemoglobin Photometer and HemoPoint® H2 Cuvettes.

The recognized reference method for tHb determination (tHb total hemoglobin) is the cyanmethemoglobin method, which is also known as the cyanhemoglobin method. The blood sample is diluted 1:251 with a reagent buffering solution. Here the erythrocytes are hemolysed and the bivalent iron in oxy- and desoxyhemoglobin are oxidised by the reagent potassium hexacyanoferrate (il) to trivalent iron and so converted to methemoglobin. Together with cyanide ions, which are also contained in the reagents, the methemoglobin forms a stable, colored complex, namely cyanmethemoglobin. This has a wide absorption maximum at $5 4 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . This absorption is proportional to the tHb concentration.

In 1966, Vanzetti suggested to replace KCN by $N a N _ { 3 }$ and thus was able to reduce the toxicity of the reagent mixture considerably.

Vanzett's method is also known as the azide methemogobin method. A modified azide methemoglobin method is used in the HemoPoint $\textcircled{8}$ H2 system.

In the HemoPoint® H2, however, the use of microcuvettes with short light pathways makes it possible to analyze undiluted blood. The filed cuvette is inserted into the HemoPoint® H2 photometer, the color produced by the chemical reaction in the cuvette is measured, and the Hb level is caiculated and displayed.

In the HemoPoint® H2 photometer the light transmitted through the cuvette sample is measured.

For this purpose, light is directed through the blood sample and the transmission T is measured. From the amount of light absorbed by the sample, the concentration of the hemoglobin in the cuvette can be calculated using Lambert-Beers Law.

Light emitting diodes (LED's) are used as light sources and a photodiode to detect the light. T ligh ittin diodeslizhe cenral wavelengths 0 measuement a $8 8 0 n m$ (for turbidity compensation).

# Intended Use:

The HemoPoint H2 Hemoglobin Measurement System is indicated for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin in arterial, venous, or capillary blood.

The microcuvettes part number 3010-100 are indicated for use in the HemoPoint® H2 Hemoglobin Measurement System and compatible measurement systems. The microcuvettes are intended to be used only once and must be disposed of after use as potentially infectious waste.

Estimation of hematocrit as a function of Hemoglobin is performed for normal hemoglobin ranges only (120 to $1 8 0 g / L$ or 12.0 to $1 8 . 0 ~ { \mathfrak { g } } / { \mathfrak { d } } 1 )$ The estimated hematocrit is not indicative of disease states such as anemia and abnormal values and will not be reported.

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only

Dear Mr. Johnson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Devicc Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
