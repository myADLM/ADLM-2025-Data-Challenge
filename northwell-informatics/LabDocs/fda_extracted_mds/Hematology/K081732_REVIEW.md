4. Special instrument requirements:

INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer and INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Controls are for use on the Dade Behring Coagulation Systems - K970431 and its family member $\mathrm { B C S @ }$ XP

# I. Device Description:

# INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer:

INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Reagent - lyophilized mouse monoclonal antibodies to Ddimer (3 or 6 vials, $4 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial)

INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Buffer - liquid saline buffer (3 or 6 vials, $5 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial)

INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Supplement - liquid saline buffer with heterophilic blocking reagent (3 or 6 vials, $2 . 6 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial)

INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Diluent - liquid saline buffer to dilute samples (3 or 6 vials, $5 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial)

INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Calibrator - lyophilized, single analyte, human plasma based product containing D-dimer preparation (2 vial, $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial)

Empty Vials - 3 vials per INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Reagent, INNOVANCE™ DDimer Buffer, INNOVANCE™ D-dimer Supplement and INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Diluent

Polystyrene particles covalently coated with a monoclonal antibody (8D3) 2 are aggregated when mixed with samples containing D-dimer. The D-dimer cross-linkage region has a stereo symmetrical structure, i.e. the epitope for the monoclonal antibody occurs twice. Consequently, one antibody suffices in order to trigger an aggregation reaction, which is then detected turbidimetrically via the increase in turbidity

# INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Controls

Content: 5 vials each level, two levels, 1mL per vial

INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Controls 1 and 2 are lyophilized, single analyte, human plasma based products containing D-dimer.

# L. Test Principle:

Polystyrene particles covalently coated with a monoclonal antibody (8D3) are aggregated when mixed with samples containing D-dimer. The D-dimer cross-linkage region has a stereosymmetrical structure, i.e., the epitope for the monoclonal antibody occurs twice. Consequently, one antibody suffices in order to trigger an aggregation reaction, which is then detected turbidimetrically via the increase in turbidity.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision testing was conducted by following CLSI EP5-A2.

Testing was performed over 20 days, two separate runs with two test samples for each test material.

One operator, one reagent, and one instrument were used.

$\textrm { n } 8 0$   
Mean $[ \mathrm { m g / L } ] 0 . 2 7 9$   
Median $[ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { L } ]$ 0.280   
Repeatability $[ \% ]$ 4.1 (SD: 0.011)   
Within-day-CV $[ \% ]$ 4.1 (SD: 0.011)   
Between-day-CV $[ \% ]$ 1.2 (SD: 0.003)   
Within-device/lab-CV $[ \% ]$ 4.3 (SD: 0.012)

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity study covered a range of 0.12 to $4 . 4 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU. Linearity testing was performed using a citrated plasma sample spiked with D-Dimer, concentration of $4 . 4 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU that was diluted with INNOVANCE™ DDimer Diluent.

The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP06-A. Based on the results of this testing and that from the Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection Study, the measuring range was established.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The calibrator is traceable to an internal reference standard. A new calibration is required for each new lot of INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer, after major maintenance or service, as indicated by quality control results, as indicated in laboratory quality control procedures, when required by government regulations.

The INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Controls 1 and 2 are single analyte, lyophilized, human plasma based products containing D-dimer. The control is traceable to an in house reference standard. INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Controls must be tested at least every eight hours on each testing day and for each vial of reagent for the respective measurement range to ensure that the system is functioning correctly.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) for INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer was determined to be $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ , respectively.

CLSI EP17-A was followed to establish the Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection.

Four blank samples, four low analyte citrated plasma samples spiked with Ddimer (diluted with INNOVANCE D-Dimer Diluent) and two reagent lots were tested over 4 days.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) for INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer was determined to be $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The Limit of Detection (LoD) L was determined to be 0.05 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Test samples were prepared by spiking the potential interferent into plasma. D-Dimer concentrations ranged from $0 . 4 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ to $0 . 5 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , except for hemoglobin, bilirubin and triglycerides, where D-Dimer concentrations ranged from $0 . 2 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ to $0 . 2 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $2 . 3 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ to $2 . 4 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2 to determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer assay. For all exogenous interferents, hemoglobin, bilirubin and triglycerides the percent bias was determined by testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing to the value obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent had been added.

To evaluate cholesterol, the endogenous concentration of the base pool was determined and additional cholesterol was spiked to the test concentration. The percent bias was determined by testing a normal control sample and comparing the value obtained from the test pool to which the cholesterol had been added.

To evaluate creatine, albumin, fibrinogen, Immunoglobulin G, urea, uric acid the endogenous concentration of the base pool and test pool were not determined. The test concentration was spiked into the test pool without taking the endogenous concentration into account. The test pool percent bias was determined by testing a normal control sample and comparing it to the value obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent had been added.

To evaluate interference from rheumatoid factors interference, samples which had RF concentrations $3 6 4 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and samples with no detectable RF concentration were used to prepare samples for the study. Different mixtures, e.g., $1 + 1 , 1 + 3 , 3 + 1$ , of samples with high concentrations of RF were prepared and the INNOVANCE D-Dimer assay concentrations were determined in replicates of five. The recovery of the D-dimer value ranged from $9 2 \%$ to $101 \%$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: 2 clinical sites, 318 samples. Passing-Babcock regression yielded a slope of 0.951, intercept of $0 . 0 5 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU and r of 0.97.

b. Matrix comparaison:

3. Clinical studies: Frozen samples were collected from 902 out-patients presenting to the emergency room with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients were evaluated using the Wells’ pre-test probability (PTP) models to estimate the probability of DVT or PE. Patients were diagnosed as DVT or PE positive by standard objective tests as appropriate.

Patients initially diagnosed as negative were followed for four months.

Samples were collected from 2 clinical sites, frozen, and tested at 2 additional sites. Of the 902 patients, 533 were female and 369 were male; all patients were between the ages of 18 and 95.

In a prospective single center study, plasma specimens from 359 out-patients suspected of VTE were tested with the INNOVANCE D-Dimer assay using a cutoff of $. 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU. PE was ruled out or confirmed by spiral CT and a 3-month follow-up. DVT was ruled out or confirmed by compression ultrasonography and a 3-month follow-up. 89 of the 359 patients received a positive diagnosis for VTE resulting with a VTE frequency of $24 \%$ in this market.
