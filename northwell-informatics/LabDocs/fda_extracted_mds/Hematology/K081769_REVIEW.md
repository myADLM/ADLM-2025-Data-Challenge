# L. Test Principle:

The INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin assay utilizes a chromogenic measuring principle. An excess of factor Xa is added to citrated plasma. In the presence of heparin, a portion of the enzyme is complexed and inactivated by the antithrombin present in the sample. Excess, uninhibited factor Xa then cleaves a specific chromogenic substrate, causing the release of a dye. The rate of the substrate cleavage is determined by the increase in the absorbance value at $4 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .

antithrombin $^ +$ heparin $>$ [antithrombin $\bullet$ heparin] [antithrombin $\bullet$ heparin] $^ +$ FXa (excess) — $\gg$ [antithrombin $\bullet$ heparin $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \operatorname { F X a } ] + \operatorname { F X a }$ (residual)

FXa (residual) chromogenic FXa substrate — > tripeptide $^ +$ dye The release of dye is inversely proportional to the inhibiting activity of the antithrombin in the plasma sample, i.e. the smaller the concentration of functionally active antithrombin, the higher the absorbance signal per time unit.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were conducted with the ${ \mathrm { B C S } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ System, as described in the CLSI Guideline EP5-A2, using Control Plasma N (control plasma in the normal range) and Control Plasma P (control plasma in the pathological range) as well as a pathological plasma pool (human plasma pool in the decision range and prepared from a minimum of 20 different individuals). Plasmas were tested in duplicate for 20 days, two runs per day (with at least a 2 hour time interval between the two runs). Analysis of variance was performed on the results.

Acceptance criteria: Within device/within laboratory $C V \leq 1 0 \%$ ; Repeatability CV for controls within normal range and controls in low pathological range were $65 \%$ and $\leq 7 \%$ , respectively. Between-run CV for controls within normal range and controls in the low pathological range were ${ \leq } 5 \%$ and $\leq 1 0 \%$ , respectively.

Acceptance criteria were met for all three levels tested.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity for INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin on the ${ \mathrm { B C S } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ System was found to be from $6 . 0 \%$ to $1 2 7 . 9 \%$ within $2 . 9 \%$ measured maximum deviation in this interval. Verification of dilution linearity on the ${ \mathrm { B C S } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ System was performed according to CLSI guideline EP6-A. A high pool (Control Plasma N reconstituted with $7 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of purified water) and a low pool (INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin Buffer) were mixed according to a dilution scheme with equally spaced concentrations to establish a linear range of 9 concentration levels across the anticipated measuring range of $0 \%$ to $1 5 0 \%$ Antithrombin. Four replicates were used at each concentration level. The mean result of each level was compared to expected result for the same concentration level.

Statistical calculation of the relative difference between predicted values from the linear regression analysis versus those from the best fitting polynomial in the diagnostically relevant range vary from 0.48 to $2 . 8 6 \%$ , which was within the pre-defined criterion for nonlinear error of ${ \leq } 8 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Real Time Stability and Open Vial Stability - Three lots of INNOVANCE™

Antithrombin Reagent, INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin Substrate and INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin Buffer were tested (vials with the respective volumes of the large vial size kit OPFH 055 and of the small vial size kit OPFH 035) using Control Plasma N (CPN), Control Plasma P (CPP) and a sample in the decision range of $7 5 \%$ antithrombin activity of the norm. Testing of the three lots was performed over a period of 12 months and at least one month after the end of expected shelf life (day 0; 6 months, 12 months and 13 months). Vials of reagent, substrate and buffer of each of the three lots were opened and stored as claimed in the package insert. All measurements were performed in triplicate.

Acceptance criteria: All test results (mean of triplicates) must fall within the assigned ranges of the controls and of the sample with an antithrombin activity of $7 5 \%$ of the norm. Stability data support a shelf life of 12 months and Open Vial stability of 8 hours at $+ 1 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $+ 2 5 \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } C } }$ and 4 weeks at $+ 2 ^ { \circ }$ to $+ 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The determination of LoB for the ${ \mathrm { B C S } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ System was performed using one blank and four low-level samples. Studies were conducted by two operators over four different days, using three different INNOVAVCE Antithrombin reagent lots and one analyzer consistent with the CLSI guideline EP17-A.

Limit of blank (LoB) was derived from measuring INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin Buffer in 60 replications. Non-parametric analysis methods were used for all reagent lots. LoB was defined as $5 . 1 \%$ , the maximum value obtained in the three individual runs.

Limit of detection (LoD) for INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin assay on the $\mathrm { B C S @ }$ coagulation system was determined with four low-level samples, three reagent lots and one analyzer. For the evaluation of LoD the four low level samples were measured in 15 replications each. The limit of detection (LoD) was defined as $6 . 0 \%$ , the maximum value obtained in the three individual runs. The acceptance criterion LoD $< 7 \%$ was met.

e. Analytical specificity:

All interference studies were conducted using a normal plasma pool and a pathological plasma pool spiked with increasing concentrations of the potential interfering substance. Nine concentrations ranging from $0 \%$ to $100 \%$ of the potential interferent were measured on the $\bar { \mathsf { B } } \mathsf { C } \bar { \mathsf { S } } ^ { \mathbb { \oplus } } / \mathsf { B } \mathsf { C } \mathsf { S } ^ { \mathbb { \oplus } } \mathrm { X }$ P System for each pool. Four replicates were measured for each concentration. Successive concentrations were tested until the maximum acceptable deviation from the reference samples was observed in two consecutive concentrations. The acceptance criterion was $10 \%$ deviation from the original value obtained with a neat sample for each pool. Results obtained with interferent levels that exceeded the acceptance criterion were considered unacceptable.

Interference studies were performed for hemoglobin, bilirubin and triglycerides using the INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin reagent on the ${ \mathrm { B C S } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ System. Acceptable results were obtained for interferent levels up to 60 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for bilirubin, $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for hemoglobin, and $2 1 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for triglycerides. Interference studies were performed for direct Factor Xa inhibitors, e.g., Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) and Fondaparinux Sodium. In addition, studies to evaluate the potential interference caused by direct thrombin inhibitors, general serine protease inhibitor and indirect Factor Xa inhibitor were conducted.

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

Not applicable. Discrimination point between normal and deficient subjects in around the lower limit of the reference range $\sim 8 0 \%$ of the norm).

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The method comparison studies were conducted at three different sites, one internal and one external evaluation using the ${ \mathrm { B C S } } ^ { \textregistered }$ System. The studies were conducted using different populations obtained from patients at risk for thrombotic events with suspected or known thrombophilia. Fresh and frozen, male and female patient samples were analyzed by both the proposed and predicate devices in single determination. The study also included samples from normal patients and diluted samples to ensure samples were tested over the entire measuring range. A total of 284 specimens with antithrombin activity ranging from 4.8 to $1 3 1 . 3 \%$ of the norm were tested during different days with two lots of INNOVANCE™ Antithrombin reagent on the ${ \mathrm { B C S } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ System and compared to the Dade Behring Berichrom™ Antithrombin III (A) reagent on the ${ \mathrm { B } } { \mathrm { \dot { C } S } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ System. Results were analyzed using Passing-Bablock regression. Acceptance criteria: Coefficient of regression $\Gamma > 0 . 9$ ; Slope $> 0 . 9$ and $< 1 . 1$ .
