6C Cell Control is a reference product prepared from treated, stabilized human erythrocytes in an isotonic medum 6C Cell Control also contans a stablized, platelet-sized component, and fixed erythrocytes to simulate leukocytes and nucleated red blood cells By design, 6C Cell Control confirms and monitors instrument accuracy and precision performance by providng measurements for counting, sizing, hemoglobin determination, NRBC enumeration and White Blood Cell differentation using VCSn technology

# 6 Intended Use:

6C Cell Control is a hematology quality control material used to monitor the performance of COULTER hematology analyzers listed in the TABLE OF EXPECTED RESULTS in conjunction with specific COULTER reagents

The assigned values and expected ranges on the TABLE OF EXPECTED RESULTS can be used to monitor instrument performance This product can also be used to establish your own laboratory mean

# 7 Comparison to Predicate(s):

COULTER 6C Cell Control is essentially identical to the current COULTER 5C Cell Control with the addition of 2 parameters NRBC% and NRBC# This control is for use with the UniCel® DxH 800 analyzer (pending 510(k) submussion) An NRBC analog was added to the 5C control product formulation

# 8 Summary of Performance Data:

The data in the Premarket Notification on safety and effectiveness supports a finding of substantial equivalence to products already in commercial distribution Stability studies of 6C Cell Control support the Beckman Coulter stability claims of 18 events within 16 days (open vial) and 95 days (closed vial)

This summary of safety and effectiveness is being submtted in accordance with the requrements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 and the implementing regulation 21 CFR 807 92
