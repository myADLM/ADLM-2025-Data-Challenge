Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics (formerly Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics) ADVIA Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c Assay and Calibrators Premarket Notification - 510(k) 510(k) Summary

# Device Description:

The concentration of A1c and the concentration of total hemoglobin are measured and the ratio is reported (either as $\%$ or mmol/mol).

There are two different sample pretreatment methods available on the ADVIA Chemistry System. The first method is an Automated Pretreatment that uses 4 reagents: A1c Denaturant Reagent, Total Hemoglobin Reagent (tHb_2), A1c Agglutinator Reagent (R1) and A1c Antibody Reagent (R2). In this Automated Pretreatment step, the whole blood sample is mixed with the A1c Denaturant Reagent. The red blood cells are lysed and the hemoglobin chains are hydrolyzed by the protease present in the reagent.

The second method is a Manual Pretreatment that uses the same reagents as the first method except that the A1c Denaturant Reagent is replaced with the Hemoglobin Denaturant Reagent. For this method, there is an off-line pretreatment that is followed by a 10 minute incubation.

For the measurement of total hemoglobin, the Total Hemoglobin Reagent is used. The method is based on the conversion of all hemoglobin derivatives into alkaline hematin in an alkaline solution of a nonionic detergent

A latex agglutination inhibition method is used for the measurement of specific A1c. The A1c present in the sample competes with the agglutinator (synthetic latex containing multiple copies of the immunoreactive portion of A1c) for the anti-A1c antibody; thereby reducing the rate of agglutination. A concentration curve is obtained by monitoring the change in scattered light as a change of absorbance. The actual change in absorbance is inversely proportional to the concentration of A1c in the sample. The HbA1cN NGSP result $( \% )$ or the HbA1cl IFCC result (mmol/mol) is calculated using the A1c and total hemoglobin values.

The ADVIA® Chemistry A1c Calibrators are used to calibrate the methods. The calibrators consist of four (4) levels of lyophilized whole blood containing varying concentrations of HbA1c and total hemoglobin. There is a single level calibration for total hemoglobin (Cal 1) and a multi-level calibration (six levels) for A1c. Four calibrator levels (designated Cal 1 - 4) are provided in a single kit and each level is $0 . 5 ~ \mathfrak { g } / \nu | \alpha |$ The other two levels consist of Saline (Cal O) and Cal 5 (prepared by the system from Cal 4 using 1.4 times the volume used for Cal 4).

The target value of each calibrator (calibration) level is:

Calibration Level 1 (Cal O): 0.00 µmol/L A1c, 0.0 g/dL Total Hemoglobin Calibration Level 2 (Cal 1): 2.30 µmol/L A1c, 11.0 g/dL Total Hemoglobin Calibration Level 3 (Cal 2): 3.65 µmol/L A1c $\bullet$ Calibration Level 4 (Cal 3): 5.15 μmol/L A1c Calibration Level 5 (Cal 4): 6.80 μmol/L A1c Calibration Level 6 (Cal 5): 8.20 μmol/L A1c

Storage is at $2 - 8 \%$ .

CAUTION! POTENTIAL BIOHAZARD: Contains human source material. While each human serum or plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDA-approved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2, all products manufactured using human source material should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B or C viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these products should be handled according to established good laboratory practices.

# Statement of Intended Use:

The ADVIA® Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c method is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of Hemoglobin A1c, a diabetes marker, in whole blood on the ADVIA Chemistry systems. Such measurements are used for monitoring the long-term glycemic control of persons with diabetes. The A1c and total hemoglobin (tHb) values generated as part of the HbA1cN and HbA1cl methods are intended for use in the calculation of the A1c / total hemoglobin ratio, and must not be used individually for diagnostic purposes.

\*Note: HbA1cN reports HbA1c in $\%$ and HbA1cl reports HbA1c in mmol/mol

The ADViA® Chemistry A1c Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of the A1c and total hemoglobin methods (Automated and Manual Pretreatment) on the ADVIA Chemistry Systems.

Dear Dr. Liu:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
