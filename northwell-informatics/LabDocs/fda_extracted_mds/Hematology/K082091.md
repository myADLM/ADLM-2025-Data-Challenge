Device names and classification

Trade name: Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent   
Common name: CD3-PE-D649/CD4-A488/CD8-PE reagent with fluorescent counting beads   
Device classification: The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent is a Class II device (21 CFR 864.5220, Panel code: GKZ)

# Predicate devices

Becton Dickinson TriTESTTM reagent CD4 FITC/CD8 PE /CD3 PerCP; TruCOUNTTM Absolute counting tubes (K971205)   
Beckman Coulter CYTO-STAT@ CD45-FITC/CD4-PE/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5 tetraCHROMETM (K030408)

# Device Description

The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent contains Atto488 - labeled CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone RPA-T4); phycoerythrin(PE)  labeled CD8 monoclonal antibody (clone LT8); and PE  Dyomics649 - labelcd CD3 monoclonal antibody (clone UCHT1) formulated with fluorescent counting beads and stabilizers. The conjugated antibodies and beads are dispensed into flow cytomcter compatible plastic tubes and dried. The material in cach tube is used to process a single sample.

The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent, thrce color immunofluorescence stain, labels, identifies, and enumerates helper/inducer $( \mathsf { C D 3 + C D 4 + } )$ and cytotoxic/suppressor $( \mathbf { C D 3 + C D 8 + } )$ T lymphocytes. Combined with a precise number of fluorescent counting beads, in each tube, the reagent provides absolute $\pmb { \mathrm { C D 4 + } }$ and $\mathbf { C D 8 + }$ T-Cell counts on a single platform.

The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent is a three color immuno-fluorescence stain for the labeling, identification, and enumeration of helper/inducer $\left( \mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + } \right)$ and cytotoxic/suppressor $\left( \mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + } \right)$ T lymphocytes combined with a precise number of fluorescent counting beads for absolute $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ and $\mathbf { C D 8 + }$ T-Cell counts. This reagent is intended to be used in a "no wash" protocol for flow cytometric analysis of erythrocytelysed human whole blood.

# Technological Characteristics

The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent, like the predicate devices, contains fluorescently labeled antibodies and fluorescent counting beads that are used to stain specific T-cell populations. These stained cells can be analyzed on any flow cytometer equipped with a $4 8 8 \mathrm { n m }$ laser, scattering detection, and capable of fluorescence detection in the ranges ${ 5 1 5 - 5 4 5 \mathrm { n m } }$ , $5 6 2 { \cdot } 6 0 7 \mathrm { n m }$ , and ${ > } 6 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

Fluorescence from the CD4-A488, CD8-PE, and CD3-PE-D649 antibody conjugates can be detected in each of the three wavelength ranges when specifically bound to the cells. The counting beads can be used to determine the volume of sample analyzed on the flow cytometer when a precise volume of blood is dispensed into the tube containing the conjugates and a known number of beads. This allows the single platform determination of the absolute $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ and $\mathbf { C D 8 + }$ T-cell counts.

# Performance Characteristics

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility

Within run reproducibility was determined by performing 10 replicates of a high, medium, and low count samples. The results were found to be acceptable with average $\% \mathbf { C V }$ better than $10 \%$ .

# 2Linearity

The linearity was determined over the reportable ranges for $\mathrm { C D 4 + ( 6 5  – 1 5 0 0 ~ c e l l s / \mu l ) }$ and $\mathrm { C D 8 + ( 5 0 { - } 1 5 0 0 ~ c e l l s / \mu l ) }$ T-cells. The linearity was found to be acceptable with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99.

3. Sample stability

Sample stability was assessed at 24 hour intervals from the time of phlebotomy. Sample stability with respect to absolute $\pmb { \mathrm { C D 4 + } }$ and $\mathbf { C D 8 + }$ T-cell concentrations were acceptable when analyzed 24 hours post draw. If samples were processed at the time of phlebotomy then the counts was found to be stable for 7 days.

Cross reactivity

The monoclonal antibodies used in the Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent were assigned these specificities at the International Workshops on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens. Conjugation has not changed their specificities.

5. Correlation to predicate devices

The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent was compared to the predicate devices at four different sites (291 samples). The correlation of absolute $\mathrm { C D } 4 +$ & $\mathrm { C D 8 + }$ T-cell counts were $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } \dot { 0 } . 9 9$ , 0.93, 0.91, & 0.99 and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 6$ , 0.91, & 0.96, respectively.

# Conclusion

The information presented in this pre-market notification for the Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent demonstrates substantial equivalence to the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Kunitake:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations afecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
