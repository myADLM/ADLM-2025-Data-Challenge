# 5. Description:

Body Fluid Control is a reference product prepared from treated, stabilized human erythrocytes suspended in an isotonic medium. Body Fluid Control also contains a stabilized, platelet-sized component, and fixed erythrocytes to simulate leukocytes. Body Fluid Control confirms and monitors instrument accuracy and precision performance by providing measurements during counting.

# 6. Intended Use:

Body Fluid Control is a hematology quality control material used to monitor the performance and verify the measuring range of the body fluid cycle of the UniCel® DxH 800 COULTER Cellular Analysis System. Refer to the System HELP or Instructions for Use.

The assigned values and expected ranges on the TABLE OF EXPECTED RESULTS can be used to monitor performance, and verify the measurable range. This product can also be used to establish your own laboratory mean.

# 7. Comparison to Predicate(s):

COULTER Body Fluid Control is similar to the current COULTER 5C Cell Control except for the number of parameters reported and their respective concentrations. The product is used to monitor the RBC and TNC (white blood cells) measurements from the Body Fluid cycle on the UniCel $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ DxH 800 analyzer (pending 510(k) clearance K081930).

# 8. Summary of Performance Data:

The data in the Premarket Notification on safety and effectiveness supports a finding of substantial equivalence to products already in commercial distribution. Stability studies of Body Fluid Control support the Beckman Coulter stability claims of 18 events within 16 days (open vial) and 120 days (closed vial).

This summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 and the implementing regulation 21 CFR 807.92.
