# IV. Description of Device:

The Factor VIII Antibody Screen is an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay with a colorimetric endpoint. The Factor VIII Antibody Screen is designed to detect IgG antibodies reactive with recombinant human Factor VIII in human serum and plasma. The Factor VII Antibody Screen kit contains all of the reagents necessary to perform the assay.

# GTIL DIAGNOSTICS

One of the most detrimental complications observed in the treatment of hemophilia A is the development of antibodies to FVIII. These antibodies can be either inhibitory or non-inhibitory in regards to FVIlI activity. The presence of inhibitory antibodies may lead to the direct neutralization of transfused or endogenous FVIII activity. The non-inhibitory antibodies may lead to increased clearance of FVIII from circulation in an antibody mediated manner or by preventing the FVII from binding to its carrier protein, von Willebrand Factor. Antibodies to Factor VIII are also present in patients with acquired hemophilia.

The Factor VIII Antibody Screen solid phase ELISA microwells provide immobilized recombinant human FVII as target molecules for the detection of anti-Factor VIII IgG antibodies.

Diluted patient serum or plasma is added to microwells coated with recombinant FVIII molecules allowing antibody, if present, to bind. Unbound material is then washed away. An alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-human immunoglobulin reagent (Anti-IgG) is added to the wells and incubated. The unbound Anti-IgG is washed away and the substrate PNPP (p-nitrophenyl phosphate) is added. After a 30 minute incubation period, the reaction is stopped by a sodium hydroxide solution. The optical density of the color that develops is measured in a spectrophotometer at $4 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ with no reference filter.

# V. Intended Use

The Factor VIII Antibody screen is a qualitative solid phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed to detect IgG antibodies reactive with recombinant human factor VIII (FVIII) in human serum and plasma.

The similarities between these two devices can be summarized as follows:

Both the Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay and the Factor VIII Antibody Screen have similar intended uses and the similar indications for use. Both the Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay and the Factor VIII Antibody Screen use the same technology (ELISA with a colorimetric endpoint) and the same general assay steps. Both the Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay and the Factor VIII Antibody Screen use identical reagents with the exception of the microwell plates, specimen diluent, and kit control.

The difference between the two devices can be summarized as follows:

The microwells for the Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay use starwells with immobilized Recombinate as the source of Factor VIII. The microwells are blocked with bovine serum albumin and coated with a stabilizing agent. The microwell plates for the Factor VIII Antibody Screen use low-volume, flat bottom microwells with immobilized Kogenate FS as the source of Factor VIII. The microwells for the Factor VIII Antibody Screen are not blocked with bovine serum albumin and are coated with the same stabilizing agent as thc Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay.

The Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay uses a Tris buffered solution containing sodium chloride and $0 . 0 5 \%$ sodium azide as the specimen diluent. The Factor VIII Antibody Screen uses a Tris buffered solution containing sodium chloride and $0 . 0 5 \%$ sodium azide with $5 \%$ bovine serum albumin as the specimen diluent.

The Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay uses the negative control to determine the cutoff for positive samples. Any sample with an average optical density (OD) value greater than or equal to

twice $( 2 \mathbf { x } )$ the average OD value of the negative control is positive. Any sample with an average OD value less than twice $( 2 \mathbf { x } )$ the average OD value of the negative control is negative. The Factor VII Antibody Screen uses the kit control to determine the cutoff for positive samples. Any sample with an average OD value greater than the average OD value of the kit control is positive. Any sample with an average OD value less than or equal to the average OD value of the kit control is negative.

# VII. Support of substantial equivalence based on performance data:

The details of each of the following studies are coved in Section 7: Performance Data of this 50(k). Only i brief summary of these studies is provided in this section.

# Factor VIII Antibody Screen Assay Cutoff

# Description of Study

Since there is no intermationally accepted standard for measurement of anti-FVIII antibodies, GTI developed its own standardization system and material used for the determination of the assay cutoff. In the Factor VII Antibody Screen, the cutoff value used to assign a reportable result (positiveornegative) to a patient sample is set by the kit control. Any sample with an average OD value $>$ than the average OD value of the kit control is positive. Any sample with an average OD value $\lneq$ the average OD value of the kit control is negative. The appropriate value for the kit control was determined by analysis of samples from normal, healthy, non-hemophiliacs and samples from patients known to contain antibodies to FVIII. A cutoff which best distinguishes between the two populations was chosen.

The kit control is a diluted serum known to contain antibodies to Factor VII. The dilution choser to make the kit control is lot specific and is determined based on the specific reactivity of each kit lot. Each time a kit lot is manufactured, all of the reagents are produced prior to the manufacture of the kit control. The reagents assigned to that particular kit lot are used in determining the best serum dilution to make the kit control. Testing includes assaying 78 different serum samples from normal, healthy, nonhemophilic donors and 3 known positive samples with low reactivity. The 3 positive samples and 78 normal samples are tested side-by-side with FVII antibody positive serum diluted to various OD values. The average OD value for the 78 normal samples is calculated. A target value for the kit control is then chosen to be three times $( 3 \mathbf { x } )$ the average OD value of the normal samples. A dilution of the FVIII antibody positive serum is chosen such that it matches the target OD within $0 . 0 2 0 ( + / - )$ The dilution which best matches the target value is used to manufacture the kit control. In addition to matching the target OD value, the chosen serum dilution must also yield the expected reportable results (positive or negative) for the samples tested. The 3 known positive samples with low reactivity must be positive and $5 9 8 \%$ of the normal samples must be negative.

# Qualification of Sample Type

# Description of Study

In the method comparison study, described in this submission, samples collected as serum, plasma samples collected in ACD, plasma samples collected in $3 . 2 \%$ or $3 . 8 \%$ sodium citrate, and samples collected as plasma and converted to serum were included. For some sample types only small numbers of samples wee availableThe purpos  this suy was  collect dat urthersuportng theusevrus sample types in the Factor VIII Antibody Screen. The unmodified Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay only allowed for plasma collected in ACD (acid citrate dextrose) or $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate to be used in the assay.

The effect of the different sample matrices were investigated in a series of experiments. First the FVIII Antibody Screen reportable results obtained from $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate plasma and serum drawn from the same 59 normal healthy, non-hemophiliacs were compared. Secondly, a three-way comparison testing samples collected from 14 healthy, non-hemophilia donors collected in serum, $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate, and ACD was conducted. Normal plasma samples from healthy, non-hemophiliacs were purchased as whole blood collected in $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate (blue-top) or ACD (yellow top) or were collected from GTI employees. Normal sera samples were collected from the same individuals into non-anticoagulated serum tubes (red-top).

In addition to normal samples, a study using spiked samples was conducted. Since we did not have access to the 3 sample types of interest collected from FVIII antibody positive patients, small amounts of Factor VIII antibody positive plasma were spiked into either $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate plasma and serum pairs drawn from normal, healthy, non-hemophiliacs or spiked into $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate plasma and ACD plasma pairs drawn from normal, healthy, non-hemophiliacs. The spiking was conducted such that the matrix was ${ > } 9 0 \%$ serum or plasma (i.e. the lowest dilution was 1:10). The reportable results for each spiked sample pair were compared to determine if there was any significant difference in how the two sample matrices responded to the spike.

# Results and Analysis

Samples from 59 normal donors drawn as serum or as plasma in $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate gave negative reportable results regardless of the sample matrix. In a three way comparison of serum, $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate plasma, and ACD plasma, samples from 14 normal donors gave negative reportable results regardless of the sample matrix. When antibody positive plasma was spiked into serum and $3 . 2 \%$ sodium cirate plasma pairs, all spiked samples yielded the same reportable result, regardless of the sample mai. A total of 12 plasma and serum pairs became positive in this experiment. When antibody positive plasma was spiked into $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate plasma and ACD plasma pairs, all spiked samples yielded the same reportable result, regardless of the sample matrix. A total of 24 plasma pairs became positive in this experiment.

# Conclusions:

In this set of experiments, no difference was observed between the reportable results obtained from samples collected as $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate plasma, ACD plasma or as serum. Differences between average OD values were noticed however there was no correlation to a specific sample matrix. From this study it

can be concluded that for the Factor VIII Antibody Screen, either plasma collected in $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate or ACD or serum can be used as the sample source. The method comparison study additionally supports the use of these sample types in the FVIII Antibody Screen.

# Factor VIII Antibody Screen Precision

# Description of Study

In this study a total of 8 samples were tested in duplicate in the Factor VIIl Antibody Screen in 10 separate assays according the Factor VIII Antibody Screen direction insert.

Results and Analysis

To obtain imprecision of the OD values, the data were analyzed by ANOVA. In addition, the eportable result (positive or negative) was analyzed for agreement within and between runs.

The calculations of imprecision for the OD values showed that the assay demonstrated $\leq 1 3 \%$ cv total imprecision for samples with OD values greater than 0.600 and $\leq 2 4 \%$ cv total imprecision for samples with OD values less than 0.600. In addition, the correct reportable result was obtained for each result of each assay. There was $100 \%$ agreement between all reportable results (within-run and betweenrun) for each sample tested.

# Conclusions:

The Factor VIII Antibody Screen showed acceptable assay imprecision of the OD values as well as the reportable results.

# Accuracy of the Factor VIII Antibody Screen

Accuracy was demonstrated by a study in which the Factor VIII Antibody Screen was compared to both the Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay and the Bethesda assay. The data is a combination of an internal study conducted at GTI and an external study conducted at the Special Coagulation Lab, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

Description of Study:

The sample set used for method comparison consisted of more than 200 samples. Samples were collected from hemophiliac donors without Factor VIII antibodies (negative Bethesda titers or a negative Bethesda Screen) and from hemophiliac donors with Factor VIII antibodies (positive Bethesda titers). Sample types included in this study were serum collected as serum, serum converted from plasma, plasma collected in sodium citrate $( 3 . 2 \%$ or $3 . 8 \%$ ), and plasma collected in ACD.

# Results and Analysis:

The results of both the internal and external method comparison study were combined. Analysis of the data was performed using $2 \mathbf { x } 2$ tables and the calculations for co-positivity, co-negativity, and $\%$ EY agreement are shown below.

In the method comparison between the Factor VIIInhibitor Assay and the Factor VIII Antibody Screen a total of 8 samples showcd discordant results. One sample was positive on the FVIII Antibody Screen and negative on the Factor VIlI Inhibitor Assay. The cause of this discrepancy remains unknown, however the sample was only tested once on the Factor VIlI Inhibitor Assay. The other 7 discordant $\sin ( \pi + \pi ) = \sin ( 2 \pi )$ , were positive on the FVII Inhibitor Assay and negative on the FVIII Antibody Screen. These samples were from hemophiliac patients that had ncgative Bethesda titers or Bethesda Scrcen results and would not be expected to contain antibodics to Factor VII. In the FVII Inhibitor Assay, the reactivity of these samples was reduced in the prescnce of a diluent containing BSA, suggesting non-FVII specific background binding, however the OD values were not reduced enough to give a negative reportable result in 5 of the 7 samplcs.

# GTI. DIAGNOSTICS

Good sclence starts with people."

In the method comparison between the Factor VIII Antibody Screen and the Bethesda assay, four Bethesda positive samples were missed on the FVII Antibody Screen. These samples ranged in Bethesda titer from 0.8 to 3 with 0.8 being the cutoff for a positive Bethesda assay. The cause of these discrepancies remains unknown. Twelve samples that were assigned negative Bethesda reportable results were found to be positive on the Factor VIII Antibody Screen. In most cases, these samples were from patients which later developed an inhibitor or had been treated with immune tolerance to abrogate the inhibitor. It is believed that these discrepant samples indicate an increased sensitivity of the ELISA compared to the functional assay, possibly due to the fact that the ELISA can detect both inhibitory and non-inhibitory FVIII antibodies.

For comparison, a summary table of all both of the combined $2 { \tt x } 2$ table analyses is provided below:

# Conclusions

The Factor VIII Antibody Screen showed excellent sensitivity (co-positivity), specificity (conegativity), and overall agreement with the predicate device (Factor VIlI Inhibitor Assay). In addition, the Factor V Antibody Screen showed excellent sensitivity (co-positivity), specificity (co-negativity), and overall agreement when compared to the Bethesda assay. The Bethesda assay is considered to be the gold standard for detection and quantitation of inhibitory antibodies to Factor VIII.

# Investigation of Possible Interfering Substances or Sample Conditions

Drugs commonly used in the treatment of hemophilia and sample conditions common to coagulation samples were tested for possible interference in the Factor VIII Antibody Screen. The following provides a description of the study, the results, and conclusions. This study was conducted as an internal study at GTI.

# GTI. DIAGNOSTICS

Good science starts with people."

Description of Study

The purpose of this study was to look at common sample conditions seen in coagulation testing and determine if any of these conditions cause interference in the Factor VI Antibody Screen. In addition, two substances often used in treatment of hemophilia, Gammagaurd (IVIG) and Rituxan (rituimab), were tested to determine if the presence of the drugs interfere with the assay results. This testing was conducted as a series of spiking experiments. The addition of hemoglobin was used to mimic hemolyzed samples, billirubin was used to mimic icteric samples, and intralipid was used to mimic lipemic samples. Three samples (1 negative, 1 with medium reactivity, and 1 with high reactivity) were tested with all possible interferences in replicates of 10.

Hemoglobin and Intralipid were tested at ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in the sample and billirubin was tested at ${ 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ in the sample. The Gammaguard (IVIG) was tested at a concentration of $2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ in the sample and Rituxan (rituximab) was tested at a concentration of $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ in the sample.

Results and Analysis:

For the two positive samples tested, the $\%$ difference between the average OD values obtained in the presence or absence of the test compound is $< 2 4 \%$ for all test compounds and the OD values were not consistently increased or decreased on the basis of the presence of the test compound. For the negative sample, the $\%$ difference between the average OD values obtained in the presence or absence of the test compound range up to $6 3 \%$ , however these OD values are less than 0.110 and this type of variation is expected. For all samples tested with all compounds tested, the reportable results were the same in the presence or absence of the test compound.

# Conclusions:

The use of lipemic, icteric, or hemolyzed patient samples should not result in an incorrect test result with the Factor VIII Antibody Screen. The presence of IVIG up to $2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or rituximab up to 10 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ in a patient sample should not result in an incorrect test result with the Factor VII Antibody Screen.

# Factor VIII Antibody Screen Lot to Lot Reproducibility

# Stability Data to Support Expiration Dating

Description of Study:

The microwells, specimen diluent and kit control are the only components not used in the GTl Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay kit (predicate device). All reagents which are shared between the two kits have been assigned the shelf-life previously used in the Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay kits. The microwells used in the Factor VIII Antibody Screen are different enough from the microwells used in the Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay to warrant an accelerated stability study to determine a reasonable shelf-life.Allother reagents are not sufficiently different from the reagents used in the GTI Factor VII Inhibitor Assay to result in changes in reagent stability.

In addition to the accelerated stability study on the microwells, a real-time kit stability study is being conducted on a total of 3 kit lots.

Results and Analysis:

During the course of the accelerate microwell strip stability study, no time points constituted at fail assay.Therefore, there were no points of failure observed during this accelerated stability study. The microwell strips were stabile out to 20 weeks when stored at $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Therefore the predicted shelf life of the microwell strips from this accelerated stability study would be 186 weeks $( - 3 . 5$ years) when stored at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . As with any accelerated stability study, the predicted shelf-life will be confirmed with a real-time stability study.

The results for the in-use and unopened kit stability study are very similar. For all samples tested at all time points the known negative sample gave negative reportable results and the known positive samples gave positive reportable results.

# Conclusions:

To summarize, the data suggest that the new format microwel strips may be stable up to 3.5 years base on accelerated data. This dating will be confirmed with real-time stability results.The real-time stabliy suis areny ut  mnhs and to date ycludene kt lot. The kit has been hown e stable at least for the 6 months completed in the study. This study is currently on-going and will be summarized in full in the final stability report for the Factor VIII Antibody Screen.

# VIII. Conclusion

Based on comparison with the predicate device, (GTI Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay), these data demonstrate that the GTI Factor VII Antibody Screen performs comparable to the predicate device and the Factor VIII Antibody Screen does not present new issues of safety and effectiveness.
