# L. Test Principle:

Diluted patient sample is added to microwells coated with recombinant FVIII, and antibody, if present will bind. Unbound material is washed away, and an alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-human immunoglobulin reagent (anti IgG) is added to the wells and incubated. Unbound anti-IgG is washed away and then PNPP (pnitrophenyl phosphate) substrate is added. After a 30 minute incubation period, the reaction is stopped, and the optical density of the color that develops is measured at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

8 samples were tested in duplicate in 10 separate assays, and analyzed by ANOVA for agreement within and between runs. Results demonstrated a within run imprecision of $\leq 2 0 \%$ CV and a between run CV of $\leq 2 4 \%$ .

Lot-to Lot Reproducibility was demonstrated by testing 12 samples (7 neg, 5 pos) in duplicate in 3 separate assays, on 3 different kit lots. Results demonstrated $100 \%$ agreement between reportable results for all 3 kit lots.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

d. Detection limit:

e. Analytical specificity:

3 samples (negative, medium, and high FVIII antibody reactivity) were used to demonstrate interference of hemoglobin, bilirubin, lipid, Gammagaurd (IVIG) and Rituxan (rituximab). Samples were spiked with interferents and tested in replicates of 10. Results showed no interference in hemoglobin and lipemia at $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ,bilirubin at $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , , IVIG 200mg.dL, Rituxan $1 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# $f .$ Assay cut-off:

The cutoff value for the Factor VIII Antibody Screen is determined by the kit control. Any sample with an average OD value $>$ than the average OD value of the kit control is positive. Any sample with an average OD value $\leq$ the average OD value of the kit control is negative.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Accuracy was demonstrated by a 2 site study in which the Factor VIII Antibody Screen was compared to the Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay and the Bethesda Assay.

# b. Matrix comparison:

Normal and spiked sample studies were conducted. Paired $3 . 2 \%$ Na citrate and serum samples was collected from 59 normal donors. Serum, $3 . 2 \%$ Na citrate, and ACD plasma samples were collected form 14 normal donors.

Antibody positive plasma was spike in 12 serum and $3 . 2 \%$ Na citrate samples. 24 ACD plasma and $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate pairs were spiked with FVIII antibody positive plasma. All studies demonstrated no difference was observed between the reportable results obtained from samples collected as $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate plasma, ACD Plasma or as serum.
