# 3. Predicate Device:

DCA Vantage™, Test system for hemoglobin A1c, albumin and creatinine, K071466   
Evolution™M, Blood glucose monitoring system, K072369

# 4. Description:

The CLOVER A1c™ is a device which combines a Hemoglobin A1c monitoring system, and a blood glucose monitoring system.

The CLOVER A1c™M monitoring system includes Hemoglobin A1c Analyzer, Hemoglobin A1c Test cartridge, Hemoglobin A1c Check cartridge, Thermal printer, Barcode scanner, PC cable, and Fan filter.

The CLOVER A1c™ monitoring system is a fuly automated boronate affinity assay for the determination of the percentage of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c $\%$ ) in human whole blood.

Hemoglobin A1c Test cartridge is composed of a cartridge and a reagent pack containing the reagents necessary for the determination of hemoglobin A1c, with a collection leg for blood sample collection.

The reagent pack is pre-filled with reaction solution and washing solution. The reaction solution contains agents that lyse erythrocytes and bind hemoglobin specifically, as well as a boronate resin that binds cis-diols of glycated hemoglobin.

Blood sample is collected at the collection leg of the reagent pack, and then the reagent pack is inserted into the cartridge. The assembled cartridge is inserted into the Hemoglobin A1c Analyzer and rotated so that the blood sample mixture is placed at the measurement zone of the cartridge, where the amount of total hemoglobin in the blood sample is photometrically measured. The measurement range is $4 . 0 { \sim } 1 4 . 0 \%$ . Acceptable anticoagulants for venous samples are EDTA, heparin, citrate and fluoride/oxalate.

The CLOVER A1c™M Glucose module is an in vitro diagnostic device designed for measuring the concentration of glucose in whole blood. The principle of the test replies upon a specific type of glucose in blood sample, the oxidase glucose that reacts to electrodes in the test strip. The test strip employs an electrochemical signal generation an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is measured by the Meter and displayed as your blood glucose result.

# 5. Indications for use:

The CLOVER A1c™ HbA1c assay is an in vitro diagnostic test that quantitatively measures the percent concentration glycosylated hemoglobin in capillary or venous whole blood samples for clinical laboratory and point of care use. Measurement of percent HbA1c is used to monitor long-term glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. CLVER Acis or n vitro diagnostc use and is ot to be used or the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.

The CLOVER A1c™ glucose assay is used for the quantitative measurement of the concentration of glucose in whole blood taken from the fingertip by healthcare professionals. The test is for prescription use as an aid in the management of diabetes. CLOVER A1c™ is for in vitro diagnostic use and is not to be used for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.

# 6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics with Predicate:

The CLOVER $\sin 1 0 ^ { \pi }$ has the same technological characteristics as the current legally marketed predicate devices, DCA Vantage ™ (K071466) by Siemens medical solutions diagnostics and Evolution TM (K072369.) by Infopia Co., Ltd.

# 7. Performance Data:

Clinical: The clinical performance evaluation using the CLOVER A1c™ device was conducted for the purpose of validating the glycosylated hemoglobin and glucose measuring accuracy. Test results showed substantial equivalence.

Non-clinical: Verification, validation and testing activities were conducted to establish the performance, functionality and reliability characteristics of the CLOVER A1c™ with respect

to predicate devices. Pass or fail criteria were based on the specifications cleared for predicate devices and results showed substantial equivalence.

# 8. Conclusion:

The conclusion drawn from the clinical and non clinical tests is that the CLOVER A1c is as safe, as effective, and performs as well as the legally marketed predicate device, the DAC Vantage  and Evolution T

Re: k082275 Trade Name: Clover $\mathsf { A l c } ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Glycosylated Hemoglobin Monitoring System Regulation Number: 21 CFR §864.7470 Regulation Name: Hemoglobin Alc Test System. Regulatory Class: Class II Product Codes: LCP, CGA Dated: January 8, 2010 Received: January 11, 2010

Dear Ms. Griffin:

We have reviewed your Section ${ \mathfrak { s l o } } ( { \mathbf k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA) it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does . not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical devicereporting (reportingofmedical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); uet   e systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
