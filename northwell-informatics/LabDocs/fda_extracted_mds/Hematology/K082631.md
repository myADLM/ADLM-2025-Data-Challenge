# L. Test Principle

Thromboplastin is a tissue-derived complex incorporating the protein Tissue Factor (TF) associated with lipid vesicles. When Thromboplastins are added to plasmas the endogenous Factor VII (FVII) or activated Factor VII (FVIIa) in the plasma complex with the Tissue Factor and lipid vesicle in the presence of calcium, which then activates the Tissue Factor pathway of blood coagulation. This TF/FVIIa complex activates Factor X (FX) to activated FX (FXa). Factor Xa complexes with activated Factor V (FVa) on a lipid surface in the presence of calcium to form the prothrombinase complex. The prothrombinase complex activates Prothrombin to Thrombin. Thrombin, without any cofactors or ion dependency, will cleave Fibrinogen to Fibrin, leading to formation of a solid clot.

Activated Protein C (aPC) in the presence of its cofactor Protein S (PS) degrades activated Factor Va (and VIIIa), reducing the catalytic efficiency of the prothrombinase complex. When the assay conditions are chosen such that an excess of aPC is present and the concentration of Protein S in the patient sample is rate limiting, the time to clot of the patient plasma becomes proportional to the concentration of the patient PS and can be used to quantify the PS activity in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable)

Performance evaluation of the ThromboTek $\mathbf { P S } e$ kit included studies of precision, linearity, analytical sensitivity, common interferants, normal range, correlation with the StaClot $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ kit, and reconstituted and accelerated stability. The method, samples, reagents, and results of each study are described in detail in section 23, Performance Data. No bench (section 20), animal (section 21), or clinical (section 22) testing was required. Summaries of the studies are:

Precision: Precision estimates of three lots of ThromboTek $\mathbf { P S } e$ were determined in a two run per day, twenty day exercise using a normal plasma and an abnormal plasma as described in the CLSI guideline EP5-A2 (7). The average precision results $\mathrm { a s \% C V }$ were:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Repeatability</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.9%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Abnormal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.8%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.2%</td></tr></table>

Linearity: Linearity studies of three lots of ThromboTek $\mathrm { P S } e$ were determined on a Stago ST4 analyzer. The ThromboTek PSe assay was linear from $10 \%$ Protein S to the maximum tested concentration of $1 5 6 \%$ Protein S.

Analytical Sensitivity: The lower limit of detection for three lots of ThromboTek $\mathrm { P S } e$ were determined by replicate measurement of IBS alone as the sample on an AMAX 200 analyzer in mechanical mode, and the $\%$ PS activity was calculated from the sum of the mean and 3 standard deviations. The lower limit of detection of the assay was $1 \%$ PS.

Interferences: Interference studies of multiple lots of ThromboTek $\mathbf { P S } e$ were determined on an AMAX 200 analyzer in mechanical mode. Interferant was spiked into pooled normal plasma and a dilution series prepared. The maximum concentration tolerated in the assay was defined as the highest concentration of interferant wherein any consistent shift relative to the recovered value of the base PNP was less than $10 \%$ . The maximum concentrations were:

# Normal Reference Range:

In a representative study one hundred twenty healthy donors were analyzed for Protein S activity with each of three lots of ThromboTek $\bf P S e$ on an AMAX 200 analyzer in mechanical mode. Assay calibration was performed using the SSC/ISTH Secondary Coagulation Standard Lot #3 available from NIBSC. The geometric means and standard deviations were calculated, and the ranges were calculated as the mean $+ 1 - 2$ standard deviations. The results were:

# Method Comparison:

A total of one hundred seventy-four patient samples were assayed for Protein S activity with multiple lots of ThromboTek PSe and two lots of another commercially available Protein S activity assay. The data was collected in two sites, one using an AMAX 200 analyzer and the other a STart4 analyzer. As determined by Kruskal-Wallis analysis the data was pooled and then further analyzed by linear regression. The correlation coefficient was O.895 $9 5 \%$ CI, 0.875-0.912) and the coefficient of determination was 0.801, with a slope and intercept of 1.71 and -8.59 respectively.

# Reconstituted Stability

The reconstituted stability of the ThromboTek PSe kit was assessed by longitudinal studies of three lots. The recoveries of two control plasmas were assessed at the initial reconstitution of each kit, and thereafter at periodic time points. The kit components were stored capped when not in use and freshly reconstituted control plasmas were prepared at each time point. With criteria of an age-related trend and a maximum shift of twice the precision CV, the predicted reconstituted stability of the ThromboTek PSe kit is 24 hours when stored at $2 . 8 \%$ and 8 hours when stored at room temperature $( 2 3 - 2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C } )$

# Accelerated Stability:

Expiry dating was predicted by a heat stress accelerated stability study of one lot of ThromboTek PSe. The study used two different sets of the kit lyophilized components, with one set stressed at $3 7 \%$ for up to 25 days and the second set at

$4 5 \%$ for up to 7 days. Thereafter three lots of control plasmas were assayed with the unstressed and stressed components, and assessed for any age-related shift in recoveries. With criteria of an age-related trend and a maximum shift of $10 \%$ , the predicted expiry dating of the ThromboTek PSe kit is 2 years when stored at $2 - 8 \%$
