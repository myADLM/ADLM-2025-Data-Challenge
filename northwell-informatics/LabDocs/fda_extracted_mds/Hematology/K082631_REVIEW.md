ThromboTek PSe is a tissue factor pathway based clotting assay. The assay activator is a lyophilized preparation incorporating rabbit thromboplastin, calcium, buffer, and stabilizers. The remaining components of the assay are lyophilized activated Protein C, lyophilized human plasma depleted of Protein S, imidazole buffered saline, and deionized water containing a preservative for reconstitution of the lyophilized components.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods Approved Guideline- Second Edition”

CLSI/NCCLS EP15-A2, “User Verification of Performance for Precision and Trueness: Approved Guideline-Second Edition”, 2005

H21-A5, “Collection, Transport and Processing of Blood Samples for Testing Plasma-based Coagulation Assays and Molecular Hemostasis Assays; Approved Guideline-Fifth Edition”, 2008

# L. Test Principle:

The Tissue Factor pathway of coagulation is activated when endogenous FVII or activated FVIIa in the sample plasma is mixed with tissue factor in the presence of calcium. This TF/FVIIa complex activates Factor X (FX) to FXa. Factor Xa complexes with activated Factor V (FVa) on a lipid surface in the presence of calcium to form a prothrombinase complex. The prothrombinase complex activates prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin leading to formation of a solid clot.

Activated Protein C (aPC) in the presence of its cofactor Protein S degrades FVa, reducing the efficiency of the prothrombinase complex. When there is an excess of aPC, the concentration of Protein S in the patient sample is rate limiting. Thus, the time for the patient plasma to clot is proportional to the concentration of the PS in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI/NCCLS Guideline EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline-Second Edition. Three lots of the assay kit was used to determine precision in a two run per day, twenty day exercise on an AMAX 200 analyzer in mechanical mode using a normal and abnormal plasma.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Three lots of linearity testing using ISTH/SCC plasma demonstrated ThromboTek PSe linearity of 10- $1 5 6 \%$ Protein S.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Assay recommends the use of pooled normal plasma or purchased reference plasma for calibration, and the use of purchased quality control material for QC

# d. Detection limit:

Lower limit of detection was determined by testing 30 replicates of the assay buffer on 3 lots of the ThromboTek PSe assay. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean $+ \ 3 { \mathrm { S D } }$ of the clot times were calculated for all three lots. The LoD was calculated as $1 \%$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Hemoglobin, bilirubin, lipid, and heparin interference was tested by spiking the interferent into pooled normal plasma and preparing serial dilutions. The maximum concentration tolerated in the assay was defined as the highest concentration of interferent resulting in a ${ < } 1 0 \%$ difference in the base result.

The maximum concentrations were:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

174 patient samples were assayed on multiple lots of ThromboTek PSe. Data was collected at two sites, one using an Trinity Biotech AMAX 200 analyzer and the other a Diagnostica Stago STA4, and yielded correlation statistics of $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 7 1 1 \mathbf { x } - 8 . 8 9 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 8 9 5$

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: n/a b. Clinical specificity: n/a c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): n/a

4. Clinical cut-off: n/a

5. Expected values/Reference range:

120 normal donors (85 females, 35 males) were assayed on 3 kits of the ThromboTek PSe. Mean, and two standard deviation ranges were calculated for males (62 – 209), females (45 – 183), and combined male and female (47-193)

# N. Proposed Labeling:
