# L. Test Principle:

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: n/a $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: n/a c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The assigned values for Berichrom Heparin UF Calibrator, Berichrom Heparin UF Control 1 and Berichrom Heparin UF Control 2 are traceable to the 5th World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for unfractionated heparin. Assigned values are obtained from multiple determinations, on multiple coagulation instruments and Berichrom Heparin lots. A typical assigned value for the calibrator is $1 . 2 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . Typical control values are $0 . 2 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ for Control 1 and $0 . 6 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ for Control 2.

Stability Testing

Shelf life (Closed)

Study Duration

24 month shelf life; studies performed for 1 month past labeled shelf life. Testing Frequency

Day 0; 6, 9, 12, 18, 19, 24 and 25 months

Storage

Replicates

Calibrator: Three six-point calibrator curves are generated from three vials of calibrator; a mean calibration curve is established from the three curves. At each time point, a vial is tested in duplicate.

Controls: At each time point, a vial is tested in duplicate.

Acceptance Criteria

Control 1: Results obtained must not deviate more than $\pm 0 . 0 5 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ compared to Day 0 results

Calibrator & Control 2: Results obtained must not deviate more than $\pm 2 0 \%$ compared to Day 0 results

The mean value at each time point is compared to the Day 0 value. Results obtained must meet the acceptance criteria. Shelf-life (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.
