X-CalTM   
Assayed hematology calibrator   
Calibrator for Cell Indices (864.8150)   
KRX

# Predicate Devices:

Cal-Chex- K840261

Description: X-Cal is a stabilized suspension of human and animal blood, in a solution containing biological salts and anti-microbial preservatives. The product is packaged in plastic vials containing $4 . 5 m |$ The closures are polypropylene screw caps with polyethylene liners. The vials will be packaged in a five welled vacuum formed "clamshell" container. The product must be stored at $2 - 8 \%$ .

Intended Use: X-Cal is used to calibrate and verify calibration of Sysmex hematology analyzers. Refer to product assay sheet.

Discussion of Tests: Three studies of X-Cal were conducted: Run to Run Reproducibility and Comparison to Whole Blood; Open Vial Stability and Closed Vial Stability.

Conclusions Drawn From Tests: Study results show X-Cal to be consistently reproducible, substantially equivalent to the predicate product, and stable for the entire product dating. X-Cal is a safe and effective product, which fulfills its intended use when used as instructed in the product package insert.

Dear Ms. Johnson:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 80 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
