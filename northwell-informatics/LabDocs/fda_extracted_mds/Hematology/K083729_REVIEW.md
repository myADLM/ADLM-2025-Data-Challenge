Assay Principle

Assay is performed in the presence of Activated Protein C and Protein S (one single test for each patient). In the presence of APC, prolongation of clotting time is inversely related to the amount of Factor V Leiden. Normal Factor V is not measured. APC resistance due to Factor V Leiden is indicated when the $\% F V L$ value is above or equal to the cut-off value.

Assay is performed in the   
presence and absence of   
Activated Protein C (two tests for each patient). In the presence of APC, prolongation of clotting time is directly related to the   
concentration of Normal Factor V, and inversely related to the   
amount of Factor V Leiden. APC resistance due to Factor V Leiden is indicated when the APC-V ratio is below or equal to the cut-off value.   
Not Applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

The Hemoclot Quanti V-L kit is a clotting method triggered by purified Factor Xa, containing Phospholipids, and Calcium, and is performed on diluted test plasma, in presence of Activated Protein C and Protein S. In the first step, diluted plasma is mixed with purified clotting Factors [clotting mixture containing Prothrombin, Fibrinogen, Protein S and Activated Protein C (APC)], in a constant and optimized concentration. Then, the purified Factor Xa in the presence of Phospholipids (PLP) is added. Clotting is initiated by the addition of Calcium $\mathbf { ( C a 2 + ) }$ . The clotting time is then recorded. Clotting time measured is inversely proportional to the concentration of factor V-L. There is an inverse linear relationship, on a lin-log graph paper, between the factor V-L concentration and the corresponding clotting time.

FVL Calibrator and Biophen V-L Cal (Undiluted) are two calibrators that may be used with the HEMOCLOT Quanti.V-L kit. Biophen V-L CAL (Undiluted) is lyophilized undiluted human plasma containing different concentrations of FV-L, to cover the assay range, from about $10 \%$ to $100 \%$ . FVL Calibrator is lyophilized prediluted human plasma (1:20) at different concentrations of FV-L, to cover the assay range, from about $10 \%$ to $100 \%$ .

Biophen Normal Control Plasma and Biophen Act. PC-r Control Plasma are quality control plasmas which may be used with the kit.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Two lots of Hemoclot Quanti V-L were analyzed for inter-assay precision. In one study the assay was performed with the waterbath, over four days using the internal reference calibrator at 4 different concentrations ( $10 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $1 0 0 \%$ of FVL. Normal Control and the Biophen APCr control were used as controls. In another study using the waterbath, 9 vials of reagent was assayed at the $100 \%$ FVL level by several technicians. Inter-assay precision was also demonstrated using the KC10 analyzer by performing 10 assay runs over

several days using 2 technicians. The calibration curve was run, which represents the entire range of the assay, $1 0 \% { - } 1 0 0 \%$ FVL.

Intra-assay precision was demonstrated on the waterbath by assaying 10 reagent vials from the same lot at the $100 \%$ FVL Level, in the single run.

All analyses yielded $C V { < } 6 \%$

Additional precision testing was performed at the medical decision points $( 1 0 \% , 2 5 \% )$ on the KC10 (10 runs), STA-R (10 runs), and waterbath (5 runs). Two samples were assayed over 3 days using 3 technicians. For each run a reference calibration curve and Normal Control and Biophen APCr was performed.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the Hemoclot Quanti $_ { \mathrm { V - L } }$ assay was evaluated by use of FVL Calibrator plasmas at 4 different concentrations of FVL, $10 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $100 \%$ . The linearity of the assay was validated on the waterbath and several commercial analyzers (KC10, STA, STAR and Amax 400). The assay is linear between $10 \%$ and $100 \%$ FVL, $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { > } 0 . 9 8$ . The linearity of the assay below $10 \%$ is not determined. Any value below $10 \%$ is considered normal. Values between $2 5 \%$ and $7 5 \%$ are expected for heterozygous plasmas. Values $> 7 5 \%$ are expected for homozygous plasmas. Values between $10 - 2 5 \%$ are considered inconclusive.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The Internal Reference Standard used for assigning values to the calibrators and controls is traceable to pooled normal and APCr human plasmas, controlled for normal Factor $\mathrm { V }$ content against commercially available reference plasma pools, and verified against an NIBSC standard for normal Factor V (SSC/ISTH Secondary Coagulation Standard).

The calibration curve for the Hemoclot Quanti V-L kit is established with either Biophen V-L cal (undiluted) or Factor V-L Calibrator kits. By definition, normal plasma contains $0 \%$ FVL and heterozygous plasma, from patients carrying the R506Q mutation, contains $50 \%$ FVL. For the Biophen VL cal (undiluted) kit, calibrators are made from mixtures of pooled heterozygous plasmas and pooled normal plasmas to yield calibration plasmas at concentrations of $10 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ and $50 \%$ . For the Factor V-L Calibrator kit, calibrators are made from mixtures of pooled heterozygous plasmas and pooled normal plasmas and diluted appropriately to yield calibration plasmas at concentrations of $10 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ and $100 \%$ FVL, ready to use with the Hemoclot Quanti V-L kit. The concentration of each calibrator level is accurately defined, against an internal reference standard, as the mean value from at least 10 vials tested in the same series by manual and/or automated methods, using the Hemoclot Quanti V-L Assay.

Biophen Act. PC-r Control Plasma and Biophen Normal Control Plasma (510k #043451) may be used for quality control with the Hemoclot Quanti VL kit. Biophen Act PC-r Control Plasma is derived from pooled heterozygous plasma, from patients carrying the R506Q mutation, and contains about $50 \%$ FVL. Biophen Normal Control Plasma is derived from pooled normal plasmas and contains about $0 \%$ FVL. The FVL concentration of each control is accurately defined, against an internal reference standard, as the mean value of at least 3 vials tested in at least 3 independent series (i.e., at least 9 vials tested) by manual and/or automated methods, using the Hemoclot Quanti V-L Assay.

Stability: Reconstituted reagents are stable for 24 hrs at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 8 hrs at room temperature $1 8 \mathrm { - } 2 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } C ) } }$ . Overheating studies support 30 month expiration dating for lyophilized reagents stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by analyzing factor deficient plasmas. Results from Factor deficient plasmas (V, X, II, PS, PC) showed no interference. Since the assay can be performed in patients with heparin therapy (up to $1 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ), plasma samples spiked with heparin were tested and showed no significant interference as the result of a heparin neutralizing substance in Reagent 1. To determine whether the assay can be performed in patients with Anti-Vitamin K (AVK) therapy, plasma samples from APCr patients with AVK therapy were tested and yielded expected values.

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

The normal cut-off range was determined and validated by analyzing normal patient plasmas and aPCr patient plasmas, carrying R506Q mutation (FVL) identified with molecular technology as Heterozygous (HTZ) or Homozygous (HMZ). Analyses were conducted on water bath, KC10 and STAR analyzers. Normal plasma is expected to measure ${ < } 1 0 \% \mathrm { F V L }$ . Plasmas from patients with Factor V Leiden are expected to measure between $2 5 \%$ and $7 5 \%$ FVL (heterozygous) or $> 7 5 \%$ (homozygous).

Using the Hemoclot Quanti V-L method, the normal plasma range was determined by analyzing 20 normal plasma samples from a French blood bank on three different instruments with normal and APCr Controls and a selection of ActPCr plasma samples. To verify the cut-off, 42 plasma samples from FVL/HTZ patients out of therapy, 20 plasma samples from FVL/HTZ patients under Anti Vitamin K (AVK) therapy and 18 plasma samples from FVL/HMZ patients were analyzed. Results were acceptable with normal samples measuring $< 1 0 \%$ FVL, $2 5 \%$ and $7 5 \%$ FVL for FVL/HTZ and $> 7 5 \%$ FVL for FVL/HMZ samples.

2. Comparison studies:

. Method comparison with predicate device: A four site (two in the US and two in Europe) comparison study was conducted. 189 plasma samples were analyzed using the test (Hemoclot Quanti V-L) and predicate (Coatest APCr) method. Samples were selected from patients who were previously tested for coagulation disorders and represented both normal and APC-Resistant populations (about $60 \%$ of the samples were from normal patients and $40 \%$ from APCr patients). Patient plasma samples were selected to cover the range of the assay. Overall, there was $94 \%$ agreement between the two methods for determining APC resistance due to the Factor V Leiden mutation. In one study, samples were identified as heterozygous (25), homozygous (11), or normal (27) with regard to FVL mutation using molecular biology methods. There was $9 7 \%$ agreement between the results of test method and the molecular biology diagnosis with regard to APCr resistance.
