# L. Test Principle:

Blood sample is added to a cylindrical blood holding cup. An oscillating pin is immersed into the blood holding cup. Movement is obstructed when a clot forms and attaches to the pin and cup surfaces. As the clot becomes firmer, the rotational movement of the pin is reduced. The motion of the pin is detected by an optical detection system. The rotational movement of the pin is converted into amplitude. An amplitude of $0 \mathrm { m m }$ means unobstructed rotation, and an amplitude of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$ can be regarded as blocking of the pin by the clot. The TEM amplitude is a measure of the clot firmness.

The following parameters are used to describe the clot firmness:   
MCF (mm) – Maximum clot firmness (maximum amplitude) of the developed clot during the test   
A10, A20 – Clot firmness (amplitude) at the time points 10 and 20 minutes after CT   
CT (s) – Clotting time The time from test start until first significant level of clot firmness $( 2 \mathrm { m m } )$ is reached   
CFT (s) – Clot formation time. The time from the CT/R until a clot firmness of $2 0 \mathrm { m m }$ is reached   
α – Alpha angle. Angle between the baseline and a tangent to the clotting curve through the 2 mm (CT/R) point.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

Dose-response curves for heparin, for dilution and for urokinase on the INTEM assay, were presented to demonstrate thromboelastograph principles: coagulation kinetics, clot firmness, and hyperfibrinolysis.

Dose response to UF heparin was presented to demonstrate coagulation kinetics. It is the most widely used anticoagulant in clinical practice, and it inhibits plasma coagulation (mainly FIIa). Heparin was spiked in the concentrations 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and $1 . 6 \ : \mathrm { U / m l }$ . A dose-dependent effect was seen on all INTEM parameters.

Dose response to dilution affect was presented to demonstrate clot firmness. Blood samples depleted of platelets or fibrinogen decreases clot firmness. To simulate the depletion of platelets and fibrinogen due to plasma expander substitution in a patient, normal blood was diluted in saline to 90, 80, 70, 60 and $50 \%$ . A pronounced dosedependent effect was seen on the INTEM A20 (Figure 10), the CFT and the Alpha Angle. The effect on the CT parameter was very weak. Only at the $50 \%$ dilution the CT results began to prolong in comparison to the $100 \%$ whole blood control, but the values were never elevated above the upper reference limit.

Hyperfibrinolysis dose response was demonstrated in-vitro, through spiking studies with the physiological plasmin activator urokinase was spiked in the concentrations 10, 20, 30, 40, and $5 0 \mathrm { ~ U } / \mathrm { m l }$ . In most cases, there was a clot lysis within 1 hour from $2 0 \mathrm { U / m l }$ on. A decrease of the median Lysis Onset Time (LOT) and A20 parameter was seen from 20 $\mathrm { U } / { \mathrm { m l } }$ on. The other parameters CT, CFT, and Alpha were not affected as within the urokinase concentration range tested the clots fully before the clot lysed.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run (channel-to-channel), total, and operator-to-operator precision were evaluated. The sample pool consisted of the following sample types:

Normal blood samples in the reference ranges Level 1 blood samples (at the medical decision limit between normal and hypocoagulable): normal blood samples diluted with physiological saline solution and spiked with a direct thrombin inhibitor Level 2 blood samples outside the reference ranges (at the medical decision limit between normal and hypercoagulable): normal sample spiked with fibrinogen (up to approximately $8 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ ) ROTROL N (level 1 - mimicking ‘normal’) ROTROL P (level 2 - mimicking ‘pathological’)

Within-run precision was assessed by performing five consecutive runs of each sample/control. Each run was performed using four different channels of ROTEM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ in parallel which resulted in 20 replicates per test and sample.

Total precision was determined by analyzing two levels of control in duplicate on two separate runs, over 20 working days. The two test runs were separated by at least two hours.

Between-operator precision was investigated by five different operators analyzing the two control samples during one working day, using two different channels per test and sample. Results were deemed acceptable based on the following:

N. Instrument Name:

ROTEM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ delta

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Automatic

2. Software:

Instrument uses Linux operating system. No unauthorized software can be installed by the user. No user access at the operating system level is allowed. Software on the measurement path is used for measurement result calculation, controlling functions, monitoring the measurement process and data analysis. The measurement is represented in a graphical picture and as numeric results.

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X_ __ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Sample identification information is manually entered into the instrument.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Samples are collected in $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate, and pre-warmed to $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ in a sample holding cup. The instrument automatically pipettes samples and reagents. Samples are stored at room temperature, and must be used within four hours of collection.

5. Calibration:

The ROTEM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ delta device uses a two tier calibration. A factory set calibration that involves the elasticity of the spring connector, and a zero-signal auto-calibration that is monitored as long as the instrument is turned on.

6. Quality Control:

The controls lyophilized plasma based reagents that have to be reconstituted fresh for each test run. The controls are recommended to be run with each series of assays and with any change of personnel operating the tests. The package inserts of ROTROL N and ROTROL P show batch-specific target reference ranges for each parameter of the ROTEM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ tests. The material can therefore not only be used to monitor precision, but also the accuracy of the system (device, reagents, and test operation).

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the “Performance Characteristics” Section above: None.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:
