Urinalysis Control   
Hematology quality control mixture (864.8625)

Predicate Device:

# Description:

UA-Cellular or IQ is a urinalysis control which contains stabilized human red and white blood cells and other inert particles in a preservative medium. UA-Cellular for IQ is a urine control for the IRIS $\yen 200$ analyzer. The product is packaged in plastic bottles containing $120 m |$ The closures are polypropylene scew caps with polyethylene lners. There re two different levels; level  and level The bottes will be packaged in a box with the package insert / assay sheet. The product must be stored at $2 - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \ C$ .

# Intended Use:

UA-Cellular for IQ is an assayed cellular urine control for evaluating the accuracy and precision of automated procedures that measure urinary sediment parameters.

# Discussion of Tests and Test Results:

Three types of studies were conducted to establish performance of UA-Cellular for IQ. The three tests conucted were Run-to-Run Reproducibility, Open Vial Stability and Closed Vial Stabiliy.All tesn showed that UA-Cellular for I s consistenty reproducible, substantially equivalent to the predicate product and stable for the shelf life claimed.

# Conclusions Drawn From Tests:

UA-Cellular for IQ is an assayed cellular urine control for evaluating the accuracy and precision of automated procedures that measure urinary sediment parameters. It meets the claim of a 60 day closed vial, and a 30 day open vial stability and consistent run-to-run performance.Reproducibility su n Clos Vi sablity esult confim o-o-ot conistenc neaactue  UA-Celu for IQ.Customers can be assured of a reliable quality control material that meets their expectations.

Re: k090201 Trade/Device Name: UA-CellularTM for IQ Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.8625 Regulation Name: Hematology Quality Control Mixture Regulatory Class: II Product Code: JPK Dated: January 26, 2009 Received: January 27, 2009

Dear Ms. Oetter:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. However, you are responsible to determine that the medical devices you use as components in the [kit/tray] have either been determined as substantially equivalent under the premarket notification process (Section 510(k) of the act), or were legally on the market prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. Please note: If you purchase your device components in bulk (i.e., unfinished) and further process (e.g., sterilize) you must submit a new 510(k) before including these components in your kit/tray. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, and labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2- Ms. Oetter

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on the labeling regulation, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at 240- 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For question regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474.
