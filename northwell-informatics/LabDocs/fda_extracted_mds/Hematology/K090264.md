# Device Descriptions:

HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500: The D-Dimer HS 500 Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of uniform size coated with the $\mathbf { F } ( \mathbf { a } \mathbf { b } ^ { \prime } ) _ { 2 }$ fragment of a monoclonal antibody highly specific for the D-Dimer idomain included in fibrin soluble derivatives. The use of the $\mathbb { F } ( \mathsf { a b } ^ { \prime } ) _ { 2 }$ fragment allows a more specific D-Dimer detection avoiding the interference of some endogenous factors like the Rheumatoid Factor. When a plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with the Latex Reagent and the Reaction Buffer included in the HemosIL D-Dimer HS $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k i t } ,$ the coated latex particles agglutinate. The degree of agglutination is directly proportional to the concentration of DDimer in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of transmitted light caused by the aggregates (turbidimetric immunoassay).

HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 Controls: The Low and High D-Dimer HS 500 Controls are prepared obtained by digestion of Factor XIlla cross-linked human fibrin with human plasmin.

# Device Intended Uses:

HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500: Automated latex enhanced immunoassay for the quantitative determination of D-Dimer in human citrated plasma on the ACL $\mathrm { T O P ^ { \bullet } }$ Family Systems for use, in conjunction with a clinical pretest probability (PTP) assessment model to exclude venous thromboembolism (VTE) in outpatients suspected of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 Controls: For the quality control of the D-Dimer HS 500 assay performed on the ACL $\mathrm { { T O P } ^ { \bullet } }$ Family Systems.

# Outcome Study

An outcome study was performed on 295 frozen samples from patients admitted consecutively to an emergency unit with suspected PE or DVT (frequency of venous thromboembolic disease: $2 5 . 4 \%$ . Of the 295 samples, 75 were confirmed as VTE positive (47 PE and 28 DVT) by standard objective tests and the remaining 220 were confirmed as negative.

# Summary Performance Data (Cont.):

A multi-center management study was performed at four hospitals on 747 samples from patients admitted consecutively to the qmergency unit with suspected DVT or PE . 401 patients were suspected of DVT and 346 patients were suspected of PE. As part of the study, patients underwent a PTP (pretest probability) assessment using the Wells model and were classified as having a high, moderate or low probability of DVT or PE.Patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a low PTP score underwent no further diagnostic testing and were followed-up after 3 months for development of DVT or PE. For patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a moderate PTP, it was the physician's decision whether to follow-up after 3 months or to undergo imaging techniques. Patients with a positive D-Dimer test result or a high PTP score underwent imaging techniques.

The overall prevalence DVT in the total population of samples was $2 2 . 4 \%$ (90/401). The overall prevalence of PE in the total population of samples was $1 5 . 0 \%$ (52/346). As of the 3 month follow-up, none of the patients that were negative through D-Dimer testing had developed DVT or PE.

The sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) of HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 for DVT and PE using the previously established clinical cut-off of $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ is summarized below with the corresponding $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI):

Dear Ms. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice

requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
