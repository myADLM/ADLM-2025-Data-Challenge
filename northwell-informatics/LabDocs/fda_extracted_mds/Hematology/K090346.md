ADVIA@ 2120/2120i Body Fluids Application

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR $\ S$ 864.5220 Automated Differential Cell Counter

Classification: Class II

Panel: Hematology

F. Predicate Device: COULTER® LH 750 Body Fluids Application 510(K) # K030606

# Device Description:

Summary and Explanation: Peritoneal and pleural fluids are serous fluids found in the serous membranes that line the peritoneal and pleural body cavities. Under normal conditions the amount of fluid in the serous membranes is very small. An effusion, the accumulation of fluid within the serous membranes, is a symptom of a pathologic process that may be transudative or exudative in origin.

Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) is a procedure that can be used to treat patients with renal disease. PD works on the principle that the mesothelial cells of the serous membrane lining the peritoneum function as a filter to remove the toxic substances that accumulate in blood. Peritonitis is a serious complication in patients who undergo PD.

Total Nucleated Cell (TNC) and RBC enumeration is a part of the clinical laboratory assessment of pleural, peritoneal, and PD fluids. The ADVIA 2120/2120i Body Fluid application TNC and RBC counts are to be used in conjunction with other diagnostic information and the attending healthcare professional's evaluation of the patient's condition.

Principles of the Procedure: The ADVIA 2120/2120i Body Fluid Application uses the Basophil/Lobularity and RBC/Platelet channels to enumerate the TNC and RBC counts. The TNC count is derived from the Basophil/Lobularity channel. The ADVIA 2120/2120i BASO reagent contains surfactant and phthalic acid which, in the presence of low heat in the Baso channel reaction chamber, lyses RBCs and strips the cytoplasmic membrane from all leukocytes except basophils. This cell suspension is subsequently passed through the flow cell. The cell suspension is intercepted by light from the laser diode where the low-angle light scatter $( 2 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 ^ { \circ }$ ) and high-angle light scatter $( 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ ) signals of each cell are counted.

The RBC count is derived from the RBC/Platelet channel. The ADVIA 2120/2120i RBC/Platelet reagent uses sodium dodecyl sulfate and glutaraldehyde to sphere and fix the RBCs. This cell suspension uses the same flow cell and low-angle and high-angle light scatter signals as the Baso channel to count the RBCs. The system automatically reports the TNC and RBC counts in conventional or SI units appropriate for body fluid samples.

# H. Intended Use:

The ADVIA 2120/2120i auto-analyzer Body Fluid Application is an in vitro diagnostic test for the enumeration of the total nucleated cell (TNC) count and RBC count for pleural, peritoneal, and peritoneal dialysis (PD) specimens collected in K2 or K3 EDTA.

Dear Mr. Joseph:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450.
