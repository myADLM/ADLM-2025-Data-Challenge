Device:

Trade/Proprietary Names: AlCNow+ (Professional Use) A1CNow Self Check (Home Use)

Common/Usual Name:

Percent Hemoglobin Alc (percent glycosylated hemoglobin)

Classification:

Assay, Glycosylated Hemoglobin; 21 CFR 864.7470

Predicate Device:

AlcNow $\mathfrak { Q }$ Multi-Use for Home and Professional Use (InViewTM) K051321

Device Description:

The AlCNow+ tests provides quantitative measurement of the percent of glycated hemoglobin (%A1C) levels in capillary (fingerstick) or venous whole blood samples. The test is used to monitor glycemic control in people with diabetes.

AlcNow+™M consists of 1) a semi-disposable plastic-encased device (the monitor), 2) a plastic cartridge enclosing dry reagent strips, and 3) a sample dilution kit for: collecting the blood sample, mixing the sample with the required pre-treatment solution, and delivering the sample to the cartridge. When testing with AlCNow+, an unmeasured whole blood mixture (diluted) is directly applied to the sample port, and the results are displayed in numeric form on the Monitor's liquid crystal display after 5 minutes.

Intended Use:

The A1CNow multi-use test provides quantitative measurement of the percent of glycated hemoglobin (%HbA1c, %A1C) levels in whole blood samples. The test is for home use and professional use for monitoring glycemic control in people with diabetes.

Technological Characteristics:

There were no changes to the intended use or fundamental scientific technology.

Comparison to Predicate device:

AlCNow is the samne in fundamental technology and intended use to the predicate device, A1CNow, K051321, but has increased product stability and a simplified hemolysate preparation kit.

Assessment of Performance:

The performance was assessed in two separate clinical validation studies. The studies showed that changes to the hemolysate kit and product stability had no negative impact on product safety and efficacy. In addition, completed and ongoing product stability studies show no negative impacts of increased room temperature shelf life.

Conclusion:

The results of the verification and validation studies of A1CNow demonstrated that the product is safe and effective in the hands of lay users and healthcare professionals. The product is substantially equivalent.
