# L. Test Principle:

The candidate device is a well established method of measuring the level of $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ in the red blood cell. The candidate device is based on chromatographic separation of $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ on a cation exchange cartridge. The various forms of hemoglobin exhibit charge differences (positive) at the acidic pH of the mobile phase, and thus can be separated on a support that is negatively charged (cation exchange). The use of ionexchange chromatography then allows molecules to be separated based upon a molecule's charge. Separation is optimized to minimize interferences from hemoglobin variants (HbS, HbC, HbD and HbE trait), labile $\mathbf { A } _ { \mathrm { { l c } } }$ , hemoglobin F and carbamylated hemoglobin.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the proposed device was evaluated using a protocol based on the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Normal patient, normal control, diabetic patient and diabetic control samples were run in the precision study. The precision study was performed on 6 instruments in 3 laboratories over 10 days. Each site was provided with the same sample set and directed to perform 2 replicates of each sample on each of 2 runs/day (morning and evening) for 10 days. Each site conducted the study on 2 instruments. The position of the precision specimens in each run was randomized. The results were analyzed by nested Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with the hierarchical levels of labs, instruments, days, and runs. Patient samples are EDTA human whole blood. The results are summarized below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The study was performed following the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Linearity across the reportable range was performed using low $( 2 . 5 \% \mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } } )$ and high $( 1 9 . 6 \% \mathrm { H b A _ { l c } } )$ EDTA whole blood patient samples. These were mixed together in varying ratios. The measured values were compared to the theoretical values based upon the dilution factor. Polynomial regression analysis (for first, second, and third order polynomials) were performed to determine the statistical significance of non-linearity. The higher order coefficients were found not to be significant and linearity was demonstrated. The measured results for each dilution were within a maximum difference of $0 . 2 4 \%$ in this range.

# d. Detection limit:

The reportable range is 3.5 to $1 9 . 0 \%$ $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ (see linearity section above).

e. Analytical specificity:

Icterus (bilirubin) and lipemia (triglyceride) interference: Two EDTA whole blood patient samples representing normal and diabetic $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ samples were split into aliquots and treated with increasing concentrations of triglycerides and bilirubin. The treated and untreated samples were run in duplicate on a VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System and the differences in $\%$ $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ between the samples were analyzed. Bilirubin up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and triglycerides up to $6 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ had no significant effect on $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ determination.

EDTA interference: In order to determine the effect of high concentrations of EDTA that can occur in cases of “short draws”, 2 whole blood patient samples representing normal and diabetic $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ samples were split into aliquots and treated with 11 times (11X) the expected EDTA concentration in samples. The treated and untreated samples were run in duplicate on a VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System and the differences in $\% \mathrm { H b A _ { \mathrm { l c } } }$ between the samples were analyzed. EDTA, up to 11X had no significant effect on $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ determination.

Labile $\mathbf { A } _ { \mathrm { l c } } \left( \mathrm { L A } _ { \mathrm { l c } } \right)$ interference: Two EDTA whole blood patient samples representing normal and diabetic $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ samples were split into aliquots and treated with increasing concentrations of a glucose solution (up to 1000 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ and incubated for 3 hours at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to facilitate the formation of $\mathrm { L A _ { \mathrm { l c } } }$ . The treated samples and untreated control samples were run in duplicate on two VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing Systems and the differences in $\%$ $\operatorname { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ between the samples were analyzed. $\mathrm { L A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ up to $6 \%$ had no significant effect on $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ determination.

Carbamylated hemoglobin interference: A series of EDTA whole blood patient samples representing normal and diabetic $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ were prepared with varying concentrations of a high carbamylated hemoglobin solution (prepared by treating the red blood cells of a normal patient sample and a diabetic patient sample with $2 . 6 \mathrm { m M }$ potassium cyanate at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 45 minutes until the carbamylated hemoglobin level increased to $6 \%$ ). The carbamylatedcontaining samples and the control samples were run in duplicate on a VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System and the differences in $\%$ $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ between the samples were analyzed. Carbamylated hemoglobin up to $4 \%$ had no significant effect on $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ determination.

Hemoglobin F (HbF) Interference: A series of EDTA whole blood patient samples representing normal and diabetic $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ were prepared with varying concentrations of a high HbF $( > 2 5 ~ \% )$ solution. The treated samples and untreated control samples were run in duplicate on two VARIANT II TURBO

Hemoglobin Testing Systems and the differences in $/ _ { 0 } \mathrm { H b A _ { \mathrm { l c } } }$ between the samples were analyzed. HbF up to $2 5 \%$ had no significant effect on $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ determination.

Hemoglobin Variant Interferences: Hemoglobin AD, AE, AS and AC-trait patient samples (20 of each) with $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ values distributed across the nondiabetic and diabetic range were analyzed by the proposed device in replicates of four and compared to values obtained by a NGSP secondary Reference Laboratory using a boronate affinitity method. Two out of 7 hemoglobin ADtrait, 2 out of 11 hemoglobin AS-trait, 1 out of 11 hemoglobin AE-trait and 3 out of 9 hemoglobin AC-trait patient samples within the clinically significant range of $6 \%$ and $9 \%$ $\operatorname { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ tested exhibited differences of more than $\pm 1 0 \%$ from values obtained using the reference method.

The sponsor includes the following statements in the product insert:

Icterus, as indicated by bilirubin concentrations up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , does not interfere with the assay.   
Lipemia, as indicated by testing a normal and a diabetic sample spiked with a lipemic clinical serum sample to achieve triglyceride   
concentrations up to $6 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , does not interfere with the assay. Carbamylated hemoglobin concentrations up to $4 \%$ do no interfere with the assay.   
Hemoglobin F concentrations up to $2 5 \%$ do not interfere with the assay. In cases where hemoglobin $\mathrm { F }$ concentrations are greater than $2 5 \%$ , the $\%$ $\mathbf { A } _ { \mathrm { { l c } } }$ should not be reported.   
In a study to assess interference form hemoglobin variants, 2 out of 7 hemoglobin AD-trait, 2 out of 11 hemoglobin AS-trait, 1 out of 11 hemoglobin AE-trait and 3 out of 9 hemoglobin AC-trait patient samples within the clinically significant range of $6 \%$ and $9 \% \mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ tested exhibited differences of more than $\pm 1 0 \%$ from values obtained using the reference method. Laboratories should take this into   
consideration when evaluating results from patients with a hemoglobin variant trait.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: To demonstrate accuracy across the measuring range of 3.5 to $1 9 \%$ ${ \mathrm { H b A } } _ { 1 { \mathrm { c } } }$ , the proposed device was compared to the predicate using 40 EDTA whole blood patient samples and 12 spiked EDTA whole blood samples. The samples were run in singlicate on the proposed device and on the predicate device. A linear regression analysis of the results calculated a slope of 0.9621, an intercept of 0.4443, and a correlation coefficient of 0.994.

A second study was performed to evaluate the proposed device compared to the previous VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin A1c method (cleared in $\mathrm { k 0 4 0 8 7 2 }$ and the software was modified and cleared in k063400). A comparison of 42 EDTA whole blood patient samples with values distributed from 4.8 to $1 2 . 5 ~ \% \mathrm { H b A _ { \mathrm { l c } } }$ (on the proposed device) were run in singlicate on both systems. A linear regression analysis of these results calculated a slope of 1.0957, an intercept of 0.7375, and a correlation coefficient of 0.9952.
