# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The XT-4000i is the same as the XT-2000i which is part of the XT-Series and has a body Fluid mode the same as the XE-5000. It is an automated hematology analyzer which consists of four principle units: (1) Main Unit which aspirates, dilutes, mixes, and analyzes whole blood and body fluid samples; (2) Sampler Unit which supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information Processing Unit) which processes data from the Main Unit and provides the operator interface with the system; (4) Pneumatic Unit which supplies pressure and vacuum from the Main Unit.

The Body Fluid (BF) analysis mode of the XT-4000i uses the 4DIFF scattergram and the RBC distribution obtained from a specialized analysis sequence to calculate and display the WBC (WBC-BF) counts, mononuclear cell (MN) / polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) counts and percentages, TC-BF (Total Count) & RBC (RBC-BF) counts found in the body fluid.

2. Principles of Operation:

Performs hematology analyses according to the Hydro Dynamic Focusing (DC Detection), flow cytometry method (using a semiconductor laser), and SLShemoglobin method.

3. Modes of Operation:

(1) Manual Mode: the caps of the sample tubes are manually removed and each sample is aspirated via the whole blood aspiration pipette.   
(2) Sampler Mode: The sampler automatically mixes, aspirates and analyzes samples without removing their caps. Up to 50 samples can be loaded at a time and analyzed automatically.   
(3) Manual Closed Mode: The sampler is used to aspirate the sample without opening the cap of the sample tube. This mode is basically the same as the manual mode; mixing and continuous analysis cannot be performed

automatically.

(4) Capillary Mode: an analysis is performed after diluting the sampe to 1:5 ratio. This mode is used in analyzing a minute amount of blood collected from the earlobe or fingertip. The method used to aspirate the sample is the same as that used in manual and body fluid modes.

(5) Body Fluid Mode: The body fluid mode is used exclusively for measuring the number of blood cells contained in body fluid. Sample aspiration is performed in the same method as for the manual mode.

4. Specimen Identification: Specimen information is managed by four menu lists and specimen identification input is manual (operator entered) or by barcode reader.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Specimens are processed manually.

6. Calibration:

Calibration is carried out by entering calibration values into the unit. This calibration is performed for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT and PLT-O parameters. WBC Diff parameters are factory calibrated prior to shipment and verified by Sysmex technical representative on installation. The instrument does not need to be calibrated in the laboratory.

7. Quality Control: Body fluid controls are not available. Whole blood control materials are recommended.

8. Software:

c. Linearity:

Linearity testing was performed at two sites, using serial dilutions of body fluid samples made to represent the full range of linearity. The expected values were plotted against obtained results and both low and high values were calculated.

Specimens that represented the high end of the reportable range and had sufficient volume were selected for testing. Specimens with clots or insufficient volume were rejected. For WBC-BF, RBC-BF, TC-BF, the following specimen types were included in the study: CSF $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 )$ , Synovial fluid $( \mathrm { N } { = } 3 )$ ), Pleural fluid $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 )$ )

and Peritoneal fluid $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 )$ . For MN and PMN parameters: CSF $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 )$ , Synovial fluid $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 )$ , Pleural fluid $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 )$ and Peritoneal fluid $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 )$ . Each linearity dilution was assayed twice.

All results met manufacturer’s specifications as described in the tables below and were within manufacturer’s specifications for all parameters.

d. Carryover:

Body fluid counts (WBC, RBC and TC) with High to Low carryover were measured at two sites. Three (3) body fluid samples with a high cell count were analyzed three consecutive times (H1, H2, H3) followed immediately by testing a sample with a low cell count consecutively three times (L1, L2, L3) for each body fluid type. Specimens that represented the high and low end of the reportable range and had sufficient volume were selected. Specimen with clots or had insufficient volume were rejected. Carryover studies were performed using the following specimen types: CSF $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 3 \right)$ , Synovial fluid $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 3 \right)$ , Pleural fluid $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 )$ and Peritoneal fluid $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 1 \right)$ ).

The studies indicate that the device met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for each parameter as listed below.

WBC-BF: ${ \leq } 0 . 3 \%$ , or $0 . 0 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { u L }$ RBC-BF: ${ \leq } 0 . 3 \%$ , or $0 . 0 0 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mathrm { u L }$ TC-BF#: $\leq 0 . 3 \%$ , or $0 . 0 0 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { u L }$ e. Interfering Substances:

The sponsor provided reference publications to support claims of interfering substances. Fat globules, crystals and high viscous synovial fluids may cause erroneous or misleading results.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

Limit of Blank

The instrument diluent (Cellpack) was used as a blank and run 60 consecutive times in the body fluid analysis mode. Samples with target concentrations were run 60 consecutive times. Limits of Blank (LoB) and Limits of Detection (LoD) were determined using a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A. Specimens containing clots or insufficient volume were rejected. The LoB studies were performed with the following specimen types: CSF fluids $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 3 \right)$ , Synovial $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 3 \right)$ , Serous fluid $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 3 )$ . Sixty replicates were tested for each LoB and LoD at a single site.

The Mean, SD and LoB were calculated from the WBC-BF, TC-BF, RBC-BF, MN# and PMN# results. The LoB was calculated as: $\mathrm { L o B } = \mathrm { M e a n } + ( 1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { ~ x }$ SD). Results for LoB studies are found in the table below.

Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation

The data in the Limit of Detection (LoD) table was obtained from running samples with the target WBC-BF and TC-BF values of 3, 5 and $1 0 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ and target RBC-BF values of 2 and 5 cells x $1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ , MN# target values of 1 and 5 ${ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L } }$ and PMN# target values of 3 and $5 \mathrm { \ c e l l s { / \mu L } }$ . Specimens were analyzed 60 consecutive times in the Body Fluid Mode. The Mean, SD and limit of detection were calculated from the WBC-BF, TC-BF, RBC-BF, MN# and PMN# results. The limit of detection was calculated as: $\mathrm { L o D r 2 0 B + ( 1 . 6 4 5 \times S D ) }$ . The estimate of bias and imprecision was determined using the mean and standard deviation results from the LoD study. The estimate of total error was less than the manufacturer’s goal of $5 \mathrm { \ c e l l s { / \mu L } }$ for the WBC-BF, TC-BF, RBC-BF, MN# and PMN# and therefore the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is equal to the LoD.
