# Device Trade Name:

ACL TOP 700 LAS

# Regulatory Information:

Regulation Section: Coagulation Instrument (864.5400)   
Classification: Class II   
Product Code: GKP   
Panel: Hematology

# Predicate Device:

K073377

ACL TOP

# Indications for Use:

The ACL TOP is a bench top, fully automated, random access analyzer designed specifically for in vitro diagnostic clinical use in the hemostasis laboratory for coagulation and/or fibrinolysis testing in the assessment of thrombosis and/or hemostasis.

The system provides results for both direct hemostasis measurements and calculated parameters.

# Reason for Submission:

The ACL TOP $7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { L A S }$ is being introduced as a new family member to the ACL TOP (K073377), with the added feature of an extra arm and hardware to interface with laboratory automation systems (LAS). A Point-in-Space design solution is utilized where the patient sample remains under the control of the laboratory automation system (i.e., the automation track) and the ACL TOP 700 LAS analyzer aspirates an aliquot for sample analysis without removing the primary container from the automation track. The instrument's system software was also modified to interface with an IM (interface module) computer, which controls the communications to the LAS system.

NOTE: The ACL TOP 700 LAS shares with the other ACL TOP family members, the same intended use/indications for use, analytical technology/operating principle, analytical specifications, labeled performance characteristics, analytical data reduction, software, test parameters and uses the same consumables and racks.

# Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

Testing demonstrated that the performance of the ACL TOP 700 LAS is substantially equiyalent to the performance of the current legally marketed ACL TOP family (K073377).

Dear Ms. Marble:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing imajor regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
