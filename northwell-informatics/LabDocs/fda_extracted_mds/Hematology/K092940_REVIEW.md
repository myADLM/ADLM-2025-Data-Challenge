# I. Device Description:

The CoaguChek $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XS Plus for Patient Self-Testing is a portable coagulation monitoring system to monitor prothrombin time (PT) in patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy. The system uses the amperometric detection of thrombin in the blood sample. A test strip is used to determine a PT value from $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of whole blood. The system features onboard quality control on every test strip as well as optional external quality control material. The test strip incorporates quality control material that assesses strip integrity. The system also features a QC lockout feature which prevents the operator from performing a test if the QC results fail.

The CoaguChek $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XS Plus for Patient Self-Testing automatically stores up to 500 test results with date, time, patient ID, and operator ID, along with 60 code chip records in memory.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document referenced (if applicable):

None

# L. Test Principle:

When a blood sample is applied to the test strip, thromboplastin activates the coagulation cascade which leads to the formation of thrombin. Thrombin cleaves the thrombin substrate creating an electrochemically active peptide, which generates an electrical signal. The signal is converted to an INR value and displayed by the CoaguChek XS System.

The on-board quality control is a bi-level control that assesses test strip integrity. The prothrombin time (PT) test and quality control (QC) testing are performed simultaneously. The test system determines whether the quality control is within preset limits. If it is, the meter displays a short term ${ } ^ { \infty } \mathrm { Q C } \quad \overrightarrow { } ^ { , }$ , and then the PT test result. If the QC is not within limits, the meter displays “error $\mathrm { Q C } ^ { \infty }$ , and no PT test result will be displayed.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

At each study site, enrolled patients and the healthcare professionals performed duplicate measurements. The precision of duplicates was calculated for both the subjects and healthcare professionals, and the data presented by site as well as overall. The acceptance criterion was set $a s \leq 1 0 \%$ INR mean bias between the patients and healthcare professional. Mean bias was calculated using the first patient and the first healthcare professional result. All visits met the acceptance criteria.

3. Clinical studies:

A three site user study was conducted comparing test results obtained by trained users with those obtained by healthcare professionals. Both groups used the CoaguChek XS Plus System. Following face-to-face training, 103 subjects were sent home to self-test, for up to 8 weeks. Three study site visits were scheduled to collect user vs technician data. Regression analysis was performed for visits 2, 3, 4, and overall. Results demonstrated acceptable correlation.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Normal range testing was conducted on 121 patients who were not on oral anticoagulant therapy. Both capillary and venous samples were collect from each patient. Samples were tested on two lots of CoaguChek XS PT strips. Results demonstrated a normal range of 0.9 to 1.1 INR with more than $9 5 \%$ of all results falling within that range.

N. Instrument Name: CoaguChek XS Plus

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Manual, closed system

2. Software:

The CoaguChek XS software controls the user interface, buttons used to navigate the user interface and to configure the device, storage of patient results, transfer of measurement results using serial infrared communication in an open mode, transfer of production and calibration results using serial infrared communication in a protected mode, reading and storage of specific information for strip LOT from code key, calculation of PT time based on data received from measurement cycle, and checks for failsafe in order to recognize malfunctions of the measurement electronics or malfunctions within the strip used for testing.

The applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this device were reviewed under K060978.   
Yes 3 or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Date and time of testing along with patient identifier information is recorded by the CoaguChek XS meter.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Whole blood is manually applied to the target area of the test strip either from the top or side of the strip.

The CoaguChek XS Test strips are calibrated to a master reagent lot which has in turn been calibrated to a WHO International Reference Preparations (rTF/95) using the manual tilt tube method.

6. Quality Control:

The CoaguChek XS System incorporates a bi-level on-board quality control (OBC) within the CoaguChek XS test strip that monitors test strip integrity. Level 1 OBC detects strip defects such as reagent defects, capillary compression and electrode defects. Level 2 OBC directly measures strip damage due to such things as exposure to increased humidity, light, and temperature.   
The pre-determined OBC ranges are programmed into the lot specific code chip that is packaged with the matching test strip lot.   
Acceptable data was presented validating the OBC.
