# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The BC-3200 Auto Hematology Analyzer is a quantitative, automated hematology analyzer and leukocyte differential cell counter for In Vitro Diagnostic use in clinical laboratories. It consists of the analyzer, M-30 serial reagents (M-30D diluent, M-30CFL lyse, M-30R rinse, M-30E E-Z cleanser and M-30P probe cleanser), SC-CAL plus calibrators and BC-3D controls.

The BC-3200 Auto Hematology Analyzer is only to be used by trained medical professionals to identify the normal patient, with all normal system-generated parameters, and to flag or identify patient results that require additional studies. The analyzer provides analysis results of 16 parameter of human blood and three histograms.

2. Principles of Operation:

WBCs are counted and sized by the impedance method. This method is based on the measurement of changes in electrical resistance produced by a particle, which in this case is a blood cell suspended in a conductive diluent as it passes through an aperture of known dimensions. HGB is determined by the colorimetric method. RBCs and PLTs are counted by the impedance method also. In addition, for RBCs and PLTs, volumetric metering is used. An accurate cell count cannot be obtained unless the precise volume of diluted sample that passes through the aperture during the count cycle is known. The analyzer uses a volumetric metering unit to control the count cycle and to ensure that a precise volume of sample is analyzed for the measurement.

3. Modes of Operation:

Closed Vial Whole Blood Mode, Whole Blood Mode for venous blood, and Predilute Mode for capillary blood.

4. Specimen Identification: Barcode or manual keyboard entry.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Samples are manually loaded into a sample compartment one at a time. The BC3200 utilizes an automatic sampling and mixing device for sample processing. The Mindray calibrator is called SC-CAL PLUS.

6. Calibration:

The device has two calibration programs: manual calibration and auto calibration using commercial calibrators. The Mindray calibrator is called SC-CAL PLUS.

7. Quality Control:

The device has two QC programs: L-J Analysis and X-B Analysis. The Mindray three level control is called BC-3D)

8. Software:

All components of the device are controlled/monitored by software, which is responsible for the functionality, user interface, safety checks and performance accuracy.
