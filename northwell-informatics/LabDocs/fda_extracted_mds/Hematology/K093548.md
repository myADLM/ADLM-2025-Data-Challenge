807.92 (a)(2): Device name- trade name and common name, and classification

Trade name: AvieTM AIC System

Common Name: Glycosylated hemoglobin assay

Classification: CFR §21.864.7470

807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate device The AvieTM A1C Test System is substantially equivalent to other AlC test systems, and specifically, the Avie A1C System, cleared under premarket notification K091400 on 6/1 1/09. '

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The Avie A1C Test is a point of care system that utilizes a Reader and disposable test cartridges to measure %A1C in whole blood samples. Whole blood from either capillary of venous is directly applied to the sample port of a test cartridge. Insertion of the test cartridge into the reader automatically prompts the operator to add diluent. Addition of diluent lyses the red bloods cell which allows both the AlC and total hemoglobin analytes to be measured. The test completes in less than three (3) minutes. Both the A1C and Total Hemoglobin (Total Hb) analytes are measured using its own distinct wavelength. Hemoglobin from the lyzed blood is converted to met-hemoglobin and is read at $4 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ The concentration of hemoglobin is directly proportional to the intensity of met-hemoglobin concentration. For A1C the lysed blood is mixed with anti-hemoglobin antibodies conjugated to colored microparticles. After a predetermined time the microparticle mixture is automatically released onto a reagent strip where the

reacted and unreacted microparticle species are separated and read optically. The final displayed result is expressed as;   
$\begin{array} { l l l } { \% \mathrm { A 1 C } } & { = } & { \left( \mathrm { A 1 C \div T o t a l H b } \right) \times 1 0 0 } \end{array}$   
MEC Dynamics, Corp. calibrates the AvieTM A1C System using National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) certified laboratory value assigned blood samples. Lot specific information is transferred to the AvieTM A1C Reader via radio frequency identification (RFID).

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use

The AvieTM A1C System test is a point of care system that quantitatively measures $\%$ A1C (glycated hemoglobin) in capillary and venous whole blood. The AvieTM A1C System consists of the AvieTM A1C System Reader, AvieTM A1C System Test Cartridge and Avie™M A1C System Diluent. The test is for physician directed prescription home use and professional use to monitor glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. Single use, auto-disabling lancing devices are to be used in the professional setting. The device cannot be used in patients with hemoglobinopathies of Hemoglobin C and Hemoglobin D.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Nonclinical Data

Studies were done that evaluated precision, linearity, interference, operational condition limits, NGSP traceability and venous vs. fingerstick whole blood matrices for the AvieTM A1C Test System. The AvieTM AlC Test System demonstrates precision within $5 \% C V$ at each of two levels- normal and abnormal %A1C. The AvieTM A1C Test System is linear between 5 and $14 \% \mathrm { A l C }$ The Avie A1C Test System is insensitive to high physiological levels of triglyceride and bilirubin, high therapeutic levels of various over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, and hemoglobin levels ranging from approximately $9 \ \mathrm { \ g / d L }$ to $2 0 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ . The AvieTM A1C Test System may report unreliable results if there is high levels of, Hemoglobin D, Hemoglobin C or other hemoglobin variants. NGSP issued a certificate of traceability granting manufacturer certification to MEC Dynamics, Corporation.

# 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Clinical Data

Clinical studies were conducted across four sites with approximately 350 comparative data. Subjects first performed one AvieTM A1C test on themselves, and this was followed by a second AvieTM A1C test performed by a health care professional at the site. Venous blood was collected and sent to the NGSP laboratory in Columbia, MO. The regression statistics from this testing are described below. '

A comparison NGSP vs. AvieTM A1C capillary results by non-professional users testing 174 subjects showed regression statistics below:

# Non-Professional Users

A comparison NGSP vs. Avie $\frac { T M } { M }$ A1C capillary results by trained professional users testing 174 subjects showed regression statistics below:

# Professional Users

A comparison between capillary Professional vs. capillary non-professional people gave a regression statistic below. Results were gathered from 169 capillary sample pairs run on the Avie system.

Non-Professional Users $\mathbf { \sigma } = 0 . 9 9 8$ (Professional Users) $\mathbf { + 0 . 0 1 9 } \quad \mathbf { r = 0 . 9 8 4 }$

A comparison of NGSP vs. AvieTM A1C venous results by trained professional users testing 279 whole blood samples is shown below:
