3. Identification of the Legally Marketed Device:

VIDAS® D-Dimer Exclusion ™ - k040882

4. Device Description:

Polystyrene particles covalently coated with a monoclonal antibody (8D3) are aggregated when mixed with samples containing D-dimer. The D-dimer crosslinkage region has a stereosymmetrical structure, i.e. the epitope for the monoclonal antibody occurs twice. Consequently, one antibody suffices in order to trigger an aggregation reaction, which is then detected turbidimetrically via the increase in turbidity.

# INNOVANCE® D-Dimer:

For the quantitative determination of cross-linked fibrin degradation products (D-dimers) in human plasma on Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics and Sysmex® Coagulation Systems. The INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay is intended for use in conjunction with a non-high clinical pretest probability (PTP) assessment model to exclude deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The INNOVANCE $\otimes$ D-Dimer is substantially equivalent to the VIDAS® D-Dimer Exclusion ™ (k040882) assay. The INNOVANCE $\otimes$ D-Dimer method, like the VIDAS® DDimer Exclusionmethod, is intended or use in conjunction with a clinical pretest probability (PTP) assessment model to exclude deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) disease.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

Clinical Performance of the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay to exclude DVT The INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the $\overline { B } \mathsf { C S } ^ { \otimes } / \mathsf { B C S } ^ { \otimes }$ XP System in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of DVT using fresh specimens collected from 455 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected DVT. Of these 455 patients, 29 were excluded for a total of 426 patients available for final analysis.

All patients were evaluated using the Wells' rules to estimate a likely or unlikely pre-test probability (PTP) of DVT. Patient specimens were tested with the INNOVANCE® DDimer assay and results were compared to a cutoff value of $0 . 5 0 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ (FEU). A D-dimer result $< 0 . 5 0 \mathrm { \ m g / L }$ (FEU) was considered negative and a D-dimer result $2 0 . 5 0 \mathsf { m g / L }$ (FEU) was considered positive.

Patients with a positive D-dimer result were evaluated by imaging methods, e.g. compression ultrasound and/or venography. Patients with a negative D-dimer, as well as those with negative imaging results, were followed for three months to evaluate potential development of DVT. All patients were subject to imaging at the physician's discretion.

The overall prevalence of DVT in those patients available for final analysis was $2 1 . 8 \%$ (93/426). The following instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) with upper and lower $9 5 \%$ confidence limits (CL) were obtained with the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer clinical cutoff of $0 . 5 0 \mathsf { m g / L }$ (FEU).

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 \dot { 0 } ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice

requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
