# 510(k) Summary

# ST AIA-PACK HbA1c

According to the requirements of 21 CFR 807.92, the following information provides sufficient detail to understand the basis for a determination of substantial equivalence.

# Device Description:

The ST AIA-PACK HbA1c is an enzyme immunoassay which, after pretreatment, is performed entirely in ST AIA-PACK HbA1c test cups. The whole blood sample must first be pretreated prior to immunocomplex formation between HbA1c and sheep antiHbA1c polyclonal antibody. Sample pretreatment is performed to achieve complete hemolysis of erythrocytes and to expose carbohydrate part of HbA1c in the whole blood sample using ST AIA-PACK HbA1c PRETREATMENT SOLUTION $( 4 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , 20 minutes). HbA1c present in the pretreated test sample is captured on the magnetic beads along with hemoglobin and bound with enzyme-labeled sheep anti-HbA1c polyclonal antibody in the AlA-PACK test cup. The beads are washed to remove the unbound materials and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional to the HbA1c concentration in the test sample. A standard curve using a range of known standard percent concentrations aligned to NGSP % is constructed and unknown HbA1c percent concentrations are calculated using this curve

The following products are required to use the Tosoh AlA-PACK HbA1c.

# Device Intended Use:

ST AIA-PACK HbA1c is designed for In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only for the quantitative measurement for percent concentration of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in EDTA whole blood on Tosoh AlA System Analyzer. HbA1c measurement is used in the management and treatment of diabetes.

# Precision

# The precision for ST AIA-PACK HBA1c was determined based on guidance from CLSI Protocol EP5-A2.

Precision was assessed by assaying three levels of unaltered EDTA whole blood specimens. Estimates of total and within-run precision were obtained from measurements of 2 replicates in a single run, 2 times a day for 20 non-consecutive days. This equaled to a total of 40 runs and 80 determinants.

# Within Run Precision

Within-run precision was determined to be from 1.1 to $1 . 9 \%$

Dear Ms. Ogden:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amenidments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter . will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
