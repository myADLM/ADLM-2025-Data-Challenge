# Device description

The device for this submission is available as a kit only. It consists of 3 reagents.

Reagent A1 contains suspended latex particles in a buffer with stabilizers and sodium azide.

Reagent R2a and Reagent R2b are mixed to prepare a working reagent, Reagent 2. This mixture contains Mouse anti-human HbA1c monoclonal antibody and Goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in a buffer containing stabilizers and sodium azide. Reagent R3, a hemolysis reagent, is an aqueous solution containing sodium azide.

# Intended Use

ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c is intended for use in the quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in human whole blood on Vital Scientific Selectra/Flexor analyzers. It is not intended for use in Point of Care settings.

# Indication for use

Dear Ms Hutson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
