I. Device Description:

The AuditTM MicroCVTM D-Dimer Linearity Set is a human based, lyophilized, five level set of QC material, A, B, C, D, and E. Each level contains D-dimer complex. It is used to confirm the proper calibration of the measuring range of D-dimer on the miniVIDAS® analyzer. Level A D-dimer is near the lower limit level and level E Ddimer is near the upper limit of the measuring range. Levels B, C, and D are related by linear dilution of level A and level E. The target ranges for five levels are:

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP06-A: Evaluation of Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach.

L. Test Principle: The AuditTM MicroCVTM D-Dimer Linearity Set is used to verify the calibration of the D-dimer measuring range of the miniVIDAS® analyzer.

M. Performance Characteristics: 1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

For each level of D-Dimer Linearity Set, 15 replicates were tested on the miniVIDAS® on three lots. All levels resulted $< 1 0 \%$ CV.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Linearity was determined using three lots of the D-Dimer Linearity Set. The mean D-dimer concentration of each of the 5 levels was plotted vs. five assigned levels of concentration. A linear regression value was obtained for each lot, and all results were within the limit of acceptance $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } > 0 . 9 5$ .   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): • Traceability: All reagent components are obtained from commercial vendors. • Open vial stability: A 2-day open vial stability claim was verified using three lots of the AuditTM MicroCVTM D-Dimer Linearity Set. All 5 levels were tested on day zero and day 2. The percent recovery is determined in comparison to day zero values. The percent recovery is within $\pm 1 0 \%$ limit of acceptance. Closed vial stability: An accelerated stability is used to predict shelf life. The vials are stressed at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 64 days to predict two-year stability when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The percent recovery of all levels is determined in comparison to day zero values and the product is considered stable when the recovered values are within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Real time studies are ongoing to support the shelf life of the product. Value assignment: For each level of D-Dimer Linearity Set, 15 separate vials were tested on one miniVIDAS® analyzer yielding 15 measurements. The mean of each level was used to calculate the target concentration. The target range of each level was calculated as $\pm 1 \mathrm { S D }$ of the target concentration.
