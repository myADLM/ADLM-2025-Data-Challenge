# L. Test Principle:

The BioSign $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ iFOBTest is a rapid qualitative test detecting the presence of human hemoglobin (hHb) in a fecal sample at $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and above. The tube is shaken to mix the fecal sample in the extraction buffer. Then, 3 drops (about $1 1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) of the mixed sample solution is added onto the sample well of the test device. After the sample has been dispensed into the sample well, the extracted sample migrates into the pad containing detector antibody conjugated dye label. The hHb in the sample will bind to the detector antibody and migrate onto the membrane where the test and control lines are located. On the membrane, immobilized capture antibodies form the invisible Test line. When the complex of hHb and detector antibodies reaches the Test line, the complex binds to the capture antibodies to form a visible reddish Test line indicative of a positive result; i.e., hHb is present. When no hHb is present in the sample, no reddish Test line forms. In addition to the Test line, a Control line on the membrane provides an internal quality control of the test device. Anti-species specific IgG antibodies are immobilized at the Control line. These antibodies will capture any unreacted/excess antibody-gold conjugates, forming a distinct Control line. The Control line serves to demonstrate that: lyophilized antibodies in the dye pad have been hydrated; sufficient sample has been applied to allow for migration to the Test line and beyond; chemicals are working properly; and the proper procedure was followed. If a Control line does not appear within the designated incubation time, the test result is invalid and the test should be repeated using a new test device.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Human stool extraction samples were spiked with hHb at the following concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . Eight samples were tested at each concentration with two lots of the BioSign iFOB test. Samples with concentrations below $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ hHb tested negative with the candidate device while samples at and above $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ tested positive, as expected. b. Linearity/assay reportable range Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Internal Control: Procedural controls are included in the test device. A reddish line appearing the control region in considered as internal procedural control. It confirms sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and correct procedural technique. External Control: Controls are not provided with this kit. It is recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper test performance. d. Detection limit: The minimal detection limit is $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of hHb in buffer or ${ 5 0 \mu \mu \mathrm { H b } } / \mathrm { g }$ in stool. e. Analytical specificity: Positive and negative stool samples were spiked with the following substances: beet, chicken, fish (meat extract), horse, goat, pig, rabbit, and sheep hemoglobin, horseradish peroxidase, red radish, raw turnip, cauliflower, broccoli, parsnip, cantaloupe, Vitamin C and iron. Addition of these substances had no effect on the test results. g. Assay cut-off: The assay cut-off is $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of hHb in buffer or ${ 5 0 \mu \mu \mathrm { H b } } / \mathrm { g }$ in stool.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The BioSign iFOBTest was evaluated in comparison with a commercially available predicate device in a reference laboratory study. Five (5) different sample concentrations, 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g \ h H b / m L }$ , were tested using the BioSign iFOBTest device and the predicate device using 8 replicates for each concentration, for a total of 40 samples. At each concentration, all results with the BioSign iFOBTest agreed $100 \%$ with expected results and the results of the predicate.

The BioSign $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ iFOBTest was also evaluated in a study at three physicians’ office laboratory (POL) sites. Five (5) different concentrations, 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g \ h H b / m L }$ , were prepared by spiking hHb into the extraction buffer. Each concentration was divided into 60 vials for each test. These vials were labeled for blind study. Each site tested a total of 100 tests with blinded samples of 5 concentrations, 20 samples per concentration, for a total

of 300 samples. The results obtained from the three POL sites agreed $9 9 . 7 \%$ with the expected results.   
Therefore, the overall agreement of the BioSign $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ iFOBTest with the expected results is $9 9 . 7 \%$ .
