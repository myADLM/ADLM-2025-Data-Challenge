# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): Cell-ChexTM is an assayed control intended for monitoring total cell counts performed manually using a hemocytometer to validate quantitation of red and white blood cells in patient cerebrospinal fluid and body fluid samples including pleural, pericardial, peritoneal and synovial fluid.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use(s)   
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only   
4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable

# I. Device Description:

Cell-Chex™ is a stabilized suspension of human red blood cells (RBC), human white blood cells (WBC) and monosodium urate crystals (Level 1 only) in a preservative medium. In addition, Level 1 contains a low cell count and Level 2 contains a high cell count.

# L. Test Principle:

Cell-Chex™ is an in-vitro diagnostic product that is used for quality control procedures associated with body fluid counting protocols. Total cell counts are performed with a hemocytometer. Crystal analysis can be performed using light or polarized light microscopy. Differential cell counts of body fluids are performed using Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ smears stained by means of routine hematology staining techniques.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Run-to-run reproducibility: Streck produced data from 10 consecutive runs on three lots of each control level on both the hemacytometer and Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . The results fell within parameter specific assay value assignment ranges and are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for the red and white blood cell parameters. Level 1 results were positive for crystals. Level 2 results were negative for crystals.

Precision performance: Data was collected internally and at external sites. Streck selected eight external sites to run a single lot of Cell-Chex control in accordance with the product’s instructions for use (IFU) using the hemacytometer and Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . Cell-Chex control materials were stored by the external sites and handled in accordance with the IFU. The controls were run between 14-17 times over the course of several weeks. The results fell within parameter specific assay value assignment ranges and are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for the red and white blood cell parameters. Level 1 results were positive for crystals. Level 2 results were negative for crystals.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Value assignment: Specific to each lot and level of control, a total of five vials were analyzed in duplicate. A cumulative mean, standard deviation and $\% C V$ were calculated for all measurands reported using Cell-Chex™ with the hemacytometer and Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ platforms. Crystals were identified as "positive" if observed microscopically. The parameter specific assay value assignment ranges are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2$ SD for the RBC and WBC parameters.

Open vial stability: At each testing interval the vials of control were analyzed one time with the hemacytometer and Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . On non-testing days, all vials of control were removed from $2 { \cdot } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage, equilibrated to room temperature and mixed in accordance with the IFU. Three separate lots were analyzed to verify performance throughout the proposed 30 day open vial dating. The results fell within parameter specific assay value assignment ranges and are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for the red and white blood cell parameters. Level 1 results were positive for crystals. Level 2 results were negative for crystals.

Closed vial stability: The control vials were analyzed 10-15 times over the course of 60 days. Control vials were then analyzed once using both the hemacytometer and Cytospin™. Three separate lots were set up to verify performance throughout the 60 day expiration dating. The results fell within parameter specific assay value assignment ranges and are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for the red and white blood cell parameters. Level 1 results were positive for crystals. Level 2 results were negative for crystals.
