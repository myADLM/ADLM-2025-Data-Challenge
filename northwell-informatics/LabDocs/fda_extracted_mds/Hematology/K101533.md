# 4.3 Identification of the predicate

Thrombelastograph® Coagulation Analyzer (TEG®)  5000 Series K002177, Product Code JPA, Haemoscope Corp.

# 4.4 Description of the Device

The three assays are system reagents for the previously cleared (K083842) ROTEM® delta Thromboelastometry system. For clarity, the description of ROTE® delta Thromboelastometry analyzer is provided below.

The ROTEM® delta Thromboelastometry System consists of a fourcolumn instrument (with integrated computer module, computer controlled electronic pipette, software), system reagents (in-TEM®, hep-TEM®, star-TEM® ex-TEM®, fib-TEM® and ap-TEM®), quality controls (ROTROL N, ROTROL P) and measurement cells (Cup and Pin pro). The blood sample is filled into a cylindrical cup. A pin ocilates permanently while it is immersed in the blood holding cup. The motion of the pin is detected by an optical detection system. Data are processed and analyzed by a computer with special software. If no clotting takes place, the movement of the pin is not obstructed. When a clot forms and attaches itself to the pin and cup surfaces, the movement is obstructed. As the clot becomes firmer, the rotational movement of the pin is reduced. The rotational movement of the pin is converted into amplitude with the following definitions applying to the thromboelastogram (TEM): Amplitude of $0 \ m \mathsf { m }$ means unobstructed oscillation, while amplitude of 100 mm can be regarded as infinite firmness and blocking of the pin by the clot. The TEM amplitude is a measure of the clot firmness.

# 4.5 Intended Use

The ExTEM assay is a semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay used to monitor the coagulation process via the extrinsic pathway in citrated whole blood specimens on the ROTEM® delta. Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameters Clotting Time (CT), Speed of Clot Formation (CFT and alpha angle), Clot Firmness (A20/MCF) and Clot Lysis (LOT, ML, LI(x)). CFT and alpha (Speed of clot formation time) are complementary parameters and should be used in conjunction with the main parameters Clotting Time (CT) and Clot Firmness (A20/MCF).

The FIBTEM assay is a semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay on the ROTEM® delta Thromboelastometry System to monitor the clot firmness of a citrated whole blood specimens after blocking platelet contribution to the clot firmness. fib-TEM® is always used in conjunction with ex-TEM®. Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameter Clot Firmness (A20/MCF).

The APTEM assay is a semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay on the ROTEM® delta Thromboelastometry System to monitor the clot firmness of a citrated whole blood specimens after blocking hypeibrinolysis by aprotinin. ap-TEM® is always used in conjucion with ex-TEM®. Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameters Clotting Time (CT), Speed of Clot Formation (CFT and alpha angle), Clot Firmness (A20/MCF) and Clot Lysis (LOT, ML, $\lfloor  \mathsf { x }  )$ . CFT and alpha (Speed of clot formation time) are complementary parameters and should be used in conjunction with the main parameters Clotting Time (CT) and Clot Firmness (A20/MCF).

# 4.7 Executive Summary of the Study Report

The ROTEM® delta (ROTEM) Whole Blood Haemostasis System has recently been FDA cleared (K083842) using the $T E G ^ { \otimes }$ 5000 (TEG) as a predicate device. In this study, the performance characteristics of the ex-TEM®, fib-TEM® and ap$T E M ^ { \otimes }$ reagents for ROTEM® delta were evaluated. For these three tests, no commercially available TEG® 5000 tests are available, but the $T E G ^ { \otimes }$ 5000 User Manual lists on pp 11-13 recommendations on how to perform these tests using other manufacturers' reagents1.

Based on the recommendations in the $T E G ^ { \otimes }$ manual and the study protocol the three assays (EXTEM, FIBTEM and APTEM) were run on the ROTEM $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and their equivalents (as described in the $T E G ^ { \otimes }$ manual) were run on the predicate device, the TEG® in support of a $5 1 0 ( k )$ submission.

Tissue Factor (TF) is the common activator in all three tests on both ROTEM® and on TEG®. Detailed reagent compositions are shown in Table 2.

For all three tests, the $R \mathsf { O } \mathsf { T E } \mathsf { M } ^ { \otimes }$ was shown to have good precision in its primary parameter clot firmness and adequate precision in its secondary coagulation kinetics parameters (see $4 . 8 . 2 \ \textrm { -- } \ 4 . 8 . 4 )$ . The main parameters and their definitions are summarized in Table 2.

The method comparison with $T E G ^ { \otimes }$ showed equality of the clot firmness (MCF vs. MA). The kinetic parameters (CT vs. R, CFT vs. K, Alpha Angle vs. Angle) showed a linear correlation between ROTEM® and TEG® (r>0.8).

Reference ranges for the ROTEM® test were estimated using the CSLI C28-A2 guideline on three clinical US reference sample groups. The reference ranges determined showed no significant center-to-center deviations and were in accordance with the reference ranges determined in earlier studies on European reference sample groups (Table 3).

Three interfering substances widely used in coagulation management, the antifibrinolytic drugs aprotinin, tranexamic acid and epsilon-amino caproic acid (eACA) were investigated. Dose-response curves were investigated for heparin, for dilution and for urokinase on the ExTEM model in order to verify the diagnostic principles of thromboelastometric methods on ROTEM®.

In summary, ROTEM® is a precise Whole Blood Haemostasis System with the typical performance characteristics of a thrombelastographic method (no aprotinin interference on the extrinsically activated tests, high heparin insensitivity of the tests with extrinsic activation and sensitivity to dilution and lysis induced by urokinase in-vitro). Its reference ranges are reproducible from center to center.

The method comparison with $T E G ^ { \textregistered }$ shows equality of the primary parameter clot firmness and a linear regression and good correlation in the secondary kinetic parameters.

In aggregate the data presented in this report demonstrate that the ROTEM® system and the three assays described are substantially equivalent to the predicate TE $G ^ { \otimes }$ System and corresponding assays.

# 4.9 Conclusion (Statement of Equivalence)

The data and information provided in this submission support a substantial equivalence determination, and, therefore, clearance of the 510(k) premarket notification for the EXTEM-, FIBTEM- and APTEM- assays on the ROTEM® delta Thromboelastometry System.

# 5.0 Device Description and Specifications

# System Description

The previously cleared (K083842) ROTEM delta Thromboelastometry system is based on thromboelastometry, an improved form of the classicalthromboelastography $/$ thrombelastography developed by Hartert in 1948. The technique was previously called rotation thrombelastography $( \mathsf { R O T E G } ^ { \otimes } )$ , but renamed in $2 0 0 3 ^ { \ast }$ .

Thromboelastometry and thromboelastography are based on the measurement of elasticity of blood by continuous graphic logging of the firmness of a blood clot during clot formation (coagulation factors and inhibitors, platelets and fibrin) and subsequent fibrinolysis.

# The ROTEM® Measurement Principle:

The patented ROTEM® technology is based on a disposable measurement cell with a fixed cup in which a pin oscillates permanently. The motion of the pin is detected by an optical detection system. Data are processed and analysed by a computer with special software.

![](images/ae2357064392ec298998226ef69ddb9b1569a984b184e9006ab07f7185a8def9.jpg)  
Fig. 1ROTEM® measurement principle

1 oscillating axis (range 4,759   
2 counterforce spring   
3 light beam   
4 mirror   
5 CCD array (detector)   
6 sensor pin   
7 cup with blood sample   
8 fibrin strands and platelet aggregates   
9 temperature controlled cup holder   
0 ball bearing   
1 data processing unit

For measurement, the blood sample is filled into the $8 \ m m$ diameter cylindrical cup. This cup is placed on a $6 \ m m$ diameter pin which is attached to the lower end of a vertical axis. The centre section of the axis is guided by a ball bearing. The axis oscillates to the left and to the right by rotating through an angle of $4 . 7 5 ^ { \circ }$ via a s pring connector.

The rotation is detected optically via a mirror plate at the upper end of the axis, a diode as light source and a light sensitive sensor (CCD (charge-coupled device) array). If no clotting takes place, the movement is not obstructed. When a clot is formed and attaches itself to the pin and cup surfaces, the movement is obstructed.

The result is a balance between the torque introduced by the spring connector into the pin and the torque generated by the clot on the pin. As the clot becomes firmer, the rotational movement of the pin is reduced. The rotational movement of the pin is converted into amplitude with the following definitions applying to the ROTEM® delta analyzer:

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number: K101533

Device Name: EXTEM assay

# Indications for Use

The EXTEM assay is a semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay on the ROTEM® delta Thromboelastometry System to monitor the coagulation process via the extrinsic pathway in citrated whole blood specimens.

Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameters Clotting Time (CT), Speed of Clot Formation (CFT and alpha angle), Clot Firmness (A20/MCF) and Clot Lysis (LOT, ML, LI(x)).   
Speed of clot formation time (CFT and alpha) is complementary parameter and should be used only in conjunction with the main parameters Clotting time (CT) and Clot Firmness (A20/MCF).

The indication for ROTEM® delta use is in adult patients where an evaluation of their blood coagulation properties is desired. Coagulation evaluations with the ROTEM® delta system are commonly used to assess clinical conditions in organ transplantation, cardiovascular surgery, cardiology procedures and trauma to assess post-operative hemorrhage and / or thrombosis.
