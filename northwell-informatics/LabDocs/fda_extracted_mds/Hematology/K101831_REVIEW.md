C. Measurand: Human Hemoglobin (hHb) in human feces   
D. Type of Test: Qualitative   
E. Applicant: Bionostics, Inc.   
F. Proprietary and Established Names: Enterix® Insure® FIT™ FOBT Controls

# G. Regulatory Information:

4. Panel: Hematology (81)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): Enterix InSure FIT FOBT Controls are for in vitro diagnostic use only and include a positive control containing stabilized human hemoglobin and a negative control containing a buffer. This is an assayed positive and negative control and intended for the qualitative test determinations of Enterix InSure FIT product. Enterix InSure FIT FOBT Controls are for exclusive use with Enterix InSure FIT product. These controls can be used to independently verify the functionality and performance of the InSure FIT test by laboratories and other professional medical institutions as part of a comprehensive quality assurance program.   
2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use   
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Prescription use only   
4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable

# I. Device Description:

Enterix Insure FIT FOBT Control Solution is a two-level (positive & negative), aqueous control solution. The positive control solution contains $3 4 . 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ of human hemoglobin per gram of solution and the negative control contains only buffer solution. It is used to verify the proper functioning of the analytical phase of the Insure FIT Fecal Occult Blood Test Kit.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The Enterix Insure FIT FOBT Control solutions are assayed and intended for qualitative test determinations. It is prepared at two concentrations of human hemoglobin and is used to verify the performance of the Enterix Insure FIT FOB test device. This test is based on the detection of human hemoglobin (hHb) in stool specimens. The negative control solution produces one distinct color band in the control area and the positive control solution produces two color bands in the control and the test area of the lateral flow strips of the test device.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Ten consecutive runs on three lots of each control level- negative and positive were performed. All ten runs of the negative control solution on each of the three lots tested negative while the control area tested positive. Similarly all ten runs of the positive control solution on each of the three lots tested positive in the test area and the control area. The results were as expected.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Value assignment: Positive control solutions were tested on a spectrophotometer in parallel to three replicates per sample of solutions with hemoglobin concentrations established by dilution $( 0 , 1 0 , 2 5 , 4 0 , 5 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g } )$ . The hemoglobin concentration of the positive solution was determined based on the equation of the line (slope and intercept) established by this dilution.   
d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
$f .$ Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Positive and negative controls from 10 replicates from three lots were tested on two different predicates. For both the negative and positive control solutions, the results agreed $100 \%$ with the expected results and the results of the predicates.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
