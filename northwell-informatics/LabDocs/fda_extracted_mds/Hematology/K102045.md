# 4. Device Descriptions:

The Dimension Vista® HbA1c kit contains Flex® reagent cartridges and calibrator. Each cartridge contains reagents used to measure total hemoglobin and hemoglobin A1c. the reagents are liquid and ready to use on the instrument. The calibrator in the kit is a five level lyophilized product. Each level is hydrated with $2 . 0 m L$ of reagent grade water. The lot matched reagents and calibrator product are for use on the Dimension Vista® Systems.

Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. Dimension Visa® HbA1c method and calibrator 510(k) Notification

A split sample method comparison was also performed with the new device, Dimension Vista $\otimes$ HbA1c kit and the Tosoh lon Exchange HPLC analyzer using ninety- one (91) human whole blood samples preserved with EDTA. The HbA1c values from 4.6 to $9 . 6 \%$ HbA1c were used in a Bland-Altman bias analysis. The analysis is as follows:

Mean Bias = - 0.04 %HbA1c   
$S D = 0 . 2 6$ %HbA1c   
Upper $9 5 \%$ EY $C 1 = 0 . 4 7 \%$ HbA1c   
Lower $9 5 \% 0 C l = - 0 . 5 6 \% l$ HbA1c
