# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description: The BD FACS Sample Prep Assistant III is a microprocessor-controlled pipetting and diluting system which automatically prepares whole blood samples using the lyse / no-wash sample preparation method for flow cytometry. Used as an accessory to the BD FACSCanto flow cytometer, the SPA III combines fluidic, optic, robotic, and electronic components to automatically prepare samples for acquisition and analysis with a flow cytometer.

2. Principles of Operation:

The SPA III pierces the sample tube cap to withdraw sample, aliquots blood and reagent into daughter tubes, and mixes the sample according to preprogrammed or custom protocols. The device also adds lysing solution and automates cleaning procedures. The unit consists of an enclosure, one robotic pipetting module moving in the X/Y/Z axes, a power supply, a central controller unit, fluid pumps, and a barcode reader.

3. Modes of Operation: Automatic, closed mode.

4. Specimen Identification: To enter the ID, one can scan a primary tube with the barcode scanner, or manually type a unique identification code (Sample ID) into the worklist.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The carousel rack holds up to 40 uncapped $1 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 7 5 \mathrm { ~ m m }$ polystyrene secondary tubes and is compatible with the BD FACS™ Loader. Each rack has an identification code stamped on top. A work list can be generated to enter primary tube identification, tube type, position, panel, and secondary tube positions.

6. Calibration: Not applicable

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy: Accuracy was assessed based on Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline, CLSI document EP9-A2.

The SPA III was compared to the manual pipetting using the BD Multitest 6- Color TBNK Reagent with BD Trucount Tubes in a 3 site external clinical study. Each site analyzed 255 patient specimens. For $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ ,

$\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + }$ and $\mathrm { C D 3 + }$ (percent and absolute values) mean bias was within $\pm 1 . 0$ and met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria of $9 5 \%$ CI on bias $\leq 1 0 \%$ . For CD3-CD $1 9 +$ and CD3-C $\textcircled { 1 6 + 1 } 5 6 +$ (percent and absolute values) mean bias was within $\pm 4 . 0 \%$ and met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria of $9 5 \%$ CI on bias $\leq 2 0 \%$ .

The SPA III with the BD FACSCanto system demonstrated equivalent performance.

$b$ . Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was assessed based on Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved Guideline, CLSI document EP5-A2. Pipetting precision was assessed gravimetrically for the BD-defined Multitest protocol using normal donor blood, BD Multi-Check process control, reagent buffer (to represent reagent). The performance for pipetting blood was found to be within the manufacturer’s specifications of $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } \pm 3 \%$ and the performance for pipetting reagent was found to be within the manufacturer’s specifications of $2 0 \mu \mathrm { L } \pm 7 \%$ .

Precision of the staining and lysing of samples was also assessed. This was demonstrated by measuring the closeness of agreement between independent test/measurement results obtained under stipulated conditions. These conditions include multiple operators (3), multiple instruments (3 SPA III), and duration of testing (21 days) run twice daily in duplicate. The study samples were CD-Chex normal (CDN) and CD-Chex CD4 low (CDL) stained with BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK Reagent in BD Trucount Tubes.

Measurements for this study were the absolute counts and percentages of the following lymphocyte subsets: $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + }$ , CD3-CD19+ and $\mathrm { C D 3 - C D 1 6 + C D 5 6 + }$ . The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria were as follows:

Absolute counts: $9 5 \%$ upper CI on the $C V \leq 1 0 \%$ for $\mathrm { C D 3 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ and $\mathrm { C D 8 + }$ $9 5 \%$ upper CI on the $C V \leq 2 0 \%$ for $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 +$ and $\mathrm { C D } 1 6 { + } 5 6 { + }$

Percent positives: $9 5 \%$ upper CI on the $\mathrm { S D } \leq 2 . 5$

Study results indicate that the device performed according to the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria.

c. Linearity:

Not applicable $d .$ . Carryover:

Carryover was assessed based on recommendations contained in Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Premarket Notifications for Automated Differential Cell Counters for Immature or Abnormal Blood Cells; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA, December 4, 2001.

Sample carryover was tested using three donors (in duplicate) on three SPA III instruments. These studies indicated that the device performed within the manufacturer’s specification of $< 0 . 2 \%$ .

Reagent carryover was tested using three donors (in duplicate) on three SPA III instruments. These studies indicated that the device performed with a carry over that was within the manufacturer’s specification of $< 0 . 0 1 \%$ . The SPA III with the BD FACSCanto system demonstrated system carryover within specification.
