# 7. Method Comparison

A split sample method comparison was conducted using the new device, Dimension $\otimes$ HB1C kit vs. the predicate, BIO-RAD Variant I Hemoglobin A1c. One hundred and twenty- six (126) human whole blood samples preserved with EDTA ranging from 4.4 to 16.3% HbA1c [25 - 160 mmol/mol] were used. The data was analyzed using Deming regression analysis. The analysis is as follows:

Dear Ms. Ennis:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
