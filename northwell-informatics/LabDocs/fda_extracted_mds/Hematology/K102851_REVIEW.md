# L. Test Principle:

In the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), factor VIII deficient plasma provides normal activity for all procoagulants except for factor VIII. When normal plasma is added to factor VIII deficient plasma, the APTT reverts to normal. Factor VIII activity in a patient’s plasma is determined by performing a modified activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Patient plasma is diluted and added to NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma. The APTT clotting time of this mixture is inversely proportional to factor VIII concentration $\%$ activity) in the patient plasma.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three lots of NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma were evaluated for precision using the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ analyzer and Stago PTT Automate 5 reagent. Acceptance criteria were $< 1 0 \%$ for within-run $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and $< 1 5 \%$ for within-device $\% \mathrm { C V }$ . FVIII activity measurements of normal control plasma (System N) and abnormal control plasma (System P) were analyzed in duplicate for each run, with two runs per day, over a total of 20 days $( \mathtt { n } = 8 0$ per lot). The calculated within-run $\% C V$ and within-device $\% \mathrm { C V }$ met the acceptance criteria.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed using three lots of NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma on the STA Compact $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ analyzer using Stago PTT Automate 5 reagent and Stago $\mathrm { S T A @ }$ Unicalibrator. A series of 11 FVIII concentrations ranging from $0 . 7 \%$ to $1 6 0 \%$ were created by reconstituting ISTH standard plasma and diluting with imidizole buffered saline. The FVIII dilutions were run in duplicate for each NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma lot and the average activities were plotted against their assigned values. Acceptance criterion for allowable total nonlinearity was $1 5 \%$ and each lot of NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma results were linear within the criterion. The results support the claimed assay reportable range of $1 \% - 1 6 0 \%$ FVIII activity. The calculated slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient are provided in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.055</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99977</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.988</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99961</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.04</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99941</td></tr></table>

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Real Time Stability: Three lots of NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma were stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and at periodic times vials were reconstituted for stability testing. The study was performed on the STA Compact $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ using Stago PTT Automate 5 reagent to determine the recovery of FVIII activity for System N and System P controls. Real time stability was tested for 26, 28, and 33 months and all results were within the control acceptance range. Results for accelerated stability, which projects a 2.4 year shelf life, support a 2-year shelf life claim of NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Ongoing real-time stability testing will be used to update the shelf life.

Reconstituted Stability: Vials from 3 lots of NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma were reconstituted and stored at 2, 6, 8 and 24 hours at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . An additional set of vials were stored at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours at room temperature $\mathrm { 1 8 - 2 6 ^ { \circ } C ) }$ . The recovered FVIII activity values at the time of reconstitution were considered the "zero hour" baseline. At the time periods after reconstitution, vials from both sets of temperatures were run and the recovery at that time point was determined. These recoveries were compared to the baseline recovery by calculating the $\%$ shift in value: (baseline value - time point value) divided by (baseline value). The criterion for acceptance was a shift of $\leq 1 0 \%$ . The data indicate that the $\%$ shift at each relevant time point tested met the specified limitation. Reconstituted NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma is stable for 4 hours when stored at room temperature $( 1 8 \small { - } 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and for 8 hours when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were conducted by spiking pooled normal plasma (PNP) with various concentrations of hemoglobin, bilirubin, and triglycerides. Each PNP interferent dilution was then assayed for its FVIII activity on the STA Compact $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ using Stago PTT Automate 5 and NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma. The maximum concentration tolerated in the study was defined as the highest concentration of interferent wherein a shift relative to the recovered value of the unspiked PNP clotting time was less than $10 \%$ . Study results showed that factor VIII activity using NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma is not affected by hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , unconjugated bilirubin up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and triglycerides up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . f.

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

Fresh vs. Once Thawed Samples – FVIII activity was tested on patient and donor samples using the Stago PTT Automate 5 reagent on the STA Compact $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ analyzer. Eighteen (18) patient samples (9 normal and 9 abnormal) were used for the study. After testing the fresh samples, samples were split and stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and ${ - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ for one to three days. Each sample was then thawed and re-tested. Acceptance criterion was $\mathbf { r } > 0 . 9 0$ . Regression analysis produced a slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient (r) of 1.064, $- 0 . 0 2$ , and 0.994 respectively for the $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ samples and a slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient (r) of 0.863, 0.02, and 0.998 respectively for the $- 8 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ samples.
