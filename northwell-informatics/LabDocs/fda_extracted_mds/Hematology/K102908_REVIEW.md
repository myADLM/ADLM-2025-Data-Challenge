# L. Test Principle:

The assay determines the functional activity of Factor IX by measuring the degree of prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time in the presence of a contact activator, thromboplastin, phospholipids and calcium ions. Factor IX activity is correlated with the prolongation of the clotting time of the Factor IX deficient plasma when added to diluted patient plasma. The APTT clotting time of this mixture is inversely proportional to factor IX concentration $\%$ activity) in the patient plasma.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Studies for within-run, lot-to-lot and within-device precision were performed on low $\%$ activity factor IX pooled plasma for 10 days along with normal and high controls for 20 days. The controls and low $\%$ activity pooled plasma were tested with 3 lots of Stago PTT-A reagent and 3 lots of NoFACT IX deficient plasma on the Stago STA Compact analyzer. Testing was conducted twice a day with two replicates per run for each sample. The acceptance criteria for within-run and lot-to-lot $\% \mathrm { C V }$ is ${ < } 1 0 \%$ and for within device $\% \mathrm { C V }$ is $< 1 5 \%$ . The overall results of the study met the acceptance criteria as follows:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were performed using the Stago PTT-A reagent on the STA Compact analyzer. The assays were calibrated using the Stago Unicalibrator. A series of 11 dilutions was conducted from reconstituted ISTH SSC approved plasma and diluted with the assay diluent and was tested at concentrations ranging from 0.8 to $1 8 8 \%$ activity. Duplicate measurements of each dilution were obtained with each of 3 lots of NoFACT IX. The Factor IX dilutions were run in duplicate for each NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma lot and the average activities were plotted against their assigned values The acceptance criteria were as follows: slope of 0.8-1.2, intercept $< 6 . 0$ and $\mathrm { r } { > } 0 . 9$ The calculated slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient are provided in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NoFact IX Deficient Plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r-value</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.212</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.57</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9998</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.084</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.168</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9959</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lot 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.066</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.815</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9979</td></tr></table>

The results of the study were within acceptable limits.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Real-time Stability:

Three lots of NoFACT IX Deficient Plasma were tested with Stago System N and P control plasmas for factor IX recovery for real-time stability. The lots were tested on the Stago STA Compact using Stago PTT-A, Stago System N and P control plasmas, and Stago Unicalibrator. The NoFact IX plasma was stored, reconstituted and tested from 0 months through 33 months at specific time intervals. Factor IX recovery of all three lots was acceptable based on the established reference range of each control. Results for the accelerated stability study, which projects a 2.4 year shelf life, support a 2-year shelf life claim of NoFact IX Deficient Plasma when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Ongoing realtime stability testing will be used to update the shelf life.

Reconstituted stability at Room Temperature and $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ :

Two lots of NoFact IX Deficient Plasma were reconstituted according to the package insert. The Stago PTT-A and NoFact IX deficient plasma assay was used to test the System N and P controls for factor IX recovery. The recovered FIX activity values at the time of reconstitution were considered the "zero hour" baseline. The reconstituted vials were stored at 0, 2 ,6, 8 and 24 hours at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 0, 4, 6 and 8 hours at room temperature. At the time periods after reconstitution, vials from both sets of temperatures were run and the recovery at that time point was determined. These recoveries were compared to the baseline recovery by calculating the $\%$ shift in value: (baseline value - time point value) divided by (baseline value). The acceptance criterion is a shift of $\leq 1 0 \%$ compared to the zero hour baseline. The overall results meet the acceptance criteria with study results at room temperature of ${ < } 8 . 1 \%$ and $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ at $< 7 . 5 \%$ . Stability data supports the reconstituted stability claim of 8 hours at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 4 hours at room temperature.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were conducted using pooled normal plasma (PNP) spiked with the interferents at predetermined maximum concentrations to create a stock preparation. The stock preparation was serially diluted 12 times with PNP in which each dilution was tested for factor IX activity on the STA Compact using Stago PTT-A and NoFACT IX. The $\%$ difference between the spiked dilutions to baseline (PNP) was accessed with an overall $\%$ difference $< 6 \%$ , which met the acceptance criteria difference of $< 1 0 \%$ .
