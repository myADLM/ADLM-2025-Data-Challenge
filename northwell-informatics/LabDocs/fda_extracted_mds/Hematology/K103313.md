# Device Name and Classification

Trade Name: Common Name: Regulation Number: Product Code: Classification:

Heparin Assay Controls   
Plasma, Coagulation Control   
21 CFR 864.5425   
GGN   
Class II

# Predicate Device

Medtronic Heparin Assay Controls (K894317 and K042206) cleared on September 5, 1989 and October 1, 2004, respectively.

# Comparison to Predicate Device

A comparison of the modified device and the currently marketed Heparin Assay Controls shows the following similarities:

2 Same intended use.   
• Same operating principle.   
. Same technological characteristics. Same performance claims.

# Description of Device Modification

# Heparin

The modification to the current control is to replace old USP heparin with revised USP heparin from the new heparin monograph that became effective October 1, 2009. The source of the heparin remains porcine.

# Intended Use

The intended use is unchanged.

# Labeling

The current labels are unchanged by this device modification. The current Instructions for Use (IFU) has been updated for style, grammar and readability. Applicable tables have also been updated with information on the construction of the modified controls using revised USP heparin.

Appendix A contains the current IFU. • Appendix B contains the draft IFU. Appendix C contains the current labels

# Conclusion

The modifications to the Medtronic Heparin Assay Controls described in this submission result in a substantially equivalent device because verification testing indicated that the fundamental scientific technology and the intended use are unchanged.

Dear Mr. Koll:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Tile 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRHl's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
