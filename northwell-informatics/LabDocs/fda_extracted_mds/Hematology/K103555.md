The Multiplate 5.0 has been found to be substantially equivalent to the previously cleared Chronolog Model 700 Whole Blood Lumi-Aggregometer (K050265).

# 1. Device Description

The Multiplate® 5.0 measures platelet function in whole blood samples using electrical impedance. The Multiplate technology employs multiple electrodes in a disposable test cell. Four electrodes form two independent sensor units allowing for two measurements on the same sample. Five independent channels of the instrument allow for testing of multiple reagents or samples simultaneously.

The instrument provides a five channel aggregometer and an integrated computer system with associated software and is connected to a computer screen, keyboard, mouse, and an electronic pipette. The software is used for data collection and is not used for diagnosis or treatment.

Currently, two test reagents (ADP and Arachidonic acid) are available that activate platelets through specific platelet membrane receptor/signal transduction pathways in order to measure platelet function or alterations in function.

# 2. Intended Use

The Multiplate 5.0 aggregometer is intended for in vitro use to measure platelet aggregation in response to Arachidonic acid or ADP in citrated whole blood samples for the qualitative assessment of platelet function.

The ADPtest reagent is a lyophilized preparation of adenosine-5-diphosphate for in vitro diagnostic use to measure platelet aggregation for the qualitative assessment of platelet function. For professional laboratory use only.

The ASPltest reagent is a lyophilized preparation of arachidonic acid (AA) for in vitro diagnostic use to measure platelet aggregation for the qualitative assessment of platelet function. For professional laboratory use only.

# 3. Technical Description

The Multiplate uses the same scientific principles of detection as the predicate Chrono-log Model 700 with the exception that it does not include the capability of platelet function measurement based on luminescence or turbidimetric light transmission measurement.

Both devices employ the same principle of measurement: electrical impedance, first cited in 1980 by Cardinal and Flower, (J Pharmacol Methods.1980;3:135-158). An electrical current passes through individual sets of electrodes. When the electrodes come into contact with a whole blood sample platelets bind to and cover the electrodes in a small monolayer. As the platelets become activated after exposure to a specific platelet agonist, the platelets strongly adhere to the electrodes and begin to aggregate. An increase in the number of platelets adhering to the electrodes increases the resistance (impedance) between the pair of electrodes.

Potential improvements of the Multiplate system are the introduction of dual sensor technology that records two measurements in each test cell based on two individual pairs of electrodes. The mean value is then reported. The final measurement is reported in Units (U) which represents the area under the curve that is generated by graphing the change in resistance.

# 4. Performance

Multi-center studies were run to compare the performance of the Multiplate 5.0 to the predicate device. Samples from 171 patients suspected of decreased platelet function were drawn and measured in duplicate.

The positive and negative percent agreements of the Multiplate to the Chrono-log were calculated. The results were considered positive if the test value was below the reference range for the specific device. The results were considered negative if they fell within the reference range for the specific device. Using this data, the positive percent agreements (PPA) and negative percent agreements (NPA) were calculated.

Sensitivity and Specificity were analysed by considering samples from 91 patients suspected of decreased platelet function which were drawn and measured in duplicate. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated against Platelet Function Status. Platelet Function Status qf each sample was based upon a physician panel's review of each patient's clinical history.

Dear Dr. Zucker:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of July 27, 2012.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
