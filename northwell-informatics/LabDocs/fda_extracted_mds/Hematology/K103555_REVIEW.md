# L. Test Principle:

The principle of measurement of the Multiplate device is electrical impedance. An electrical current passes through individual sets of electrodes. When the electrodes come into contact with a whole blood sample platelets bind to and cover the electrodes in a small monolayer. As the platelets become activated after exposure to a specific platelet agonist, the platelets strongly adhere to the electrodes and begin to aggregate. An increase in the number of platelets adhering to the electrodes increases the resistance (impedance) between the pair of electrodes. The Multiplate software plots these changes as a curve. The instrument transforms the measured signal into units (U), which are dependent on the change of resistance. The aggregation is plotted against the time and the area under the measuring curve is expressed as units (U).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Donor samples containing low $( < 3 4 0$ for ADP and ${ < } 3 2 \mathrm { U }$ for AA), medium (between 34 and 52U for ADP and between 32 and 48U for AA) and high $( > 5 2 0$ for ADP and ${ > } 4 8 \mathrm { U }$ for AA) platelet function levels were tested with three lots of reagents, using three different devices and two different operators. For each configuration, samples were measured in duplicate. The experiment was repeated for 10 days for high and medium platelet function level samples. Low platelet function samples were repeated for 5 days.

The percent positive and negative agreement for the ADPtest and ASPItest at low and high level platelet function samples was $100 \%$ . At medium platelet levels, the following observations were made:

ADPtest- The measurements for precision were performed with freshly drawn blood from donors, tested with three different lots of reagent, using three different devices, and two different operators. For each configuration two replicates were measured. The experiment was repeated for a minimum of five days with a new blood draw on each day. Samples from one donor each with high, medium, and low platelet function levels were tested. Agreement for the high and low platelet function level samples was $100 \%$ for device and lot variabilities. Lot-to-lot variability with medium platelet function levels around the cut-off determined a mean of 15.7 (15-17) for samples determined to have decreased platelet function level and 43.7 (43-45) for samples which exhibit normal platelet function. Comparably, the mean observations for the device variability study were 16.3 (11-24) for samples with decreased platelet function, and 43.7 (36-49) for normal samples. The repeatability study showed similar results as the reproducibility study.

ASPItest- The measurements for precision were performed with freshly drawn blood from donors, tested with three different lots of reagents, using three different devices, and two different operators. For each configuration two replicates were measured. The experiment was repeated for a minimum of five days with a new blood draw on each day. Samples from one donor each with at high, medium, and low platelet function levels were tested. Agreement for the high and low platelet function level samples was $100 \%$ for device and lot variabilities. Lot-to-lot variability with medium platelet function levels around the cut-off determined a mean of 28 (23-34) for samples determined to have decreased platelet function level and 32 (26-37) for samples which exhibit normal platelet function. Likewise, the mean observations for device variability study were 28 (22-37) for samples with decreased platelet function, and 32 (23-38) for normal samples. The repeatability study showed similar results as the reproducibility study.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Increasing concentrations of platelet function antagonists (Aspirin for the Arachidonic acid assay and Thienopyridine for the ADP assay) were added to blood samples from healthy donors prior to measurement. The linear range

was determined by linear regression.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls - The control material that is available for the Verum Multiplate 5.0 aggregometer consists of two liquids of different ionic strengths. The liquid quality control is an artificial quality control to ensure the quality of the electronic parts and sensors of the Multiplate system by evaluating the resistance measurement of the system. Because the controls are used for a functional test, they do not contain a specific analyte. Rather, mixing of the 2 controls at varying proportions provides two distinct levels of resistance that are representative of two distinct ranges or measurements on the Verum Multiplate system.

Expected Values - Value assignment for the liquid control material is performed by comparison testing at 11 sites for a total of 200 measurements per control, assessed as amplitude of the electrical signal produced by the control, expressed in Amplitude Units (AU). In accordance with CLSI guideline C28-A3c, a reference range is established using the inner $90 \%$ confidence interval.

Results were rounded to the next full integer. Based on the CI limits, acceptable values for control measurements were set at 50-75 AU for level 1 and 100-140 AU for level 2. Each new lot of liquid control material is tested and must meet established performance values and pass accelerated stability testing.

Stability claims - Stability of the lyophilized reagents, frozen reagents, reconstituted reagents, controls and test cells was determined. The shelf life stability of the control material was established by performing accelerated and real-time stability studies. Expiration dates are assigned based on real time stability. All test passed the acceptance criteria of a mean difference of claimed stability time point and $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { t } } = 0$ of $\leq 1 2 \%$ .

Not applicable f. Assay cut-off:

260 healthy volunteers with no known bleeding disorders who reported to have abstained from intake of anti-platelet agents were tested with the Verum Multiplate 5.0 aggregometer Arachidonic acid and ADP assays in three centers. One measurement was omitted as outlier. The reference intervals were calculated as the inner $90 \%$ confidence interval. Results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Test</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No. ofMeasurements</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean(U)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>StandardDeviation(U)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5thPercentile(U)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95thPercentile(U)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ReferenceInterval(U)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Arachidonicacid(0.5mM)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>260</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>63.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>91</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40-91</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ADP(10μM)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>259</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>67.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>43</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>92</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>43-92</td></tr></table>

3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

The evaluation of the platelet function status (normal/abnormal) via the Multiplate 5.0 aggregometer was compared to the clinical assessment of a three member adjudication panel using the patient clinical history. To this end, 260 patients suspected of platelet dysfunction were tested at three clinical sites using the Verum Multiplate 5.0 or the predicate device using the ADP and Arachidonic Acid reagents. The presence of normal or abnormal platelet function was determined using the cut-off of ${ < } 4 3 \mathrm { U }$ for ADPtest and ${ < } 4 0 \mathrm { U }$ for ASPItest. Due to restricted access to patient data through the local IRB at one site, the patient history files (including laboratory results, clinical history, clinical procedures, demographic data, etc.) of 171 study patients were further assessed by 2 adjudicators for presence of abnormal platelet function based on the information in each subject’s clinical history. In case of disagreement, a third panel member made the final determination. Patient sample histories were numbered sequentially and no identifiers allowed for patient identification or identification of the clinical testing site.
