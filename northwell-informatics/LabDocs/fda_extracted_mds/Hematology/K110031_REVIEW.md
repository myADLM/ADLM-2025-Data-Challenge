The HemosIL dRVVT Screen and HemosIL dRVVT Confirm assays are qualitative in-vitro diagnostic products to aid in the detection of lupus anticoagulants in human citrated plasma by the diluted Russell’s Viper Venom method, on the ACL $\mathrm { T O P { ‰} }$ Family. The HemosIL dRVVT Screen and HemosIL dRVVT Confirm assays are intended to evaluate patients who have unexplained prolonged APTT test results The HemosIL dRVVT Screen and HemosIL dRVVT Confirm assays should be used in parallel as an integrated test for Lupus Anticoagulant detection.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as above

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements:

For use on IL Coagulation systems ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP Base and ACL TOP 500 CTS).

# I. Device Description:

HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVVT Screen and Confirm assay uses diluted Russell viper venom to detect lupus anticoagulant. HemosIL dRVVT Screen assays are a lyophilized reagent containing a low concentration of phospholipids, anti-heparin agents, calcium, buffer, stabilizers and a dye. The HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVVT Confirm assay has a higher concentration of phospholipids than the HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Screen assay. Both assays together are to be used as part of profile to detect lupus anticoagulants. HemosIL dRVVT Screen and Confirm assays are packaged as $1 0 - 2 \mathrm { m l }$ vials. HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LAC assays are the parent assay to the HemosIL dRVVT Screen and Confirm. The assays differ based on current in-house manufacturing and prolonged assay stability claims. dRVVT Screen and Confirm are an integrated test as referenced in the ISTH 2009 committee recommendation for Lupus Anticoagulant Detection.

# L. Test Principle:

Lupus Anticoagulants (LA) belongs to the group of antiphospholipid antibodies which are directed against negatively-charged phospholipids or complexes between phospholipids and proteins (either $\beta$ -2-glycoprotein I or clotting factors such as prothrombin). When determined by their ability to prolong phospholipid-dependent tests (APTT, SCT, dRVVT), these antibodies are referred as LA. Patients with LA are at increased risk of clinical complications such as thrombosis and recurrent miscarriages.

The dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm assays are improved dRVVT reagents intended to simplify and standardize the detection of LA in clinical evaluations1, 3. The dRVVT Screen assay is poor in phospholipid, making it sensitive to LA. The additional amount of phospholipid (bi-layers) in dRVVT Confirm neutralizes LA to give shorter clotting times.

Russell’s Viper Venom, in the presence of calcium, directly activates factor X (in the test sample). The dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm assays are therefore unaffected by contact factor abnormalities, factor VII, VIII and IX deficiencies or inhibitors. Heparin interference up to $1 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ is neutralized by polybrene. As a result, dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm are more specific tests for the evaluation of LA than APTT.

dRVVT Screen and Confirm are being used as an integrated test as referenced in the ISTH 2009 committee recommendation for Lupus Anticoagulant Detection.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed on three reagent lots of HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVVT Screen and Confirm analyzing three lots of HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LA Negative, Weak Pos and Positive controls. Results (clotting time in seconds) were determined from testing two runs per day over 20 days on three ACP TOP family (ACL TOP base and ACL TOP 500CTS) analyzers according to CLSI EP5-A2. The mean, SD and $9 5 \%$ CI were calculated for each analyte. The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of the average clotting times was $< 5 \%$ and was within the acceptance criteria of $\leq 6 \%$ for repeatability and $\leq$ $6 \%$ for reproducibility. The acceptance criteria are based on the normalized ratio value:

Level 1: HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Negative control: NR ${ \leq } 1 . 1 0 $ (k102552) Level 2: HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LA Weak Positive: ${ \mathrm { N R } } \geq 1 . 2 5$ and $< 1 . 4 0$ (In-house) Level 3: HemosIL LA Positive control: $\ge 1 . 4 0$ (k102252)

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The reconstituted stability of the HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVVT Screen and HemosIL $^ { \textregistered }$ dRVVT Confirm reagents were assessed by longitudinal studies. With criteria of an age-related trend and a maximum shift of $6 \%$ of the zero point clotting time, the predicted reconstituted stability of the HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVVT Screen and HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ dRVVT Confirm reagents are 15 days when reconstituted and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 days on board stability when stored at $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and up to a 2 year lyophilized shelf life at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . (based on accelerated study). Real time stability testing is on-going for the 2 yr shelf life.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were determined on the ACL TOP instrument family line (ACL TOP, ACL TOP 500CTS) for HemosIL $^ { \textregistered }$ dRVVT Screen and Confirm. Interferents were spiked into 3 levels of pooled normal plasma, weak LA positive plasma and high LA positive plasma at various concentrations with acceptance criteria of $\leq 1 5 \%$ compared to the un-spiked control results.

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

A study comparing $3 . 2 \%$ versus $3 . 8 \%$ citrated plasma was performed. Two blood samples were drawn, from 26 donors, using both a $3 . 2 \%$ and $3 . 8 \%$ sodium citrate sample tubes respectively. The plasma from each donor was promptly recovered from the sample by centrifugation, in accordance with the updated 2009 ISTH guideline for Lupus anticoagulant detection. Two pools, with different sodium citrate concentrations, were prepared using the same volume of citrated plasma from each donor. Artificial LA-Positive samples were prepared by spiking with different amounts of $\beta 2 \mathrm { g P l }$ antibodies to produce a range of concentrations. A total of 24 pairs of samples were prepared in this manner. The results of the study based on statistical analysis meeting the outlined specifications are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.8 v. 3.2% NaCitrate</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PPA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CI 95%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NPA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CI 95%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ACL TOP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>19/19 -100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>83.2-100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24/26 (92%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>75.9-97.9%</td></tr></table>

A fresh vs. frozen study was conducted in which 26 sample from normal patients were spiked with different concentration of $\beta 2 \mathrm { g P L }$ antibodies. A set of the 26 samples were maintained at room temperature while another set of the 26 samples were frozen at ${ } _ { - 6 4 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours and thawed at room temperature. Both sets of samples were tested on the ACL TOP and the test results calculated based the established normalized ratio cutoff. The compared normalized ratio for both sets of frozen ad room temperature samples were expressed as positive and negative result agreement (PPA and NPA) as the following:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fresh vs. Frozen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PPA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CI 95%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NPA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CI 95%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ACL TOP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>28/28 (100%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>87.9% -100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>26/26 (100%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>87.1% -100%</td></tr></table>
