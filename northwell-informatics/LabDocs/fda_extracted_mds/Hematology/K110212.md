# D. Device Description:

The INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional and Home) perform a modified version of the one-stage Prothrombin Time test, using commercially available recombinant human thromboplastin (rhTP) reagent. The clot formed in the Prothrombin Time (PT) reaction is detected by a change in the electrical impedance of the sample during the coagulation process. The system consists of a monitor and disposable test strips. The monitor heats the test strip to the proper reaction temperature; a measure clot impedance and provides a result on a screen (user interface). The clotting reaction occurs on the Test Strip after the blood sample is applied. An International Normalized Ratio (INR) value is calculated from measured Prothrombin Time and the INR is displayed on the monitor to the user/patient.

# E. Intended Uses:

Alere INRatio $\mathfrak { B } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Monitoring System (Professional Use): The Alere INRatio®2 PT/INR Monitoring System (Professional Use), consisting of the INRatio $\mathfrak { B } 2$ Monitor and INRatio $\textcircled{8} 2$ PT/INR test strip, is used for quantitative determination of international normalized ratio (INR) in fresh capillary whole blood to monitor the effect of warfarin on clotting time by health care professionals. The Alere INRatio ${ \mathfrak { G } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Monitoring System (Professional Use) is intended for use outside of the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The Alere INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Monitoring System (Professional Use) is not intended to be used for screening purposes.

Limitations: The Alere INRatio ${ \mathfrak { G } } _ { 2 }$ PT/NR Monitoring System (Professional Use) is not intended for use in patients who are transitioning from heparin treatment to warfarin therapy.

Alere INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Home Monitoring System: The Alere INRatic $\mathfrak { P } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Home Monitoring System, consisting of the INRatio®2 Home Monitor and INRatio02 PT/INR test strip, is used for quantitative determination of international normalized ratio (INR) in fresh capillary whole blood to monitor the effect of warfarin therapy on clotting time by properly selected suitably trained users (by prescription for home use or other order of a treating physician). Patients must be stabilized $( > 6$ weeks) on warfarin therapy. The The Alere INRatio ${ \mathfrak { G } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Home Monitoring System is intended for use outside of the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The Alere INRatic ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Home Monitoring System is not intended to be used for screening purposes.

Limitations: The Alere INRatic $\mathfrak { P } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Home Monitoring System is not intended for use in patients who are transitioning from heparin treatment to warfarin therapy.

# F. Comparison with the Predicate Devices:

The intended use (assay type and intended users) and the operation of the INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional and Home) and associated accessories and reagents have not changed. The INRatio2PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional or Home) are intended to measure International Normalized Ratio (INR) from fresh, capillary whole blood samples by both healthcare professional users and lay (trained patient users. The systems are not intended for screening. Based on the data and information presented here, the INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional or Home), when used with the User Guide by both Healthcare Professionals and Trained Patients, performed equivalently to the INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring System K072727).

Furthermore, the INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strip is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared INRatio PT/INR Test Strip (K092987) currently marketed and distributed by Alere

North America. The current and modified INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strips both catalyze a clotting reaction in fresh, finger stick capillary whole blood samples The INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strips have a lower blood volume requirement. The INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strips can be used with the INRatio2 PT/INR monitors (Professional or Home).

The INRatic $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional Use and Home-use) are not intended for use in the quantitative determination of the international normalized ratio (INR) to monitor the effect of oral anticoagulant (warfarin) therapy on clotting time on patients who are transitioning from heparin treatment to warfarin therapy.

# Nonclinical Data:

Performance testing verified that the modified INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strips have equivalent or better performance compared to the previously cleared INRatio PT/INR Test Strips with respect to precision, accuracy, and potential interferents when used with the INRatio2 PT/NR Monitoring Systems (Professional or Home). The performance claims currently in the labeling have been changed to reflect the performance of the INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strips.

# G. Clinical Data

Clinical testing validated that the INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional and Home) utilizing the INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strips, when used by trained patient users or healthcare professionals, performed with acceptable accuracy compared to the reference method (the Sysmex CA-560 Anticoagulation Analyzer). Both user populations generated INR values with the INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional or Home), utilizing the INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strip, that were deemed accurate relative to the reference method, per ISO 17593:2007.

# H. Conclusions Drawn from Testing

Based on the data and information presented here, the INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional and Home) , when used with the INRatio2 PT/INR Test Strip, are substantially equivalent to the INRatio (K020679; K021923) and INRatio2 (K072727) PT/INR Monitoring System and the INRatio PT/INR Test Strip (K092987) currently manufactured and distributed by Alere. The INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems (Professional and Home) have been verified and validated for ease of use by both Healthcare Professionals and Trained Patients in multiple healthcare professional and patient self-test user clinical trials (K020679; K021923, K072727 and this submission).

Please note that the above labeling limitations are required by Section 513(i)(1)(E) of the Act. Therefore, a new 510(k) is required before these limitations are modified in any way or removed from the device's labeling.

The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and permits your device to proceed to the market. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification if the limitation statement described above is added to your labeling.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
