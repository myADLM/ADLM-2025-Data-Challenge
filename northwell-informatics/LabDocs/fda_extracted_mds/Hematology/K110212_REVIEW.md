# L. Test Principle:

After a drop of fresh capillary whole blood is applied to the sample well of the test strip, it is drawn into the reaction area by capillary action where it mixes with the reagents that initiate coagulation. Initially the impedance across the electrode (measured by the monitor) is high until the air gap is closed by filling the reaction area with blood. As the reaction progresses, the electrical impedance increases and then gradually drops to a second minimum as the clotting reaction proceeds. A characteristic inflection point, identified by the system algorithm is defined as the clotting endpoint. The elapsed time, in seconds, from the initiation of the reaction until the endpoint is reached is the prothrombin time. The monitor software calculates the INR of the sample from the PT using calibration coefficients determined from the strip code.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision (repeatability) was evaluated with duplicate samples of capillary whole blood. Three lots of the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips were used on both INRatio® and INRatio ${ \mathbb { \ B } } _ { 2 }$ monitors for the study. For each lot, samples from individuals not receiving warfarin/vitamin K antagonist therapy (Normals, N), $\mathrm { ( n { = } l } 1 8$ ) and samples from subjects on warfarin/VKA therapy (Therapeutics, T), $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 1 0 )$ were included. The precision performance of the test strips used met the acceptance criteria as shown in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interval</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Result</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acceptance Criteria</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal (&lt;2.0 INR)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.0% CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV ≤ 11%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Therapeutic Range (2.0 - 4.5 INR)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.4% CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV ≤ 10%</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The study was conducted to verify linearity of the INR range (0.7 to 7.5) of the INRatio ${ \bar { \mathfrak { B } } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips used in conjunction with both INRatio® and INRatio ${ \mathbb { \beta } } _ { 2 }$ monitors compared to the Sysmex CA-560 laboratory reference method. Seventeen (17) contrived plasma samples were prepared by mixing normal plasma with commercially obtained factor II deficient plasma. Saline-washed normal red blood cells and calcium were added to contrive whole blood of various INRs. One representative strip lot was used for this study. For each sample, 8 replicates were tested on each meter type. In addition, fingerstick capillary whole blood from 2 subjects was also included in the study (8 replicates for each subject) for comparison to the contrived samples. The test strips tested on both INRatio® and INRatio ${ \mathrm { \hat { \mathbb { B } } } } _ { 2 }$ monitors demonstrated accuracy as assessed with respect to percent of results within the Allowable Difference for INR within the reportable range of the system. The observed slope and correlation fall within acceptable ranges.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

A study was conducted to verify shelf life stability of the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips. Three (3) lots of the INRatio ${ \mathbb { \ B } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips were used. The strips were incubated at three (3) storage conditions $( 3 2 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 2 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and tested at the various time intervals (3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 months). Testing was conducted with blood from 4 subjects ( $1 \mathrm { N }$ and $3 \mathrm { T }$ ) in 13 replicates per sample for a total of 52 tests. The strips were tested on the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ monitor and the results were compared to results on the Sysmex CA-560 reference method. All 3 lots of test strips met stability acceptance criteria requirements up to 12 months for all storage temperatures tested.

# d. Detection limit:

Contrived coagulation factor deficient blood samples were prepared by mixing commercially obtained citrated factor deficient plasma in various proportions with normal citrated plasma and with red blood cells such that whole blood samples with several factor concentrations were generated. The factor deficient plasma was used to make whole blood samples in final concentrations of normal plasma from $100 \%$ to

$0 \%$ in $10 \%$ intervals. The results of the INRatio ${ \mathbb { \ B } } _ { 2 }$ and the Sysmex CA-560 were compared. The study verifies Factor sensitivity for the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ monitor and INRatio ${ \mathbb { \ B } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips at the following levels $\%$ of normal factor level; in vitro testing): Factor $1 1 { < } 5 6 \%$ ; Factor $V { < } 6 2 \%$ ; Factor VII $< 7 8 \%$ ; and Factor $X { < } 7 4 \%$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

A study was conducted to verify the endogenous substances (bilirubin, triglycerides and hemoglobin) at the concentrations present in whole blood do not cause interference with INR results for tests performed with the INRatio ${ \mathbb { \ B } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips when used in conjunction with the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ monitor. Three to four concentrations of each substance was spiked into the iced venous blood of one normal donor blood sample and one therapeutic donor blood sample (INR 2.0- 4.5). Each endogenous substance, at each defined concentration, was tested with a replicated set of at least 48 blood samples using one lot of the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips. Test results from blood samples with and without the endogenous substance on the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ monitor were compared to results evaluated from citrated venous blood processed to plasma on the Sysmex CA-560 as the reference method. For all subjects, results fell within the acceptance criteria based on ISO 17593:2007. The study results show that the following substances do not interfere with test results up to the concentrations shown:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>up to 30 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides (lipemia)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>upto1500mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin (hemolysis)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>up to 1000mg/dL</td></tr></table>

In addition, a study was conducted to characterize the levels of other pharmaceuticals: clopidogrel (active ingredient in Plavix $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ), acetylsalicylic acid (active ingredient in aspirin), Arixtra (fondaparinux) and atorvastatin (active ingredient in Lipitor $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ), that might be present for subjects on warfarin/VKA therapy without adverse effects on accuracy of the system. Two concentrations of each substance were spiked into the iced venous blood of normal donor blood samples and therapeutic donor blood samples (INR 2.0- 4.5). Each exogenous substance was tested with a replicated set of at least 48 blood samples using one lot of the INRatio ${ \mathbb { \beta } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips. Test results from blood samples with and without the exogenous substance on the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ monitor were compared to result evaluated from citrated venous blood processed to plasma on the Sysmex CA-560 as the reference method. For all subjects, results fell within the acceptance criteria based on ISO 17593:2007. The study results show that the drugs listed below do not interfere with test results when spiked into whole blood, up to the concentrations shown:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Drug</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Up to this concentration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fondaparinux</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>up to 5 mg/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acetylsalicylic acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>up to 4 mmol/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Clopidogrel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>up to 20 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Atorvastatin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>up to 600 μg/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Unfractionated Heparin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>up to 2 Units/mL plasma</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low Molecular Weight Heparin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>up to 3 Units/mL plasma</td></tr></table>

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Accuracy was evaluated with the INRatio ${ \mathbb { \beta } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips in conjunction with both INRatio® and INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ monitors with capillary whole blood. Samples from individuals not receiving warfarin/vitamin K antagonist therapy (Normals, INR $< 2 . 0$ ), $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 1 7 4 )$ and samples from subjects on warfarin/VKA therapy (Therapeutics, INR 2.0 to 4.5), $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 2 4 )$ were included. Three (3) lots of INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips were used for this study. Test results on both monitors were compared to reference results on the Sysmex CA-560 method from citrated venous blood processed to plasma. Linear regression was performed and the Pearson correlation (R value), slope (with confidence interval), and intercept (with confidence interval) were calculated, and Allowable Difference limits were constructed. To pass acceptance criteria, $90 \%$ of data for $\mathrm { I N R } \leq 4 . 5$ must fall within the limits of Allowable Difference.

The results of the study show that each of the 3 strip lots met the acceptance criteria for INR accuracy as represented by $\%$ Allowable Difference relative to the Sysmex CA-560 reference method, both below and at therapeutic ranges $( < 2 . 0$ and 2.0 to 4.5) when analyzed on either INRatio® or INRatio ${ \mathbb { \beta } } _ { 2 }$ monitors. The data show that $9 8 \%$ of valid test results for the test strips used in conjunction with both monitors are within the Allowable Difference for $\mathrm { I N R } \leq 4 . 5$ . For $\mathrm { I N R } < 2 . 0$ , the Allowable Difference $\mathrm { i s } \pm 0 . 5$ INR and for INR between 2.0 to 4.5, the Allowable Difference is a $\%$ relative INR difference $) f \pm 3 0 \%$ .

Innovin® (Reference System)). Results of comparison of fingerstick (capillary) whole blood INR results on INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ to plasma (venous) INR results on Sysmex®/Dade Innovin® from all four sites combined are summarized below:

Regression Statistics (Deming):   
105 subjects   
4 clinical sites   
$\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 7 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 1 9$   
$9 5 \%$ confidence interval of slope: (0.92, 1.23),   
$9 5 \%$ confidence interval of intercept: (-0.55, 0.18)   
Pearson correlation coefficient $( \mathrm { r } ) = 0 . 9 3$

Precision: Precision of the system for PST was assessed in the clinical trials described above. Home PST users tested fingerstick (capillary) whole blood. Precision was assessed by conducting duplicate testing of samples $\mathbf { N } =$ number of duplicate pairs) within specified INR ranges. Precision is expressed as a percent coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ and standard deviation (SD) around the Mean INR value for the duplicate pairs within the indicated INR ranges.

4. Clinical cut-off:

Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A normal range study was conducted on 120 subjects not on anticoagulant therapy. Testing was conducted with fresh capillary whole blood using 3 lots of INRatio ${ \hat { \mathbb { B } } } { \dot { 2 } }$ PT/INR Test Strips on both INRatio® and INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ monitors. The normal reference range at $9 5 \%$ confidence level was determined to be 0.8-1.3 INR.

# N. Instrument Name:

INRatio ${ \mathbb { \ B } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR monitor

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Manual mode

2. Software:

The INRatio ${ \mathbb { \beta } } _ { 2 }$ Monitor software consists of three modules (Application Operating System (AOS), Application Control Program (ACP), and Prothrombin Time Finding Algorithm modules (PTFA)) that are linked together to form a single program that resides on the micro-controller unit ROM. The AOS controls the hardware functions of the monitor, the ACP controls the user interface, and the PTFA controls the clotting time measurement functions.

The INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR monitor uses an icon-based, language-independent user interface that makes the monitor simpler to use, and minimizes labeling and translation requirements.

The monitor software calculates the INR of the sample from the PT using calibration coefficients determined from the strip code.

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Manual input.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

After the test strip is inserted into the monitor, fresh capillary whole blood (obtained by fingerstick) is manually applied directly to the sample well of the test strip.

5. Calibration:

INRatio $\overline { { \mathfrak { B } _ { 2 } } }$ PT/INR test strip: Fresh human blood samples from both therapeutic patients and normal subjects are used for test strip calibration. The Test Strips are calibrated to a laboratory reference method (Sysmex CA 560 Coagulation Analyzer). A calibration coefficient for each lot of test strips is calculated. The calibration method is in alignment with WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. 48th Report. World Health Organ Tech Rep Ser. 1999, 889:64-83. The human recombinant thromboplastin is traceable to WHO reference thromboplastin material.

INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ Monitor: Factory calibration. The monitor performs self-checks at start-up and throughout the testing process.

6. Quality Control:

The INRatio $\overline { { \mathfrak { B } _ { 2 } } }$ PT/INR Test Strip contains two levels of integrated “on-board” quality control (QC) so that external quality control is not required to monitor the performance of the test system. On-board QC is performed with each test. These report one result in the normal range and one result in the therapeutic range. QC ensures that the test is being performed correctly and that the monitor and test strips are working properly together as a system. Before the patient’s test results are displayed, the monitor determines whether the control results are within specified limits. If the control results are in range (verifying strip integrity), the monitor reports the patient’s test results. If either or both of the controls are out of range, the monitor displays a flashing CAUTION symbol and the applicable QC error message. No test result is given if a QC error is displayed.

P. O therSupportiveInstrum entPerform anceCharacteristicsDataNotCovered In the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

A study was conducted to verify the acceptable hematocrit range of the INRatio ${ \mathbb { \ B } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR Test Strips in conjunction with the INRatio ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR monitor. Testing was conducted on the chilled-venous whole blood sample type due to necessity for sample manipulation to targeted hematocrit levels. Sample blood from fifteen (15) subjects on warfarin/VKA therapy (T, INR 2.0 to 4.5) and one normal subject was collected by venipuncture into plain plastic tubes without anticoagulant. Aliquots were made to plain plastic tubes without anticoagulant and samples were immediately placed on ice for up to $9 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ for storage. Just prior to testing the blood samples were warmed to $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and then applied to test strips. Samples were contrived to target concentrations. Low hematocrit blood samples were

contrived by dilution of the sample with plasma from the same subject. High hematocrit samples were contrived by concentration of the sample by removal of plasma from the sample. Test results on the INRatio®/INRatio ${ \mathbb { \ B } } _ { 2 }$ PT/INR system were compared to reference results on the Sysmex CA-560 from citrated venous blood processed to plasma. The results of the study meet all acceptability criteria defined in the clinical protocols and support the acceptable hematocrit range of 25 to $53 \%$ .
