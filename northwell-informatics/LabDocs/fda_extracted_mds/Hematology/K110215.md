Common Name: CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1)   
Classification Name: Immunohistochemistry Antibody Assay, Estrogen Receptor

PREDICATE DEVICE FLEX Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor a Clone SP1 (K081286)

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) binds to human estrogen receptor alpha (ER) in paraffin embedded tissue sections. The antibody is diluted in $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { M }$ Tris-HCl with $2 \%$ carrier protein, and $0 . 1 0 \%$ ProClin 300, a preservative. There is trace $( - 0 . 2 \% )$ fetal calf serum of U.S. origin from the stock solution. Total protein concentration of the reagent is approximately $2 0 \mathrm { \ m g / m L }$ Specific antibody concentration is approximately $1 \mu \ g / \mathrm { m L }$ CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody produced as a cell culture supernatant.

CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) is optimized for use on the BenchMark XT and BenchMark ULTRA automated slides stainers using iView DAB and ultraView DAB detection chemistries.

# INTENDED USE

This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use.

CONFIRM anti-Estrogen Receptor (ER) (SP1) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody is intended for laboratory use for the qualitative detection of estrogen receptor (ER) antigen in sections of formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue on a Ventana automated slide stainer with Ventana detection kits and ancillary reagents. CONFIRM anti-ER (SPl) is directed against an epitope present on human ER alpha protein located in the nucleus of ER positive normal and neoplastic cells. CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) is indicated as an aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of hormone therapy for breast carcinoma.

This product should be interpreted by a qualified pathologist in conjunction with histological examination, relevant clinical information, and proper controls.

Prescription use only.

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) product and the predicate FLEX Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor a Clone SP1 product utilize the same rabbit monoclonal antibody clone (SPl) which recognizes human estrogen receptor alpha. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the Cterminal portion of the ER molecule was used as the immunogen to generate the clone. The SP1 clone has been shown to react with $6 6 ~ \mathbf { k D }$ protein from MCF-7 cells via Western blotting. The protein size is in agreement with that predicted from the cloning of the gene for ER.

The CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device. Both products specifically bind to estrogen receptor proteins located in the nuclei of cells, and are optimized for use on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues. Both products are optimized for use on automated slide stainers using similar detection chemistry principles. Both aid in the prognosis of breast carcinoma.

# METHOD COMPARISON

A randomized, multi-site, multi-reader study was conducted to compare the staining performance of the CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) on the BenchMark ULTRA instrument versus the BenchMark XT instrument. One hundred twenty (120) ER negative and 132 ER positive cases of breast cancer representing the clinical range of the assay were randomly assigned to three study sites. Each site stained its assigned cases with the CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) antibody on a BenchMark ULTRA instrument and a CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) antibody on a BenchMark XT instrument. The stained slides were evaluated by pathologists who determined the percentage of stained tumor cells. A case was considered ER positive if there was staining of the nucleus in at least $\geq 1 \%$ of invasive tumor cells.

In the direct comparison of CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) on the BenchMark XT versus the BenchMark ULTRA, the overall percent agreement (OPA) for ER status (positive/negative) was 90.9 (86.2-94.1).

# EQUIVALENCE TO PREDICATE

A randomized, single-site, multi-reader study was conducted using a clinical cohort of 820 invasive breast cancer cases comparing the staining performance of CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) and FLEX antiER (SP1) to progression-free survival outcome. Additional comparison was made to the preceding technology ligand binding assay (LBA) data available from the cohort database.Cases were included in the analyses if the patient had a confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma and received treatment with primary surgical intervention with or without post-operative local radiation therapy followed by adjuvant tamoxifen endocrine therapy $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { p . o . } / \mathrm { d a y } )$ for 5 years. Cases were excluded from analyses if diagnostic biopsy or primary surgical tissue specimens were unavailable,  there had been a prior cancer diagnosis (except non-melanoma skin cancer), or if the patient received prior or adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 1907 tissue microarray cores from 594 breast cancer cases with primary tumor were stained on the BenchMark ULTRA instrument. The stained slides were evaluated by three independent pathologists who determined the percentage of stained tumor cells. A case was considered ER positive if there was staining of the nucleus in at least ${ > } 1 \%$ of invasive tumor cells.

In a direct comparison of CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) and FLEX anti-ER (SP1) assay results, the OPA for ER status (positive/negative) was $9 7 . 8 \%$ $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C I } ; 9 6 . 2 \mathsf { - } 9 8 . 8 \% )$ .

In comparison against patient outcome, the CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) assay and FLEX anti-ER (SP1) assay yielded identical median survival times in tamoxifen treated patients (101.6 months in $\mathrm { E R + }$ patients vs 47.2 months in ER- patients). For both assays the log-rank test showed the difference between ER $^ +$ /ER- relative to survival is statistically significant $\mathbf { ( P < 0 . 0 0 1 ) }$ .

When adjusted for clinical covariates known to influence survival (age, nodal status, tumor size, and tumor grade) the Cox proportional hazard ratio for $\mathbf { E R } +$ compared to ER- in CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) was 0.469 $( \mathtt { p } = 0 . 0 2 6 )$ , while in FLEX anti-ER (SP1) it was 0.564 ${ \bf \tilde { P } } = 0 . 0 8 3$ Inspection of the point estimates and their confidence intervals show that the two results are essentially identical to each other. The chi-square statistics associated with the likelihood ratio (LR) were (100.395 for Ventana vs 98.951 for Dako).

The CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) and FLEX anti-ER (SP1) PPA rates were identical for cases that were $\mathbf { E R } +$ by LBA $( 9 8 . 6 \%$ . $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 6 . 8 \substack { - 9 9 . 4 \% }$ , for both assays). The difference between CONFIRM antiER (SP1) and FLEX anti-ER (SP1) $( 0 . 0 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI -1.6-1.6) was not statistically significantly different from zero at the 0.05 level (McNemar's exact test $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { p } }$ value ${ \bf > 0 . 9 9 9 }$ ). The CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) NPA was lower than the FLEX anti-ER (SP1) NPA with respect to LBA ER status $( 2 7 . 6 \%$ vs $3 4 . 5 \%$ respectively), but the difference between NPAs ( $- 6 . 9 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $- 1 9 . 6 \substack { - 5 . 8 \% } ,$ was not statistically significantly different from zero at the 0.05 significance level (McNemar's exact test p-value $= 0 . 5 0 0 \AA$

# CONCLUSIONS

The CONFIRM anti-Estrogen Receptor (SP1) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody is substantially equivalent to the predicate FLEX Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor a Clone SPl based on their intended use and technological characteristics. In performance comparison to preceding technology (ligand binding assay) and effectiveness at predicting patient outcome for hormone therapy the assays were substantially equivalent.
