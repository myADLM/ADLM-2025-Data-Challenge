# H. Intended Use

1. Intended use(s):

HemosIL Factor VIll deficient plasma is human plasma, depleted of Factor VIll, which is intended for the in vitro diagnostic quantitative determination of Factor Vill activity in citrated plasma, based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay, on the ACL ${ \mathsf { T O P } } ^ { \otimes }$ Family analyzers. HemosFactorVl deficient plasma isindicated or use on patients who are suspected of congenital or acquired deficiency based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay results.

2Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For in-vitro diagnostic use only. For prescription use.

4. Special instrument requirements: ACL TOP® Family analyzers

# I. Device Description

The assay determines the functional activity of Factor Vill by measuring the degree of prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time in the presence of a contact activator, thromboplastin, phospholipids and calcium ions. Factor VIll activity is correlated with the prolongation of the clotting time of the Factor Vil deficient plasma to which diluted patient sample has been added.

J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): HemosIl. Factor VIll deficient plasma (same name)   
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): K034007

3. Comparison with predicate: Similarities

The applicant, HemosIL Factor VIll deficient plasma (PN 00020012800) is substantially equivalent to its predicate, the HemosIL Factor Vill deficient plasma (K034007).

# Differences

The difference between the 2 products; the applicant HemosIL Factor Vil deficient plasma and its predicate, is that the applicant contains normal levels of von Willebrand factor, whereas the predicate is deficient not only in Factor Vil but also in von Willebrand Factor. The test results demonstrate that this change does not adversely affect the product's performance.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

No performance standard or FDA guidance has been established for FVIll deficient plasma.

# L. Test Principle

Correction of the clotting time of the deficient plasma is proportional to the concentration $1 \%$ activity) of the factor VIll in the patient plasma, interpolated from a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics

# Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility

Precision was assessed utilizing 3 lots of plasma on representative members of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP base, ACL TOP 700 and ACL TOP 500 CTS). Precision was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2, for 20 days, with 2 runs per day and 2 replicates per run for each sample level ( $\scriptstyle 1 = 8 0 1$ instrument/ lot), using a specific lot of APTT reagent (APTT-SP and SynthASil) and both normal and abnormal samples. Test data from a representative instrument, APTT reagent and plasma lot is included below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity:

The Factor Vill activities of a high sample (level 1) and an intermediate sample (level 2) were determined from the respective means of 8 replicates, using the Factor VIl deficient plasma predicate. These two samples, together with HemosIL® Factor VIll deficient plasma (PN 00020012800), were used to setup samples with Factor Vill activities ranging from ${ \tt< } 1 \%$ to ${ > } 1 5 0 \%$ .

All Factor Vill samples were run in 4 replicates, using Factor ViIll deficient plasma (PN0020012800) as a substrate, on the ACL TOP with the two reagent lots, and the average activities for all the samples were plotted against their assigned values. The results demonstrated that the Factor Vill assay is linear, with the HemosIL Factor VIll deficient plasma (PN0020012800) as a substrate, up to $1 5 0 \%$ activity on the ACL TOP Family.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

In-House Study

An in-house method comparison study was performed to compare the performance of the new Factor Vill deficient plasma with its predicate.

The Deming regression analysis for the ACL TOP shows that the slope and correlation coefficient (r) are 1.064 and 0.9885 respectively, with the SynthASil reagent, and 0.893 and 0.9884 respectively, with the APTT-SP reagent.

The Deming regression analysis for the ACL TOP 500 CTS shows that the slope and correlation coefficient (r) are 1.112 and 0:9923 respectively, with the SynthASil reagent, and 0.913 and 0.9926 respectively, with the APTT-SP reagent.

The above results satisfy the product specifications for method comparison and demonstrate comparable performance is achieved for the 2 reagents.
