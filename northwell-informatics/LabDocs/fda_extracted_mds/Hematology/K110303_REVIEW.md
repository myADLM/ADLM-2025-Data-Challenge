# L. Test Principle:

The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. In this procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the DDMR TestPak. This antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the D-dimer molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a second distinct antigenic site on the D-dimer molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound D-dimer, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { P } } { \mathrm { C S } }$ analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of D-dimer in the sample. The reaction rate can be measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity: Citrated Plasma The Stratus ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { P } } { \mathrm { C S } }$ Acute Care™ D-dimer assay was evaluated on the Stratus $\mathrm { C S } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Analyzer in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of PE using fresh citrated plasma specimens collected from 730 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected PE. Of these 730 patients, 75 were excluded for a total of 655 patients available for final analysis.

All patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate a high, moderate or low pre-test probability (PTP) of PE. Patient specimens were tested with the Stratus $^ { \mathfrak { P } } { \mathrm { C S } } ^ { }$ Acute Care™ D-dimer assay and results were compared to a cut-off value of $4 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } \mathrm { [ \mu g / L ] }$ (FEU). A D-dimer result $< 4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

$[ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } ]$ (FEU) was considered negative and a D-dimer result $\ge 4 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (FEU) $[ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } ]$ was considered positive.

Patients with a positive D-dimer result and/or high PTP were evaluated by imaging methods, e.g. spiral CT and/or VQ scan. Patients with a negative Ddimer result and a low or moderate PTP underwent imaging at the physician’s discretion, and patients with negative imaging results were followed for three months to evaluate potential development of PE.

The overall prevalence of PE in those patients available for final analysis was $1 4 . 0 \%$ (92/655). The following instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) with upper and lower $9 5 \ \%$ confidence limits (CL) were obtained with the Stratus ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { \mathbf { \hat { C } } \mathbf { S } }$ Acute Care™ D-Dimer clinical cutoff of $4 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } [ \mu \mathrm { g / L } ]$ (FEU).

Heparinized Plasma

The Stratus ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { P } } { \mathrm { C S } }$ Acute Care™ D-dimer assay was evaluated on the Stratus $\mathrm { C S } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Analyzer in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of PE using fresh heparinized plasma specimens collected from 468 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected PE. Of these 468 patients, 41 were excluded for a total of 427 patients available for final analysis.

All patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate a high, moderate or low pre-test probability (PTP) of PE. Patient specimens were tested with the Stratus ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } { \mathrm { C S } }$ Acute Care™ D-dimer assay and results were compared to a cut-off value of $4 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L \ [ \mu g / L ] }$ (FEU). A D-dimer result $< 4 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L \left[ \mu g / L \right] }$ (FEU) was considered negative and a D-dimer result $\geq 4 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L \left[ \mu g / L \right] }$ (FEU) was considered positive.

Patients with a positive D-dimer result and/or high PTP were evaluated by imaging methods, e.g. spiral CT and/or VQ scan. Patients with a negative Ddimer result and a low or moderate PTP underwent imaging at the physician’s discretion, and patients with negative imaging results were followed for three months to evaluate potential development of PE.

The overall prevalence of PE in those patients available for final analysis was $1 4 . 1 \%$ (60/427). The following instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) with upper and lower $9 5 \ \%$ confidence limits (CL) were obtained with the Stratus ® CS Acute Care™ D-Dimer clinical cut-off of $4 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } \mathrm { [ \mu g / L ] }$ (FEU).
