ic:K070660 - INSTANT-VIEW® Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Rapid Tes1

The FOB One Step Rapid Test is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay based on the principle of the double antibody-sandwich technique. The membrane is pre-coated with anti-hemoglobin antibody on the test line region of the device. During testing, the specimen reacts with the particle coated with anti-hemoglobin antibody. The mixture migrates upward on the membrane chromatographically by capillary action to react with anti-hemoglobin antibody on the membrane and generate a colored line. The presence of this colored line in the test region indicates a positive result, while its absence indicates a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear in the control line region indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

# Intended Use

The FOB One Step Rapid Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of human occult blood in human fecal specimens.

The device is suitable for use in laboratories and physician's offices as well as for Over the Counter Use.

# Potential Interferences

An interference study was carred out by adding known amounts of potential interfering substances to aqueous fecal samples that contain 0 and 50 ng /mL of human hemoglobin. Substances tested included horseradish peroxidase (20 mg/mL), aqueous extracts of red radish, raw turnip, cauliflower and broccoli, dietary supplements of chloride, fluoride, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and iron, and toilet water with and without cleaner and deodorizer.

# Potential Cross Reactors:

A crss-reactivity study of animal hemoglobin was carried out by spiking negative(0 g hHb /mL) and positive(50 ng hHb /mL) fecal samples with no reaction from beef hemoglobin, chicken hemoglobin, fish hemoglobin, horse hemoglobin, goat hemoglobin, pig hemoglobin, rabbit hemoglobin and sheep hemoglobin, respectively, at the concentration of 200 ng/mL.

# ACCURACY

A study was conducted to evaluate the Fecal Occult Blood Rapid Test and compare results with a commercially available Fecal Occult Blood Rapid Test at three physician ffce laboratories by technical personnel, and one medical laboratory by non-technical personnel with diverse educational backgrounds and ages.

Consumer results using the FOB One Step Rapid Test compared to both the professional and   
Predicate test results were evaluated:   
Study of technical personnel

In each POL site, 100 human stool extraction samples were spiked with human hemoglobin at the following concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and 500 ng/ml (20 replicates at each concentration). Results obtained from 3 sites agreed $9 9 . 0 \%$ with the expected results and $9 8 . 0 \%$ with results of predicated device.

# Study of non-technical personnel

150 human stool extraction samples were spiked with hHb at the following concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and $5 0 0 \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m l }$ (0 at each concentration). Thirty (30) participants without technical background were enrolled to conduct the study in a medical laboratory. Each participant tested 5 samples (1 at each concentration) with the two FOB devices.
