# Summary Prepared:

October 11, 2011

Name of the Device:

VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N Common Name: Normal Control Plasma

# Classification of Device:

Class II   
21 CFR 864.5425   
Subpart H, Hematology Kits and Packages   
Product Code: GGN

# Predicate Device:

HemosiL Routine Control Level 1, K082859 Instrumentation Laboratory

# Device Description:

The VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N is a pool of normal citrated human plasma collected from a minimum of 20 donors, buffered with 0.02 M HEPES buffer, dispensed and rapidly frozen.

Device Intended Use:

The VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N plasma is an assayed normal control plasma intended for use in the quality control of quantitative coagulation assays, including Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen, in the normal range. The VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N plasma may be used with mechanical and photo-optical coagulation instruments in conjunction with appropriate commercial reagents.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

A technical comparison of the proposed device and the predicate device is illustrated in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>VisuCon-F Frozen CoagScreen N(Proposed Device)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HemosIL Routine ControlLevel 1,(Predicate Device)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intended Use</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>For the quality control ofcoagulation assays in thenormal range</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>For the quality control ofcoagulation assays in thenormal range</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analytes</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Prothrombin time (PT), Activatedpartial thromboplastin time(APTT), Fibrinogen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Prothrombin time (PT),Activated partial thromboplastintime (APTT), Fibrinogen</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Matrix</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Citrated human plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Citrated human plasma</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Format</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Frozen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lyophilized</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Open-VialStability</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8 hours at 2-8°C or on-boardcoagulation instrument(15-22°C)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8 hours at 2-8°</td></tr></table>

Conclusion: The VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N is substantially equivalent to its predicate device, HemoslL Routine Control Level 1, based on similar intended use, product matrix and stability. To our knowledge, any differences, such as product format (frozen versus lyophilized), do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the proposed device.

Dear Ms. Foulon,

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { k } } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice

requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
