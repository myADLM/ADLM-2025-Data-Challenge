# L. Test Principle:

Cell-Chex™ with CPPD crystals is an in-vitro diagnostic product used for quality control procedures associated with body fluid counting protocols. Total cell counts and crystal identification are performed with a hemocytometer using undiluted or diluted body fluid. Crystal analysis can be performed using light or polarized light microscopy following routine lab protocol for crystal identification. Differential cell counts of body fluids are performed using Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ smears stained by means of routine hematology staining techniques.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Run-to-run repeatability: Data was produced from 10 consecutive runs on three lots of each control level on both the hemacytometer and Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . Results fell within parameter specific assay value assignment ranges and are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for the red and white blood cell parameters. Level 1 results were positive for crystals. Level 2 results were negative for crystals.

Precision performance: Data was collected internally and at six external sites in accordance with the product’s instructions for use (IFU) using the hemacytometer and Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . One lot of control was run for 20 days (4 reps/day) over the course of 45 days. The results fell within parameter specific assay value assignment ranges and are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for the red and white blood cell parameters. Level 1 results were positive for crystals. Level 2 results were negative for crystals.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment: Specific to each lot and level of control, a total of five vials were analyzed in duplicate. The assigned values of the total cell counts are based on the average number of cells per $\mu \mathrm { L }$ counted in the nine large square grids on both sides of the Neubauer Improved hemocytometer counting chamber. The assigned value of the differential cell counts are based on replicate 100-cell differentials. A cumulative mean, standard deviation and $\% C V$ were calculated for all measurands reported using Cell-Chex™ with CPPD Crystals with the hemacytometer and Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ platforms. Crystals were identified as "positive" if observed microscopically. The parameter specific assay value assignment ranges are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2$ SD for the RBC and WBC parameters.

• Open vial stability: Three separate lots were analyzed to verify performance throughout the proposed 30 day open vial dating. At each testing interval the vials of control were analyzed one time with the hemacytometer and Cytospin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . On non-testing days, all vials of control were removed from $2 { \cdot } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage, equilibrated to room temperature and mixed in accordance with the IFU. The results fell within parameter specific assay value assignment ranges and are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for the red and white blood cell parameters. Level 1 results were positive for crystals. Level 2 results were negative for crystals.

Closed vial stability: Three separate lots were analyzed to verify performance throughout the 60 day expiration dating. At, each testing interval the control materials were removed from $2 { \cdot } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage, equilibrated to room temperature, re-suspended and analyzed using both the hemacytometer and Cytospin™. The results fell within parameter specific assay value assignment ranges and are reflective of $\pm 3 \mathrm { S D }$ for the WBC differential parameters and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for the red and white blood cell parameters. Level 1 results were positive for crystals. Level 2 results were negative for crystals.
