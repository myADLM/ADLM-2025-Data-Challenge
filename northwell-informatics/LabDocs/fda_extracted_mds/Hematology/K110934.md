# G. Intended Use:

For in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of Hemoglobin A1c, a diabetes marker, in whole blood on the ADViA Chemistry systems. Such measurements are used for monitoring the long-term care of persons with diabetes. The A1c_3 and total hemoglobin

(tHb_ 3) values generated as part of the ADVIA Chemistry HbA1c% and HbA1cR assays are intended for use in the calculation of the A1c/total hemogiobin ratio, and must not be used individually for diagnostic purposes.

# H. Device Description:

The concentration of A1c and the concentration of total hemoglobin are measured and their ratio is reported. The automated pretreatment assays (ADVIA Chemistry A1c_3 and ADVIA Chemistry tHb_3) use 3 ADVIA Chemistry reagents:

• A1c_3 Agglutinator/Total Hemoglobin Reagent (A1c_3 R1) A1c_3 Antibody Reagent (A1c_3 R2) A1c_3 Denaturant Reagent (A1c_3 DENAT)

1. Test Principle:

HbA1c is formed by the non-enzymatic glycation of the N-terminus of the B-chain of hemoglobin A. The level of HbA1c is proportional to the level of glucose in the blood and is widely accepted as an indicator of the mean daily blood glucose concentration over the preceding 2 months. Recent studies have shown that the regular measurement of HbA1c leads to changes in diabetes treatment and improvement of metabolic control as indicated by a lowering of HbA1c values.

In an automated pretreatment step, the whole blood sample is mixed with the A1c_3 Denaturant Reagent The red blood cells are lysed and the hemoglobin chain is hydrolyzed by the protease present in the reagent. For the measurement of total hemoglobin, the A1c_3 Agglutinator Reagent (A1c_ 3 R1) is used. The assay is based on the determination of released heme in the Soret region at 410 nm.

A latex agglutination inhibition assay is used for the measurement of specific A1c. A second protease in the R1 reagent further hydrolyzes the HbA1c sample to a glycated pentapeptide, which competes with the agglutinator (synthetic polymer containing multiple copies of the immunoreactive portion of A1c) for the anti-HbA1c antibody, thereby reducing the rate of agglutination.A concentration curve is obtained by monitoring the change in scattered lht at 694 nm as a change of absorbance. The actual change in absorbance is inversely proportional to the concentration of A1c in the sample:

The A1c_3 and tHb_3 results use the HbA1c% Ratio to determine HbA1c results in NGSP equivalent units $( \% )$ . The HbA1cR Ratio is used to determine HbA1c results in IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol). The required assays and parameter sheets are summarized in the following table:

# K. Performance Characteristics

Substantial equivalence was demonstrated by testing several performance characteristics including imprecision, method comparison, interfering substances and analytical range. All of the evaluation studies gave acceptable results compared to the predicate device. These

studies support that the ADVIA® 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 (A1c_3) Automated Pretreatment Assay is substantially equivalent to the ADVIA® Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c (A1c Assay that is currently marketed.

# I. Imprecision

Within run and Total Precision were established by assaying a normal whole blood sample and an abnormal whole blood sample. Each sample was assayed 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day, for at least 20 days. Precision estimates were computed according to CLSl document EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline.

# II. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study across the entire measuring range was assessed using commercially available linearity set solutions. The low and high levels of the linearity set were mixed to make nine (9) intermediate levels and all samples were tested on the ADVIA Chemistry 1800 analyzer. The range of samples tested was from 1.13-19.44% A1c. The observed values were compared to the expected values.

Linear/measuring range of the assay is

The A1c_3 assay can be used for specific A1c concentrations from 1.0 to 8.83 pmol/L.   
The tHb_3 assay can be used for total hemoglobin concentrations from 7 to 24 g/dL.   
The HbA1c% assay is linear from 2.9 to $1 5 . 4 \%$ HbA1c.   
The HbA1cR assay is linear from 8 to 144 mmol/mol.

The low end of the assay range is calculated based on the Limit of Detection. The high end of the assay range is based on the linearity calculation.

# III. Limit of detection

The estimations of the Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were performed by running 60 replicates of $0 . 9 \%$ Saline (Blank) and five (5) HbA1c low samples. Data were obtained from a 3-day precision study. The LoD for the HbA1c_3 assays is 0.48 umol/L (0.91 %HbA1c).

IV. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of this method (y) on an ADVIA 1800 was compared with performance of ADVIA® Chemistry System A1c method $( \boldsymbol x )$ . Ninety-eight (98) whole blood samples in EDTA were tested and the sample results ranged from 3.14 - 14.92 %HbA1c (11 - 139) mmol/mol) and gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9942.

Linear regression analysis gave the following equation: This method $\fallingdotseq$ 1.00 (predicate device) - 2.90 mmol/mol

# IV. Analytical specificity

Interferences from icterus, lipemia, and hemolysis were evaluated for this Hemoglobin A1c method on an ADVIA 1800 analyzer using a significance criterion of $>10 \%$ variance from the control. No significant lipemia interference was found at Intralipid levels from 0-1000 mg/dl in a $5 . 1 6 \%$ , 9.84% HbA1c sample. No significant interference was found at unconjugated bilirubin levels from 0-60 mg/dL in a $5 . 1 6 \%$ $9 . 9 0 \%$ HbA1c sample. No significant interference was found at conjugated bilirubin levels from 0-60 mg/dL in a $5 . 0 3 \%$ \* $9 . 7 8 \%$ HbA1c sample.

# L. Conclusion:

The ADVIA® 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 (A1c_3) Automated Pretreatment assay is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics ADVIA® Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c Assay (k081895).
