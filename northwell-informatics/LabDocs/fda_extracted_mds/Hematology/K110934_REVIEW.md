# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment Assay is a latex agglutination inhibition assay that is used for the measurement of specific A1c.

In an automated pretreatment step, the whole blood sample is mixed with the A1c_3 Denaturant Reagent. The red blood cells are lysed and the hemoglobin chain is hydrolyzed by the protease present in the reagent. For the measurement of total hemoglobin, the A1c_3 Agglutinator Reagent (A1c_3 R1) is used. The assay is based on the determination of released heme in the Soret region at $4 1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

A latex agglutination inhibition assay is used for the measurement of specific A1c. A second protease in the R1 reagent further hydrolyzes the HbA1c sample to a glycated pentapeptide, which competes with the agglutinator (synthetic polymer containing multiple copies of the immunoreactive portion of A1c) for the anti-HbA1c antibody, thereby reducing the rate of agglutination. A concentration curve is obtained by monitoring the change the scattered light at $6 9 4 { \mathrm { n m } }$ as a change of absorbance. The actual change in absorbance is inversely proportional to the concentration of A1c in the sample.

The A1c_3 and thB_3 results use the $\mathrm { H b A l c \% }$ ratio to determine HbA1c results in NGSP equivalent units $( \% )$ . The HbA1cR Ratio is used to determine HbA1c results in IFCC equivalent units $\mathrm { ( m m o l / m o l ) }$ ). The required assays and parameter sheets are summarized in the following table:

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study was performed by testing a normal blood pool, high blood pool, two whole blood pools ( $6 . 5 \%$ and $10 \%$ HbA1c) and two levels of control material. Each sample was assayed 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day, for at least 20 days on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer. The results are shown below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A commercially available linearity set solution was used to assess the linearity across the entire measuring range of the assay. The low and high levels of the linearity set were mixed to make a total of nine intermediate levels on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer using the Hemoglobin A1c3 Automated Pretreatment Assay. The range of samples tested was $1 . 1 3 - 1 9 . 4 4 \% \mathrm { A l c }$ . The observed values versus the expected values are $9 5 . 0 - 1 0 0 . 7 \%$ . The regression was:

The data provided support the sponsor’s claims that the reportable range of this assay is $2 . 9 - 1 5 . 4 \%$ A1c.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 assay standardization is traceable to the IFCC reference calibrators. The assigned A1c and total hemoglobin (tHb_3) values of the calibrators are traceable to the NGSP reference method (Tosoh G7) through a correlation study. The ADVIA Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www,ngsp.org.

The derived result of the ratio $( \% )$ from the NGSP correlation is calculated from the individual quantitative results for total hemoglobin (tHb_3) and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c_3). The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation:

# IFCC $\circeq$ (NGSP-2.15)/0.092

Two different units are provided to the customers:

NGSP equivalent units $( \% )$ and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol)

# Stability:

Shelf-life and open vial stability testing protocols for the calibrators have been previously cleared under k081895.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying a zero sample (blank) and five low HbA1c samples according to CLSI guideline EP17-A. Each sample was assayed twice a day in replicates of ten $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 6 0 }$ ) for three days on the ADVIA analyzer. The detection limits are summarized in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Platform/Method</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB (%A1c)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD (%A1c)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ADVIA® 1800 Chemistry HemoglobinA1c 3 Automated Pretreatment Assay</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.77</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.91</td></tr></table>

The assay has a reportable range of $2 . 9 \%$ to $1 5 . 4 \%$ A1c.

# e. Analytical specificity:

i.) Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay. The interfering substances were evaluated in whole blood EDTA samples that had different Hgb A1c concentrations. The low range samples ranged from $4 . 8 7 - 5 . 2 6 \% \mathrm { H b A l c }$ b $\left( 3 0 { - } 3 4 \mathrm { m m o l / m o l } \right)$ ); the high level samples ranged from $8 . 9 9 - 9 . 9 0 \%$ HbA1c $\left( 7 4 { - } 8 4 \mathrm { m m o l / m o l } \right)$ . Samples were assayed in duplicate on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer using the Hemoglobin A1c_3 assay. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is analyte recovery should not vary from the base recovery by more than $10 \%$ . No significant interference was defined as the $\%$ recovery of $< 1 0 \%$ .

The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference by the following interferents:

Conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Triglycerides (Intralipid) up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Rheumatoid Factor up to 936 IU/mL

ii.) An interference study was performed to assess the affect of labile A1c with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay. Two levels of pooled blood samples ${ \sim } 5 . 3$ and $9 . 9 \%$ A1c) were used and each pool was split into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as the control sample while the other aliquot was supplemented by dissolving $0 . 0 3 0 \mathrm { ~ g ~ } ( 3 0 \mathrm { m g } )$ of glucose into the pool sample (glucose concentration $= 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). The sample was incubated for five hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to facilitate formation of labile A1c. Both aliquots were tested on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria is $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias

between the tested and the control samples.

The sponsor concluded that labile A1c concentrations do not interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.

iii.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of urea with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay. Two levels of pooled whole blood samples ${ \it - } 5 . { } \overline { { 1 } }$ and 9.7 A1c) were used and each pool was split into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as the control sample while the other was supplemented by dissolving $3 \mathrm { m g }$ of urea into the pool sample (urea concentration $= 1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). The sample was incubated for two hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Both aliquots were tested on the ADVIA 180 analyzer. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias between the tested and the control samples.

The sponsor concluded that urea concentrations $\leq 1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ do not interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.

iv.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of acetylsalicylic acid with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay. One pooled whole blood sample $( \sim 5 . 9 \%$ A1c) was used and split into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as the control sample while the other aliquot was supplemented by dissolving $9 0 0 . 8 \mathrm { m g }$ of acetylsalicylic acid into an ethanol stock solution and then adding this stock solution into the pool sample. The sample was incubated for three hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Both aliquots were tested on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias between the tested and the control samples.

The sponsor concluded that acetylacetic acid concentrations $\leq 1 0 \mathrm { m M }$ does not interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.

v.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of carbamylated A1c with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay. A pooled whole blood sample $( { \sim } 4 . 7 8 \ \% \mathrm { A l c }$ ) was split into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as the control sample while the other aliquot was supplemented by dissolving $3 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ of sodium cyanate into $_ \mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ to make a stock solution in which 2.5 ml of this stock solution is then added to the whole blood sample. The samples were incubated for one hour at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for one hour. Both aliquots were tested in duplicate on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is $\leq 1 0 \%$ bias between the tested and the control samples.

The sponsor concluded that carbamylated A1c does not interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.

vi.) A hemoglobin concentration interference study was done with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay by testing varying

concentrations of total hemoglobin at the same level of $\% \mathrm { A l c }$ . Seven individual normal donors were used for the study. The acceptance criterion for the hemoglobin interference was $\% _ { \mathrm { \tiny \mathrm { ~ H b A l { c } } } }$ at different hemoglobin levels must be within $\pm 7 . 5 \%$ of the target $\%$ HbA1c. The results met the sponsor’s predetermined criteria and the sponsor concluded that total hemoglobin in the range of 7 to $2 6 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ does not interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.

vii.) A hemoglobin variant interference study was carried out using NGSP samples known to contain Hemoglobin variants C, S, D, E and F. These variant samples were tested on the Primus Ultra 2 HPLC system and the ADVIA 1800 analyzer with the ADVIA Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment method. All the variants tested showed $< 1 0 \%$ bias at $6 \%$ and $9 \%$ except Hemoglobin F at concentrations greater than $10 \%$ . Hemoglobin F variant ${ > } 1 0 \%$ showed a negative bias therefore, the sponsor has the following limitation in their labeling:

“Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two alpha and two gamma chains that are not recognized by the anti-HbA1c antibody. Samples that contain high amounts of HBF $( > 1 0 \% )$ , usually found in some people with thalassemia, in infants, and in some pregnant women, may yield a lower than expected HbA1c result with this assay. For blood samples containing HbF $( > 1 0 \% )$ , HbA1c results obtained by this assay should not be compared to published normal or abnormal results”.

See NGSP at http://www.ngsp.org for assay interferences with hemoglobin variants.
