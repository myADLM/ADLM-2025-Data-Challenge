L. Test Principle:

The CELL-DYN 22 Plus Calibrator was designed to calibrate the Abbott CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instrument. The assayed values are traceable to reference methods. The product is for in-vitro diagnostic use to calibrate WBC, RBC, HGB, MCV, and PLT.

M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision performance: Data was collected internally and at two external sites across seven different CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instruments with multiple operators using 3 lots of CELL-DYN 22 Plus Calibrator. The external sites performed 10 consecutive runs across two different instruments with separate vials of calibrator from each lot. Internally, Streck performed 10 consecutive runs per lot across three instruments. The acceptance criteria are based on a compilation of the $\% C V$ for each measurand. All $\% C V$ values were within the acceptable threshold value as shown below,

Run-to-run precision was evaluated in a 10-run repeatability study performed with each calibrator lot and with a fresh whole blood sample collected in $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ . Parameter specific SDs and CVs reported with whole blood were compared to those reported with three individual lots of the calibrator. Repeatability attributes of the CELL-DYN 22Plus Calibrator parallel those reported with fresh whole blood with $\% C V$ values within acceptable limits..

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Value assignment: A minimum of three vials were tested on the CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instruments. Duplicate testing on each vial was performed consecutively for a minimum of three test events performed on different dates. The data were entered into the validated QC link database program to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for each parameter analyzed. Final assay assignment values were determined using data collected and established product performance characteristics. Expected range values assigned to the assay were based on the standard deviation of the assay data. Assay values were assigned to the calibrator based on $\pm 2 . 5$ SD for each measurand.

Open vial stability: A 5-day open-vial stability claim was verified using three lots of the CELL-DYN 22 Plus Calibrator. Each lot was tested on days 1, 5 and at minimum one intermediate time interval.

Closed vial stability: A 45-day closed-vial stability claim was verified using three lots of the CELL-DYN 22 Plus Calibrator. Each lot was tested at a minimum every 14 days over a minimum period of 45 days.

The acceptance criteria for open and closed vial stability is based on a compilation of the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for each measurand over the data collected across 7 different CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instruments, at 3 sites, throughout the product dating claim. Reported $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for each measurand was within the threshold value $\text{‰}$ CV).
