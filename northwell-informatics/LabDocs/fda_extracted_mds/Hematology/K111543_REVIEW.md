# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY

A. 510(k) Number: k111543   
B. Purpose for Submission: New device   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Ventana Virtuoso System for HER2 (4B5)   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Computer-assisted image analysis scoring and manual scoring of digital images of immunohistochemistry stained HER2 slides.

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description: The Virtuoso™ System is an instrument-plus-software system designed to assist the qualified pathologist in the consistent assessment of protein expression in immunohistochemically stained histologic sections from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded normal and neoplastic tissues.

The system consists of a slide scanner (iScan), computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, image analysis algorithms for specific immunohistochemical markers, and software with a Windows web browser-based user interface. Virtuoso is a webbased, end-to-end, digital pathology software solution that allows pathology laboratories to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report digital images of pathology specimens. Using the Virtuoso software, the pathologist can view digital images, add annotations, make measurements, perform image analysis, and generate reports.

The Digital Read option allows the pathologist to score the HER2 stained slide’s digital image on a computer monitor. In the Image Analysis Application option, slides are scored by the HER2 image analysis application. This score is then presented on the computer screen. The pathologist then verifies the score and confirms it.

Hardware: The iScan slide scanning device captures digital images of formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage and viewing. The device includes a digital slide scanner, racks for loading glass slides, computer, scanner software, keyboard, mouse and monitor.

Software: The Virtuoso software is designed to complement the routine workflow of a qualified pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained histologic slides. It allows the user to select fields of view (FOVs) in the digital image for analysis and provides quantitative data on these FOVs to assist with interpretation. The software makes no independent interpretations of the data and requires competent human intervention for all steps in the analysis process.

2. Principles of Operation:

The Virtuoso System for HER2 4B5 employs image analysis techniques to obtain HER2 scores. Pre-defined parameters are used to obtain HER2 scores. The identification of the nuclei and membrane are carried out automatically by the

image analysis algorithms. The steps involved in the analysis algorithms are:

1. Enhancing the image. This process increases the contrast to make the image more suitable for analysis.

2. Identifying the epithelial area. The epithelial area is the region of the image where there is the possibility of epithelial cell being present.

3. Identifying the nucleus

4. Identifying the cell membrane

5. Classify the cells based on the extent, intensity and thickness of membrane staining   
6. Computer score

3. Modes of Operation:

a. Manual scoring of immunohistochemically (IHC) HER2 stained slide images on a computer monitor (Digital read). b. Computer scoring of IHC HER2 stained slide images performed by HER2 Image Analysis Application. This score is verified by the pathologist.

4. Specimen Identification: Glass tissue slides are identified by slide label or barcode (if provided by the user) by scanning the whole slide including the label or barcode.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

IHC stained slides manually loaded on to the iSCAN Coreo slide scanner individually or in slide racks. The slide racks hold a maximum of 160 slides. Under the default setting a thumbnail view of the slide and the area of interest (AOI) in the slide is scanned. The operator has the option of rescanning the slide after viewing the image on the computer monitor. Under the manual scanning option, the user has the ability to select the scan area for single or batch slides.

6. Calibration:

The iSCAN Coreo contains a diagnostics module that can be run by the user. This application tests the scanner hardware components and functions. These tests must be run with nine custom slides calibrated for the module which can be obtained from the sponsor.

7. Quality Control: Quality control is performed by the operator before releasing the images to the pathologist for review. Slides with sub-optimal images will be rescanned.

# I. Special Control/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

The performance of the Virtuoso System for IHC HER2 (4B5) was validated via two studies. The first study evaluated overall system performance in terms of: (1) agreement between the reference manual method (with a traditional microscope) and both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of the Virtuoso system, (2) intra-pathologist/inter-day reproducibility of DR and IA Virtuoso applications, and (3) inter-pathologist reproducibility of the DR and IA Virtuoso applications. These studies were conducted in 3 different sites.

In the second study, scanner precision was evaluated in an isolated fashion via a cross-over design from the primary study. A subset of the clinical cases $( \mathtt { n } = 4 0 )$ ) was scanned two more times with two different scanners at two separate locations. This study evaluated scanner precision of the image analysis application only for both inter-scanner precision and intra-scanner/inter-day precision, as the image analysis application is the more sensitive of the two applications, and it generates an instrument-generated HER2 score that is not affected by memory bias as would be the case with human interpretations.

a. Accuracy:

This study was conducted in 3 sites with one pathologist at each site. There were 120 specimens that were included in this study. All pathologists read all the slides under the three different modes – manual, digital read and Image analysis scoring. The data were categorized as “negative” and “positive” using HER2 classifications of 0 and $1 +$ to describe negative, and $^ { 2 + }$ and $3 +$ to describe positive. The acceptance criteria of an overall agreement rate of at least $7 5 \%$ were set by the sponsor. These were met in all the studies. The overall agreements across the three sites with the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown below.

# $b$ . Precision/Reproducibility:

# Reproducibility

Reproducibility of the device was assessed during slide reading sessions. A slide reading session consisted of pathologists conducting a digital read (DR)

or image analysis (IA) of all the 40 slides. There was a 7-day wash-out period between slide reading sessions. An agreement of $2 7 5 \%$ between each of the three reading sessions (Session 1 vs. Session 2, Session 1 vs. Session 3, and Session 2 vs. Session 3) for the Virtuoso digital read (DR) application was considered acceptable intra-pathologist/inter-day scoring performance (maximum $\mathtt { n } = 4 0$ ). The same criterion was established for the Virtuoso image analysis application (IA) (maximum $\mathrm { n } = 4 0$ ). Concordance was analyzed based upon the clinical assessment of negative $( 0 , 1 + )$ and positive $( 2 + , 3 + )$ . Reproducibility was also evaluated for the inter-pathologist variable, by comparing the concordance data in a pair-wise manner between Site 1 vs. Site 2, Site 1 vs. Site 3, and Site 2 vs. Site 3. This was done for both DR and IA, and used the same $7 5 \%$ acceptance criterion. The agreement rate set by sponsor were met in all these studies.

Scanner Precision: The scanner precision study was designed to assess the performance of the Virtuoso system’s scanner (iScan) in isolation from other variables. The primary (clinical validation) study evaluated system performance according to the intended use, as three different pathologists interpreted the same stained slides in the three different modalities, (manual method, DR, and IA). As the DR and IA images were derived from a single scanning “run,” this second study held other variables constant so that scanner performance could be comprehensively

addressed. This study evaluated scanner precision of the image analysis application. The scanner precision study utilized a randomly selected subset of 40 cases from the primary study (protocol TP-000115). The clinical cases spanned the range of the HER2 scoring categories $( 0 , 1 + ,$ , $2 \ t , 3 \ t + )$ in roughly equal numbers, and the slides were stained with both universal DAB detection kits (iVIEW and ultraView). A subset of the clinical cases $( \mathtt { n } = 4 0 )$ ) was scanned two more times with two different scanners at two separate locations.
