Common Name: Digital pathology and image analysis system for immunochemistry-stained slides

Classifications: 21 CFR § 864.1860- Immunohistochemistry reagents and kits

807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate devices

The Virtuoso System for IHC Ki-67 (30-9) is substantially equivalent to BioImagene's PATHIAM™M System with iScan for p53 and Ki-67 (Biolmagene, Inc. [now Ventana Digital Pathology], Sunnyvale, CA), cleared under pre-market notification K092333 on October 27, 2010. Both devices are digital pathology and image analysis systems for the consistent assessment of pathology interpretations using immunohistochemically stained slides (in this case, stained for Ki-67 expression), and both systems include slide scanner hardware, and software that both automates the procedural steps and performs the analyses.

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

# General Description

The Virtuoso™M System is an instrument-plus-software system designed to assist the qualified pathologist in the consistent assessment of protein expression in immunohistochemically stained histologic sections from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded normal and neoplastic tissues. The system consists of a slide scanner (iScan), computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, image analysis algorithms for specific immunohistochemical markers, and software with a Windows web

browser-based user interface. Virtuoso is a web-based, end-to-end, digital pathology software solution that allows pathology laboratories to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report digital images of pathology specimens. Using the Virtuoso software, the pathologist can view digital images, add annotations, make measurements, perform image analysis, and generate reports.

Hardware: The iScan slide scanning device captures digital images of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage and viewing. The device includes a digital slide scanner, racks for loading glass slides, computer, scanner software, keyboard, mouse and monitor.

Software: The Virtuoso software is designed to complement the routine workflow of a qualified pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained histologic slides. It allows the user to select fields of view (FOVs) in the digital image for analysis and provides quantitative data on these FOVs to assist with interpretation. The software makes no independent interpretations of the data and requires competent human intervention for all steps in the analysis process.

# Additional Materials Required:

Ventana CONFIRMTM Ki-67 (30-9) rabbit monoclonal primary antibody   
• Reagents for visualization, such as universal DAB universal chromogen   
• Associated materials for completing immunohistochemical staining according to the appropriate package insert Color printer if user wishes to print color copies

# Device Quality Control

The quality of results depends on the laboratory following the quality control instructions recommended in the labeling of the immunohistochemistry (IHC) reagents. The software also performs a quality check on the digital images to determine if they are suitable for further analysis using "Image Quality Assessment" algorithms.

# Summary of Procedure

Samples are obtained as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Histologic sections are prepared and mounted onto glass slides. Slides are reacted with the p53 (D07) primary antibody, and are then visualized using DAB. Prepared slides are loaded into the Virtuoso system scanner and scanned. The resulting digital images are reviewed by the pathologist on a computer monitor, and appropriate fields of view (FOVs) are then selected for analysis by the Virtuoso software. The Virtuoso software produces a quantitative score for the FOV and an aggregate score over all the FOVs for the whole slide. The pathologist has the choice of accepting the result or overriding with his/her own score for some or all FOVs.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use/ Indication(s) for Use:

The Virtuoso system provides automated digital slide creation, management, analysis, and viewing. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the display, detection, counting, review and classification of tissues and cells of clinical interest based on particular morphology, color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.

The Virtuoso™M System for Ki67 (30-9) is for digital read and image analysis applications. This particular Virtuoso system is intended for use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of Ki67 (30-9) protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. This device is an accessory to the Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. CONFIRMTM antiKi67 (30-9) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay. The Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. CONFIRM™M anti-Ki67 (30-9) assay is indicated for use in assessing the proliferative activity of normal and neoplastic breast tissue. When used with this assay, the VirtuosoTM System for Ki67 (30-9) is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of Ki-67 status in breast cancer patients (but is not the sole basis for treatment).

Note: The IHC Ki67 (30-9) Digital Read and Image Analysis applications are adjunctive computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the acquisition and measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer specimens stained for the presence of Ki67 protein. The pathologist should verify agreement with the Image Analysis software application score. The accuracy of the test results depends on the quality of the immunohistochemical staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as specified in the instructions for the CONFIRMTM anti-Ki67 (30-9) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay to assure the validity of the VirtuosoTM System for Ki67 (30-9) Digital Read and Image Analysis scores. The actual correlation of CONFIRMTM anti-Ki67 (30-9) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary antibody assay to clinical outcome has not been established.

# 807.92 (b)(1/2): Brief Description of Clinical Data (Non-clinical data N/A)

The Virtuoso System for IHC KI-67 (30-9) was clinically validated via two studies. The first (primary) study evaluated overall system performance across four sites in terms of agreement between the reference manual method (with a traditional microscope) and both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of the Virtuoso system. In the second study, scanner precision was evaluated in an isolated fashion among three pathologists for inter-pathologist reproducibility of the two Virtuoso applications, and intra-pathologist/inter-day reproducibility of the two Virtuoso applications was also evaluated. The data from both studies are summarized below.

# Agreement/Concordance

# a. Virtuoso Digital Read vs Manual Method

Each pathologist's Virtuoso digital read results were compared to their manual results. The data were categorized as "neg" and "pos" using Ki-67 classifications of less than or equal to $10 \%$ staining to describe negative, and greater than $10 \%$ to describe positive. The overall agreements across the four sites were: $9 2 \%$ $81 \%$ $86 \%$ , and $87 \%$ , respectively. The data, with the $95 \%$ confidence intervals (Cl) around the agreements are shown below.
