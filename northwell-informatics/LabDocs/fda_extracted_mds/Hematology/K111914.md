# 4 Device Description

The VS800 System is an automated digital slide creation, management and viewing system. The VS800 System components consist of an automated digital microscope slide scanner (VS800-SS) which include a computer, keyboard and mouse, operating monitor (VS800-MTR) and VS Viewer software (VS2-ASW-IDB). The system capabilities include digitizing microscope slides at high resolution, storing and managing the resulting digital slide images, retrieving and displaying digital slides, including support for remote access over wide-area networks, providing facilities for annotating digital slides and entering and editing metadata associated with digital slides, and facilities for image analysis of digital slides. The remote digital slide viewing capabilities of the system support reading digital slides on a computer monitor, enabling Pathologists to make clinically relevant decisions analogous to those they make using a conventional microscope. Specifically, the system supports the pathologist in the detection of HER2/neu by manual examination of the digital slide of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue immunohistochemically stained for HER2 receptors on a computer monitor.

The VS80o-ss (an automated digital microscope slide scanner) creates high resolution, color digital slide images of entire glass slides in a matter of minutes. High numeric aperture $2 0 x$ objectives, specially designed for Vs800-ss optical system and real time contrast auto focus system (AF) are used to produce high-quality images. VS800-SS employs a 2D CCD imager for fine image acquisition which is same technologies used in conventional microscope imaging system. Vs80o-SS captured image is as same as conventional microscope image.

The VS-ASW-IDB (VS Viewer software) is a ful-featured digital pathology information management system. The software runs on a server computer, which stores digital slide images on disk storage such as a RAID array, and which hosts an SQL database that contains digital slide metadata. The VS-ASW-IDB includes a web application and services which encapsulate database and digital slide image access for other computers. The VS-ASW-IDB also includes support for locally or remotely connected Image Server, which run digital slide viewing software provided as part of VS-ASW-IDB.

The laboratory technician or operator of VS8oo-sS loads glass microscope slides into a specially designed slide carrier with a capacity up to 100 slides per carrier (300 total). The scanning process begins when the operator starts the VS800-ss scanner and finishes when the scanner has completed scanning of all loaded slides. As each glass slide is processed, the system automatically stores stitched images as a single digital slide image, which represents a histological reconstruction of the entire tissue section. When the slide scanning finished, then operator of scanner will confirms the image quality and records to the database. When the images are recorded, pathologists or authorized parsons can observe these images to access the VS-ASW-IDB.

# 5 Indications for Use

The Vs800 system is an automated digital slide creation, management, and viewing system. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the display, detection, counting and classification of tissues and cells of clinical interest based on particular color, intensity, size,

pattern and shape.

The VS800HER2 Manual Read (MR) of digital slide application is intended for use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of HER2 by manual examination of the digital slide of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and neoplastic tissue IHC stained for HER2 receptors on a computer monitor. HER2 results are indicated for use as an aid in the management, prognosis and prediction of therapy outcomes of breast cancer.

The VS80oHER2 MR of digital slide application is intended for use as an accessory to the DakoHercepTest to aid the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of HER2 by manual examination of the digital slide of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and neoplastic tissue immunohistochemically stained for HER2 receptors on a computer monitor. When used with the Dako Hercep Test, it is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer. patients for whom HERCEPTIN $\circled{8}$ (Trastuzumab) treatment is being considered.

# 6 Comparison of Technological Characteristics

A summary of the technological characteristics of the VS800 System, subject device, in comparison to the predicate device follows:

Method of cell detection: The method of cell detection is by colorimetric pattern recognition by microscopic examination of prepared cells by size, shape, hue and intensity as observed by a computer-automated, microscopic digital slide scanner system and/or by visual observation by a health care professional.

System Components: The system components comprising the VS800 System, subject device, are substantially equivalent to those in the predicate device; i.e., a computer-automated digital microscope slide scanner, computer, color monitor, and keyboard.

Energy Source: The electrical service is 100 - 120vAC / 220 - 240vAC, 50Hz/60 Hz, 5.8A MAX, which is similar to the predicate device electrical service requirements.

# 7 Summary of Non-Clinical Testing

In support of the non-clinical tests, a risk analysis was carried out in accordance with established in-house acceptance criteria based on IS0 14971. The design verification tests and their acceptance criteria were identified and performed as a result of the risk analysis assessment.In addition, electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility testing was performed and carried out in accordance to IEC61010-2-101:2002 and EN 61326-2-6:2006.

The software validation activities were performed in accordance with the FDA Guidance, "Guidance for the Contents of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices." Olympus has accessed that our proposed VS800 System has a Moderate Level of concern, and the documents within the 510(k) support the level of concern.

# 8 Summary of Clinical Testing

A prospective clinical study was conducted to validate the performance for reading images of slides on a computer monitor (manual digital reads) in comparison to reading the glass-slides with a conventional microscope (manual microscopy reads). The VS800 system was used to digitize, manage and view the slides. The specific application is limited to Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) breast tissue specimens ImmunoHistoChemically (IHC) stained with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) using DakoCytomation's FDA approved HercepTest ™ kit.

A study was conducted at two clinical sites to compare the performance of manual digital reads with manual microscopy reads. One clinical laboratory provided two clinical sites with different slide sets of one hundred (100) slides each. The slides were selected from archive to provide an equal distribution of HER2 scores in the trichotomous categorization of the HER2 scores combining 0 and $1 +$ and leaving $^ { 2 + }$ and $^ { 3 + }$ uncombined, and then re-cut and re-stained. At each clinical site, three different pathologists performed first a blinded read of the glass-slides using a conventional microscope. Then, the slides were digitized using a different instrument at each clinical site, and after a wash-out period of at least one week and randomization, the same three pathologists at each site performed another blinded read of the slides, but this time they read the images of the slides on their computer monitors.

The statistical analysis is presented across all slides comparatively between manual microscopy reads and manual digital reads using Percent Agreement (PA) with a $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval (CI). The statistical analysis is provided for a trichotomous agreement of the HER2 scores combining 0 and $1 +$ , and leaving $^ { 2 + }$ and $^ { 3 + }$ uncombined, as suggested by FDA.

Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 show the $4 \times 4$ tables for the agreements between the manual microscopy reads and manual digital reads using column-wise Percent Agreement (PA; i.e., percent of manual digital reads that agree with a given manual microscopy read) with a Exact $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval (Cl) for each of the three pathologists at site 1 and site .For example, there were 33 (10 $+ 2 3 )$ slides with manual microscopy read either 0 or $\uparrow +$ and 30 $( 4 + 0 + 6 + 2 0 )$ of these were called 0 or $1 +$ by manual digital read, resulting in a PA of $9 0 . 9 1 \%$ (30/33).

In addition, a precision study was conducted at one clinical site to assess the intra-instrument and inter-instruments precision for manual digital reads. A subset of thirty (30) slides from the comparison with conventional microscopy study was used. The slides were selected to provide an equal distribution of HER2 scores in the trichotomous categorization of the HER2 scores combining 0 and $1 +$ , and leaving $^ { 2 + }$ and $^ { 3 + }$ uncombined. For comparison, a pathologist reads first the thirty (30) glass-slides three times using the same conventional microscope. Then, the same pathologist reads the images of the thirty (30) glass-slides three times on a computer monitor, re-scanned each times on the same instrument. Finally, the same pathologist reads the images of the thirty (30) glass-slides another three times on a computer monitor, this time the slides were re-scanned each time on a different instrument. The wash-out period between reads were at least one week and the slides were randomized between reads.

The statistical analysis is presented for intra- and inter-instruments variations, using Percent Agreement (PA) with a $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval (Cl). The statistical analysis is provided for a trichotomous categorization of the HER2 scores combining 0 and $\ L _ { 1 + }$ , and leaving $^ { 2 + }$ and $^ { 3 + }$ uncombined. Table 7 shows the overall agreements across all slides and all pair wise comparisons of the different reads.
