Predicate Device: URISTK H Series Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Dirui H-50, H-100, or H-500 Urine Analyzer manufactured by Dirui Industrial Co. Ltd (K040703).

Device Description Healgen Series Reagent strips for Urinalysis and urine analyzers are in vitro diagnostic test devices that use reagents for qualitative and semiquantitative urinalysis. The device is composed of several color pads aligned on a strip. Each pad is employed for testing one assay item by visually or instrumentally reading the color change of the pad and comparing with the corresponding blocks on a color chart.

Healgen Series Reagent Strip provides tests for Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite, Ascorbic Acid and Leukocytes in Urine.

# Intended Use/lndications for Use

Healgen Series Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are in vitro diagnostic test devices that use reagents for qualitative and semi-quantitative urinalysis. The strips are for professional use only.

Healgen Series Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are intended for use to detect conditions indicating possible diabetes, metabolic abnormalities, liver diseases, kidney function, and urinary tract infections. Test results can be used along with other diagnostic information to rule out certain disease, states and to determine if microscopic analysis is needed.

# Test principles

Urobilinogen: this test is based on the Ehrlich reaction in which p-diethylamino benzaldehyde in conjunction with a color enhancer reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly acid medium to produce a pink-red color.

Bilirubin: The direct bilirubin and dichlorobenzene diazonium produce fuchsia azo dyes in a strongly acid medium.

Ketone: The acetoacetate and sodium nitroprusside cause a reaction in the alkaline medium, which produces a violet color.

Blood: Hemoglobin acts as a peroxidase. It can cause peroxidase to release neo-ecotypes oxide [0] [0] oxidizes the indicator and causes the color change.

Protein: The test is based on the protein-error-of-indicators principle. An ion in the specific pH indicator attracted by cation on the protein molecule makes the indicator further ionized, which changes its color.

Nitrite: Nitrite in the urine and aromatic amino sulphanilamide are diazotized to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound reacting with tetrahydro benzo (h) quinolin 3-phenol causes the color change.

Leukocytes: Granulocyte leukocytes in urine contain esterase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the pyrrole amino acid ester to liberate 3-hydroxy-5-pheny pyrrole.This pyrrole reacting with diazonium forms a purple color.

Glucose: The glucose oxidized by glucose oxidase catalyzes the formation of glucuronic acid and peroxide hydrogen. Peroxide hydrogen releases neo-ecotypes oxide [O] under the function of peroxidase. [O] oxidizes iodide potassium, which causes the color change.

Specific Gravity: Electrolyte $( M + X - 1$ in the form of salt in urine reacts with poly methyl vinyl ether and maleic acid (-COOH), which is a weak acid ionic exchanger. The reaction produces hydrogenous ionogen, which reacts with a pH indicator that causes the color change.

entire urinary pH range.

Ascorbic Acid: Ascorbic acid, with 1, 2-dihydroxy alkenes, under the alkaline condition, deoxidizes the blue 2, 6-dichloroindophenolate into colorless N- (p-phenol)-2, 6-dichloro- $\pmb { \mathsf { p } }$ amine phenol.

# Performance

The following are performance characteristicsof the Healgen Series Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Healgen Series Urine Analyzers.

# a.Analytical limits (cutoff):

We demonstrated the analytical limits of each assay item as below:

<table><tr><td>Analyte</td><td>Unit</td><td>Cutoff</td></tr><tr><td>Urobilinogen</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>,Bilirubin.</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>Ketone</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>3.5</td></tr><tr><td>Blood</td><td>cells/μL</td><td>6.5</td></tr><tr><td>Protein</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>7.2</td></tr><tr><td>Nitrite</td><td>μg/dL</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Leukocytes</td><td>cells /μL</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Glucose</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Ascorbic Acid</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>6.5</td></tr><tr><td>pH</td><td></td><td>5.6</td></tr><tr><td>Specific Gravity</td><td></td><td>1.003.</td></tr></table>

# Precision (repeatability/reproducibility):

Within-run and within-day precisions were determined at 3 clinical sites by 6 technicians.

In within-run precision testing, 20 replicates were run on each of the 3 levels of urine controls. Each of the 20 replicates was assayed consecutively, using strips obtained from each of 3 lots strips.

In witin-ay precisin testing, he 3 levels were analyzed  duplicate, e a day, or10 days strips obtained from 3 lots of strips.

All the 3 formats (Healgen 11, 10 and 4) strips and both of the reading method were used to perform the abovementioned evaluation. For instrumental reading, both Healgen 500 and Healgen 800 were used.

Urinalysis control Level 1 and Level 2 of Bio-Rad and a 3rd control with analyte concentrations around cutoff were used as samples for lower and higher levels.

The 3rd control was obtained by pooling the Bio-Rad controls and spiking with certain kinds of pure analytes to make all the analyte concentrations near the cutoff values.

# c. Reportable ranges:

Healgen Series Reagent Strips for Urinalysis are qualitative and semi-quantitative. The strips give results in a small range of concentration of each analyte. All the output values of Healgen Series Reagent Strips are within the laboratory assay ranges. The laboratory assay range and the reportable range of Healgen strips for each analyte are listed in the following table:

<table><tr><td>Analyte</td><td>Unit</td><td>Lab Assay Range</td><td>Reportable Range</td></tr><tr><td>Urobilinogen</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>0.01-18.75</td><td>0.2-8</td></tr><tr><td>Bilirubin</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>0-18.8</td><td>0-6</td></tr><tr><td>Ketone</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>0.2-350</td><td>0-160</td></tr><tr><td>Blood</td><td>cells /μL</td><td>0-350</td><td>0-200</td></tr><tr><td>Protein</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>0.3-5000</td><td>0-2000</td></tr><tr><td>Nitrite</td><td>. mg/dl</td><td>5.0-2000</td><td>Neg-Pos</td></tr><tr><td>Leukocytes</td><td>cells/μL</td><td>0-800</td><td>0-500</td></tr><tr><td>Glucose</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>0-5500</td><td>0-2000</td></tr><tr><td>Specific Gravity</td><td></td><td>1.000-1.040</td><td>1.000-1.030</td></tr><tr><td>pH</td><td></td><td>0-14.0</td><td>5.0-8.5</td></tr><tr><td>Ascorbic Acid</td><td>mg/dl</td><td>1-230</td><td>0-100</td></tr></table>

# d.Analytical specificity

The interference study was carried out by adding known amounts of potential interfering substances to urine samples and evaluated the test results. 5 test strips from each of 3 lots were used for each interference test, and all the interferents were tested in a one-at-a-time way.

A table of the studied concentrations of the potentially interfering substances that will not have influence on the test results is shown as below:

# eComparison Studies Using Clinical Specimens

The clinical comparison studies were conducted in 3 sites using the Healgen 11 Reagent Strip for Urinalysis and the predicate devices. Data obtained by visually reading and instrumental reading (Healgen 500 and 800) were collected. The study results indicated that comparable testing data could be obtained by intended users when using the Healgen 11 Reagent Strip for Urinalysis and the legally marketed URISTK H Series Reagent Strips for Urinalysis from Dirui.
