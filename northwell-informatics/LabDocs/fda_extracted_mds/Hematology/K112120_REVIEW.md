# L. Test Principle:

This assay measures the fibrin degradation product D-dimer, which is present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. The Diazyme D-Dimer Assay is a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay in which anti-D-dimer coated latex particles bind to the D-dimer proteins present in the sample, causing agglutination. The degree of turbidity is assessed optically and is proportional to the amount of Ddimer present in the sample. The actual amount of D-dimer is determined from a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

All analytical studies were performed on the Roche Modular P instrument.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A2. Three levels of D-Dimer controls (0.97, 2.99 and $7 . 4 7 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU), one unaltered pooled plasma sample $( 0 . 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU) and two plasma pools spiked with D-Dimer stock solution at levels of $2 . 4 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and $7 . 4 7 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU were tested. Samples were tested in duplicate, with 2 runs per day over 20 working days using three reagent and three calibrator lots. Acceptable criteria of $C V \leq 8 \%$ for analyte concentrations greater than $0 . 0 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU were met. The table below represents results for the combined data.

A reproducibility study was performed at three external testing sites. Testing included three reagent and calibrator lots. Four samples of citrated patient plasmas ranging from $0 . 3 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $7 . 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU were tested in duplicate for 2 runs per day for 5 non-consecutive days. Statistical evaluation was applied to identify sources of variability. Within-run, between-run, betweenday, between-lot (operator, site and instrument) and total precision were calculated. Results met acceptance criteria for $C V < 1 0 \%$ ; $< 0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU SD $0 . 0 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU, as summarized in the table below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was demonstrated following CLSI EP6-A. An 11-point linearity set was prepared from a plasma sample containing $8 . 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU by dilution of the plasma sample with saline at varying ratios. Samples were tested in triplicate, and demonstrated linearity for D-Dimer concentrations from 0.003 to $8 . 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ FEU. The acceptance criteria allowable total error of $< 1 0 \%$ was met.

A hook effect study was performed by testing dilutions of a high concentration D-dimer stock solution to levels ranging from $0 . 4 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU. No hook effect was observed in the claimed linear range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment for calibrators and controls:

Diazyme D-Dimer calibrators are derived from human serum and value assignment is based on the predicate assay Roche TINA QUANT D-Dimer system.

Diazyme D-Dimer controls are traceable to in-house standards. The Diazyme D-Dimer reagents and calibrators are used to determine the mean value of the newly prepared controls. The expected range is calculated $a s \pm 1 5 \%$ of the mean value as determined by testing with one Roche Modular P instrument, two lots of reagents and three vials from each level over two testing days.

# Reagent stability

Reagent shelf stability

All stability testing was performed using the Roche Modular P instrument. The reagent real time stability claim at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is based on ongoing real time stability data available for 3 lots of reagent, 9 months at time of clearance. The sponsor also provided data from accelerated stability studies on 2 lots of reagents tested at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . At specified times, assay kits were evaluated by testing D-Dimer controls ranging from 1.1 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $4 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU after calibration. Results demonstrated that the reagents were stable for 14 days at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and for 2 months at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

Acceptance Criteria of ${ < } 1 5 \%$ control recovery change from Day 0 value were met.

On-board reagent stability

On board reagent stability was performed by testing 3 levels of controls with one lot of reagents. Results demonstrated on-board stability of at least 6 weeks (Acceptance criteria $\leq 1 0 \%$ control recovery change from Day 0 value were met).

Calibrator stability Calibrator shelf stability

Real time stability data for storage of three calibrator lots at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ available at time of clearance supported calibrator shelf life of 9 months. In addition, sponsor provided data from accelerated studies that tested two calibrator lots stored at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Results demonstrated that the lyophilized calibrators were stable for 21 days at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and for 3 months at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ by meeting the acceptance criteria of $\leq 1 0 \%$ calibrator recovery from Day 0   
Reconstituted calibrator stability   
Reconstituted calibrator stability demonstrated at least 21 days stability at 2- $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . Acceptance criteria of $\leq 1 0 \%$ calibrator recovery from Day 0 were met in each of these studies.

Calibration curve stability

Three levels of controls from one lot were tested repeatedly after calibration at day 0 over a period of 28 days. This calibration stability study demonstrated a curve stability of 4 weeks (Acceptance criteria $\leq 1 0 \%$ control recovery change from Day 0 value were met).

# Control stability

Control shelf stability   
Real time stability data for storage of three control lots at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ available at time of clearance supported calibrator shelf life of 9 months. Accelerated study data on two control lots stored at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and tested in duplicate at specified times demonstrated that two lots of controls are stable for 19 days at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } C } }$ , and 3 months at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Acceptance criteria of $\leq 1 5 \%$ calibrator recovery from day 0 were met in each of these studies.

Stability of reconstituted controls

Reconstituted control stability was determined by repeat testing of 2 control lots for up to 28 days for storage at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ . Acceptance criteria of $\leq 1 5 \%$ calibrator recovery from day 0 were met in each of these studies. Likewise, these criteria were met for open-vial stability of up to 14 hours at room temperature.

# Sample stability

Two citrated plasma samples were tested daily after storage at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ . The acceptance criteria of ${ < } 1 0 \%$ change from day 0 were met for storage up to 4 days. One freeze- thaw cycle between day 3 and 4 further indicated freezethaw stability. Testing after 3 months of storage at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ demonstrated samples were stable and met the same acceptance criteria.

Sample freeze thaw stability

Freeze thaw stability was further demonstrated by testing 10 plasma samples ranging from 0.32 to $5 . 0 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU that had been frozen at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for three days. Results were compared to initial assessments of the fresh samples prior to freezing. Samples are within the predetermine acceptance criteria of $1 0 \% \ \mathrm { o r } \pm 0 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU for samples below $0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ FEU.

# d. Detection limit:

LOB, LOD, and LOQ of the Diazyme D-Dimer Assay were determined according to CLSI EP17- A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline, using $7 . 5 \%$ Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in saline as the true blank, and five citrated plasma samples on the Roche Modular P. For LOB determination, the citrated samples were diluted 1/100, and 12 replicates of each were assayed. Five blank samples were tested in quadruplicate on each of three testing days for a total of 60 observations and the LOB was determined to be $0 . 0 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU. Similarily, 5 citrated plasma samples were diluted 100 fold with saline containing $7 . 5 \%$ BSA. Each sample was tested in 12 replicates. The LOD was determined to be $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { \mu g / m L }$ FEU. Analysis of repeated testing of five diluted citrate plasma samples ranging in concentration from $0 . 0 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $0 . 9 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ FEU with 5 runs in 8 replicates per run by EP evaluator-8 fitted modeling calculated an LOQ of $0 . 1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ FEU.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Testing was performed by evaluating the effects of increasing concentrations of potential interfering substances on assay performance by testing spiked two plasma samples of high and low D-dimer concentration spiked with increasing concentrations of interferent in triplicate. The interfering substances of triglyceride, ascorbic acid, bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin, rheumatoid factor, heparin, and human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) showed no significant interference $( < \pm 1 0 \% )$ up to the concentrations summarized below.
