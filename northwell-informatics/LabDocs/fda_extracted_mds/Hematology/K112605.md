Device Description:</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The Sysmex® XN-Series modules (XN-10, XN-20) are multi-parameter hematologyanalyzers intended to perform tests on whole blood samples collected in Kz orK,EDTA and body fluids (pleural, peritoneal and synovial) collected in Kzanticoagulant. It can also perform tests on CSF which should not be collected in anyanticoagulant. The instrument consists of four principal units: (1) Two Main Units(XN-10, XN-20) which aspirate, dilute, mix, and analyze blood and body fluidsamples; (2) Two Auto Sampler Units (SA-10, SA-20) which supply samples to theMain Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information Processing Unit) which processesdata from the Main Unit and provides the operator interface with the system; (4)Pneumatic Unit which supplies pressure and vacuum from the Main Unit. The XN-Series analyzers perform analysis using the following methods: RF/DC DetectionMethod, Sheath Flow DC Detection Method, and Flow Cytometry Methods using aSemiconductor Laser. Particle characterization and identification is based ondetection of forward scatter, fluorescence and adaptive cluster analysis. The XN-Series analyzers automatically classify cells from whole blood and body fluids andcarry out all processes automatically from aspiration of the sample to outputting theresults.The body fluid analysis mode of the XN-Series analyzers uses the 4DIFFscattergram &amp; the RBC distribution obtained from a specialized analysis sequence tocalculate &amp; display the WBC (WBC-BF) counts, mononuclear cell (MN) /polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) counts &amp; percentages, TC-BF (Total Count) &amp; RBC(RBC-BF) counts found in the body fluid.Analysis results and graphics are displayed on the IPU screen.

Re: k112605 Trade/Device Name: Sysmex® XN-Series (XN-10, XN-20) Automated Hematology Analyzers Regulation Number: 21 CFR $\ S$ 864.5220 Regulation Name: Automated differential cell counter Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: GKZ Dated: October 15, 2012 Received: October 16, 2012

Dear Ms. Brooks:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class I (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes-and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice

requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will alow you to begin marketing your device as described in you Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address

# 4. INDICATIONS FOR USE STATEMENT

510(k) Number (if known) . K112605

Device Name: XN-Series (XN-10, XN-20) Automated Hematology Analyzers

Indications for Use:

The XN-Series modules (XN-10, XN-20) are quantitative multi-parameter automated hematology analyzers intended for in vitro diagnostic use in screening patient populations found in clinical laboratories.

The XN-Series modules classify and enumerate the following parameters in whole blood: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PLT (PLT-I, PLT-F), NEUT%/#, LYMPH%/#, MONO%/#, $E O \% / \#$ , BASO%/#, IG%/#, RDW-CV, RDW-SD, MPV, NRBC# $1 \%$ , RET%/#, IPF, IRF, RET-He and has a Body Fluid mode for body fluids. The Body Fluid mode enumerates the WBC-BF, RBC-BF, MN%/#, PMN%/#, and TC-BF parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serous fluids (peritoneal, pleural) and synovial fluids. Whole blood should be collected in ${ \bf K } _ { 2 }$ or $\operatorname { K } _ { 3 } \operatorname { E D T A }$ anticoagulant and, Serous and Synovial fluids in ${ \tt K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA anticoagulant to prevent clotting of fluid. The use of anticoagulants with CSF specimens is neither required nor recommended.
