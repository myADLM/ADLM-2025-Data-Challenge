# D.Device Description

The ViDAS® D-Dimer Exclusion il assay is an automated quantitative test for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family for the determination of fibrin degradation products FbDP) in human plasma (sodium citrate) using the ELFA (Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay) technique. VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II is indicated for use in conjunction with a clinical pretest probability assessment model to exclude deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) disease in outpatients suspected of DVT or PE.

The assay principle combines a two-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorecent detection LFA. The Solid Phase Receptacle R), a pipette tip-like device, serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. The assay reagents are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips (STRs). The individual kit components are described in detail on the following pages.

All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times.

First, the sample is taken by the SPR, diluted and then cycled in and out of the SPR several times. The antigen binds to the anti-FbDP immunoglobulins coated on the SPR. Unbound components are eliminated during a washing step. In the second step, the conjugate that contains an alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-FbDP monoclonal antibody is cycled in and out of the SPR to form a sandwich. Unbound components are eliminated during the washing steps.

A detection step is then performed. The substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone), the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . The intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antigen present in the sample. At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to the calibration curve stored in memory. The results are then printed.

Dear Ms Daenzer:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must

comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
