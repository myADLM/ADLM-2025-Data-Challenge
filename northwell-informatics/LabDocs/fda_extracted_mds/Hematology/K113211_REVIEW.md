# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff – Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material, June 7, 2007 · CLSI EP25-A: Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents; Approved Guideline (2009)

# L. Test Principle:

LA Positive control is a lyophilized preparation from human donors with antiphospholipid antibodies with added buffer. LA Negative control is a lyophilized preparation of a pool of normal human citrated platelet-poor plasma. The controls are used to assess the precision and accuracy of Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) assays

performed on IL Coagulation instrument platforms using HemosIL LA Reagents (LA dRVVT Screen/dRVVT Confirm, LAC Screen/LAC Confirm; Silica Clotting Time).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: To evaluate precision 9 vials were run over 1 day from 3 lots (27 samples total) for each control and were analyzed on the ACL TOP base analyzer with both the HemosIL dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm assays. Normalized Ratios (NR) were calculated as described below. Acceptance criteria were set at a NR of ${ \ge } 1 . 4$ for the Positive Control, and a NR of ${ \le } 1 . 2$ for the Negative Control. Both LA Controls met precision specifications. To evaluate reproducibility, 2 lots of each Control were tested with a single lot of HemosIL dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm assay on representative members of the instrument families for 20 days with 2 runs per day and 2 replicates for each run for each sample level $\mathrm { N } { = } 8 0$ per level/instrument/lot). Testing was done on the following instruments: ACL TOP/500CTS, ACL   
10000, ACL Advance, and ACL Classic. Acceptance criteria for both withinrun and total reproducibility were set at a CV $6 \%$ . Both LA Controls met reproducibility specifications. $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable $c$ . Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Stability: The lyophilized shelf life for the LA Controls is 24 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After reconstitution the LA Controls are stable for 24 hours at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 21 days at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ in the closed original vials. The on-board stability of the LA Controls after reconstitution are:   
24 hours on the ACL TOP Family   
4 hours on the ACL ELITE/ELITE PRO 8/9/10000   
4 hours on the ACL Futura/ACL Advance   
4 hours on the ACL Classic (100-7000) System

# Freezing stability claim:

Fresh vials were reconstituted and assayed at time 0 at the same time that the frozen vials were thawed in a $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ water bath. Two vials per time point per lot were pooled and assayed and the results were compared to the mean of the results from fresh vials at time 0. Each lot was assayed with the LAC Screen, LAC Confirm, SCT Screen, SCT Confirm, dRVVT Screen, and dRVVT Confirm assays.

Acceptance criteria are $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the zero point.

$\% \mathrm { V }$ ariation $=$ (Test clot time (sec))-(Zero point clot time (sec))/Zero point clot time (sec) $\mathbf { x l 0 0 \% }$

Because the LA Negative Controls were not stable at the 32 day time point, the 22 day time point was assayed and the acceptance criteria were met.

The LA Positive Controls was stable at the 32 day time point.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected values were based on determined normalized ratios (NR). The NR acceptance criterion for the HemosIL LA Positive Control was set at ${ \ge } 1 . 4 0 $ , which is the same as that for the HemosIL LA Positive Control and LA Negative Control with the LAC and Silica Clotting Time assays. The Negative Control NR acceptance criterion was established based on the normal cut-off for the dRVVT assay, which is 1.2. Therefore the acceptance criterion for the negative control is set at ${ \le } 1 . 2$ .
