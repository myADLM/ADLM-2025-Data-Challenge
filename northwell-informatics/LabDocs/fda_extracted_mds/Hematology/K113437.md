The instrument accepts the physical patient samples, performs the appropriate optical or potentiometric measurements on those samples and communicates that data to an integral Panel PC. The Panel PC uses keyboard or touch screen input to manually enter a variety of data, control and accept data from the instrument, manage and maintain system information and generate reports relative to patient status and instrument performance. The Panel PC also allows remote download of patient requisitions and upload of patient results via a standard interface. Prior to the ACE Hemoglobin Alc (HbA1c) Reagent assay, whole blood samples require a pretreatment step, which is done on-board the analyzer. The</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>red blood cells in the sample are lysed by the Hemoglobin Denaturant and the hemoglobin chains are hydrolyzed. For determination of HbAlc, a latex agglutination inhibition assay is used. In the absence of HbA1c in the sample, the agglutinator (synthetic polymer containing the immunoreactive portion of HbA1c) in the HbA1c Agglutinator Reagent and the antibody-coated microparticles in the HbA1c Antibody Reagent will agglutinate. The presence of HbA1c in the sample competes for the antibody binding sites and inhibits agglutination. The increase in absorbance, monitored monochromatically at 592 nm, is inversely proportional to the HbA1c present in the sample. For the determination of total hemoglobin, all hemoglobin derivatives in the sample are converted to alkaline hematin. The reaction produces a green colored solution, which is measured bichromatically at 573 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the total hemoglobin concentration in the sample. The concentrations of both HbA1c and total hemoglobin are measured, the ratio is calculated and the result reported as percent HbAlc. The CEDIA T Uptake assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based the bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments. These fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzyme which, in the assay format, cleaves a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically. In the assay, enzyme donor thyroxine conjugate binds directly to the unoccupied thyroxine- binding sites in the sample, preventing the spontaneous re-association of the</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>regulate the amount of β-galactosidase formed from the reassembly of the remaining donor and enzyme acceptor as monitored by the hydrolysis of the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside. The ACE T4 Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay using ready-to- use liquid ACE T4 Reagent. The assay uses 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) to dissociate thyroxine from the plasma binding proteins. Using specific antibodies to thyroxine, this assay is based on the competition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) labeled thyroxine and the dissociated thyroxine in the sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of thyroxine from the sample, the thyroxine labeled G6PD in the second reagent is bound by the specific antibody in the first reagent, inhibiting the enzyme's activity. The enzyme G6PD catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to form 6-phosphogluconate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). NADH strongly absorbs at 340 nm whereas NAD* does not. The rate of conversion, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at 340 nm/505 nm during a fixed time interval, is directly proportional to the amount of thyroxine in the sample. The concentration of thyroxine is determined automatically by the ACE Clinical Chemistry System using a logarithmic calibration curve established with</td></tr><tr><td>proportional to the ferritin concentration in the sample. Indications for Use:</td><td>calibrators, which are provided separately. In the Ferritin Assay, serum ferritin, in the presence of anti-ferritin conjugated latex micorparticles, and a buffer promoting aggregation, initiates an antigen- antibody reaction, resulting in the agglutination of the latex microparticles. The agglutination is detected turbidometrically by an absorbance change measured at a wavelength of 592 nm.
