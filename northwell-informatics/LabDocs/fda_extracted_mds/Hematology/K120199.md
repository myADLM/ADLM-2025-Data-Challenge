# 5.0 Description:

The HbA1c assay (B00389) involves the use of four reagents: Total Hemoglobin R1, HbA1c R1, HbA1c R2, and Hemolyzing Reagent (sold separately as Cat. No. 472137). In a pre-treatment step, whole blood is mixed with the Hemolyzing Reagent in a 1 to 100 dilution and the resultant hemolysate is used. Tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) in the Hemolyzing Reagent eliminates interference from leukocytes.

The concentrations of both HbA1c and Total Hemoglobin are determined. The HbA1c/Total Hemoglobin ratio is expressed either as mmol/mol (IFCC) or %HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP). Total Hemoglobin Reagent is used to measure total hemoglobin concentration by a colorimetric method. Change is absorbance is measured at 570/660 nm. HbA1c reagent is used to measure hemoglobin A1c concentration by a turbidimetric immunoinhibition method. In the reaction, hemoglobin A1c antibodies combine with HbA1c from the sample to form soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Polyhaptens from the reagent then bind with the excess antibodies and the resulting agglutinated complex is measured turbidimetrically. Change in absorbance is measured at 340/700 nm.

# 6.0 Intended Use:

The HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) reagent, when used in conjunction with Beckman Coulter Systems, HbA1c Calibrators, and SYNCHRON and AU Hemolyzing Reagent, is intended for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c concentration in human whole blood. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use only.

The absolute HbA1c and Total Hemoglobin (THb) values generated as part of the HbA1c assay are intended for use in the calculation of the HbA1c/Total Hemoglobin ratio and must not be used individually for diagnostic purposes.

The HbA1c Calibrators are an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) method on the AU clinical chemistry systems.

Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is accepted as a method to measure longterm glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus.

# Clinical Significance:

Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is accepted as a method to measure longterm glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus (a chronic disorder associated with disturbances in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism and characterized by hyperglycemia). Determination of hemogiobin A1c provides an important tool for monitoring the efficiency of dietary control and therapy during treatment of diabetes mellitus. Long term treatment of the disease emphasizes control of blood glucose levels in preventing the acute complications of ketosis and hyperglycemia. In addition, long term complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease can be minimized if blood glucose levels are effectively controlled.

The process of conversion from hemoglobin A to hemoglobin A1c depends on the blood glucose concentration. Since the average life of a red blood cell is 120 days, measurement of hemoglobin A1c can reflect the mean daily blood glucose concentration over the preceding two to three months and provides a much better indication of glycemic control than blood or urinary glucose determinations.

Dear Ms. Harding:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices and Radiological Health at (301) 796-5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH'S Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (301) 796-576-. For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/Medical
