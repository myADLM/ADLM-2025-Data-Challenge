# L. Test Principle:

Rabbit monoclonal anti-human antibody ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , Clone EP1, specifically binds to the estrogen receptor- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ antigen located in the nuclear region of a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues. Automated immunohistochemical staining is performed on routinely processed, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens using a specific heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method and incubation with the primary rabbit monoclonal antibody ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , Clone EP1. The procedure employs a ready-to-use horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked visualization reagent. And the enzymatic conversion of the added $\mathrm { D A B ^ { + } }$ chromogen results in the formation of a visible reaction product at the antigen site. Specimen may then be counterstained and coverslipped and visualized with a light microscope.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision:

Precision study was conducted with serial sections from12 different formalinfixed paraffin-embedded human breast carcinoma tissue blocks, representing a dynamic range of ER expression which included samples around the cutoff.

Testing was performed by three operators at a single site, utilizing a single instrument (Autostainer Link 48) per operator. Tissue sections were stained with ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , clone EP1 antibody using Dako EnVision™ FLEX visualization system protocol.

Study was focused on proportion scores based on a 0 to 5 scale and the goal was to demonstrate that estrogen receptor status (positive or negative) will remain the same within a specimen tested across all variables. A specimen is considered estrogen receptor-positive if $2 1 \%$ tumor cells display nuclear staining of any intensity.

Intra-run: Triplicate slides from each of 12 specimens were stained with ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , clone EP1 antibody on one Autostainer Link 48 instrument by one operator in a single run. Concurrently one section from each block was also stained with a negative control reagent.

Inter-run: A single slide from each specimen was stained with ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , clone EP1 antibody on the same one Link 48 instrument by the same one operator and repeated for five non-consecutive days. Concurrently, one section from each tissue block was also stained with a negative control reagent.

Inter-instrument/Inter-operator: A single slide from each of 12 specimens were stained with ER α, clone EP1 antibody on three unique Autostainer Link 48 instruments by three different operators on the same day. Concurrently,

one slide from each tissue block was also stained with a negative control reagent   
All 12 specimens stained with ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , EP1 clone antibody for intra-run, interrun and inter-operator had a $100 \%$ concordance agreement with regard to the Estrogen Receptor Status (Positive or Negative). And all Specimens stained with the NCR were negative with 0 specific staining and $< 1$ background staining.

# Reproducibility:

Study was conducted at $2 \mathrm { ~ U . S }$ sites and 1 foreign site. A set of 18 randomized (9 positive and 9 negative) breast cancer tissue blocks expressing different levels of ER $\mathfrak { a }$ which also included samples around the cutoff, were selected by screening cut sections of FFPE tissues. Tissue sections were stained on Dako Autostainer Link 48 instruments by performing 5 separate automated runs at each study site for 5 non-consecutive days. The first automated run for 18 specimens included a control slide stained with ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , clone EP1 antibody, and a negative control reagent (NCR) slide. A total of 270 tissue sections were employed for the staining runs performed with the ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , clone EP1 primary antibody reagent. Comparative results for the 3 study sites were within the established value of $2 8 5 \%$ set for negative percent agreement, positive percent agreement, and total percent agreement. Summary results of site-to-site reproducibility study using rabbit monoclonal ER $\mathfrak { a }$ antibody EP1 clone are shown in the tables below:

Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility study:

A single site, blinded, randomized, comparative study using 3 lots of antibody and full tissue sections of FFPE breast cancer tissue expressing differing levels of ER was conducted to assess lot-to-lot reproducibility. Three separate automated runs (11, 11 and 8 specimens) using a total of 30 different FFPE breast cancer tissue specimens, plus a positive and negative control slides, on Dako Autostainer Link48 instruments were stained with 3 different lots of the primary antibody and the appropriate negative control reagent (NCR). In addition, slides were scored and staining characteristics recorded by a single licensed pathologist. Lot-to-lot reproducibility within the 3 lots was evaluated by calculating the negative percent agreement, positive percent agreement, and total percent agreement of each paired lot. The range of negative percent agreement was above $9 2 . 9 \%$ to $100 \%$ across all lots, positive percent agreement was $100 \%$ across all lots and the total percent agreement was 96.7 to $100 \%$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability:

Stability was tested for 3 manufactured lots of RTU rabbit monoclonal antihuman ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , clone EP1 at specified time intervals in real time and in-use/onboard stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ , $3 7 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ . Prior to testing one lot of the antibody was also subjected to a rigorous transport simulation test i.e., 3 freeze/thawing cycles and incubation at $3 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C } - 3 9 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ for 16-24 hours and at $2 8 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C } - 3 2 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ for 4 days. Results demonstrated an interim shelf life of 12 months when store at $2 - 8 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ , based on the acceptance criteria of a positive specific staining in the nucleus of ER $\mathfrak { a }$ -positive cells and that results of specimens stained with the aged Rabbit Monoclonal anti-Human ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , should vary by no more than 0.5 grade specific staining intensity when compared to baseline and the freshly diluted EP1 clone antibody.

# Control:

Positive and negative controls should be performed with each staining run. The pathologist is responsible for assuring that the assay is performing properly.

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Sections from 90 normal tissues were tested with the ER $\mathfrak { a }$ , clone EP1 and Dako EnVision™ FLEX visualization system. Results demonstrated negative immunoreactivity with most tissues expected to be negative and positive nuclear staining was observed in a subset of normal cells from seven tissue types including epithelial cells and/or stromal cells from breast, cervix, esophagus, ovary, prostate, tonsil and uterus.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A blinded, randomized concordance study was conducted at 3-sites using FFPE full tissue sections containing invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) that exhibited differing levels of ER $\mathfrak { a }$ expression. A set of 173 different FFPE invasive breast cancer tissue samples were prescreened with the ER α component of the ER/PR pharmDx kit to ensure that there was an approximately equal distribution of ER $\mathfrak { a }$ -positive and ER $\mathfrak { a }$ - negative specimens and that a number of samples expressing ER $\mathfrak { a }$ staining levels near the cut-off value of $5 1 \%$ to $10 \%$ stained tumor cells were

adequately represented. All tissue sections were stained using FLEX monoclonal rabbit anti-human estrogen receptor $\mathfrak { a }$ , clone EP1, Ready to-Use (RTU) with EnVision™ FLEX. All slides were scored according to ASCO/CAP guidelines $( \geq 1 \%$ cut-off), and also with ER $\mathfrak { a }$ component of the Dako ER/PR pharmDx™ Kit, scored according to the Allred scoring guideline. All slides were scored according to this summarized accepted guideline below:
