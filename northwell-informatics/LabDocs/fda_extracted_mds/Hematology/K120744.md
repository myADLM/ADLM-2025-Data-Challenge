XN CHECKT BF   
Assayed Hematology Control   
Hematology Quality Control Mixture-(JPK-864.8625)

# Predicate Device:

Cell-Chex Auto-K053362

# Description:

XN CHECK™ BF is an in-vitro diagnostic product that contains the following: stabilized red blood cell component(s) and stabilized white blood cell component(s) in a preservative medium. The product is packaged in polypropylene plastic vials with screw caps containing $3 m |$ The vials will be packaged in (4) welled vacuum formed clamshell container with the product information sheet / assay sheet.The product must be stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \subset$

# Intended Use:

XN CHECK BF is used for control and calibration verification of Sysmex XN series (XN-10, XN-20) analyzers. It is not, however, intended for actual calibration of these analyzers.Assayed parameters include: 7

WBC-BF (103/µl), RBC-BF (10%/μ), MN# (103/μl), PMN# (103/μl), MN% (%), PMN% (%), TC-BF# $( 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu 1 )$

# Discussion of Tests and Test Results:

The following studies were conducted to establish performance of XN CHECK™M BF. The tests conducted wereOpen-Vial Stability, Closed-Vial Stability, and Precision Perormance.Al testing howed that  CHECK™ BF is consistently reproducible, substantialy equivalent o the predicate product and stable for the shelf life claimed.

# Conclusions Drawn From Tests:

Study results show XN CHECK™ BF to be consistently reproducible, substantially equivalent to the predicate products, and stable for the entire product dating. XN CHECK™ BF is a safe and effective product, which fulfils its intended use when used as instructed in the Instructions for Use.

Dear Ms. Kipp:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to
