M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Data were collected internally and at two external sites across 4 different

Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, throughout the product dating claim with 3 separately manufactured lots of XN-CHECK™ BF. Studies were conducted for each lot at all three (3) sites. The external sites performed 10 consecutive runs on each XN Series Instrument with separate vials of control from each lot. Control materials were shipped, stored, mixed, and handled in accordance with the Instructions for Use (IFU). Acceptance criteria were based on a compilation of the $C V \%$ for each measurand. Results collected across the three separately manufactured lots of XN CHECK™ BF demonstrated consistent recovery across multiple instruments at multiple sites and were within the parameter specific assay assignment ranges set forth for each measurand (see table below).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Value assignments:

Streck performed analyses on four Sysmex (XN-10 and XN-20) analyzers using two vials of each level of control, tested a minimum of five times per vial. Data were entered into the internally validated QC link database program (validation number PQ-062) to calculate the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) for each parameter analyzed.

The database allows computation and comparison of data that is used in the assay value assignment process as defined by controlled documents.

Expected range values assigned to each measurand were based on $\pm 3 . 0$ SD calculated from the total-run data collected. Total-run encompasses the values generated over multiple combined datasets compiled for all three lots of control.

# Reagent Stability

Acceptance criteria for open and closed vial stability were based on compilation of the $C V \%$ for each measurand on data collected across four different Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, at 3 sites, throughout the product dating claim, with three separately manufactured lots of XN CHECK™ BF.

# Open-vial stability:

30-day open-vial stability claim was validated at the end of the 84-day closed vial product expiration claim on Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzer. Two vials of each level of control from each of the three reference lots were analyzed in duplicate at multiple testing intervals over a period greater than 30 days. On a daily basis, vials were removed from storage and mixed in accordance with the instructions for use to simulate daily customer usage/handling.

# Closed-vial stability:

Three separately manufactured lots of XN CHECK™ BF lots were set up to validate closed-vial stability performance throughout the 84-day expiration dating at refrigerated temperature $( 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Data were collected using CLSI EP5-A2 methods on Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers.

All reported $C V \%$ values for open and closed-vial reagent stability were within the acceptable threshold values as shown in the tables above in section M. 1(a).
