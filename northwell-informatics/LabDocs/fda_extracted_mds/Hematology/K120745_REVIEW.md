# L. Test Principle:

XN CAL™ was designed to function as a substitute for fresh whole blood to calibrate the Sysmex XN Series instruments. This product is for in-vitro diagnostic use to calibrate the following parameters: RBC $\dot { ( } 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$ , HGB $( \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d } \mathrm { L } )$ , HCT $( \% )$ , PLT $( 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$ , WBC $( 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$ , and RET $( \% )$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Data were collected internally and at two external sites across 4 different Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers with 3 separately manufactured lots of

XN-CAL™. Studies were conducted for each lot at all three (3) sites. The external sites performed 10 consecutive runs on each XN Series Instrument with separate vials of calibrator from each lot. Control materials were shipped, stored, mixed, and handled in accordance with the instructions for use. The acceptance criteria were based on a compilation of the $C V \%$ for each measurand. Results across the three separately manufactured lots of XN CAL™ demonstrated consistent recovery across multiple instruments, at multiple sites within the parameter specific assay assignment ranges set forth for each measurand (see table below).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Value assignment:

Streck performed analyses on four Sysmex (XN-10 and XN-20) analyzers using two vials of calibrator tested a minimum of five times per vial. Data were entered into the internally validated QC link database program (validation number PQ-062) to calculate the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) for each parameter analyzed. The database allows computation and comparison of data that is used in the value assignment process as defined by controlled documents. Final assignment values were determined using data collected and established product performance characteristics. Expected range values assigned to the measurands were based on 2.5 SD from the total-run data collected for XN CAL™.

# Reagent Stability

The acceptance criteria for open and closed-vial stability were based on a compilation of the $C V \%$ for each measurand over data collected across four different Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, at three sites, throughout the product dating claim, with 3 separately manufactured lots of XN CAL™.

Open-vial stability: A 4 hour open-vial stability claim was validated at the end of the 35-day product expiration claim on XN series (XN-10, XN-20) analyzer. Two vials of calibrator from each reference lot were analyzed in duplicate for three consecutive days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 2 )$ ) on one analyzer.

Closed-vial stability: Three separately manufactured lots of XN CAL™ were set up to validate closed-vial stability performance throughout the 35-day expiration dating at refrigerated temperatures $\left( 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ on XN series (XN-10, XN-20) analyzer. Data were collected using CLSI EP25-A methods.

All $C V \%$ values for reagent stability were within the acceptable threshold values as shown in the table above in section M.1(a).
