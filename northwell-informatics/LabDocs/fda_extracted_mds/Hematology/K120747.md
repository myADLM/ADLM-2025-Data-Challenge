# Discussion of Tests and Test Results:

The following studies were conducted to establish performance of XN CAL ™ PF. The tests conducted were Open-Vial Stability, Closed-Vial Stability, and Precision Performance. All testing showed that XN CAL™F isconsitenty roducible substantially equivalent to he predicat product an stal the shelf life claimed.

# Conclusions Drawn From Tests:

Study results show XN CAL ™ PF to be consistently reproducible, substantially equivalent to the predicate products, and stable for the entire product dating. XN CAL™ PF is a safe and effective product, which fulfills its intended use when used as instructed in the Instructions for Use.

Dear Ms. Kipp:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for·use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898.
