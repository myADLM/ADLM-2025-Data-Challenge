# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI H26-A2, Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology Analyzers, October 2010.

CLSI EP5-A2 Methods, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline-Second Edition.

# L. Test Principle:

XN CAL™ PF is designed to function as a substitute for fresh whole blood to calibrate the Sysmex XN Series instruments. .XN CAL™ PF is used to calibrate the platelet count obtained for the PLT-F channel of the Sysmex XN Series analyzers.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Data was collected internally and at two external sites across 4 different Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers with 3 separately manufactured lots of XN-CAL™ PF. Studies were conducted for each lot at all three (3) sites. The external sites performed 10 consecutive runs on each XN Series Instrument with separate vials of calibrator from each lot. Control materials were shipped, stored, mixed, and handled in accordance with the instructions for use. The acceptance criteria were based on a compilation of the $C V \%$ for PLT-F. Results collected across the three separately manufactured lots of XN CAL™ PF demonstrate consistent recovery across multiple instruments, at multiple sites within the parameter specific assay assignment range set forth for PLT-F as shown in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment:

Streck performed analyses on four Sysmex (XN-10 and XN-20) analyzers using two vials of calibrator tested a minimum of five times per vial. Data were entered into the internally validated QC link database program (validation number PQ-062) to calculate the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) for each parameter analyzed. The database allows computation and comparison of data that is used in the assay value assignment process as defined by controlled documents. Final assigned values were determined using data collected and established product performance characteristics. Expected range values assigned to the calibrator were based on $\pm 2 . 5$ SD calculated from the total-run data.

# Reagent Stability

The acceptance criterion for open and closed-vial stability was based on a compilation of the $C V \%$ for PLT-F over data collected across four different Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, at three sites, throughout the product dating claim, with three separately manufactured lots of XN CAL™ PF.

Open-vial stability: A 4 hour open-vial stability claim was validated at the end of the 35-day product expiration claim on XN series (XN-10, XN-20) analyzer. Two vials of calibrator from each reference lot were analyzed in duplicate for three consecutive days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 2$ ).

Closed-vial stability: Three separately manufactured lots of XN CAL™ PF were set up to validate closed-vial stability performance throughout the 35- day expiration dating at refrigerated temperatures $\left( 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ on XN series (XN10, XN-20) analyzer. Data were collected according to CLSI EP5-A2 methods.

$C V \%$ value for open and closed vial XN CAL™ PF stability was within the acceptable threshold value as shown in the table above in section M.1(a).
