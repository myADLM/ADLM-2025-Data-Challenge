# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

The Virtuoso™ system provides automated digital slide creation, management, analysis, and viewing. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the display, detection, counting, review and classification of tissues and cells of clinical interest based on particular morphology, color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.

The Virtuoso™ System for Ki67 (30-9) is for digital read and image analysis applications. This particular Virtuoso™ system is intended for use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of Ki67 (30-9) protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. This device is an accessory to the Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. CONFIRM™ anti-Ki67 (30-9) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay. The Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. CONFIRM™ anti-Ki67 (30-9) assay is indicated for use in assessing the proliferative activity of normal and neoplastic breast tissue. When used with this assay, the Virtuoso™ System for Ki67 (30-9) is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of Ki67 status in breast cancer patients (but is not the sole basis for treatment).

Note: The IHC Ki67 (30-9) Digital Read and Image Analysis applications are adjunctive computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the acquisition and measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer specimens stained for the presence of Ki67 protein. The pathologist should verify agreement with the Image Analysis software application score. The accuracy of the test results depends on the quality of the IHC staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as specified in the instructions for the CONFIRM™ anti-Ki67 (30-9) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay to assure the validity of the Virtuoso™ System for Ki67 (30-9) Digital Read and Image Analysis scores. The actual correlation of CONFIRM™ anti-Ki67 (30-9) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary antibody assay to clinical outcome has not been established.

2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

For prescription use only

Indicated for use with either the Benchmark XT or ULTRA™ stainers.

\* A precautionary statement indicating that this device has not been tested, or its safety and effectiveness validated, when used with a personal computer (PC) from home was included in the Limitations section of the device package insert.

# I. Special Control/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

The performance of the Virtuoso™ System for Ki67 (30-9) when used in conjunction with the Benchmark ULTRA™ stainer was validated by assessing the positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent agreement (OPA) between the reference manual method (with a traditional microscope) and both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of the Virtuoso™ system. Patient slides were scored as positive or negative for Ki67 status using the percent positive staining cutoff of $< 1 0 \%$ for the distinction between positive and negative staining.

Concordance with manual scoring was assessed between scores assigned to 120 specimens for both digital reads and image analysis. The acceptance criteria of an overall agreement rate of at least $7 5 \%$ were met in these studies. Concordance of digital reads with manual scoring was assessed at one site, whereas concordance of image analysis with manual scoring was performed at 3 study sites. The agreements with the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown below. All confidence intervals are 2-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals calculated using the score method.
