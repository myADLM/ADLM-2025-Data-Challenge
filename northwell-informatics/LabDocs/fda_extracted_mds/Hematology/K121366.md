# Infopia Co.,Ltd. Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Monitoring System Special 510(k) for In Vitro Diagnostic Device

# 5. Description:

The Hemocue® HbA1c 501 ™M Glycosylated Hemoglobin test system measures Hemoglobin Alc in venous and capillary whole blood. The Hemocue® HbA1c 501 TM Glycosylated Hemoglobin test system includes Analyzer, Test cartridge, Check cartridges(Monthly and Daily), Thermal printer, Barcode scanner, PC cable and fan filter. The Hemocue® HbAlc ${ 5 0 1 } ^ { \mathrm { \tilde { m } } }$ Glycosylated Hemoglobin test system is a fully automated boronate affinity assay for the determination of the percentage of hemoglobin $\mathbf { A l c ( H b A l c , \% ) }$ in human whole blood.

The Test Cartridge consists of a cartridge and a reagent pack containing the reagents necessary for the determination of hemoglobin Alc, with a sampling area for blood collection.

The reagent pack is pre-filled with reagent solution and rinsing solution. The reagent solution contains agents that hemolyse erythrocytes and bind hemoglobin specifically as well as a boronate resin that binds to the cis-diols of glycated hemoglobin.

The blood sample (4uL) is collected at the sampling area of the reagent pack, which is then inserted into the cartridge, where the blood is instantly lysed releasing the hemoglobin and the boronate resin binding the glycated hemoglobin.

The reagent pack containing the blood sample is inserted in Hemocue® HbA1c 501 Analyzer (in which the cartridge has been placed). The cartridge is automatically rotated, placing the blood sample in the measuring zone. The total hemoglobin is photometrically measured by the diffused reflectance of the optical sensor composed of both a LED (Light Emitting Diode) and a PD (Photo Diode). The assembled cartridge is rotated and the rinsing solution washes out non-glycated hemoglobin from the blood sample, enabling photomectical measurement of glycated hemoglobin.

# 6. Indications for use:

The HemoCue® HbA1c501 assay is an in vitro diagnostic test that quantitatively measures the percent concentration glycosylated hemoglobin in capillary or venous whole blood samples for clinical laboratory and point of care use. Measurement of percent HbAlc is used to monitor long-term glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. HemoCue® Hbal c501 is for in vitro diagnostic use and is not to be used for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.

The test is for prescription use as an aid in the management of diabetes.

7. Comparison to the Cleared Device

The device appearance (Analyzer &Test cartridge) has been changed, and glucose module function has been removed. Display resolution &Graphic User Interface design has been improved. Other than these modifications, the modified meter has the following similarities to the cleared device:

has the same intended use,   
uses the same operating principle,   
incorporates the same materials,   
•adopts the same use environment and calibration method, and has the same shelf life.

8. Performance Data

Clinical: The clinical performance evaluation using the HemoCue® HbA 1c501components were conducted for purpose of validating the professional accuracy. Test results showed substantial equivalence.

Non-clinical: Verification, validation and testing activities were conducted to establish the performance, functionality and reliability characteristics of the HemoCue® HbA1c501 System. The device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

# 9. Conclusion

The conclusion drawn from the clinical and nonclinical tests is that the HemoCue® HbA 1c501System is as safe, as effective and performs as well as the legally marketed predicate device, CLOVER A1c TM System (K082275).

Dear Ms. Griffin:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
