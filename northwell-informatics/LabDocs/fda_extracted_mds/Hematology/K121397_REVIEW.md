FDA’s Guidance for Industry and FDA staff: Review Criteria for Assessment of Qualitative Fecal Occult Blood In Vitro Diagnostic Devices; August 8, 2007.

# L. Test Principle:

The OSOM iFOB (Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood) Test is a rapid test which can detect the presence of occult blood in human fecal samples by detecting the presence of human hemoglobin (hHb). The OSOM iFOB Test is a qualitative assay that employs immunochromatographic, lateral flow technology. The fecal sample collected using an OSOM iFOB sample collection card is placed into a prefilled vial containing extraction buffer. This test solution is then dispensed, through a dropper tip containing human hemoglobin antibody conjugated to latex, into the sample well of the test device. The sample migrates across the membrane containing a Test line coated with anti-human hemoglobin antibody and a Control line. If hemoglobin is present at or above the level of detection of the test, an antigen/antibody complex will be formed. The appearance of a visible blue Test line and a red Control line in the result window indicates the presence of human hemoglobin in the sample. A red control line must appear for the results to be valid. If a detectable level of hemoglobin is not present, only the red Control line will appear in the result window. An invalid test occurs when no control line appears.

The Control line serves as an internal procedural control, indicating that the test system is functioning correctly and that the operator added a sufficient volume of sample. In addition to the internal control in each test device, external controls are available in a separate OSOM iFOBT control kit. The Negative Control (buffer solution) and the Positive Control (hHb in buffer solution) are run in the iFOB Test in the same manner as an extracted fecal sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To demonstrate the reproducibility of the OSOM iFOB Test, an evaluation was conducted at three external physician office laboratories (POL) and one internal site using three OSOM test kit lots. Each site tested randomly coded panels of fecal samples spiked with human blood, with known concentrations of hemoglobin A (HbA) at five different concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Testing was performed at the external POL sites by 3 intended users per site, with varying levels of education and work experience. Testing at Sekisui Diagnostics was performed by two experienced laboratory professionals. Each panel consisted of 15 test samples, 3 of each of the 5 hemoglobin concentration levels, dried onto an OSOM iFOB sample collection card. Each POL operator tested, in a random fashion, 1 panel on each of the 3 lots of the OSOM iFOB Test. The internal site tested the same number of samples across the 3 lots, with the panels divided between the two operators. Testing was performed over three non-consecutive days and all operators were blinded to the test sample analyte levels.

The results obtained by the three POL sites and the reference laboratory had an overall agreement of $9 8 . 5 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 7 . 4 - 9 9 . 0 \%$ to the expected results, with a positive percent agreement of $9 8 . 5 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 6 . 4 - 9 9 . 3 \%$ , and a negative percent agreement of $9 8 . 6 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 6 . 0 - 9 9 . 5 \%$ . A summary of the reproducibility study result is provided in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The device and controls are not traceable to any recognized reference materials.

Internal Control: Procedural controls are included in the test device. The control line serves as an internal procedural control, indicating that the test system is functioning correctly and that the operator added a sufficient volume of sample.

External Quality Control: In addition to the internal control in each test device, external controls are available in a separate OSOM iFOBT control kit. The negative control (buffer solution) and the positive control (hHb in buffer solution) are run in the iFOB Test in the same manner as an extracted fecal sample. It is recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper test performance.

Sample Stability: Fecal samples with negative ( $\mathrm { 0 \ n g / m L }$ hHbA) and positive (50 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ hHbA) were applied to sample collection cards, dried, and stored in mailing envelopes at room temperature for 46 days. Testing was performed $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ at intervals with the OSOM iFOB Test. All positive samples were positive and all negative samples were negative, demonstrating that fecal sample is stable for 46 days when stored at room temperature.

Sample Shipping Stress test: To assess the effects of exposure to transportation stress and environmental extremes on the stability of dried fecal samples, negative $\mathrm { { ( 0 n g / m L } }$ hHbA) and positive $\mathrm { \ 5 0 \ n g / m L }$ hHbA) fecal samples were prepared, applied to sample collection cards, dried, and placed in mailing envelopes. In evaluating the effect of exposure to elevated temperatures, fecal samples were stored for 8 hours at $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , and $6 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and for 2 days at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . To evaluate the effect of low temperature exposure, samples were stored for 2 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 2 days at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ with two freeze/thaw cycles. Stressed samples were tested $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ with the OSOM iFOB Test. All results were acceptable, demonstrating that dried fecal samples are stable in the mailing envelope up to 8 hours at temperatures as high as $6 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and up to 2 days at temperatures as low as ${ } - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with up to two freeze/thaw cycles.

iFOB Test Kit Stability Study: Real time stability of the device (cassette, conjugate vial tips, extraction reagent vials) was tested with 3 lots of the device. Devices were stored at ambient room temperature $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for ten months. Three devices from each lot were tested with spiked fecal samples at time points 0, 9, and10 months in support of an initial nine months shelf-life. All test results were acceptable demonstrating an initial stability of nine months when store at room temperature. Stability testing with spiked fecal samples, in triplicate will continue for the duration of the stability study to extend the expiration dating based on passing stability results.

iFOB Test Kit Shipping Stress Test: To evaluate the effect of exposure to elevated temperatures, iFOB reagents were stored for 8 hours at $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $6 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and for 2 days at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . To evaluate the effect of low temperature exposure, reagents were stored for 2 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 2 days at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with two freeze/thaw cycles. Reagents were also stored at room temperature (unstressed) as a control condition. Spiked fecal samples and liquid hemoglobin controls (negative and low level positive HbA control) were then tested with these stored reagents. At zero time point testing was performed with five replicates and testing was performed in triplicate for other time points. All test results were acceptable, demonstrating that iFOB Test Kit performance was unaffected by the extreme temperatures tested.

iFOBT Control Kit Stability Study: Shelf life for iFOBT Controls was estimated by accelerated stability testing of two lots of controls conducted at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Testing was performed with one lot of iFOB Test reagents and included five replicates on day zero and three replicates on all other days. The observed accelerated stability results for 65 days of testing predict 24 months shelf life for the OSOM iFOBT Control Kit at a storage temperature of $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Accelerated stability studies will continue up to 100 days, and confirmatory real time stability studies at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and at room temperature will continue for 24 months.

In addition to studies to determine expiry dating, open vial stability studies were performed for the iFOB Controls. Three vials each of two lots of the negative and positive controls were tested after opening on day zero, vials were re-capped and stored at room temperature. Testing of all vials was performed in triplicate on day-15 and day-31. All results were acceptable, demonstrating 30 days open vial stability at room temperature.

iFOBT Control kit Shipping Stress Test: iFOBT test kits and two lots of the control (positive and negative) stored at $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , $6 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 4 and 8 hours and at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 2 days were tested. Effect of low temperature exposure was evaluated by storing controls at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2 days and at ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ for 2 days with two freeze/thaw cycles. Control materials were also stored at room temperature (unstressed) as a control condition. At zero time point testing was performed with five replicates and testing was performed in triplicate at other time points. Test results showed that positive and negative controls were not stable at $6 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and stable at all other conditions tested.

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limit of the device was determined by spiking hemoglobin free stool samples with known concentrations of hemoglobin A at five different concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5 and $2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g } \mathrm { h H b } / \mathrm { m L }$ . The cut-off level was determined to be $5 0 \ \mathrm { n g \ h H b / m L }$ and no prozone effect was seen at up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g }$ hHb/mL.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The ability of the OSOM iFOB Test to detect human hemoglobin variants was demonstrated in testing of known levels of hemoglobin-S (HbS) and hemoglobinC (HbC) across three reagent lots. All three lots of iFOB Test detected the presence of both HbS and HbC at concentrations of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and higher.
