# 5.0 Description:

The UniCel DxC SYNCHRON Systems Hemoglobin A1c- (HbA1c-) Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c concentration in human whole blood. The UniCel DxC Systems utilize two unique cartridges, Hband A1c-, to determine hemoglobin A1c concentration as a ratio of total hemoglobin.

Hb- reagent is used to measure total hemoglobin concentration by a colorimetric method. The system automatically proportions the appropriate sample and reagent volumes into the cuvette. The ratio used is one part sample to 8.6 parts reagent. The system monitors the change in absorbance at 410 nanometers. This change in absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of total hemoglobin in the sample and is used by the system to calculate and express total hemoglobin concentration.

A1c- reagent is used to measure the hemoglobin A1c concentration by a turbidimetric immunoinhibition method. In the reaction, hemoglobin A1c antibodies combine with hemoglobin A1c from the sample to form soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Polyhaptens from the reagent then bind with the excess antibodies and the resulting agglutinated complex is measured turbidimetrically. The system automatically proportions the appropriate sample and reagent volumes into the cuvette. The ratio used is one part sample to 28 parts reagent. The system monitors the change in absorbance at 340 nanometers. This change in absorbance is inversely proportional to the concentration of hemoglobin A1c in the sample and is used by the systems to calculate and express hemoglobin A1c concentration as a ratio of total hemoglobin.

# 6.0 Indications for Use:

The Hemoglobin A1c- reagent, when used in conjunction with UniCel® DxC 600/800 SYNCHRON $\textcircled{8}$ Systems, UniCel® DxC SYNCHRON $\textcircled{8}$ Systems HbA1cCalibrators and SYNCHRON® and $A ( \sqrt { R } )$ Systems Hemolyzing Reagent, is intended for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c concentration in human whole blood.

Measurement of hemoglobin A1c measures long-term glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus.

3.0 Summary of Changes, Risk Analysis, Design Verification and Design Validation activities:

The UniCel DxC SYNCHRON Systems Hemoglobin A1c- reagent formulation and manufacturing process have been enhanced by the OEM manufacturer. The reagent to sample ratio and other $\mathsf { D x C }$ instrument parameters has been refined. The Calibrator level 1 was changed to a non-zero concentration utilizing the same matrix and manufacturing process as levels 2-5. Calibrator value-assignment process has been updated while maintaining traceability to IFCC reference method. New specifications and data were generated in support of these changes.

# Risk Management Process for HbA1c

A Risk Management Plan was created to describe the various risk assessments required for the device modification and its components.

A design risk assessment (Failure Modes & Effects Analysis or FMEA) was developed to identify potential risks on instrument parameter optimization, calibrator value assignment and system interaction associated with the device modification.

• A process FMEA was developed to identify potential risks related to manufacturing processes.

• A risk assessment on two software tols for interal data analysis was developed to identify potential risks on the software's intended use.

All risk assessments require that testing and reports (design verification, design validation and process validation) are complete before potential risks are mitigated.

All safety-related risks (those that could potentially affect patient, bystander such as instrument operator, manufacturing personnel and field service engineer) from the various risk assessments are required to be transferred to a System Risk Assessment (SRA).

A Comprehensive Risk Management Review meeting is required before a Risk Management Report is written.
