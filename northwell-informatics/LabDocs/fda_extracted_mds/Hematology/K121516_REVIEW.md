# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

The Virtuoso system provides automated digital slide creation, management, analysis, and viewing. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the display, detection, counting, review and classification of tissues and cells of clinical interest based on particular morphology, color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.

The Virtuoso™ System for IHC HER2 (4B5) is for digital read and image analysis applications. This particular Virtuoso system is intended for use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of HER2 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. This device is an accessory to Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. PATHWAY® anti-HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody. The PATHWAY® anti-HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom HERCEPTIN® (Trastuzumab) treatment is being considered.

NOTE: The IHC HER2 4B5 Digital Read and Image Analysis applications are adjunctive computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the acquisition and measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer specimens stained for the presence of HER-2/neu receptor protein. The pathologist should verify agreement with the Image Analysis software application score. The accuracy of the test results depends on the quality of the immunohistochemical staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as specified in the instructions for the PATHWAY® anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay used to assure the validity of the iScan System for IHC HER2 4B5 Digital Read and Image Analysis scores. The actual correlation of PATHWAY® anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) to clinical outcome has not been established.

# 2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

For prescription use only

Indicated for use with either the Benchmark XT or ULTRA™ stainers.

\* A precautionary statement indicating that this device has not been tested, or its safety and effectiveness validated, when used with a personal computer (PC) from home was included in the Limitations section of the device package insert.

# I. Special Control/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

The performance of the Virtuoso™ System for HER2 (4B5) when used in conjunction with the Benchmark ULTRA™ stainer was validated by assessing the positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent agreement (OPA) between the reference manual method (with a traditional microscope) and both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of the Virtuoso™ system. Patient slides were scored as positive or negative for HER2 status defining negative as 0 and $1 +$ and positive as $^ { 2 + }$ and $3 +$ .

Concordance with manual scoring was assessed between scores assigned to 120 specimens for both digital reads and image analysis. For digital reads, only 106 specimens were analyzed due to quality control failures. Concordance of digital reads and image analysis with manual scoring was assessed at one site. The agreements with the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown below. All confidence intervals are 2-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals calculated using the score method.
