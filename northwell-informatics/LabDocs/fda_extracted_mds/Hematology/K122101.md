# l. 510(k) SUMMARY

# INTENDED USE AND SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURES

The CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit is designed for separation and quantification of the HbA1c glycated fraction of hemoglobin in human blood, by capillary electrophoresis in alkaline buffer (pH 9.4) with the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument. The CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit is designed for laboratory use. Measurement of the hemoglobin A1c is effective in monitoring long-term glycemic control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. The CAPILLARYS Hb A1c kit is designed for Professional Use Only.

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

The CAPILLARYS Hb A1c procedure performed with the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument has been certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP).

Electrophoresis is a well established technique routinely used in clinical laboratories for measuring components from body fluids, including HbA1c glycated fraction. The CAPILLARYS 2 FLEXPIERCING instrument has been developed to provide complete automation of this testing with fast separation and good resolution. In many aspects, the methodology can be considered as an intermediary type of technique between classical zone electrophoresis and liquid chromatography.

The CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument uses the principle of capillary electrophoresis in free solution. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their electrophoretic mobility in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH.Separation also occurs according to the electrolyte pH and electroosmotic flow.

The CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument has silica capillaries functioning in parallel allowing 8 simultaneous analyses for HbA1c quantification from whole blood sample. A sample dilution with hemolysing solution is prepared and injected by aspiration at the anodic end of the capillary. A high voltage protein separation is then performed and direct detection of the hemoglobins is made at the cathodic end of the capillary at 415 nm, which is the absorbance wave length specific to hemoglobins.Before each run, the capillaries are washed with a wash solution and prepared for the next analysis with buffer.

Direct detection provides accurate relative quantification of individual hemoglobin A1c fraction. In addition, the high resolution of CAPILLARYS Hb A1c procedure allows the quantification of $H b A 1 c ,$ even in the presence of labile HbA1c, carbamylated , acetylated hemoglobins, major hemoglobin variants such as HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE and HbF and common interfering factors such as Triglycerides, Bilirubin, Ascorbic Acid, Urea, Rheumatoid factor, and Glybenclamide as outlined in the package insert labeling.

By using alkaline pH buffer, normal and abnormal (or variant) hemoglobins are detected in the following order, from cathode to anode : A2/C, E, S/D, F, A0, other Hb (including minor Hb A1) and then A1c.

COMPARISON (CONCORDANCE), SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE AND PERFORMANCE STUDIES

The performance and comparative studies of the CAPILLARYS Hb A1c test performed with the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING system were performed using SEBIA's commercially available materials and standard procedures.

Similarly, in comparative studies, commercially available materials and standard procedures were used with the predicate device: TOSOH G8 Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 (K071132), which are based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of blood samples for Hb A1c analysis.

The SEBIA CAPILLARYS Hb A1c procedure, performed with the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING system were found to be substantially equivalent in function, use, safety, effectiveness and the performance to predicate devices described above.

The following tables presents the similarities and the differences between the SEBIA CAPILLARYS Hb A1c test, calibrators and controls perfoimed with the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING as compared to the TOSOH G8 automated glycohemoglobin analyzer HLC-723G8 (K071132) both used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of Hb A1c .

Dear Ms. Anderson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
