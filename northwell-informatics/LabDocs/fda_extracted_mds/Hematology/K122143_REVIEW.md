# G. Intended Use:

1. Indication(s) for Use:

The Virtuoso™ system provides automated digital slide creation, management, analysis, and viewing. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the display, detection, counting, review and classification of tissues and cells of clinical interest based on particular morphology, color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.

The Virtuoso™ System for IHC PR (1E2) is for digital read and image analysis applications. This particular Virtuoso™ system is intended for use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of progesterone receptor (PR) protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. This device is an accessory to the Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay. The CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom endocrine treatment is being considered (but is not the sole basis for treatment).

Note: The IHC PR (1E2) Digital Read and Image Analysis applications are adjunctive computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the acquisition and measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer specimens stained for the presence of PR protein. The pathologist should verify agreement with the Image Analysis software application score. The accuracy of the test results depends on the quality of the immunohistochemical staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as specified in the instructions for the CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody used to assure the validity of the Virtuoso System for IHC PR Digital Read and Image Analysis scores. The actual correlation of CONFIRM™ antiPR antibody to clinical outcome has not been established.

2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

For prescription use only.

Indicated for use with either the Benchmark XT or ULTRA™ stainers.

\* A precautionary statement indicating that this device has not been tested, or its safety and effectiveness validated, when used with a personal computer (PC) from home was included in the Limitations section of the device package insert.

# I. Special Control/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

The performance of the Virtuoso™ System for PR (1E2) when used in conjunction with the Benchmark ULTRA™ stainer was validated by assessing the positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent agreement (OPA) between the reference manual method (with a traditional microscope) and both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of the Virtuoso™ system. A total of 120 patient slides were scored as positive or negative for PR status using the percent positive staining cutoff of $< 1 \%$ for the distinction between positive and negative staining. . The agreements with the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown below. All confidence intervals are 2-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals calculated using the score method.
