3. Product code: JOZ, System, Automated Platelet Aggregation

4. Panel: 81 Hematology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The AggreGuide A-100 Aspirin assay is a qualitative system to aid in the detection of platelet dysfunction due to aspirin ingestion by those 18 years of age or older in $3 . 2 \%$ citrated venous whole blood. For professional use.

This test is not for use in patients with underlying congenital platelet abnormalities or in patients receiving non-aspirin anti-platelet agents.

The test results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory data available to the clinician.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only

Limitations:

Pre and Post $3 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ Aspirin study - The study results used to demonstrate the performance of the AA assay are based predominantly on healthy subjects (i.e. having 2 or less cardiovascular disease risk factors) ingesting non-coated aspirin. Ten percent $( 1 0 \% )$ of study subjects showed platelet dysfunction at baseline without ingesting aspirin.

Post $8 1 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ Aspirin Study - Sixty $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 6 0 )$ ) healthy subjects were studied at one time point post-aspirin ingestion of non-coated aspirin. Twelve $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 2 )$ of subjects were on chronic aspirin, and forty eight $( \mathrm { n } { = } 4 8 )$ subjects took aspirin for one week. Eighty-two percent $( 8 2 \% )$ of the subjects showed platelet dysfunction post aspirin ingestion. The prevalence of platelet dysfunction at baseline for patients taking $8 1 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ aspirin has not been established.

4. Special instrument requirements:

The AggreGuide A-100 instrument is required to test the AggreGuide A-100 AA assay.

# I. Device Description:

The AggreGuide A-100 system consists of a stand-alone AggreGuide A-100 instrument and single use AggreGuide A-100 AA cartridge. Sodium citrated venous whole blood is added to the cartridge in the reaction chamber containing freeze dried arachidonic acid. The amount of platelet aggregation is measured by detecting the laser light scattered. Result is reported as Platelet Activity Index (PAI). The PAI is related to the number of platelets aggregated.

Higher PAI values represent a higher level of platelet aggregation. Lower PAI values represent a lower level of platelet aggregation.

# L. Test Principle:

The AggreGuide A-100 is a laser light scattering system that detects the level of platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid agonist when whole blood is added to the AggreGuide A-100 AA assay cartridge. Arachidonic acid in the platelet is oxygenated and rearranged by cyclooxygenase (COX-1) into endoperoxide and subsequently into thromboxane. When thromboxane is released from the platelets and binds to the thromboxane receptors, platelet aggregation occurs. Aspirin irreversibly inactivates COX-1 which renders the platelets unresponsive to arachidonic acid, causes platelet dysfunction. The amount of platelet aggregation is measured by detecting the laser light scattered. Result is reported as Platelet Activity Index (PAI).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Assay reportable range:

2-12 PAI

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: Not applicable

Stability:

AggreGuide A-100 AA Assay Cartridge: To support a 12 month shelf life, the study was conducted at different time points for a 14 month period. Multiple lots were used in the study. At each time point, the aged cartridge was tested and results were compared to a freshly made cartridge using split fresh whole blood samples. Results were within acceptable limits.

# Controls:

Each reagent cartridge is checked by the AggreGuide instrument to ensure the cartridge is functioning properly.   
The electronic QC cartridge is performed weekly to verify that there have been no changes in the light scattering signal from the factory calibration.   
There are no manufactured external controls for AggreGuide A-100 AA assay. The manufacturer recommends that laboratories should establish their own donor reagent controls and may consider the following when establishing control donor groups:   
1) Normal PAI value: Blood drawn from healthy adults may be used for normal controls. The donor must not have taken any medication that is known to affect platelet function for at least 7 days and should have prior platelet aggregation tests that have fallen within the normal range established by the laboratory. The manufacturer recommends using donors whose PAI value is ${ > } 5$ .   
2) Abnormal PAI value: Blood drawn from a donor who has been on aspirin may be used for abnormal controls. The donor must be on chronic aspirin treatment. The manufacturer recommends using donors whose PAI value is ${ < } 4$ .

Aggredyne recommends that normal and abnormal donor control checks be performed for each new lot of AA assay cartridges. Additional QC check may be performed on a monthly, weekly, daily or shift basis based on the laboratory’s quality control policies. The end user should follow the recommendations of local and state regulatory agencies as well as facility policies.

Calibrators:

No calibrators are provided. Calibration is established by the manufacturer.

# d. Detection limit:

To determine the blank/noise level for the AggreGuide A-100, three instruments and two assay cartridges specifically prepared (without reagents, without agonist) were used in the study. Blood samples from three donors were tested on each type of cartridge for 28 to 30 replicates. The study demonstrated that the PAI values 0-2 represent the blank/noise level, no detectable aggregation.

# e. Analytical specificity:

i. Bilirubin: Blood was collected from 3 donors and spiked with bilirubin solution yielding control and elevated bilirubin samples. The AA assays were conducted in duplicate. The study demonstrated that there is no significant difference in platelet aggregation between the control samples and elevated bilirubin samples up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .   
ii. Hemolysis: Blood was collected from 3 donors and spiked with hemoglobin. The AA assays were performed in singlicate. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in platelet aggregation between the control samples and samples with elevated hemoglobin up to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .   
iii. Lipid: Measurements of PAI from the AA assay were compared to the baseline and elevated triglyceride from 3 donors subsequent to a high fat meal. The study demonstrated that there is no significant difference in platelet aggregation between the control samples and samples with elevated triglyceride up to $3 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable

3. Clinical studies

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

The clinical performance of the AggreGuide A-100 AA assay was evaluated at three sites with 169 healthy adults for pre and post $3 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ aspirin ingestion. Sixteen (16) subjects were not evaluable because pre-aspirin ingestion PAI results were below 4. Thirteen (13) subjects did not return for post-aspirin ingestion, two (2) subjects did not pass inclusion criteria, yielding 138 evaluable subjects. Each test subject had a baseline AA assay measurement. Then subjects took a single dose of $3 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ noncoated aspirin and had an AA measurement after 2-30 hours of aspirin ingestion. The pre-established cut-off value, $\mathrm { P A I } < 4$ , was used to determine sensitivity, indicating low platelet activity or platelet dysfunction.
