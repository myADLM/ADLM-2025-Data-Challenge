For Prescription Use Only

# 4. Special instrument requirements: For use with the Bio-Rad VARIANTTMII TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System

# E. Description of Device:

The VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System uses the principles of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The VARIANT II TURBO $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { l c } } \mathrm { K i t }$ 2.0 is based on chromatographic separation of Hemoglobin $\mathsf { A } _ { \mathrm { l c } }$ on a cation exchange cartridge. The VARIANT II TURBO ${ \mathsf { H b A } } _ { 1 { \mathsf { c } } }$ Kit - 2.0 contains an analytical cartridge, 5 prefilters, Elution Buffer A and B, Calibrator Level 1, Calibrator Level 2, Whole Blood Primer, sample vials and a CD-ROM with test parameters.

The VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System provides an integrated method for sample preparation, separation and the quantitative determination of HbAlc in EDTA human whole blood. The VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System is a fully automated, high-throughput hemoglobin analyzer. It consists of two modules - the VARIANT II Chromatographic Station (VCS) and the VARIANT II Sampling Station (VSS). There have been hardware updates due to obsolescence of parts and firmware updates to support the replacement hardware components.

A personal computer is used to control the VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System using updated Clinical Data Management (CDM) software version 5.1.1.

# Method Comparison:

This study was performed following CLSI guideline EP9-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples. To demonstrate the correlation between CDM Software Versions 5.1 and 4.03, the VARIANT II TURBO HbA1c Kit - 2.0 was run on the VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System using both software versions. The protocol consisted of 100 EDTA whole blood human samples and 16 samples prepared by mixing EDTA whole blood samples with either purified $\mathbf { H b A } _ { \mathrm { O } }$ or purified $\mathrm { H b A } _ { 1 \mathfrak { c } }$ .The samples were run as a single injection and the ranges of values are presented in Table 2 below.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the modified version of software (v5.1) did not produce a clinically significant effect on $\mathrm { H b A } _ { 1 \mathfrak { c } }$ results with the use of $+ 1 - 1 0 \%$ EMP relative bias at $6 \%$ and $9 \% \mathrm { H b A } _ { 1 \mathfrak { c } }$ as evaluation limits. The Bias Estimation data is presented in Table 1 and acceptable error at the decision points were met. The linear regression correlation data is presented in Table 2.

# Analytical specificity:

Hemoglobin variant Interference study:

This study was performed following CLSI EP7 -A2: Guidelines Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guidelines, Second Edition.

Two fresh, EDTA non-variant human blood sample pools at $6 . 5 \%$ and $8 . 0 { - } 9 . 0 \% \ \mathrm { H b } \mathrm { A } _ { \mathrm { l } \mathrm { c } }$ were collected. Fresh, EDTA human homozygous blood samples for each of the 4 hemoglobin variants (e.g. E, D, S, and C) was obtained for dilution. For the interference testing of each variant, a series of test sample pools were prepared by the dilution of a homozygous variant patient sample (as interferent) in the non-variant patient sample pool. The samples were run in duplicate on two VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing Systems. The conclusion of this study demonstrated that no interference was observed at the following concentrations: $H 6 \mathbf { S } \leq 6 7 \%$ , $H b C \leq 7 2 \%$ $H _ { 6 } D \leq 5 5 \%$ , and E $\mathrm { H b E } \leq 4 1 \%$ .

# 8. Conclusion:

When considering the similarities of the intended use, the general features and characteristics of the assay, the use of the same technology, it can be concluded that the VARIANT II TURBO ${ \mathrm { H b A } } _ { { \mathrm { l c } } }$ Kit - 2.0 is substantially equivalent to the cleared and currently marketed predicate, VARIANT II TURBO ${ \mathrm { H b A } } _ { 1 { \mathfrak { c } } }$ Kit  2.0 (k090699).
