# 9 Test Principle

Immunohistochemical staining techniques allow for the visualization of antigens via the sequential application of a specific antibody to the antigen (primary antibody, ER), a secondary antibody to the primary antibody and an enzyme complex with a chromogenic substrate with interposed washing steps. The enzymatic activation of the chromogen results in a visible reaction product at the antigen site. The specimen may then be counterstained and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope and aid in the differential diagnosis of pathophysiological processes, which may or may not be associated with a particular antigen.

A schematic diagram of the immunohistochemical staining technique using a polymer detection system is shown in figure 1 and described below.

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the immunohistochemical staining technique using a polymer detection system to detect the primary antibody.

Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 is recommended for use in an immunohistochemical procedure, which allows the qualitative identification by light microscopy of antigens in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, via sequential steps with interposed washing steps. Prior to staining, endogenous peroxidase activity is blocked and sections are subjected to epitope retrieval. As indicated in figure 1, the section is subsequently incubated with the mouse primary antibody that binds with the human tissue antigen. A polymeric enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody that recognizes mouse immunoglobulins is used to detect the primary antibody. Sections are further incubated with the substrate/chromogen, $_ { 3 , 3 ^ { \prime } }$ - diaminobenzidine (DAB), and DAB Substrate Buffer. Reaction with the peroxidase produces a visible brown precipitate at the antigen site. Sections are counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope.

# 10 Intended Use

For in vitro diagnostic use

Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 (ER 6F11) Mouse Monoclonal antibody is intended for laboratory use to qualitatively identify estrogen receptor (ER) antigen in sections of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded breast cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry method. Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 specifically binds to the ER antigen located in the nucleus of ER positive normal and neoplastic cells.

Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 is indicated as an aid in the management, prognosis and predication of therapy outcome of breast cancer. The clinical interpretation of any staining or its absence should be complemented by morphological studies using proper controls and should be evaluated within the context of the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic tests by a qualified pathologist.

Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody for Bond™ and Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Liquid Concentrate Primary Antibody, Novocastra™ are optimized for use on the Leica Biosystems Bond Il staining platform using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit.

# BIOSYSTEMS

Bond Polymer Refine Detection utilizes a novel controlled polymerization technology to prepare polymeric HRP-linker antibody conjugates. The detection system avoids the use of streptavidin and biotin, and therefore eliminates nonspecific staining as a result of endogenous biotin. Bond Polymer Refine Detection works as follows:   
• The specimen is incubated with hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody for Bond™ is applied A post primary antibody solution enhances penetration of the subsequent polymer reagent A poly-HRP anti-mouse/rabbit IgG reagent localizes the primary antibody   
C The substrate chromogen, $3 , 3 ^ { \prime }$ - diaminobenzidine (DAB), visualizes the complex via a brown precipitate Hematoxylin (blue) counterstaining allows the visualization of cell

# 13.3 Precision Summary

In addition to the evaluation method and in keeping with standard pathological practice, al aspects o staining quality were assessed and reported for each case, ie. staining intensiy, proportion of cells staining, background staining, tissue morphology, staining of benign ductal cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells and lymphocytes.

Cases for reproducibility studies were selected with the following estrogen receptor expression; 6 negative, 6 around cut off $1 - 1 0 \%$ tumour staining; Allred proportion score of 2) and 6 positive cases $( > 1 0 \%$ tumour staining). Reproducibility studies have shown that for cases around the cut-off $1 - 1 0 \%$ tumour staining), a single pathologist has reproducibly estimated a similar percentage of cell staining between the three replicate slides.When all three pathologist percentage of cells staining scores are compared, it has shown that some variation in the number of cells estimated exists.This shows the limitations of a subjective method based on estimation alone.

In addition, small differences in the percentage of cells stained and then estimated by the same pathologist may be due to tumour heterogeneity.Multiple sections from each tissue block are requid to perform reproducibility studies, with this process resulting in different cells being examined between each section.Small foci of tumour will invariably cut in/out of the tissue section and result in differences in interpretation.This phenomenon has been widely published and the concept is most effectively demonstrated by the micro-dissection of sentinel node tumour micro-metastases analysis (Weaver 2010).

Based on acceptance and approval of the Test Device Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-toUse Primary Antibody for Bond™ on the Bond Il, this device is now considered the Reference Standard Test for the further Inter-Platform Comparison Studies.

# 14 Inter-Platform Comparison Study

An inter-platform comparison study was performed at three independent US based testing facilities. Comparative data between the reference standard device Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody for Bond™ on the Bond Ill and Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Liquid Concentrate Primary Antibody, NovocastraTM on the Bond III.

Blinding and randomization was used throughout the evaluation to reduce bias. Screeners were blinded to the test used.

The sample types (specimens) used in clinical evaluation were whole tissue sections, formalin fixed, and paraffin embedded invasive breast cancer cases. The specimens utilized were obtained from clinical archives, representative of the intended population, samples appropriately handled in the clinical environment, and met all local and national institutional review board (IRB) ethical approval for use in clinical evaluation studies.

Positive procedural controls were performed to validate assay performance. Procedural controls were not used for statistical analysis.

Negative controls were performed on the same tissues as the test article. The negative controls were not used for statistical analysis.

Based on the results, all documented evidence supports substantial equivalence between the both the concentrated and RTU formats of ER 6F11 on the Bond III.

# 14.2 Inter-Platform Comparison Study Summary

The total cohort included for the Inter-Platform comparison study was three hundred and six (306) invasive breast cancer specimens.

A requirement set by FDA for the cohort to include a minimum of $10 \%$ of test cases that express estrogen receptor around the cut off $( 1 - 1 0 \% )$ , when assessed by the reference standard device, was not met. The total overall percentage of cases in this category was $7 . 5 \%$ (23/306). Assessment of an additional 452 cases was undertaken in an attempt to enrich the cohort to $10 \%$ .

Recent publications (Hicks DH, Zhang Z, et $a l$ ), in which 1700 consecutive invasive breast cancer patients were assessed for ER status, indicated that only $2 \%$ of cases expressed estrogen in the $1 - 1 0 \%$ range. This indicates that these tumours are not common and that the $7 . 5 \%$ of cases assessed within this cohort is representative of almost 4 times the normal popuiation.

Additionally, differences in the percentage of cells stained and then estimated by the same pathologist between test devices may be due to tumour heterogeneity. Multiple sections from each tissue block are required to perform comparison studies, with this process resulting in different cells being examined between each section. Foci of tumour will invariably cut in/out of the tissue section and result in differences in interpretation. This phenomenon has been widely published and the concept is most effectively demonstrated by the micro-dissection of sentinel node tumour micro-metastases analysis (Weaver 2010).

In addition to the evaluation method and in keeping with standard pathological practice, al aspects of stainig qualiy were assessed and reported for each case, i. staining intensiy, proportion  cells staining, background staining, tissue morphology, staining of benign ductal cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells and lymphocytes.
