# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None

# L. Test Principle:

Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 (ER 6F11) is recommended for use in an immunohistochemical procedure, which allows the qualitative identification by light microscopy of antigens in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, via sequential steps with interposed washing steps. Prior to staining, endogenous peroxidase activity is blocked and sections are subjected to epitope retrieval. The tissue section is subsequently incubated with the mouse primary antibody that binds with the human tissue antigen. A polymeric enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody that recognizes mouse immunoglobulins is used to detect the primary antibody. Sections are further incubated with the substrate/chromogen, $_ { 3 , 3 } ,$ -diaminobenzidine (DAB) and DAB Substrate Buffer. Reaction with the peroxidase produces a visible brown precipitate at the antigen site. Sections are counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Intra-run precision Intra-run precision testing of the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody for Bond™ (RTU) was evaluated at a single site on FFPE breast cancer tissue on the Bond III staining platform. Similarly the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Liquid Concentrate Primary Antibody, Novocastra™ (concentrate) was also evaluated at this site on FFPE breast cancer tissue on the Bond III staining platform. The following testing configuration was used in each of the above studies: Testing was conducted using 3 slides mounted with tissue micro arrays (TMAs) of human breast carcinomas samples. Each slide contained 13 TMA cores as follows: 3 cores each of high, medium and low positive ER staining and 3 cores of negative ER staining breast cancer tissue and 1 core of normal breast (non-neoplastic) tissue serving as a control tissue. In addition, 1 test slide with negative control antibody and 1 assay control slide were also used. Staining was performed three times over three different days (3 slides x 3 tests $= 9$ TMA slides incorporating 108 breast cancer specimens). Two cores were unevaluable due to tissue loss. All test slides were blinded, randomized and assessed by a single observer. The scoring was performed per the ASCO/CAP scoring method [American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists Guideline Recommendations for Immunohistochemical Testing of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors in Breast Cancer (Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2010;134:e48–e72), i.e. positive for ER if finding of $\geq 1 \%$ of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive and negative for ER if finding of $< 1 \%$ of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive in the presence of evidence that the sample can express ER (positive intrinsic controls are seen)]. In addition the staining intensity was also assessed. The acceptance criteria set by the sponsor was $8 5 \%$ agreement (overall, positive and negative) at the lower bound of a two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval. The acceptance criteria were met in these studies.

# Inter-run/inter-day precision

Inter-run precision of the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody for Bond™ (RTU) was evaluated at a single site on FFPE breast cancer tissue on the Bond III staining platform. Similarly the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Liquid Concentrate Primary Antibody, Novocastra™ (concentrate) was also evaluated at this site on FFPE breast cancer tissue on the Bond III staining platform. The following testing configuration was used in each of the above studies: Testing was conducted using 3 slides mounted with TMAs of human breast carcinomas samples.

In addition, 1 test slide with negative control antibody and 1 assay control slide were also used. Staining was performed five times over five different days performed over a twenty (20) day period (3 slides x 5 tests $= 1 5$ TMA slides incorporating 180 breast cancer specimens). All test slides were blinded, randomized and assessed by a single observer. Four cores were unevaluable due to tissue loss. The scoring criteria were the same as above. The acceptance criteria were the same as above. The acceptance criteria were met in these studies.

Within Instrument Precision Study (intra-instrument) Within-instrument precision testing of the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-toUse Primary Antibody for Bond™ (RTU) was evaluated on FFPE breast cancer tissue on three Bond III staining platforms. Similarly the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Liquid Concentrate Primary Antibody, Novocastra™ (concentrate) was also

evaluated on FFPE breast cancer tissue on three Bond III staining platforms. Three slides – one TMA slide (12 breast cancer cores as described in 1a above), 1 with negative control antibody and 1 assay control slide, were stained three times over three different days (3 slides x 3 runs x3 instruments, 108 test data points) for each combination of the antibody format and the staining platform. Samples spanned the range of ER expression. All test slides were blinded, randomized and assessed by a single observer. Five cores were unevaluable due to tissue loss. The scoring criteria were the same as above. The acceptance criteria were the same as above and were met in these studies.

# Inter-Site Reproducibility

Inter-site reproducibility testing of the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody for Bond™ and the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Liquid Concentrate Primary Antibody, Novocastra™ was evaluated at 3 investigational sites on whole tissue sections using the Bond III stainer. The test cohort consisted of 18 cases. Samples spanned the range of ER expression. Testing was performed over a span of 5 non-consecutive days (Day1, Day3, Day 5), with each site staining a full set of cases on each day. This provided 9 replicates of 18 cases. The scoring criteria were the same as above. In addition, all aspects of staining quality was assessed and reported for each case i.e. staining intensity, proportion of cells staining, background staining, tissue morphology, staining of benign ductal cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells and lymphocytes for each study case. The acceptance criteria set by the sponsor was $8 5 \%$ agreement (overall, positive and negative) at the lower bound of a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval.

The test device Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody for Bond™ and the staining platform Bond III using the DS9800 Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit was tested in an independent clinical outcome study. This study used a retrospective patient cohort $\left( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 3 2 \right)$ composed of breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2000 in the Tom Baker Cancer Center in Calgary, who were treated with primary adjuvant tamoxifen regardless of their ER and PR status. This cohort had a greater than 5 years of follow-up, it was enriched for events to increase its statistical power and it included ER negative patients so as to remove treatment selection bias. There were 473 samples available for evaluation with the test device.

A Kaplan-Meier survival plot by Leica ER (6F11) status showed strong separation between Leica ER positive and ER negative cases. As expected, ER positive patients had longer survival times than ER negative patients when tamoxifen treatment was administered.
