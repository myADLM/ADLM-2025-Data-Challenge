# L. Test Principle:

Prothrombin Time- the thromboplastin reagent included in the ReadiPlasTin kit, after mixing with the ReadiPlasTin Diluent, is a liposomal preparation that contains recombinant human tissue factor (RTF), relipidated in a synthetic phospholipid blend. In the Prothrombin Time (PT) test, the addition of the tissue thromboplastin   
(ReadiPlasTin reagent) to the patient plasma in the presence of calcium ions initiates the activation of the extrinsic pathway. This results ultimately in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, with formation of a solid gel.   
Fibrinogen- derived- fibrinogen is quantitated (PT-based method) by relating the absorbance during clotting to a calibrator.

The acceptance criteria were met for all samples within each study.

Repeatability for HemosIL ReadiPlasTin was performed by testing a three lots of the applicable controls and calibrators with one lot of HemosIL ReadiPlasTin on a representative member of the ACL TOP instrument family (ACL TOP 700), for 5 days, 1 run/day, and 4 replicates per run for each sample level $\mathrm { N } { = } 2 0$ per level/ instrument/ lot). The within-run $C V \%$ for PT seconds were $65 \%$ and for Fibrinogen PT-derived were $\leq 1 5 \%$ employing the controls and calibrators. All result met acceptance criteria.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Fibrinogen linearity testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06, using one lot of HemosIL ReadiPlasTin reagent, on a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700). Two samples, a high-fibrinogen donor sample $( { \sim } 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and a fibrinogen-deficient donor plasma sample $( < 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , were used to prepare 10 samples ranging from ${ \sim } 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to ${ \sim } 8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Fibrinogen concentrations were determined by HemosIL Fibrinogen C and were tested against ReadiPlasTin in quadruplicate. Theoretical fibrinogen values were calculated as the weighted average of the highest and lowest fibrinogen in the series. Acceptance criteria were as follows: slope, $0 . 8 5 - 1 . 1 \dot { 5 }$ ; $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \ge 0 . 9 5$ . The results of the study fell within acceptable limits and demonstrated that HemosIL ReadiPlasTin is linear within the range of 60 to $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Extrinsic factor linearity testing was performed with factor deficient plasma for FII, FV, FVII and FX, using one lot of ReadiPlasTin on a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700). For each extrinsic factor, 14 levels of theoretical extrinsic factor $\%$ were created from a high patient plasma pool. Results met acceptance criteria (AC):

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Real Time Stability (closed vial):

The general storage condition for the ReadiPlasTin kit is at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Three lots were stored and at periodic times sample vials were removed for stability testing. The lots were tested on an ACL TOP 700 and ACL TOP 500 CTS for the recovery of ReadiPlasTin for the plasma controls. Using the mean of the ReadiPlasTin values for each control plasma sample at month zero as a baseline, the change $( \% )$ for each time point was calculated for PT and PTbased Fibrinogen. Real time stability was tested for 18 months for the first and second lot, and 15 months for the third lot. All the real time stability tests performed were within the established acceptance range. Results for real time stability support a 15-month shelf-life claim of the ReadiPlasTin kit when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Ongoing real-time stability testing will be used to update the shelf-life.

# On-board Stability (open vial):

On-board stability testing was performed on 2 different lots of HemosIL ReadiPlasTin on a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 500 CTS). Two lots of ReadiPlasTin reagent were placed in the reagent block of an ACL TOP 500 CTS. Each of the control levels listed above was tested for PT and PT-based Fib at 0, 3, 7, 10 & 11 day time points. Each control plasma sample was tested in quadruplicate. Using the mean of the ReadiPlasTin values of each control plasma sample on day zero as a base line, the change $( \% )$ for each time point was calculated for PT and PT-based Fibrinogen. Acceptable performance was determined if the percentage change in the recovery, relative to the initial baseline value, met the following specifications:

Table 4- Stability Specifications   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PT(sec)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fib PT-based (mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HemosIL Normal Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>baseline mean ± 10%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>baseline mean ± 15%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HemosIL Low Abnormal Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>baseline mean ± 15%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>baseline mean ± 15%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HemosIL High Abnormal Control baseline mean ± 15%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>baseline mean ± 15%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low Fibrinogen Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>baseline mean ± 15%</td></tr></table>

The data from both HemosIL ReadiPlasTin lots support an on-board stability of 10 days at $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

# Reconstituted stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ :

Vials of two lots of ReadiPlasTin reagent were prepared according to the insert, placed at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and taken out periodically to be tested on an ACL TOP $5 0 0 \mathrm { C T S }$ . Each of the control levels listed above was tested in quadruplicate for PT and PT-based Fib at 0, 3, 10, 11, 14 and 21 day time points. After testing, the vials of reagent were returned to $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Using the mean of the ReadiPlasTin values of each control plasma sample on day zero as a baseline, the change $( \% )$ for each time point was calculated for PT and PT-based Fib. Performance of the reagent was judged to be acceptable if the percentage change in the recovery, relative to the initial baseline value met the specification listed in Table 3. The data supports the claim of reconstituted stability for 10 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference limits were established for the following substances: Unfractionated Heparin (UHF), Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH), Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, Triglycerides and the antibiotic Daptomycin. An interference study was performed with one lot of ReadiPlasTin on a representative member of the ACL TOP $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Family (ACL TOP (base)). Two levels of plasma were used: 1.) a commercially available normal platelet poor plasma pool from 20 or more male and female donors; 2.) a commercially available pool of oral anticoagulant patient samples with an INR 2.0-3.0. The two sample levels were spiked with multiple levels of the indicated interferent and tested in quadruplicate. The data was then compared to the unspiked control result. Performance of the reagent was judged to be acceptable if the ReadiPlasTin reagent met the following recovery specifications:

Additional method comparison studies were conducted between HemosIL ReadiPlasTin and its predicate (HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G) at 3 US field sites, using a total of 715 patient samples and consisting of both normal $\mathbf { \bar { n } = }$ 310) and abnormal samples $( \mathtt { n } = 4 0 5 )$ . Of the abnormal specimens, 249 include patients on Oral Anticoagulant Therapy (OAT) and 156 are obtained from patients with various disease states (Table 10). Both normal and abnormal samples were tested contemporaneously using a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700).

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

Fresh vs. Once Thawed Samples- Plasma samples $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 2 4 5 )$ ) were collected in accordance with CLSI H21-A5. Samples included both normal $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 4 0 )$ and abnormal $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 1 0 5 } )$ ) samples. Abnormal samples included patients receiving Daptomycin, heparin (LMWH and UHF) and oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT), as well as patients with liver disease. Testing was performed on a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700), with the new HemosIL ReadiPlasTin assay. After testing the fresh samples, the samples were stored at or below $- 6 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for at least 24 hours, prior to being thawed and re-tested. The HemosIL ReadiPlasTin results obtained from oncethawed when compared to those from fresh samples, must meet the following acceptance criteria:

The results demonstrate that HemosIL ReadiPlasTin delivers comparable results on fresh samples and once-thawed samples.

Comparison of $3 . 2 \%$ and $3 . 8 \%$ sodium citrate plasma- Two parallel blood samples were drawn, from a total of 30 ostensibly normal donors, using both a $3 . 2 \%$ and $3 . 8 \%$ sodium citrate sample tube. Plasma from each donor was promptly recovered after centrifugation. A portion of donor plasmas was pooled and depleted of vitamin-K dependent proteins. This pool was used to create a set of abnormal samples with a wide range of PT values. Samples were run in duplicate on an ACL TOP 500 CTS. Acceptance criteria were as follows:

The method comparison between samples collected with $3 . 2 \%$ citrate tubes and the same samples collected into $3 . 8 \%$ citrate tubes demonstrated acceptable correlation for PT with a Deming regression slope, intercept and correlation coefficient of 1.071, 0, and 0.9983 respectively. The Deming regression slope, intercept and correlation coefficient for Fibrinogen PT derived were 0.902, 1.4, and 0.9326 respectively.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Extrinsic Factor Sensitivity: To demonstrate extrinsic factor sensitivity, a study was performed to evaluate the performance of the HemosIL $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ReadiPlasTin assay and determine the factor level at which the Prothrombin Time rises above the upper limit of the reference interval. Samples were prepared by mixing HemosIL factor deficient plasma with normal pool plasma of known assayed factors to create 11 dilutions. Concentrations ranged from $7 \%$ to $1 1 0 \%$ factor activity. Prothrombin time was determined on each plasma dilution in duplicate on a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700). “Factor sensitivity” is defined as the factor level at which PT rises above the upper limit of the reference interval. PT values in seconds (Y-axis) were plotted against $\%$ Factor value (X-axis). The cut-off for each factor was determined as the point where the $\%$ Factor intersects the upper limit of the reference interval. The assay is sensitive to factors II, V,

VII and X at the following levels: Factor II: $2 9 \%$ , Factor V: $49 \%$ , Factor VII: $50 \%$ and Factor X: $56 \%$ .

4. Clinical cut-off:

Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A reference interval study was performed using one lot of HemosIL ReadiPlasTin reagent kit on a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700). One hundred ninety nine (199) clinical samples (104 male and 95 female) from ostensibly “normal patients” were used in this study. Normal patient samples were tested for Prothrombin time and derived Fibrinogen values. The results were statistically analyzed for their distribution in order to verify the normal range for ReadiPlasTin:

The sponsor labeling indicates ReadiPlasTin results were obtained using a specific lot of reagent. Due to many variables which may affect clotting times, each laboratory should establish its own normal range.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
