# D. Indication/Intended Use

The STA Compact $\operatorname { M a x } ^ { \mathfrak { P } }$ is a fully automatic clinical analyzer designed to perform tests on human plasmas, the results of which aid $\lrcorner$ in the diagnosis of coagulation abnormalities or in monitoring anticoagulant therapy.

# E. Purpose of the Special 510(k) Notice

The STA Compact $\ M \mathbf { a x } ^ { \otimes }$ is a modification to the company's own legally marketed device, STA Compact® (K093167).

The modifications of the device involve:

-1- Change of the on-board computer to allow the use of current technologies for data transfer (USB, DVD), without any change in the technology or mechanical operation by which samples are processed.   
-2- Change of the operating system: from DOS for the predicate device to Windows for the STA Compact $\operatorname { M a x } ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ .   
-3- Migration of the user/application software to accommodate the new operating system, the use of new peripherals (USB, DVD, touch screen) and update the graphical user interface without modification of specifications and functionalities.   
-4- Change of the external design (colors and shape) of the analyzer to refresh external aspect.

# F. Description of the device

Diagnostica Stago's STA Compact $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \otimes }$ is a fully automatic clinical laboratory designed as a modification to the company's previously cleared STA Compact® analyzer (K093167). It performs tests which aid in the diagnosis of Haemostatic disorders and the monitoring of anticoagulant treatment.

The device consists of the following components:

-1- a cuvette, which holds the patient sample and any needed reagent;   
-2- a metal ball located in the cuvette, that is induced to oscillate to measure coagulation;   
-3- three needles that will aspirate. and dispense the patient's sample and reagents into the cuvette;   
-4- oscillation amplitude detection of a metal ball in a cuvette to measure sample coagulation by the chronometric method;   
-5- a light source and sensor to transmit light through the cuvette containing the sample and reagents that subsequently measures the light absorbed as a reaction takes place; :   
-6- Software which conducts the measurement and test determination;

# 1) Principles of Operation

STA Compact $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathfrak { P } }$ is a fully automatic clinical laboratory analyzer. Samples and test reagents are loaded into the instrument where sample handling, reagent delivery, analysis, and reporting of results are performed automatically. A central processing unit controls instrument functions such as, management of patient results, quality control, support for instrument maintenance, and work load optimization.

The instrument utilizes Diagnostica Stago reagents in addition to open adaptation of other currently available reagents. Barcoding of test reagents, calibrators and controls facilitate their use on the system and permits reagent management simple. Manual entry of reagent information enables the use of non-barcoded reagents. The instrument performs multiple test methodologies in random access as selected by the user. These include clotting time or clot-based tests (i.e. chronometric) measurements and photometric assays (at specific wave lengths) on plasma samples.

# 2) Fundamental technologies

The proposed device has same fundamental technological characteristics as the predicate device based on the following:

. Chronometry Measurement Principle

The principle consists in measuring the variations of the ball oscillation amplitude through inductive sensors. The ball has a pendular movement obtained:

- thanks to the two curved rail tracks of the cuvettes   
- and an alternate electro-magnetic field created by two independent . coils.

The oscillation amplitude is constant when the environment has a constant viscosity. The oscillation amplitude decreases when the environment viscosity increases as shown in Schema 1.

Schema 1: Amplitude of the ball oscillation during clotting

# Photometry Measurement Principle

The detection of chromogenic assays is based on the absorbance (optical density: O.D) of monochromatic light passing through the cuvette as a chromogenic reaction takes place.

Incident light entering the cuvette is partially absorbed by the reaction mixture as it passes through. The transmitted light is measured, and converted to absorbance. The Beer-lambert law is applied to convert absorbance to concentration of the substance being measured. The principle of absorbance measurement is depicted by the Schema 2.

The specific differences between the instruments are the on-board computer, to allow the use of Windows operating system, new peripherals (USB, CD/DVD), and the migration of the application software with a new graphical user interface. The purposes are to improve the ease of use, to include operator/user use enhancements and to manage obsolescence (See Table 2). These modifications don't change, delete or add functionalities.

The modifications of external design: color and shape, are only a marketing purpose, and has no impact on performances, principles of operation or fundamental technologies.
