# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATIONDECISION SUMMARYINSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE

C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Beckman Coulter, Inc. Navios Flow Cytometer

D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Flow Cytometric Immuno-assay: Cell identification with quantitative cell counts

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Description: The Navios Flow Cytometer uses flow cytometric principles to determine qualitative and quantitative measurements of biological and physical properties of cells and other particles. These properties are measured when the cells pass through the laser beam(s) in single file.

The Navios Flow Cytometry System also offers an optional standalone offline software package, Navios software, which enables the user to reanalyze, display, print and export acquired listmode data.

The Navios tetra Software is an optional locked algorithm application plug-in that is designed for the Navios Flow Cytometer. It provides automated analysis and results for tetraCHROME reagents; this application cannot be modified by the user.

Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres is a suspension of fluorospheres with uniform and stable size and fluorescence intensity. The stability of these product parameters allows for the standardization of light scatter and fluorescence intensity instrument settings. For automated, algorithm-based Beckman Coulter flow cytometry IVD systems such as Navios tetra Software, target value ranges for X-Mode (fluorescent intensity) are provided by Beckman Coulter with each Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres lot on the Table of Application Target Settings.

The Navios Flow Cytometer system consists of:

• Navios Flow Cytometer   
• Navios tetra Software   
• Navios Software (off-line analysis tool)   
• Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres   
• CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME reagents   
• COULTER IMMUNOPREP Reagent System

• TQ-Prep Workstation (Accessory for Sample Preparation) • PrepPlus™ 2 Workstation (Accessory for Sample Preparation)

2. Principles of Operation:

The Navios flow cytometer aligns cells in suspension by hydrodynamic focusing and passes them through a laser beam one cell at a time. The scattered and fluoresced light that emanates from these cells as they intersect the laser beam is collected by photomultipler tubes and transduced to an electronic pulse and counted by the cytometer’s computer. This test depends on the ability of a monoclonal antibody to bind to the surface of cells expressing discrete antigenic determinants. Specific cell staining is accomplished by incubating whole blood with the monoclonal antibody reagent. The CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8- ECD/CD3-PC5 and CYTOSTAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5. Monoclonal Antibody Reagents are each a combination of four murine monoclonal antibodies, each conjugated to a specific fluorochrome and specific for a different cell surface antigen. Red blood cells are lysed with the COULTER ImmunoPrep Reagent System. The remaining white blood cells are analyzed on a Navios flow cytometry system with the Navios tetra Software package. Navios Flow Cytometer Software and Navios tetra Software, in conjunction with quality control reagents, provide automated standardization of light scatter and fluorescence intensities and automated adjustment of color compensation settings. The Navios tetra Software, in conjunction with the Navios Flow Cytometer Software, and CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8- ECD/CD3-PC5 and CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19- ECD/CD3-PC5 Monoclonal Antibody Reagents, provides automated analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations.

3. Modes of Operation: Batch or single tube

4. Specimen Identification: Barcode reader or manual entry

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The automated sample loader for the instrument uses a carousel that holds thirty-two $1 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ 75-mm test tubes and includes a barcode reader.

6. Calibration:

Fluorescence intensity is calibrated by adjusting photomultiplier voltage using Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres. The absolute count of a population is based on the calibration factor (CAL Factor) and the number of Flow-Count fluorospheres particles within a user defined CAL region.

# 7. Quality Control:

IMMUNO-TROL Cells and IMMUNO-TROL Low Cells are assayed, lysable, wholeblood quality control products used to verify the activity of the CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME reagents and to verify the methods used for staining targeted cells, lysing

erythrocytes, and analyzing samples with flow cytometry.

Precision and reproducibility of Flow-Set Pro fluorospheres

Three lots of Flow-Set Pro fluorospheres were tested on a Navios Flow Cytometer over twenty days according to methods defined in CLSI EP5 to assess repeatability and reproducibility. All parameters demonstrated $\mathrm { C V ^ { \prime } s } < 1 5 \%$ and as such met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria. Flow-Set Pro fluorospheres were also tested on an Epics FC500 Flow Cytometer and found to meet the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria.

# c. Linearity:

i. Instrument linearity was assessed with two Immunobrite beads of different fluorescent intensities analyzed at 5 different voltages covering the dynamic range of each PMT. The mean channel fluorescent intensity ratios of pairs was calculated at five different voltages levels across three decades on all PMTs. Lower and Upper Limits are calculated from the mean value $+ 5 \%$ . The results of this study demonstrate that the intensity differences between the beads were constant across the range of voltages assessed.

ii. Linearity of the tetraCHROME reagents on the Navios Flow Cytometer with Navios tetra software and the manual gating method was established in accordance with CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. Using the following linearity acceptance limits:

$\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \geq 0 . 9 5$ ; $0 { - } 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L } { : } \pm 3 0 ~ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ bias ${ > } 3 0 0$ cells $\mu \mathrm { L }$ : $\pm 1 0 \%$ bias

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte / Units of Measure</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Accuracy Specifications</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cell count(Total CD3+, CD3+/CD4+, CD3+/CD8+,CD3-/CD56+, CD19+)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0-300 cells/μL: ± 40 bias&gt;300 cells/µL: ± 13% bias</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Percent(Total CD3+, CD3+/CD4+, CD3+/CD8+,CD3-/CD56+, CD19+)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0-40%: ± 1.5 percentage point bias&gt;40%: ± 2.5 percentage point bias</td></tr></table>

The results demonstrated that PrepPlus 2 performs comparably to manual pipette for sample preparation when used with the Navios flow cytometer and tetraCHROME reagents and Flow Count for absolute count.

# f. Single versus Dual Platform Method Comparison:

Forty one specimens (abnormal and normal) were selected for study. Absolute counts were determined using both Flow-Count beads (single platform) and compared to the absolute counts as calculated as the product of the subset percentage and the lymphocyte count from the LH 780 Hematology Analyzer (K061616) (dual platform). The methods were considered equivalent if the absolute value of the upper or lower $9 5 \ \%$ confidence limit of the bias is statistically smaller than the allowable difference between the two methods $( \pm 1 0 \% )$ . The two methods met the acceptance criteria for all reported parameters.
