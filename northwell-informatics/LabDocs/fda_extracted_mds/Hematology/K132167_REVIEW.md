# L. Test Principle:

$i$ -CHROMA iFOB is an immunoassay system based on antigen-antibody reaction and fluorescence technology. When a human fecal sample is mixed with the detection buffer in the sample collection tube, the fluorochrome-labeled detector antibodies (anti-hemoglobin) in the detection buffer binds with hemoglobin in the fecal occult blood (FOB). The test is performed using test cartridge, sample collection tube and ID chip of matching lot numbers. Test components of different lots are not interchangeable.

When the fecal sample mixture is loaded into the sample well on the test cartridge, it migrates through the nitrocellulose matrix of the test strip. The fluorochrome-labeled detector antibody-analyte (FOB hemoglobin) complexes get captured on to the capture antibodies (anti-hemoglobin) which have been immobilized at the test line on the test strip. As a result, the fluorochrome-labeled complexes of the detector antibody-analyte (FOB hemoglobin)-capture antibody accumulate at the test line on test cartridge membrane. Thus, the more hemoglobin in the human fecal sample, the more complexes that get accumulated at the test line on the test cartridge membrane.

Upon inserting the sample-loaded test cartridge in the $i .$ -CHROMA Reader, the laser light illuminates the test cartridge membrane thereby triggering fluorescence from the fluorochrome-labeled complexes of hemoglobin (accumulated at the test line) as well as the control line.

The fluorescent light is collected together with the scattered laser light. Pure fluorescence is filtered from the mixture of the scattered and fluorescent light. Intensity of the fluorescence is scanned and converted into an electric signal which is proportional to intensity of fluorescence and hence to the concentration of FOB hemoglobin in the test sample. The onboard microprocessor computes the FOB hemoglobin concentration based on a preprogrammed calibration. The computed and converted result is displayed by the $i \cdot$ -CHROMA Reader in a qualitative (positive or negative) manner based on an analytical cut-off of 100 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with detection buffer). The $i$ -CHROMA iFOB and $i$ -CHROMA Reader are compatible only with each other.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The repeatability and reproducibility of $i .$ -CHROMA iFOB was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of fecal samples spiked with human blood to obtain test samples containing seven different concentrations of human hemoglobin: $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 85 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Between site reproducibility study was conducted at three intended use sites in the US. Test samples were prepared at study site 1 and the same samples were tested at all the three US sites. The samples were shipped to the testing sites in Styrofoam boxes containing ice packs. $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB testing was carried out in a random and blinded manner. No invalid or indeterminate results were obtained throughout the precision studies.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Control material was used as test samples for determining the measuring range of $i .$ - CHROMA iFOB. Two sets of control samples were tested: one set of 16 levels of human hemoglobin A0 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 $\mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ to cover the lower measuring range and the second set of 8 levels of human hemoglobin $\mathbf { A } 0$ (800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1100, 1250, and $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ to cover he higher measuring range. Nine replicates of test samples at each of the above analyte levels were tested in a single run by the same operator using same lot of test components and same instrument at the same testing site on the same day. Numerical values of test results of the nine replicates at each analyte level were statistically analyzed to calculate the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ . The lowest concentration of analyte showing coefficient of variation below $10 \%$ was considered as the lower limit of the measuring range. The highest concentration of analyte showing coefficient of variation below $10 \%$ was considered as the upper limit of the measuring range. The measuring/reportable range of $i$ -CHROMA iFOB is $2 5 . 0 0 { - } 1 0 0 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

(hemoglobin in the human fecal sample processed with $i$ -CHROMA iFOB Detection Buffer).

# Prozone (Hook Effect)

Susceptibility of $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB to prozone effect was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of hemoglobin-negative stool samples spiked with human blood (with known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing 14 different hemoglobin concentrations $7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ up to $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

$i$ -CHROMA iFOB was not found susceptible to prozone/hook effect as it would display positive test results with fecal samples containing hemoglobin concentration up to $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

$i$ -CHROMA iFOB Test as well as the Controls are traceable to the IRMM/IFCC-467 Human Hemoglobin Reference Standard and OC-Standard V-IX50.

Internal Control: Procedural controls are included in the test device. The control line serves as an internal procedural control, indicating that the test system is functioning correctly and that the operator added a sufficient volume of sample.

External Quality Control: $i$ -CHROMA iFOB Negative & Positive Controls are available in a separate control kit. The negative and positive controls are run in the iFOB Test in the same manner as an extracted fecal sample. It is recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper test performance.

# Stability Studies

# 1. Stability of fecal samples

a. Collected in $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB Sample Collection Tubes: Samples for stability testing were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood (with known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing six different hemoglobin concentrations: $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 110 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Each spiked sample was mixed with detection buffer in $1 0 i ^ { \cdot }$ -CHROMA iFOB sample collection tubes.

Six sets, each of 10 sample collection tubes (containing fecal samples spiked with the same level of hemoglobin) were individually enclosed in sample sacs, sealed in return envelopes and stored $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 120 hours/five days immediately after sampling. Each sample was tested with $i \cdot$ - CHROMA iFOB initially (at 0 hour) and daily thereafter at time intervals: 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours.

$i$ -CHROMA iFOB ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study. Fecal samples submitted by the patient in $i$ -CHROMA iFOB sample collection tube should be tested before 72 hours after sampling if stored at $4 \%$ $( 2 { \sim } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 3 5 . 6 { \sim } 4 6 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and before 48 hours after sampling if stored at ambient temperature not exceeding $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 9 8 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ .

b. Not collected in $i$ -CHROMA iFOB Sample Collection Tubes: For fecal samples that are collected in a container other than the sample collection tubes provided with the $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB kit, the samples have to be transferred into the $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB CollectionTubes before testing. The following study was performed to determine the maximum allowable time after sampling for testing:

Samples for stability testing were prepared by spiking stool with human blood (with known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing six different hemoglobin concentrations: $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 110 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Separate specimen cups containing the spiked fecal samples were stored $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 120 hours/five days immediately after spiking/preparation.

Each test sample was tested with $i$ -CHROMA iFOB initially (at 0 hour) and daily thereafter at time intervals: 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours.

$i$ -CHROMA iFOB ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study.

Fecal samples submitted by the patient in a specimen cup should be tested before 72 hours after sampling if stored at $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $( 2 { \sim } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 3 5 . 6 { \sim } 4 6 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and before 24 hours after sampling if stored at ambient temperature not exceeding $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 9 8 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ .

2. $\underline { { i } } .$ -CHROMA iFOB Controls Stability Study: Vials of three different lots of $i \cdot$ - CHROMA iFOB ‘Negative’ and ‘Positive’ Controls were stored in sealed conditions at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and used for stability testing over a period of 10 months. To demonstrate stability of the controls, $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB test cartridges (stored at $4 { \sim } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB sample collection tubes (stored at $2 { \sim } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in refrigerator) of matching lot number were used throughout the study period.

$i$ -CHROMA iFOB controls from each lot stored at each of the three temperatures were tested initially at the start of the stability study (0 month) as well as every month (i.e. $2 9 { \sim } 3 1$ days) thereafter over the period of 10 months.

For evaluating shelf-life stability, separate vials (of each lot) of the controls were used for each periodic testing. A vial once used for the initial or previous testing was not re-used for any successive periodic testing.

For evaluating open-vial stability, the same control vial was used for the initial as well as all successive periodic testing. Periodic/monthly $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB test results of the stored ‘Negative’ and ‘Positive’ controls were compared with the initial test results of corresponding vial/lot (i.e. at 0 month).

The $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB ‘Negative’ as well as ‘Positive’ Controls have a closedvial stability of three months and open vial stability of one month under the recommended storage conditions of $2 ^ { \circ } C { \sim } 8 ^ { \circ } C$ in a refrigerator.

d. Detection limit:

Control material was used as test samples for determining the limit of detection of $i .$ - CHROMA iFOB. Sixteen (16) levels of human hemoglobin A0 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) were tested. Nine replicates of test samples at each of the above analyte levels were tested in a single run by the same operator using same lot of test components and same instrument at the same testing site on the same day. Numerical values of test results of the nine replicates at each analyte level were statistically analyzed to calculate the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ . The lowest concentration of analyte showing coefficient of variation below $10 \%$ was considered as the limit of detection. Accordingly the lower limit of detection was found to be $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (with $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $7 0 . 0 8 \mathrm { \sim } 1 0 0 $ ).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Sensitivity to human hemoglobin variant Sensitivity of $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB to ‘Hemoglobin $\mathrm {  ~ S ~ } ^ { \flat }$ as the human hemoglobin variant associated with sickle cell anemia was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of fecal samples spiked with blood of a sickle cell anemia patient to obtain test samples with five different concentrations of ‘Hemoglobin $\mathrm { \Delta S ^ { \prime } }$ ( $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ & $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB was found to be equally sensitive to ‘Hemoglobin $\mathrm {  ~ S ~ } ^ { \flat }$ as the human hemoglobin variant associated with sickle cell anemia.

Cross-reactivity of $i$ -CHROMA iFOB with animal hemoglobin was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of hemoglobin-negative stool spiked with the intended level of respective animal hemoglobin such as bovine $( 2 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , chicken $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , fish $( 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , horse/equine $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , goat $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , pig/swine (500 $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ ), rabbit $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ and sheep $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ . $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB did not show significant cross-reactivity with any of the animal hemoglobin tested.

# Interfering Substances

Susceptibility of $i$ -CHROMA iFOB to interference from endogenous substances was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of fecal samples spiked with human blood to obtain samples with $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } ,$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ concentrations of human hemoglobin and further spiking them with solutions containing intended concentrations of four endogenous substances: ascorbic acid (30 $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ ), bilirubin $( 2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ), albumin $( 6 0 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ and myoglobin $( 2 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ . $i$ -CHROMA iFOB did not show significant interference from any of the four endogenous substances tested.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Analytical characterization of cut-off of the $i$ -CHROMA iFOB involved testing of 219 human fecal samples comprising 125 normal/negative samples and 94 positive samples as confirmed with the predicate test OC Auto Micro FOB.

Test results were statistically analyzed by Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) Analysis and analyte concentration corresponding to maximum sensitivity as well as maximum specificity of $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB was taken as the cut-off.

Cut-off of $i$ -CHROMA iFOB was determined to be $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with detection buffer).

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Due to administrative error, the following section in quotations was previously redacted:

“A clinical method comparison of i-CHROMA iFOB with the predicate test, OC Auto Micro FOB, was evaluated by testing fecal samples obtained from 134 patients (68 males and 66 females above the age of 50 years). Test samples were tested first with the ‘i-CHROMA iFOB’. The test samples were then tested with the comparator/predicate method ‘OC Auto Micro FOB’.”

A method comparison of $i$ -CHROMA iFOB with the predicate test, OC Auto Micro FOB, was evaluated by testing spiked fecal samples at three intended use sites in the US. Test samples were prepared by spiking hemoglobin negative stool with human blood (with known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven different hemoglobin concentrations: $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . 20 aliquots of each spiked sample were tested with $i$ -CHROMA iFOB at each testing site and then with the predicate test OC Auto Micro FOB. No invalid or indeterminate results were obtained throughout the analytical method comparison study. Statistical analysis of site-wise test results as well as combined results shows that $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB test results have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement with OC Auto Micro FOB test results.

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Introduction of test strip cartridge

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes __ _x_ ___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Enter Patient Identification Information manually on the label of $i$ -CHROMA iFOB Sample Collection Tube.

e. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

It is recommended that the laboratory should give the $i$ -CHROMA iFOB Sample Collection Tube to the patient so that the patient can collect fecal sample and do the sampling himself/herself and submit it to the laboratory for testing as per the appropriate instructions received from the laboratory.

The laboratory may also receive fecal samples which have been collected and submitted in specimen cups or similar containers by the patients. Such fecal samples may be stored at ambient temperature (up to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } $ ) but must be processed (with detection buffer in the sample collection tube) and tested within 48 hours after collection. Fecal sample submitted by the patient in $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB sample collection tube should be tested before 72 hours after sampling if stored at $4 \%$ $( 2 { \sim } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 3 5 . 6 { \sim } 4 6 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and before 48 hours after sampling if stored at ambient temperature not exceeding $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 9 8 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ .

5. Calibration:

$i$ -CHROMA iFOB ID chip (supplied in the test cartridge box) contains a memory device that contains encoded calibration data/information for the batch-to-batch (lot-to-lot) variation. With the ID chip inserted in the designated port, $i$ -CHROMA Reader reads and utilizes the calibration data regarding the batch/lot under consideration and applies appropriate correction to the conversion formula while computing the test result.

6. Quality Control:

Internal Control: $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB test cartridge contains a ‘control line’ on which ‘rabbit immunoglobulin-G antibodies’ have been immobilized. The control line of $i \cdot$ - CHROMA iFOB test cartridge functions as the built-in procedural control and indicate the following:

a. A sufficient quantity of test sample (mixed with the detection buffer) was loaded into the sample well of the test cartridge.   
b. Test sample mixture loaded into the ‘sample well’ has migrated to the control line and test line of the test cartridge as required.   
c. All the components of $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB test functioned properly.
