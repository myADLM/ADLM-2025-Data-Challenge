# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The UniCel DxC Synchron Systems Hemoglobin A1c3 (HbA1c3) Reagent, when used in conjunction with UniCel DxC 600/800 SYNCHRON Systems, UniCel DxC SYNCHRON Systems HbA1c3 Calibrators and HbDil reagent, is intended for the

quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c concentration in human whole blood.

The A1c3 and Hb3 values generated as part of the HbA1c3 assay are intended for use in the calculation of the A1c3/Hb3 ratio and must not be used individually.

Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is accepted as a method to measure long-term glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Special conditions for use statement(s):

For Prescription use Only This assay is designed only for the measurement of mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) and %HbA1c (NGSP). The individual results for Hb and A1c concentration should not be reported.   
· Do not use this test for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Performance characteristics for this use have not been determined.   
· This assay is not useful in evaluating day-to-day glucose control and should not be used to replace daily home testing of glucose.   
· Caution should be exercised when interpreting the HbA1c results from patients with hemolytic disease or other conditions characterized by shortened erythrocyte survival, acute blood loss and iron deficiency. Erythrocytes in a whole blood sample will settle over time. An inaccurate result could be produced from an unmixed whole blood sample.   
· Samples containing ${ > } 1 0 \%$ HbF may result in lower than expected HbA1c results   
· Specimens with elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation (ESR) may generate inaccurate results. The hemolysate should be manually prepared and assayed for HbA1c3 using “OTHER” as sample type.

# L. Test Principle:

The Hb3 reagent is used to measure total hemoglobin concentration by a colorimetric method. The analyzer system automatically proportions the appropriate sample and reagent volumes in to the cuvette. The ratio used is one part samples to 8.6 parts reagent. The system monitors the change in absorbance at $4 1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . This change in absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of total hemoglobin in the sample and is used by the system to calculate and express total hemoglobin concentration.

The A1c3 reagent is used to measure the hemoglobin concentration by a turbidimetric immunoinhibition method. In the reaction, hemoglobin A1c antibodies combine with hemoglobin A1c from the sample to form soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Polyhaptens from the reagent then bind with the excess antibodies and the resulting agglutinated complex is measured turbidimetrically. Change in absorbance is measured at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . This change in absorbance is inversely proportional to the concentration of hemoglobin A1c in the sample and is used by the analyzer system to calculate and express hemoglobin A1c concentration as a ratio of total hemoglobin.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP-06A. A series of thirteen analyte concentrations, covering the measuring range of the assay, were prepared by intermixing a high $( 1 8 . 8 \% )$ and low $( 3 . 4 \% )$ HbA1c sample. Each dilution was assayed in quadruplicate on the UniCel DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON Systems analyzers. Sample range tested was between $3 . 4 - 1 8 . 8 \%$ HbA1c. The results from regression analysis between the target values and the measured values are summarized below:

The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of $4 \mathrm { - } 1 7 \%$ HbA1c on the UniCel DxC 600/800 SYNCHRON System analyzers

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The UniCel Synchron Systems Hemoglobin A1c3 (HbA1c3) assay is traceable to the IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry). The UniCel Synchron

Systems Hemoglobin (HbA1c3) assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires one year from the certification date. See NGSP website for current certification http://www.ngsp.org.

Two different units of measure are provided to the customers. NGSP equivalent units $( \% )$ and IFCC equivalent units $\mathrm { ( m m o l / m o l ) }$ .

Stability-The UniCel DxC Synchron Systems HbA1c (HbA1c3) calibrators are stable until the expiration date printed on the calibrator bottle if stored unopened at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Reconstituted calibrators are stable for 8 hours stored at $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , or 48 hours stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ unless the expiration date is exceeded. Calibrators that are aliquoted immediately after reconstitution and stored at ${ } _ { - 1 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ are stable for 60 days. Frozen calibrators should be thawed only once.

Calibrator value assignment- calibrator values are lot specific values which are assigned using multiple analyzers and multiple runs over several days. The data generated provides set points for use on the UniCel DxC 600/800 SYNCHRON Systems platforms. Once the calibration set points are established on the analyzers; principal samples (IFCC calibrators, IFCC controls, freshly prepared test calibrators, and NGSP traceable samples to cover the NGSP range) are analyzed in several replicates and must meet the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.

Controls- the sponsor recommends the use of any commercially available control for HbA1c. Alternatively, the user may use the Canterbury Scientific extendSURE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Hemoglobin A1c Liquid Controls previously cleared in k043070.

# d. Detection limit:

The claimed measuring range of $4 . 0 { - } 1 7 . 0 \%$ HbA1c for the Unicel DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON Systems analyzers, is based on linearity. See 1b above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# i.) Endogenous Interference

Interference studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could potentially interfere with the Unicel DxC Synchron Systems Hemoglobin A1c3 (HbA1c3) assay. The potential interfering substances were evaluated using human EDTA whole blood sample pools at three HbA1c concentrations $( 5 \% , 7 \%$ and $10 \%$ ). Each sample was spiked with the potential interferant and tested in quadruplicate to give a total of four replicates per sample on the UniCel DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON Systems analyzers. The $\%$ HbA1c values of the spiked samples were compared to reference samples (samples containing no interferent). The sponsor defined non- significant interference as the $\%$ recovery $+ / - 6 \%$ .

The sponsor claims there is no significant interference by the following substances:

Unconjugated Bilirubin up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ · Triglycerides (Intralipid) up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ · Rheumatoid Factor up to $2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ · Ascorbic Acid $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# ii.) Cross Reactivity

Potential Interference from from HbA0, HbA1 $( \mathsf { a } + \mathsf { b } )$ , acetylated hemoglobin HbA0, glycated albumin and Carbamylated HbA0 were evaluated using EDTA whole blood samples with HbA1c values of ${ \sim } 5 \%$ , $\sim 7 \%$ and ${ \sim } 1 0 \%$ HbA1c. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the $\%$ recovery $+ / - 1 0 \%$ . The results were concluded as follows:

HbA0 (up to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ) does not interfere with this assay   
· $\operatorname { H b A l } ( \mathbf { a } + \mathbf { b } )$ (up to $8 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ) does not interfere with this assay   
· Acetylated HbA0 (up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ) does not interfere with this assay.   
$\bullet$ Glycated albumin (up to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ) does not interfere with this assay Carbamylated HbA0 (up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ) does not interfere with this assay.

In addition, interference from Labile glycated hemoglobin was evaluated using human whole blood samples at three HbA1c concentrations $5 \%$ , $7 \%$ and $10 \%$ HbA1c). Each sample was spiked with a glucose stock solution and incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5 hours and analyzed in quadruplicate on the UniCel $\mathrm { D x C }$ 600 and 800 SYNCHRON System analyzers. The percent difference of the samples with and without the potential interfering substance was calculated. The sponsor defined nonsignificant interference as the $\%$ recovery $+ / - 1 0 \%$ . The results concluded as follows:

Labile Glycated hemoglobin (up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) does not interfere with this assay.

# iii.) Hemoglobin Variant Interference:

A hemoglobin variant study was performed using commercially available samples known to contain Hemoglobin variants C, D, E, S, F. These variant samples were tested on the UniCel DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON Systems analyzers using the UniCel $\mathrm { D x C }$ Synchron Systems Hemoglobin A1c3 (HbA1c3) assay. Samples were analyzed in quadruplicate and compared to the target values which were obtained using an HPLC reference analyzer. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as $+ / - 7 \%$ between the candidate method and the reference method for Hemoglobin variants C, D, E, and S. Non-significant interference was defined as $+ / - 1 0 \%$ between the candidate and reference method for HbF.

The testing results indicate there is no significant interference for HbC $( \leq 3 6 . 4 \% )$ , HbD $( \leq 3 5 . 1 \% )$ , HbE $( \leq 2 1 . 7 \% )$ and HbS $( \leq 3 1 . 9 \% )$ .

The labeling states “Samples containing ${ > } 1 0 \%$ HbF may result in lower than expected HbA1c results”
