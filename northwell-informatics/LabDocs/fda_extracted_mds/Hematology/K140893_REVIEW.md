# L. Test Principle:

The CORA PlateletMapping Assay is an in vitro diagnostic assay used in conjunction with the CORA System (analyzer). This assay specifically determines the Maximum Amplitude (MA), a measure of the maximum firmness of the clot during the test. The assay uses Arachidonic Acid (AA) and/or Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) agonists. Since thrombin (present in blood samples) is the primary and most potent activator of platelets, its activity must be inhibited with heparin in order to assess the platelet inhibiting effects of ADP and AA. Thrombin also converts fibrinogen into fibrin to create the fibrin mesh necessary for any clot formation, and converts Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa for fibrin cross linking.

Since thrombin has been rendered inactive by heparin, Activator F (ActF) is used to replace thrombin’s role in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa. Thus, with this cross-linked fibrin network as the foundation (represented by MAActF), additional clot strength due to platelet-fibrin bonding related to ADP (MAADP) and AA (MAAA) platelet receptor activation can be measured.

The Kaolin with Heparinase (HKH) reagent, a combination of Kaolin and Heparinase, generates test data for the uninhibited MA (MAK) resulting from thrombin activation of the blood sample, while the Heparinase neutralizes the effects of heparin.

AA %Aggregation and $\%$ Inhibition, and ADP $\%$ Aggregation and $\%$ Inhibition are parameters derived from the CORA MA parameters for the ActF, AA, ADP and HKH reagents, as described above. Following are the equations used by the CORA System with PlateletMapping Assay Cartridge to derive these parameters:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } { \mathrm { A A P e r c e n t ~ A g g r e g a t i o n } = } & { { } { \Big [ } { \Big \{ } _ { M A _ { K } - M A _ { A c t F } } ^ { M A _ { A c t F } } \Big \} * 1 0 0 { \Big ] } , \qquad { \mathrm { ( m a x i m u m ~ o f ~ } } 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { ) } } } \\ { \mathrm { A D P e r c e n t ~ A g g r e g a t i o n } = } & { { } { \Big [ } { \Big \{ } _ { M A _ { K } - M A _ { A c t F } } ^ { M A _ { A c t F } } \Big \} * 1 0 0 { \Big ] } , \qquad { \mathrm { ( m a x i m u m ~ o f ~ } } 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { ) } } } \end{array}
$$

AA Percent Inhibition $= 1 0 0 - \mathrm { { A A } }$ Percent Aggregation, (minimum of $0 \%$ ) ADP Percent Inhibition $=$ 100 – ADP Percent Aggregation, (minimum of $0 \%$ )

To perform a test, a disposable CORA PlateletMapping Cartridge is inserted into the instrument. Blood is added to an entry port on the cartridge and drawn into the cartridge under instrument control. The amount of the sample drawn into the cartridge is automatically determined by the volume of the blood chambers in the cartridge. Once in the disposable, the sample is metered into as many as four separate analysis channels, depending upon the assay being performed. Reconstitution of reagents dried within the cartridge is accomplished by moving the sample back and forth through reagent chambers, under the control of microfluidic valves and bellows within the cartridge. After each sample has been mixed with reagent, it is delivered to a test cell where it is monitored for changes due to coagulation. Excess sample material is moved under microfluidic control into an enclosed waste chamber within the cartridge.

The CORA technology is based on a disposable containing up to four independent measurement cells. Each cell consists of a short vertically-oriented injection molded tube (ring). Detection of clotting in the CORA System is performed optically. Under control of the instrument, approximately $2 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of prepared sample is delivered to the tube, where a meniscus naturally forms at each end of the tube. The tube is positioned so that the lower meniscus partially blocks light traveling from a collimated source toward a photodiode. During testing, a piezoelectric actuator drives the measurement cell(s) through a motion profile composed of summed sinusoids at different frequencies. The resulting motion of the meniscus is monitored optically and analyzed by the instrument to calculate the resonant frequency and modulus of elasticity (stiffness) of the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability, Operator-to-Operator Variability, Instrument-to-Instrument Variability were assessed in one combined study. Three different patient samples were tested for HKH Precision testing:

Hypocoagulable (donor with coagulation level of MA parameter near the lower limit of the reference range) · Normal (donor with coagulation level of MA parameters near the center of the reference range) Hypercoagulable (donor with coagulation level of MA parameter near the upper limit of the reference range)

For ADP and AA $\%$ Aggregation and $\%$ Inhibition Precision testing, the following sample types were utilized:

Normal [donor with little or no platelet inhibition, inhibition levels below cut-off values (ADP Inhibition ${ < } 1 7 \%$ , AA Inhibition $< 1 1 \%$ )] · Abnormal (donor with platelet inhibition levels above cut-off values)

Patient samples were tested in duplicate with each of three reagent lots and six instruments by two operators. Testing was repeated on each of five non-consecutive testing days. A new blood draw from each donor was taken on each of the 5 study days.

For clarity, the testing schematic for each sample and operator, which was completed on each testing day, is summarized below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Real time and accelerated stability studies were performed in support of a 1-year stability claim for CORA PlateletMapping reagents. Three months of accelerated stability testing was performed with a minimum of two lots of each reagent. The regulatory stability claim is limited to the available real time stability data available at time of clearance.

Real time stability studies included 3 lots of each reagent. At 6 months and 1 year of storage at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , reagent lots were tested with 2 donor samples in quadruplicate and compared to results generated with one newly manufactured reagent lot. The allowable $10 \%$ degradation from the initial value was not exceeded in the indicated testing timeframe, thereby supporting a one year shelf life claim for storage at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

In use stability: For each reagent type, two cartridges from each of 3 lots were removed from their foil pouches at each of multiple time-points and stored at ambient temperature. Cartridges were stored up to 3 hours under in-use conditions prior to testing. Each cartridge was testing with donor blood in quadruplicate. No significant difference in performance was observed after the claimed 2 hours of storage under inuse conditions after removal from the foil pouch.

Transport simulation studies: For each reagent type, 3 lots of reagents were tested for transport stability using a study design based on International Safe Transit Association (ISTA) Procedure 7D “Summer Profile” for 72 hour expedited international airfreight transport. An extended hold at $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ was added to simulate a total of 7 days instead of 3. The study design is summarized in the table below.

Compared to one lot of reagent stored at the recommended storage conditions of 2-8 ${ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , stability of the reagent lots is not impacted by the exposure to the simulated shipping conditions outlined in the table above.

Sample stability: In order to assess sample stability, five consecutive runs of each of three patient samples (normal, hypo and hyper) were tested. Blood samples were tested in quadruplicate at each time point. There is no significant sample deterioration within 2 hours after sample collection.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were carried out according to CLSI EP 7- A2. The effect on hemolysis, hemodilution up to $50 \%$ and short draw resulting in up to 2 times heparin concentration were performed for each of the reagents. In addition, the effect of absence of a discard type and addition of EACA on the HKH MA parameter were assessed.

Short draw: For each reagent type, five (5) different samples resulting in final heparin concentrations up to 2 fold were prepared. Each of these samples was tested in quadruplicate. Interference was observed at heparin concentrations equivalent to $2 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ whole blood in a $4 \mathrm { m L }$ heparin containing tube for the ADP and AA reagent.

Hemodilution: Whole blood was hemodiluted up to $50 \%$ . Each of the 5 resulting samples was tested in quadruplicate. Hemodilution above $40 \%$ was determined to interfere with the HKH and ADP reagent.

Hemolysis: Pooled heparinized blood was split. Half of the blood was hemolyzed ex vivo. The effect of lysis on testing results was evaluated by testing each sample 8 times. Hemolysis was found to be an interferent for the HKH and AA reagents.

Lack of discard tube: The effect of discard tube omission on HKH reagent testing was evaluated. In this case, results in the presence and absence of discard tube were compared. For each condition, 8 replicates were tested. No differences in results were observed for the HKH MA parameter.

EACA: The antifibrinolytic substance effect the device output. The effect on adding increasing concentrations of EACA on HKH MA were assessed. Testing was performed in quadruplicate. No interference was observed for EACA concentrations up to $6 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# $f .$ Assay cut-off:

The assay cut-off was identified utilizing the references range data of healthy patients. The value was identified as the $10 \%$ probability quantile for both ADP and AA aggregation. Since inhibition $= 1 0 0$ - aggregation, the inhibition cut-off is based on the $90 \%$ probability quantile for AA and ADP Inhibition.

3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

Due to the low percentage agreement in the method comparison study, an additional analysis was performed. In this analysis, CORA PlateletMapping assay or the predicate device output was compared to the clinical evaluation of the patients’ platelet function status. The presence of normal or abnormal platelet function was determined using the cut-off of ${ < } 8 3$ for ADP and ${ < } 8 9$ for AA for the CORA PlateletMapping assay and ${ < } 8 0$ for the TEG AA and ADP Platelet Mapping assays. Available clinical history (e.g. types of clinical procedures and medications a patient has received) was utilized for the clinical evaluation of the platelet function status (presence or absence of inhibition). The resulting clinical composite was utilized as clinical reference. In all, the results of 203 and 205 patients were included in this analysis for the ADP and AA reagents, respectively.

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>All sites</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>ADP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>AA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sensitivity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Specificity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sensitivity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Specificity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CORA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>74.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>72.4%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>84.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>62.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% CI</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>64.7% - 82.8%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>62.8% - 80.7%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77.8% - 89.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40.6% - 81.2%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TEG</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>94.9%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>39.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>88.4%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% CI</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>88.5% - 98.3%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29.7% - 49.1%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>82.8% - 92.7%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29.1% - 70.9%</td></tr></table>

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and $b .$ . are not applicable):

A reader study was performed to determine whether the numerical outputs produced by the CORA PlateletMapping System have the same clinical interpretation as the output produced by the predicate device. In order to do so, a total of 30 paired device outputs from the CORA PlateletMapping System and the predicate device were provided to 3 readers each at 3 clinical sites, resulting in a total of 270 reads for each parameter.

4. Clinical cut-off:

The following cut-offs were utilized in the precision studies and clinical studies in support of the ADP and AA reagents:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cut-off</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ADP Aggregation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>83%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>AA Aggregation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>89%</td></tr></table>

Cut-off values were utilized for precision and reader studies for HKH MA parameter. The boundaries of the reference ranges were used to determine whether samples fall into the hypercoagulable, normal or hypocoagulable ranges for the HKH-MA parameter. The following ranges were utilized to select suitable samples for the precision evaluation of the HKH-MA parameter:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MA Value Range</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hypocoagulable</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt; 42 - 53</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>53 - 68</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hypercoagulable</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>68 - &gt; 71</td></tr></table>

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Reference Ranges for each reagent-parameter combination were established in 153 healthy individuals according to CLSI C28-A3c. Samples were excluded on a perparameter basis using standard outlier criteria. The Minimum and Maximum of the normal range with the respective $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals $9 5 \%$ CI) are summarized in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Minimum (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Maximum (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HKH-MA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>53 (50-55)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>68 (67-72)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>149</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ActF-MA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2 (2-2)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>19 (18-30)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>152</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ADP-MA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>45 (43-50)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>69 (67-72)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>145</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>AA-MA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51(49-52)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>71(68-77)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>144</td></tr></table>
