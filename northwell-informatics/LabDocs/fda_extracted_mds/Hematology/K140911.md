Dear Mr. Lemberg:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

# Device Description

The $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ and DxH SMS form a family of integrated and interactive modular products that are scalable to meet the specific laboratory workflow and workload needs. Currently these products are offered as stand-alone devices only.

DxH 800: The UniCel $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ Analyzer is a quantitative, automated hematology analyzer for in vitro diagnostic use in screening patient populations found in clinical laboratories. The UniCel $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ Analyzer provides a Complete Blood Count (CBC), Leukocyte Five-part Differential (Diff), Reticulocyte (RET), Nucleated Red Blood Cell (NRBC) on whole blood, Total Nucleated Count (TNC) and Red Blood Cell Count (RBC) on Body Fluids (cerebrospinal, serous and synovial)

DxH SMS: The DxH Slidemaker Stainer is a fully automated slide preparation and staining device that aspirates a whole-blood sample, smears a blood film on a clean microscope slide, and delivers a variety of fixatives, stains, buffers, and rinse solutions to that blood smear.

# Page 4 of 14

The upgrade of these devices with software v3.0 will allow for these stand-alone devices to be configured into five workcell configurations through physical and virtual connections. Physically, the instruments are connected via hardware and the virtual connection is accomplished by means of the new control system software that provides integrated process control, data consolidation and sample transport to the various instruments in the workcell in order to facilitate and improve laboratory efficiency. This will yield a total of seven product configurations, including:

 Stand-alone $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ with software v3.0   
 Stand-alone DxH SMS with software v3.0   
 Five customizable workcell configurations comprised of $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ and DxH SMS with software v3.0 o DxH 801 – one DxH 800 $^ +$ one DxH SMS o DxH 1600 – two DxH 800 o DxH 1601 – two DxH 800 + one DxH SMS o DxH 2400 – three DxH 800 o DxH 2401 – three DxH $8 0 0 +$ one DxH SMS

These workcell configurations allow for increased system efficiencies through workload balancing between available instruments within the workcell, and automated pass through processing of selected slide preparation and stain test orders.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusion to Demonstrate Safety, Effectiveness & Equivalent Performance to Predicate:

The updates to the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ and DxH SMS with software v3.0 that are the subject of this submission, do not change the intended use, nor add or delete a contraindication for the device. The changes do not alter the device control mechanism, operating principle, energy type, environmental specification, ergonomics of the user interface, dimensional specifications, nor packaging. The device does not have expiration dating nor is it subject to sterilization.

The conclusions drawn from the performance testing discussed above demonstrate that the device is as safe, as effective, and meets the performance acceptance criteria.

In summary, the updated $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ and DxH SMS with software v3.0, as described in this submission are substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to their predicate device and reference method, respectively.

The UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System v3.0 is substantially equivalent to the UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System v2.0 manufactured by Beckman Coulter.  The UniCel DxH Slidemaker Stainer Coulter Cellular Analysis System v3.0 is substantially equivalent to manually prepared blood films per the manual wedge-pull film technique as described in CLSI H20-A2, Reference Leukocyte (WBC) Differential Count (Proportional) and Evaluation of Instrumental Methods; Approved Standard

This summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 and the implementing regulation 21 CFR 807.92.
