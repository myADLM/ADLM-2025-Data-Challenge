# J. Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance:

The $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ and DxH SMS v3.0 test strategy was designed to evaluate the software changes and minor hardware changes made and the effect of those changes on analytical performance. The scope of the software changes is limited to the workstation software and the hardware changes only impacted the physical connection of the instruments together. No changes were made in the individual instruments configured in the workcell. Based on these, limited performance tests were conducted on the most complex workcell configuration (e.g., model DxH 2401). The performance studies were conducted at either the Beckman Coulter facility in Miami, Florida or at the London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.

a. Accuracy:

Measurement Procedures Comparison: Whole Blood

The objective of the study was to verify that whole blood results on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ meet the bias specifications when compared to the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ predicate. Trueness was established in accordance with CLSI H26-A2 and EP9-A3.

The study included 333 whole blood specimens distributed across the analytical measuring interval (AMI). Spent normal and clinical specimens from a comprehensive and diverse range of hematological conditions with hematological cellular characteristics at target ranges of the parameters to be tested were used. The specimens were tested in singlet on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ and the predicate $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ $\mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ in the CBC/Diff and Reticulocyte (CDR) panel. A minimum of 100 specimens were tested on each $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instrument in the workcell with the workstation software determining the specimen routing between instruments.

The regression approach described in CLSI EP9-A3 was used to estimate differences between the test $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ and the predicate $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ instruments.

Prior to statistical analysis, the data were inspected for outliers; no outliers were removed. Parameters flagged with R (Review Flag), or non-numeric results were excluded from analysis. Exclusions were made at the parameter level not the specimen level. There were no specimens excluded from the study.

Deming and Weighted Deming approaches were used to estimate the parameters of the regression model (slope, intercept, their $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals and correlation coefficient). Weighted Deming was used for counts, i.e., WBC, RBC, PLT, etc., since the scatter of the data (variability) was significantly related to the range of measurements (mean). The Deming approach was used for other parameters, except $\mathrm { B A } \%$ . Passing and Bablok regression was used for $\mathrm { B A } \%$ because the scatter of the data was not uniform throughout the range and a non-parametric approach was more appropriate. Bias between methods was calculated from the regression line at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile points of the range of the comparator and at medical decision points. Confidence limits of bias estimates were calculated based on standard errors of bias and $9 5 \%$ confidence. The upper/lower confidence limits were compared to the specifications.

The $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ is considered to be comparable to the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ predicate if the upper/lower $9 5 \%$ confidence limit of the difference between the parameter results obtained from the data set for all other parameters is less than or equal to the acceptance limits defined. The $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ is considered to be comparable to the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ predicate if the correlation coefficient for NRBC is greater than the specification.

All results met the acceptance criteria. The whole blood comparability results on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ demonstrated acceptable performance against the predicate $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ $\mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ .

Measurement Procedures Comparison: Body Fluid

The objective of the study was to verify that body fluid results on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ meet the bias specifications when compared to the predicate $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ . Trueness was established in accordance with CLSI H26-A2 and EP9-A3.

The study included 110 specimens distributed across the AMI with spent body fluid specimens from a comprehensive and diverse range of hematological conditions whose body fluid characteristics satisfied the target ranges of the parameters to be tested. Body fluid specimen was spiked with spent whole blood and whole blood was diluted with normal saline; all samples were analyzed in the body fluid test mode. The specimens were comprised of a mixture of the body fluid types (e.g., CSF, synovial, and serous). The specimens were tested in duplicate on the DxH 800 v3.0 and the predicate $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ in the body fluids mode. The specimens were equally distributed across the three $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instruments within the workcell.

Prior to statistical analysis, the data were inspected for outliers; no outliers were removed. Individual parameter results for specimens that were below the measuring range were excluded from analysis. There was one specimen excluded from the study.

Weighted Deming approaches were used to estimate the parameters of the regression model (slope, intercept, their $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals, and correlation) since the scatter of the data (variability) was significantly related to the range of measurements (mean). Bias between methods was calculated from the regression line at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile points of the range of the comparator. Confidence limits of bias estimates were calculated based on standard errors of bias and $9 5 \%$ confidence. The upper/lower confidence limits were compared to the specifications.

The $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ is considered to be comparable to the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ predicate if the upper/lower $9 5 \%$ confidence limit of the difference between the parameter results is less than or equal to the acceptance limits defined.

All results met the acceptance criteria. The body fluid bias results on the DxH 800 $\mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ demonstrated acceptable performance against the predicate $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ .

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

Imprecision (Repeatability): Whole Blood

The objective was to verify that the Whole Blood Imprecision (Repeatability) of the proposed $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. Imprecision for Whole Blood was evaluated in accordance with CLSI H26-A2.

Specimens were collected to evaluate repeatability in the lower ranges for WBC, RBC, and PLT parameters. Where specimens could not be obtained through the collection of routine spent samples, specimens were manipulated to achieve the target parameter value prior to testing. At least 5 samples with 10 replicates for each sample were included in the analysis. Different samples were tested for different parameters. The specimens were randomly distributed across the three $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instruments in the workcell. Exclusions were made at the parameter level not the specimen level. Parameter results for specimens having System Messages, System Status messages and “R” flags were excluded. No specimens were removed from analysis.

Calculations were performed separately for each parameter. ANOVA was used to partition sample-to-sample variability from the within sample variability. Test for homogeneity for each parameter confirmed the pooling of variances. Within sample variance component estimated the repeatability of the system. Upper $9 5 \%$ confidence limit of the repeatability variance was calculated using the chi-square distribution. $C V \%$ was calculated by dividing the square roots of variance and its upper limit with the average of all samples. Upper limit of the repeatability $C V \%$ was compared to the repeatability specification.

The whole blood imprecision (repeatability) results on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ demonstrated acceptable performance. All the results met the acceptance criteria. For all parameters, the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence limit was within the specification. The descriptive statistics, repeatability $C V \%$ , upper $9 5 \%$ confidence limits of the repeatability $C V \%$ , acceptance limits, and conclusions are presented below.

# Imprecision (Repeatability): Body Fluid

The objective was to verify that the Body Fluid Imprecision (Repeatability) of the proposed $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. Imprecision for Body Fluid was evaluated in accordance with CLSI H26-A2.

Diluted whole blood specimens were prepared such that the BF-TNC and BF-RBC parameters were within the specified target ranges. At least 5 samples were included for each target range with 10 replicates tested in the body fluids mode from each sample. Different specimens were tested for the different parameters. The specimens were randomly distributed across the three $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instruments in the workcell. No data was excluded from the analysis.

Calculations were performed separately for each parameter. ANOVA was used to partition sample-to-sample variability from the within sample variability.

# c. Linearity:

Linearity: Whole Blood

The objective of the study was to verify that the Whole Blood Linearity of the proposed $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. Linearity evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A.

Linearity was assessed by demonstrating that the reported results are directly proportional to the concentration of the measurand in a test sample for WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters across the analytical measuring range. Testing assessed whole blood linearity using whole blood and cell control analog samples on the proposed $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ system (v3.0).

Dilution series were prepared covering the analytical measuring interval for each parameter. A mixture of whole blood and plasma were used for RBC and HGB and a mixture of cell control analogs and media were used for WBC and PLT to create the dilution series. To cover the entire parameter range using a single set of dilutions, the dilution schemes designed for WBC and PLT included more dilution points in the lower end of the range. This distribution allowed for higher resolution in the lower end of the range to capture medical decision points while covering the full range. Equally spaced dilutions were used for RBC and HGB since their ranges were relatively narrower and the medical decision levels were captured adequately. All dilutions were run in quadruplicate on each of the three $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ instruments in the workcell.

The linearity data was analyzed independently for each $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ instrument in the workcell. Linearity was evaluated by fitting linear and non-linear (quadratic and cubic) models and assessing that the deviations from linearity (difference between the non-linear and linear fits) were within the acceptance criteria.

Weighted least squares method was used to estimate the linear, quadratic and cubic regression parameters. The reason for choosing the weighted least squares method was the significant dependency of variability to the measuring range (heteroscedacity).

All analyses met $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 }$ acceptance criteria. The linearity results for WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ demonstrated acceptable linearity performance.

Linearity: Body Fluid

The objective of the study was to verify that the Body Fluid Linearity of the proposed $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. Linearity was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A.

Linearity was assessed by demonstrating that the reported results are directly proportional to the concentration of the measurand in a test sample for body fluids for BF-RBC and BF-TNC parameters across the analytical measuring range. Testing assessed body fluid linearity using whole blood or cell control analogs on the proposed $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ system (v3.0).

Dilution series of whole blood (BF-RBC) or cell control analogs (BF-TNC) were made to cover the analytical measuring interval of the body fluid parameter. To cover the entire parameter range a single set of 15 dilutions were made. All dilutions were run in quadruplicate on each of the three $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instruments in the workcell.

All analyses met $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 }$ acceptance criteria. The results for BF-RBC and BF-TNC on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ demonstrated acceptable body fluids linearity performance.

# d. Carryover:

The objective of the study was to verify that the Whole Blood Carryover of the proposed $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. The study was performed in accordance with CLSI H26-A2.

Carryover was assessed by running whole blood specimens with high parameter values followed by DxH Diluent (diluent). Whole blood specimens were selected or altered to obtain the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT target values below. Each whole blood specimen was analyzed three times followed by diluent analyzed three times. A minimum of three carryover cycles (i.e., three different specimens) per parameter were tested on each $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ instrument in the workcell.

All results met the acceptance criteria. The whole blood carryover results for the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ demonstrated acceptable performance.

Carryover: Body Fluids

The objective of the study was to verify that the Body Fluid Carryover of the proposed $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ system (v3.0) meets the performance specifications. The study was performed in accordance with CLSI H26-A2.

Carryover was assessed by running whole blood specimens with high parameter values followed by DxH Diluent (diluent). Whole blood specimens were selected having WBC, and RBC values as listed below. Each whole blood specimen was analyzed three times in the CDR mode followed by diluent analyzed three times in the BF (body fluids) mode. A minimum of three carryover cycles (i.e., three different specimens) per parameter were tested on each $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ instrument in the workcell.

Target Values

The carryover for BF-TNC and BF-RBC parameters is reported as the total cells counted. The results are considered acceptable if the number of cells for each diluent is less than the specification.

All results met the acceptance criteria. The body fluid carryover results for the DxH $8 0 0 { \mathrm { v } } 3 . 0 $ demonstrated acceptable performance.

# e. Interfering Substances:

Refer to 510(k) cleared device: k120771 a. Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference:

The objective of the study was to verify that the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) status of individual $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ and DxH SMS instruments are not impacted when configured in a workcell configuration.

The required intrinsic immunity level to preclude EMC interference against emissions of nearby devices for the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ is 3 volts/meter. An assessment of the $\mathrm { D x H 8 0 0 ^ { \circ } s }$ intrinsic level of immunity to preclude EMC interference against emissions of nearby devices was performed. Both the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ and DxH SMS have a maximum permissible emission limit of 0.0007 volts/meter. Testing of the individual devices showed acceptable performance to these limits. The required immunity level for both is 3 volts/meter. Therefore, the intrinsic level of RF immunity for both devices is orders of magnitude greater than the emission limit of each device. Based on these factors, it is unlikely that the EMC interference would be increased in a connected DxH workcell as compared to a stand-alone $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ .

b. Vibration Testing

The objective of the study was to determine the impact of vibration due to the coupling of multiple instruments in a workcell configuration on measurement results.

The impact of connecting $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ and DxH SMS instruments in workcell configurations was assessed by comparing the System Backgrounds and AC RMS (alternating current root mean square) noise for each blood cell measurement channel against the specification limits. Measurement results will not be impacted if System Backgrounds and AC RMS noise remain within specification during vibration testing.

The testing protocol included: instrument Shutdown and Startup; completion of daily checks including System Backgrounds, and; for each instrument, capture 20 AC RMS noise measurements for each blood cell measurement channel of the CBC and VCSn modules, while all of the other instruments $\mathrm { ( D x H 8 0 0 }$ and DxH SMS) in the test configuration were continuously running.

Eleven test cases were executed representing the different workcell configurations. All test cases for the Standalone and Connectivity Workcell configurations passed the AC RMS noise measurements as well as System Backgrounds. Based on this study, there is no evidence that the coupling of multiple instruments in a workcell configuration will have an impact on measurement of results.

c. Determination of Limit of Blank (LoB), Lower Limits of Detection (LLoD) and Quantitation (LLoQ):

The objective of the study was to verify that the LoB, LLoD and LLoQ of the DxH

800 v3.0 meet the performance specifications. The studies were designed based on CLSI H26-A2.

LoB, LoD, and LLoQ testing was performed for the parameters defined below. These are parameters where there is a clinical interest (medical decision level) on very low or near zero values.

Whole blood – WBC and PLT Body Fluid – TNC and RBC

# Limit of Blank

The test was conducted on each of the three $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instruments in the workcell. On each test instrument, blank samples consisting of $\mathrm { D x H }$ Diluent (diluent) were tested over three days as follows:

For the whole blood mode, testing of the diluent blanks was distributed over the different analysis modes where five diluent blanks were analyzed in each mode (CBC, CD, CDR and CR) for three days. This testing scheme resulted in 40 daily runs (20 AM, 20 PM) which then totaled 120 whole blood runs over the 3 day study. · For the body fluids mode, testing of the diluent blanks resulted in 40 daily runs (20 AM, 20 PM) which then totaled 120 body fluid runs over the 3 day study.

A minimum of two reagent lots were used for the DxH Diluent and the DxH Cell Lyse installed on the DxH 800 Workcell instruments over the 3 day period.

The limits of blank (LoB) were calculated separately for 3 connected DxH 800 v3.0 instruments. The nonparametric approach based on $9 5 \%$ percentiles was used to calculate LoB for each instrument.

Lower Limit of Detection and Lower Limit of Quantitation

To test for LLoD and LLoQ, an individual set of dilutions on a sample was prepared to obtain a stock solution with a value in one of the specified target ranges. The concentration of the stock solution was verified on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ predicate instrument. Four samples per parameter were used for a total of 16 samples.

Dilution series were prepared of the stock solution in 10 percent increments from $0 \%$ to $100 \%$ . Three sets of dilutions were prepared; one set of dilutions was analyzed on each of the three $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instruments. Five replicates of each dilution level were analyzed on each $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instrument in the appropriate analytical mode, either CBC or BF. The analysis was repeated 24 hours later on each of the three $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ instruments.

Bias was established using normal whole blood samples analyzed in duplicate in the CBC analytical mode on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ predicate instrument and each of the DxH

$8 0 0 { \mathrm { v } } 3 . 0 $ instruments in the workcell. Five bloods were analyzed each day for 12 days for a total of 60 bloods.

There was a significant relationship between precision and concentration for each parameter. Consequently, the precision profile approach was used to estimate LLoD and LLoQ. LLoQ was calculated based on total error composed of the within laboratory variability component and bias component.

# d. DxH SMS Performance Test Strategy

The output of the DxH SMS is limited to the delivery of a physical slide. The device does not generate test results; it only produces a slide that is read on a separate device by a technician. Based on this, the DxH SMS test strategy was designed to evaluate the critical attributes of the slide output, specifically slide quality and carryover.

Testing was performed on the most complex workcell (model DxH 2401).

# DxH SMS Slide Quality

The objective was to verify that the DxH SMS produces slides that meet the slide quality specifications. Slide quality was established in accordance with CLSI H20- A2.

Slides were prepared in duplicate for 104 specimens on the DxH SMS in the workcell. The slides were evaluated by two independent readers following the Requirements for an Acceptable Blood Film (section 6.3.1) described in CLSI H20- A2. Additionally, overall slide quality was assessed.

Acceptance Criteria: Slides must meet the Requirements for an Acceptable Blood Film (section 6.3.1) described in CLSI H20-A2:

1. Sufficient working area.   
2. Minimum $2 . 5 \mathrm { c m }$ in length terminating at least 1 cm from the end of the slide.   
3. Gradual transition in thickness from the thick to the thin areas, ending in a feathered edge.

4. Acceptable morphology within the working area.

5. Narrower than the slide on which the film is spread, with smooth continuous side margins that are accessible for oil immersion examination.

6. No artifact introduced by the technique.

7. Minimum distributional distortion.

8. A far end that becomes gradually thinner, without grainy streaks, troughs, or ridges, all of which indicate an increased number of WBC carried into this area.

Additionally, $59 5 \%$ of the slides must be readable.

All results met the acceptance criteria. The DxH SMS produces slides that meet the slide quality specifications.

# DxH SMS Carryover

The objective was to verify that the Carryover of the DxH SMS meets the performance specifications.

A series of slides from normal whole blood samples followed by control material containing analog cells were prepared by the DxH SMS in alternating order as described below.

· Three normal whole blood samples · One control sample with a WBC value of $5 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ · Three normal whole blood samples · One control sample with a WBC value of $1 5 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ · Four normal whole blood samples · One control sample with a WBC value of $4 0 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ · Three normal whole blood samples · One control sample with a WBC value of $5 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ Three normal whole blood samples

The whole blood slides were assessed for carryover of control analog cells by performing a 400 cell differential on each slide using the Cellavision DM96 (k080595).

Slides must contain ${ \le } 1$ analog cell in 400 WBCs in the working area of the slide. There were no analog cells observed on any of the whole blood slides. The DxH SMS carryover demonstrated acceptable performance.

An additional carryover study was conducted on the DxH SMS using whole blood samples with abnormal WBC types. It was designed to test for carryover of abnormal WBC cell types using the DxH SMS within a connected workcell. The carryover study was repeated 5 times using 5 different high target value (HTV) abnormal WBC specimens.

A low target value (LTV) sample free of abnormal WBC cells was identified with sufficient volume for each carryover study. Each sample was leukodepleted using CD45RO conjugated beads to reduce the background WBC and enhance the detection sensitivity of the carryover studies. Leukodepletion did not affect the other cell populations and some residual WBC may have remained.

For each carryover study, a set of seven slides (1 Background LTV, 3 HTV, 3 LTV) were prepared on the DxH SMS. The same specimen was used to prepare the Background LTV and the individual LTV slides. A manual differential was performed on the Background LTV slide, the third HTV slide and the first LTV slide. For the HTV samples, the manual differential was based on a 400 cell count. For LTV samples, due to the low cell concentration, all cells within the working area of the slide were read. A Cellavison DM96 was used to locate the events on the slide and the results were reviewed by a single operator.

The first LTV slide must contain $\leq 1$ abnormal cell in the working area of the slide. There were no abnormal cells observed on any of the LTV slides from the five carryover studies.

All carryover studies met the acceptance criteria. The DxH SMS carryover demonstrated acceptable performance.
