# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY

A. 510(k) Number: K140957   
B. Purpose for Submission: New device   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Applied Spectral Imaging Ltd., GenASIs HiPath IHC Family   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

Computer-assisted image analysis algorithm for scoring immunohistochemically stained HER2/neu slides, estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) slides, and ki67 slides. The image analysis algorithm scoring is confirmed by the pathologist before reporting the scores.

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The GenASIs HiPath IHC Family, including software is designed to assist the qualified pathologist in the consistent assessment in immohistochemnically stained histologic sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues. The device consists of a slide capture camera, microscope, computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, image analysis algorithms for specific immunohistochemical markers, and software with a Graphic User Interface (GUI).

The GenASIs HiPath IHC Family is an intranet-based, software application that allows pathology laboratories, to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report test results of pathology specimens. Using the GenASIs HiPath IHC Family software the pathologist can view captured images, add annotations, make measurements, perform image analysis and generate reports.

Hardware: A camera based acquisition device designed to captures bright-field microscope digital images of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissues that are suitable for storage and viewing. The device includes a digital slide acquisition camera, X-Y Stage with holder adaptor for loading glass slides on a microscope and a workstation including a computer, keyboard, mouse and monitor.

Software: The GenASIs HiPath IHC Family software is designed to complement the routine workflow of a qualified pathologist in the review of specific immunohistochemically stained FFPE breast histologic slides. It allows the user to select fields of view (FOVs) in the digital image for analysis and provides quantitative data on these FOVs to assist with interpretation. The software makes no independent interpretations of the data and requires competent human intervention for all steps in the analysis process.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The pathologist selects the ROI (Region Of Interest) of the immunohistochemically stained glass slides by using the review microscope. The desired ROI of the glass slide is digitized by an image acquisition system and an Image Analysis scoring algorithm is applied on the digitized image. The image analysis application score is presented to the pathologist on the screen who must verify agreement with the Image Analysis software application score by manually reviewing the slide under the optical microscope.

3. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ___X____ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No ___X_

4. Specimen Identification: Glass slides are identified by slide label.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen glass slides are mounted manually on the microscope by the pathologist to be imaged by the camera mounted on the microscope.

6. Calibration:

Camera White Balance: The image acquisition program automatically adjusts white balance for each image it acquires.

NOTE: The GenASIs HiPath IHC Family for HER2 (4B5) image capture and analysis applications are adjunctive computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the acquisition and semi-quantitative measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer specimens stained for the presence of HER-2/neu receptor protein. The pathologist should verify agreement with the Image Analysis software application score by reviewing the glass slide under the microscope. The accuracy of the test results depends on the quality of the immuohistochemical staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as specified in the instructions for the PATHWAY $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay used to assure the validity of the GenASIs HiPath IHC Family for HER2 (4B5) image capture and analysis scores. The actual correlation of PATHWAY $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) to clinical outcome has not been established.

2. The GenASIs HiPath IHC Family for PR (1E2) is for image capture and analysis applications. This particular system is intended for use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection and qualitative measurement of progesterone receptor (PR) protein in formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue.

The following tables (6-8) present frequency distribution of agreement between manual count and the system output where the outcome is summarized in three ways—two-level outcome (positive / negative), three-level outcome (positive / equivocal / negative) and four-level outcome (positive / equivocal / negative class $1 +$ / negative class 0). The distribution is given by center and overall. The corresponding PPA, NPA and OA, and their $9 5 \%$ two- sided Exact Binomial confidence intervals are included.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

For the repeatability and reproducibility tests a total of 40 slides were used for each application. The slides were chosen in a way that they will span the entire clinically meaningful range. Per each sample, attention was given to the relevant categories, so that there will be enough samples per each category.

The following quantities of slides per category were used (Table 9):
