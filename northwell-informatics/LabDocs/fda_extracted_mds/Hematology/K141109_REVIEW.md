Addition of the AT Turbo and CS2 scanner models to the cleared Aperio ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XT System for scoring ER, PR and HER2 immunohistochemically stained slides by the image analysis algorithm method.

# C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:

Leica Biosystems Imaging, Inc., Aperio ePathology eIHC IVD System, AT Turbo and CS2 models

# D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

Computer-assisted image analysis algorithm for scoring immunohistochemically stained HER2/neu slides, estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) slides.. The image analysis algorithm scoring is confirmed by the pathologist before reporting the scores.

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Aperio ePathology eIHC IVD System is a closed system comprised of a ScanScope® digital slide scanner instrument (either the ScanScope AT Turbo or the ScanScope CS2) and eSlide Manager software, ImageScope software and Image Analysis Algorithms, as applicable. The Aperio ePathology eIHC IVD System is an automated digital slide creation, management, viewing and analysis system. The system is comprised of a slide scanner instrument and a computer executing eSlideManager, ImageScope and Image Analysis Algorithm software. The system capabilities include digitizing immunohistochemically stained slides, storing and managing the resulting digital slide images, retrieving and displaying digital slides, providing tools for annotating digital slides and entering and editing data associated with digital slides, and tools for image analysis of the regions that pathologists select on the digital slide images.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

Glass slides are digitized by an image acquisition system that provides digital slide images of the immunohistochemically stained slides; the image acquisition system provides support for patient / slide identification, slide loading, calibration, tissue identification, focusing and digital image storage and management. Pathologists select regions on the digital slide images that will be automatically analyzed by an image analysis algorithm for HER2 or ER/PR (i.e., HER2 or ER/PR Image Analysis). The regions on the digital slide images selected by pathologists for image analysis should be representative for the entire tumor.

The HER2 Image Analysis algorithm detects the membrane staining for the individual tumor cells in the selected regions and quantifies the intensity and completeness of the membrane staining. Tumor cells are individually classified as $0 , 1 + , 2 +$ , and $3 +$ based on their membrane staining intensity and completeness. The HER2 score is then calculated based on the percentages of $0 , 1 + , 2 +$ , and $^ { 3 + }$ cells according to the HER2 scoring scheme. A markup image highlights the detected cell features (black $=$ nuclei and membrane) and the membrane staining which is color-coded according to the cell classification (blue ${ = } 0$ , yellow $= 1 +$ , orange $= 2 +$ , $\operatorname { r e d } = 3 +$ ). The pathologist is then provided with HER2 score and the percentages of $) , 1 + , 2 +$ , and $3 +$ cells. The pathologist makes the final interpretation based on both the qualitative and quantitative information and should follow all appropriate instructions in the Dako Hercep Test™ product insert

The ER/PR image analysis algorithms use color, intensity, size, pattern and shape information to detect, count, and classify cells of interest and determine a score that correlates with the score the pathologists provide. The image analysis algorithm reports the percentage of positive nuclei and average intensity score of 0 $, 1 + , 2 +$ or $^ { 3 + }$ for each slide. The pathologist makes the final interpretation based on the percent positivity of tumor nuclei and/or staining intensity according to the laboratory’s established interpretation criteria.

3. Modes of Operation:

Semi-automated computer-assisted scoring of IHC HER2, ER or PR stained slide images performed by Image Analysis Applications with manual verification by the pathologist.

4. Specimen Identification: Glass slides are identified by barcode label

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The Autoloader component of the ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ AT Turbo instrument is responsible for storing slides to be scanned, and contains a mechanism for mounting the current slide to be processed on the scanning stage. The slide autoloader is an assembly within the ScanScope AT Turbo that can hold up to 400 slides.

The ScanScope $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CS2 has no Autoloader. The CS2 has a five slide capacity tray that can be inserted by the operator into the system.

6. Calibration:

The scanner is calibrated and verified at the factory before shipment. No further manual calibration or verification is required by the customer. Annual preventive maintenance, performed by Leica Biosystems Imaging Technical Services, is recommended to make sure the scanner is operating correctly. The scanner provides automatic calibration and verification every time a slide is scanned by performing prescan calibration during the scan.

# 7. Quality Control:

The pathologist must verify that the eSlides are of sufficient quality to perform his or her task. The pathologist should review the quality of the scanning by evaluating that the entire tissue sample is scanned and in focus. Positive and negative control slides are also scanned along with the patient slides which are reviewed by the pathologist before scoring.
