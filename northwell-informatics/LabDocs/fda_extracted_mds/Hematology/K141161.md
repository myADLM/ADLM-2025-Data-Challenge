# 4.0 System description : 4.1 Device Description

The ABX MICROS ES 60 is a quantitative, automated hematology analyzer and leukocyte differential counter for in vitro diagnostic use in clinical laboratories. The instrument system is comprised of the analyzer and a suite of analytical reagents that allow for simultaneous quantitative determination of hemoglobin measurement, cell counting, quality control, calibration, and cleaning. The system is a microprocessor controlled hematology analyzer used for the in vitro diagnostic testing of whole blood specimens. It operates in complete blood count (CBC) and Differential (DIFF) mode using a combination of focused flow impedance and light transmission technologies. It is available in Closed (CT) or Open Tube (OT) sampling versions.

# 4.2 Principles of Operation

The ABX Micros ES 60 principle of automated cell counting and sizing is used in the analysis of the whole blood. Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an insulator. As each cell goes through the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between two submerged electrodes on either side of the aperture. This causes a measurable electronic pulse. While the number of pulses indicates particle count, the amplitude of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell volume. These pulses are sent to the Signal Conditioner for analog to digital conversion. Pulse counts and digitized pulse measurements are sent to the System Manager for processing by the algorithms where the reported parameter values, flags and histograms are generated.

The diluted sample is processed through two different chambers:

The RBC / PLT chamber, for the Red Blood Cell (RBC) and Platelet (PLT) detection The WBC / HGB chamber, for the White Blood Cell (WBC) and Hemoglobin (HGB) counts

![](images/c9a53b9c32a2ba2ec757b71e98652db18785f16fb33810b8b9b378f8e1c53f69.jpg)

Red Blood Cells (RBC) and Platelets (PLT) Detection:

The blood specimen is diluted in the electrolytic (current conductor) ABX Minidil LMG and pulled through the $5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ calibrated micro-aperture in the mini flow-cytometer. Two electrodes are placed on either side of the aperture. Electric current passes through the electrodes continuously. When a cell passes through the aperture, the electric resistance between the two electrodes increases proportionately to the cell volume.

The impedance variation is measured and allows for the RBC and PLT quantification.

# Hemoglobin Measurement:

The lysing reagent breaks down the RBC cell membrane and releases the hemoglobin contained by the cell. The hemoglobin, released by the lysing reagent, combines with the potassium cyanide from the lysing reagent to form a chromogenous cyanmethemoglobin compound. This compound is then measured through the optical part of the WBC/HGB chamber by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of $5 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# Hematocrit Measurement:

All the RBC pulses are grouped into various sizes. Each group pulse height is then averaged. All the pulse height averages are then averaged one final time for a mean average of all the RBC pulse heights. This function is a numeric integration of the MCV. The HCT results are given as a percentage of this integration.

# Red Distribution Width (RDW) Calculation:

The RDW is calculated from the RBC histogram. It allows to follow the evolution of the width of the RBC histogram in relation to the number of cells and their average volume.

Mean Cell Volume (MCV), Mean Cell Hemoglobin (MCH) and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) Calculations:

The MCV is calculated directly from the entire RBC histogram. The MCH is calculated from the HGB value and the RBC count. The MCHC is calculated according to the HGB and HCT values.

Mean Platelet Volume (MPV): The MPV is directly derived from the analysis of the platelet distribution curve.

# White Blood Cell (WBC) Count:

The WBC count is carried out in the WBC/HGB chamber. The detection principle is the same as for RBC.

ABX Minidil LMG reagent preserves and prepares the WBC cell membrane for the differential reaction. The lysing reagent has a differential mode of action on the WBC cytoplasmic membranes.

When the lysing reagent reacts with the lymphocytes, the cytoplasm and the membrane are destroyed. At the end of the lysing action, only the nucleous remains intact and this action results in a smaller volume detected by the instrument.

When the lysing reagent reacts with the monocyte cytoplasmic membrane, it has an intermediate reaction that empties the cytoplasm from the cell. At the end of the lysing action, the monocyte cells obtained have an intermediate size between the lymphocytes and the granulocytes. • When the lysing reagent reacts with the granulocytes, it has a limited reaction due to a molecule in their cytoplasmic structure which protects them from the shrinking action of the lyse. This in turn makes the granulocytes the larger of the WBC sub-populations in the cell differentiation.

The three sub-populations of WBCs are placed according to the number of cells and the size of the cells in each group. The lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte results are given as a percentage of the entire WBC count.

The granulocytes subpopulation of the WBC contains three sub-populations that contain cytoplasmic granular material which stain various colors when viewed microscopically.

■ Neutrophils Eosinophils ■ Basophils

The distribution of these cells depends on the pathological and physiological conditions of the individuals analyzed.   
Pathological cells are placed in different zones within the WBC distribution curve and trigger alarms.

# 4.3 Modes of Operation

Two models of ABX Micros ES 60 are available.

• The Closed Tube (CT) instrument: it has a cap-piercing mechanism. The blood collection tube is placed directly in the analyzer without removing the cap. The Open Tube (OT) instrument: the cap form the blood collection tube must be removed before analyzing the sample.

# 4.4 Specimen Identification

Specimen identification is by manual sample identification with the use of a hand held barcode scanner.

# 4.5 Calibration

Calibration is a procedure that is performed during specific situations such as installation, maintenance or service intervention. It is performed by a HORIBA ABX SAS representative. It ensures that the precision and accuracy of the analyzer are acceptable, so that accurate measurements are performed by the analyzer.

ABX Minocal calibrator (k955925) is used for the ABX Micros ES 60 calibration procedure. Assigned assay values are traceable to reference methods.

# 4.6 Quality Control

Quality control allows the user to monitor a set of analyses based on known sample values and ranges over a period of several months. Statistical computation performed on these populations allows the extraction of qualitative information related to the stability of the instrument.

ABX Minotrol 16 Control (k850755) enables monitoring of system performance for all directly measured and calculated CBC and Diff parameters. Assigned assay values are determined on validated instruments using the appropriate reagents.

# 8.0 Summary of Performance Data :

8.1 Analytical Performance 8.1.1 Analytical Limits at Low Level Limit of Blank (LoB)

Plasma samples, obtained by centrifugation of normal samples, were used as blank samples, in order to be as close as possible as the blood sample matrix.   
To estimate the LoB, a total of 60 repeated measurements of different plasma are run in the same series (5 different samples run 12 times).   
This test is performed on 2 instruments with two reagents lots.   
Results on Micros ES60 OT and Micros ES60 CT were similar and met specifications.

LoB obtained from 60 repeated measurements of 5 different plasma samples, are:

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

A set of six samples with very low parameter concentration (i.e. in the range LoB and $4 \mathrm { \Delta x }$ LoB) are run 10 times over several days.

To estimate the LOD, take 60 results and calculate the pooled standard deviation (SDs).   
This test is performed on 2 instruments with two reagents lots.   
Results on Micros ES60 OT and Micros $\mathrm { E S 6 0 C T }$ were similar and met specifications.

# Limit of Quantitation $\mathbf { \Pi } ( \mathbf { I . 0 0 } )$

To estimate the limit of quantitation, several ranges of linearity in low concentrations are prepared. Between 3 to 6 samples by level are prepared and run at least 5 times each, 40 replicates by level are necessary. The LoQ data are considered acceptable when the %Total-error is smaller than the desired total error for each measurand.

This test is performed on 2 instruments with two reagents lots.

# 8.1.2 Precision(Repeatability/Reproducibility Imprecision (Repeatability)

Repeatability was performed using 12 normal and 10 abnormal fresh whole blood samples collected into tubes containing K2EDTA anticoagulant. Each sample was run 10 consecutive times on two models of the Micros ES60 (ES60 OT and ES 60 CT), in a single day and all runs were completed within 8 hours of sample collection.

The size of the standard deviation was compared with the mean value of each parameter. This standard deviation divided by the mean is known as the Coefficient of Variation (CV) and is expressed as a percentage: $\mathrm { C V \% } = ( 1 0 0 ^ { \ast } |$ [Standard Deviation/Mean])

The results obtained were in the specifications.

# Imprecision (Reproducibility)

Reproducibility was assessed on three Micros ES60 instruments at three sites, each with its own operator. On each site; High, Normal, and Low levels of one single lot of Minotrol control material were run in duplicate, twice each day, during a minimum of 18 days.

Total standard deviation and $C V \%$ were calculated for each measurand and results obtained were in the specifications.

# 8.1.3 Linearity / Assay’s Measuring (Reportable) Range

Commercial High and Full Range Linearity kits were used to perform the linearity studies. The expected values of the kit samples were considered the “true values”. Each level was run in replicates of four $( \mathrm { n } { = } 4 )$ as recommended by the kit supplier. For each level, the 4 replicate results were plotted versus the theoretical value. The findings of the polynomial regression analysis indicate that the ABX Micros ES 60 exhibits linearity across the claimed range.

The Analytical Measuring Range is defined as the range comprised between the Limit of Quantitation and the High Linearity Limit determined for each parameter. The claimed AMR are therefore:

# 8.1.4 Carryover

The potential for sample carryover was tested in duplicate on the ABX Micros ES 60 OT and CT instruments using alternating high and low concentrations samples.

The percentage of carryover is calculated using the formula below:

$$
\boxed { C t ^ { \% } = \frac { l o w 4 - l o w 6 } { h i g h 3 - l o w 6 } \times 1 0 0 }
$$

All carry-over results are within specifications for the ABX Micros ES OT and CT Systems.

# 8.1.5 Interfering substances

The interference effect is evaluated following two methodologies:

By addition $:$ evaluating the effect of potentially interfering substances added to the sample of interest:

A potential interfering substance is added to a sample and the bias relative to a control portion of the sample is evaluated ("paired-difference testing"). This bias was compared to the acceptance criteria.

For all tests performed with the following potential interferents, the bias remained below the acceptable limit and therefore, no significant interference was observed: urea, bilirubin, lipemia, and hemolysis.

An interference on WBC counts has been observed in presence of yeast in the sample.

- By comparison: evaluating the bias of individual specimen:

Representative patient specimens and a control sample (without interferent) are run in duplicate in comparison to a comparative measurement procedure (Micros 60). Then the bias versus comparative measurement values was plotted for each specimen group. Both measurement procedures had 10 to 20 samples in each group to demonstrate sufficient precision.

A comparable effect was observed on the ABX Micros ES 60 and the reference device for the interferences from: WBC fragments, Myelocytes, nucleated RBC, RBC Inclusion, RBC Agglutinins / Cold Agglutinins / RBC Rouleaux, Dual RBC population, RBC fragments, Target cells, Platelet Aggregates, Platelet Satelitism, Macrothrombocytes / Large Platelets, Small RBC Leukocytosis.

Additionnally, Megakaryoctes and Parasites are potential interferents on respectively WBC and Monocytes counts that could not be tested, but that are well described in literature.

# 8.1.6 Sample stability

11 whole venous blood specimens (collected in K2EDTA and K3EDTA) were analyzed on the ABX Micros ES 60 (OT model) at one site in France. Following the collection (T0), each specimen was divided in half, with one sample stored at ambient temperature $( 2 0 { - } 2 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and the other stored under refrigerated conditions $\left( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ . Testing for stability was performed at 2, 6, 8, 10, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours after $\mathrm { T 0 }$ . The first aliquot of each specimen was run sequentially in any order. The second aliquot was run in reverse order to minimize the effects of carryover and drift. The acceptance criteria for sample stability is given as an acceptable maximum bias of the value at $\mathrm { T }$ with the value at T0. All data passed specifications.

# 8.2 Other supportive performance data using clinical specimens

In order to support the equivalence and comparability claims made for the ABX Micros ES 60 in vitro diagnostic hematology analyzer, some performance studies were done in external clinical laboratories with clinical blood specimens collected prospectively or not. These may be considered as “Clinical studies”.

# 8.2.1 Comparability with Predicate Device

A total of 179 whole blood specimens from adult patients were analyzed at four test sites in the US.

Each of the samples was analyzed in duplicate on the ABX Micros ES 60 (CT model) and on the predicate ABX Micros 60.

Bias was estimated at three points for each parameter: the low end of the distribution of observations, the mid-point, and the high end of the distribution. Bias was estimated separately for each replicate. Acceptance criteria were met for all measurands at all levels. These findings support the claim that the ABX Micros ES60 candidate device and the ABX Micros 60 predicate device are substantially equivalent, and demonstrate acceptable levels of bias.

# 8.2.2 Comparability between Sampling methods

A total of 237 whole blood specimens from adult patients were analyzed at one test site in France.

Each of the samples was analyzed in duplicate on the ABX Micros ES 60 CT (Close Tube model) and on the ABX Micros ES 60 OT (Open Tube model).

Bias was estimated at three points for each parameter: the low end of the distribution of observations, the mid-point, and the high end of the distribution. Bias was estimated separately for each replicate. Acceptance criteria were met for all measurands at all levels. These findings support the claim that both Open Tube and Close Tube models of ABX Micros ES60 device yield comparable performances across the analytical range for all the parameters.

# 8.2.3 Comparability between Anticoagulant types

A total of 52 normal and pathological blood specimens were analyzed on the ABX Micros ES60 (CT model) at three sites in the US. Different instruments and operators were used at each site. The specimens used in this study were venous blood specimens that were prospectively collected for this study specifically. Each subject provided blood collected in both K2EDTA and K3EDTA.

Each of the samples was analyzed in duplicate on the ABX Micros ES 60.

Bias was estimated at three points for each parameter: the low end of the distribution of observations, the mid-point, and the high end of the distribution. Bias was estimated separately for each replicate. Acceptance criteria were met for all measurands at all levels. These findings support the claim that K2EDTA and K3EDTA specimens give comparable results as measured on the ABX Micros ES60 hematology analyzer.

# 8.2.4 Clinical Sensitivity / Specificity

100 normal and 100 pathological samples preserved in K2EDTA covering the full analytic range of the ABX Micros ES60 were analyzed in duplicate on the ABX Micros ES60 (CT model) and ABX Micros ES60 (OT model). Samples used for this study were left-over samples from both hospital and private independent clinical laboratories in France. Two slides with May Grünwald Giemsa staining were prepared for each sample. Slide reviews were conducted as a gold standard reference and WBC differential counts were conducted using 400-cell reference differential count (200 cells per reader, 2 readers) on each sample following the procedure discussed in CLSI H20-A2.

Samples were classified into Normal or Abnormal samples for the ABX Micros ES60 OT, ABX Micros ES60 CT, and the reference method (manual slide microscopy for differential count and morphological appreciation; the predicate ABX Micros 60 for quantitative CBC parameters). Abnormal samples were subdivided into those with abnormal proportions of one or more cell types (quantitative), and those containing abnormal cells (morphological).

Method comparison studies were designed using the CLSI H20-A2 procedure by the construction of the “envelope” that takes into account the imprecision of both the test and the manual method ( $9 5 \%$ and $9 9 \%$ confidence interval respectively).

The ability to identify abnormal samples and listed pathologies was evaluated according the CLSI H20-A2 by creating predictive value tables for distributional and morphological classification. From these tables, the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated.

For each cell type, the mean of the manual differential count is compared with the mean of the analyzer count.

For WBC differential count analysis, the scatter plot of the means of the test method (yi) vs. the means of the reference method (xi) for each sample (i) is traced. On each scatter plot, the $9 5 \%$ and $9 9 \%$ confidence intervals that take into account the imprecision of the test and reference methods are drawn.

The ABX Micros ES60 OT and CT models have shown acceptable performances in detecting an abnormal sample with good sensitivity. Positive predictive and negative predictive values are acceptable. Moreover, the WBC differential analysis comparison between the Micros ES60 and the manual microscopy slide observations (Gold Standard) show acceptable results. The data demonstrate the accuracy of the ABX Micros ES60 performance.

# 8.2.5 Reference Interval

275 (135 male and 140 female) normal adult samples (whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA) were analyzed in duplicate on the ABX Micros ES60 (OT model) and ABX Micros ES60 (CT model) at one test site in the US.

The nonparametric data analysis method was used, depending only on the ranks of the reference data arranged in order of increasing size. Per EP28-A3, the reference interval is determined to be between and including the lower and upper reference limits, which enclose $9 5 \%$ of the values from the reference population subjects. Confidence intervals for the reference limit were calculated using a $90 \%$ probability $90 \%$ CI).

Defined reference values are not significantly different between the ABX Micros ES60 OT and CT models. For each gender, a single reference interval applicable (Shared Interval) on both versions of the analyzers has been defined as described in the following table.

Reference intervals have been established on ABX Micros ES60 OT and CT for each parameter, based on a CLSI EP28-A3 study. These intervals are given in the labeling of the Micros ES60.

However, expected values will vary with sample population and/or geographical location. Horiba highly recommends that each laboratory establishes its own normal ranges based upon its local population.

# 9.0 Proposed Labeling :

The labeling is written as per the recommendations given in standard EN18113-2. It takes into account the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# 10.0 Conclusion :

As per 21CFR Part §807.92(b)(3), the nonclinical and clinical tests demonstrate that the ABX Micros ES 60 device is as safe, as effective, and performs as well as or better than the predicate device .
