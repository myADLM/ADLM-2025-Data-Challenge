BD FACSCanto™ flow cytometer (4-3-3 configuration) with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software and BD FACSDiva™ software

# D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

Flow Cytometric Immunoassays

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The BD FACSCanto™ II system (4-2-2 and 5-3 configurations) and the BD FACSCanto™ (4-3-3 configuration) systems consist of a flow cytometer, a self-contained fluidics cart, and a computer workstation. System options include an automated sample loader, a barcode reader, and a sample preparation assistant.

All optical configurations of the FACSCanto™ II share the same dimensions: 25.2 inches in height by 35.7 inches in width by 24 inches in depth. The units are designed to fit a lab bench 22 inches in depth. Each system weighs less than 320 pounds, excluding the FACSLoader and computer workstation. They are able to accept 100/115/230 VAC (volts alternating current) at 50-60 Hertz. Power consumption is rated at 500 Watts.

The FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration shares the same height and width as the FACSCanto™ II instrument but is 25 inches deep and designed to fit on a 27 inches deep lab bench. It weighs less than the FACSCanto™ II instrument (270 pounds without FACSLoader or workstation) and has similar power input and consumption specifications.

2. Principles of Operation:

Flow cytometers combine fluidics, optics, and electronics subsystems to measure and analyze signals emitted when particles in a liquid stream flow through a glass cuvette, at which beams of laser light are directed. The scatter and fluorescence light signals from these particles provide information about cell size, internal complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. The Instructions for Use for each BD FACSCanto™ II and BD FACSCanto™ instrument includes more details on the system components and theory of operations.

The instruments are intended for use with cleared or approved in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays for the identification and enumeration of human cell subsets that are indicated for use with the instrument.

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

The Accuracy study design was based on recommendations in the CLSI document EP9-A2. Method comparison with the predicate instrument configuration was used to determine accuracy through comparative evaluation of the same specimen stained with the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color; IMK) and the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent (TBNK) and analyzed in parallel with the test method and predicate device. Surplus samples were obtained with IRB approval from Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, and from Biocollections Worldwide, Inc.

For each test system (BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2-2 configuration, BD FACSCanto™ II 5-3 configuration, and BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration), the accuracy studies shared the same design and differed only by the system configuration under test, the source of samples, and total number of samples tested. For the purposes of the study, accuracy was defined as the relative or absolute difference between the two systems for each of the specified parameters.

Manufacture’s pre-defined acceptance criteria were as follows:

The accuracy study for each new instrument configuration (BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2- 2, BD FACSCanto™ II 5-3, and BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3; test methods) demonstrates equivalence between the test system with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software and the BD FACSCanto™ 4-2 system (predicate) with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

Instrument precision is assay-dependent and should be performed with each IVD assay intended for use with the instruments.

To assess variability within the instrument configurations, two precision studies were conducted using control materials and whole blood.

Precision studies with control material were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2. Whole blood controls for lymphocyte subset enumeration were used to estimate precision for the following parameters:

· Percent and absolute count of $\mathrm { C D 4 } ^ { + }$ T lymphocytes · Percent and absolute count of $\mathrm { C D 8 } ^ { + }$ T lymphocytes · Percent and absolute count of $\mathrm { C D } 3 ^ { + }$ T lymphocytes · Percent and absolute count of $\mathrm { C D 1 9 ^ { + } B }$ lymphocytes Percent and absolute count of $\mathrm { C D } 1 6 ^ { + } 5 6 ^ { + } \mathrm { N I }$ K lymphocytes

Data were acquired on multiple test systems (BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2-2 configuration, BD FACSCanto™ II 5-3 configuration, BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration) equipped with BD FACSLoaders. For each test system, instruments were rotated over the study duration for at least 21 days, using one instrument per day. Multiple different operators were rotated to collect data throughout the study.

Measurements were obtained from two separate runs per day. Each run was separated by a minimum of 4 hours. Only one operator collected samples per system per day for both reagents. The instruments were set up for acquisition of samples using BD FACS 7-color setup beads and the BD FACSCanto™ clinical software setup module. Tested samples consisted of two levels of whole blood control cells. Quality control samples were included in each run. Each tested sample was stained in duplicate, and each quality control sample was stained singly with the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color) and with the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent in BD Trucount tubes.

The manufacture’s pre-defined acceptance criteria for total precision and within-run precision values for subset percentages and for absolute counts were as follows:

Subset percentages: the upper one-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence bound on the standard deviation should be $\leq 2 . 5 \%$ for $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ , and $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + }$ lymphocytes. · Absolute counts: the upper one-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence bound of the percent CV should be $\leq 1 0 \%$ for T lymphocytes and $\leq 2 0 \%$ for $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 +$ lymphocytes and $\mathrm { C D } 1 6 { + } 5 6 { + }$ lymphocytes.

A second whole blood repeatability study was performed to assess instrument precision using patient samples. The whole blood specimens used in the accuracy study were used to determine repeatability (all samples done in duplicate) therefore results cannot be directly compared across instruments. Samples adequately represented the CD4 analytical measuring range and included concentrations around the medical decision points for each kit.

All parameters for the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent and BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color) met the precision/reproducibility (control material) and repeatability (whole-blood) criteria for the BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2-2 with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software, the BD FACSCanto™ II 5-3 configuration with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software, and the BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software.

# c. Linearity:

Instrument linearity is assay-dependent and should be performed with each IVD assay intended for use with the instrument configurations.

Linearity studies were performed on each configuration to mathematically verify that the relationship between the observed values and the true concentrations of the analyte was linear for each configuration. The objective of each linearity study was to estimate the linearity of the test systems (BD FACSCanto™ II 4-2-2 configuration, BD FACSCanto™ II 5-3 configuration, and BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration, each with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software) using the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4- color) and the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent for the lyse/no-wash method of sample preparation.

Linearity was demonstrated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A section 5.3. Appropriate sample dilutions were chosen across the assays’ ranges. Whole blood from one donor was collected; the mononuclear cells were harvested and stained to determine the subset cell count to ensure that the dilutions would cover the full linearity range. The autologous plasma was reserved and used to pool the specimen into 11 evenly spaced dilutions. Replicates of each dilution were stained with the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color) and BD Multitest 6-color TBNK Reagent in Trucount tubes.

For the absolute counts of each detailed subset $\left( \mathrm { C D 4 } ^ { + } \right.$ , $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 } ^ { + }$ , $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 ^ { + }$ , and $\mathrm { C D } 1 6 ^ { + } \mathrm { C D } 5 6 ^ { + } )$ , the system was considered linear if the higher order coefficient terms (2nd and 3rd order terms) of the polynomial model are not statistically significant.

Regression statistics, including 2-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals and percent recovery were provided for all each cellular subset. The instrument system using the FACSCanto Clinical software for the IMK and TBNK assay was found to be linear for each parameter (absolute counts) for each configuration.

# d. Carryover:

Specimen carry over studies were performed on the BD FACSCanto™ II and BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration to determine whether cellular results were materially affected by residue or other contamination from neighboring samples.

Carryover for both manual and BD FACSLoader acquisition was evaluated on each of three BD FACSCanto™ 4-3-3 configuration and three BD FACSCanto™ II instruments. Percent carryover was estimated by introducing three consecutive abnormally high leucocyte prepared samples followed by three consecutive abnormally low leucocyte prepared samples, and calculating the percent difference according to the formula $\%$ Carryover $= [ ( \mathrm { L } 1 . \mathrm { L } 3 ) / \mathrm { H } 3 . \mathrm { L } 3 ) ] ^ { \ast } 1 0 0$ .

Manufactures predetermined acceptance criteria were as follows:

For each donor on each BD FACSCanto™ II and each BD FACSCanto™ 4- 3-3 configuration instrument used in the study, the leucocyte carryover percentage shall be $\leq \pm 0 . 1 \%$ when the sample is loaded manually. · For each donor on each BD FACSCanto™ II and each BD FACSCanto™ 4- 3-3 configuration instrument used in the study, the leucocyte carryover percentage shall be $\leq \pm 0 . 5 \%$ , when the sample is automatically loaded.

Carryover from one specimen to another was demonstrated to be less than the predetermined acceptance limits. The BD FACSCanto™ 4-2-2 and 5-3- configurations and the BD FACSCanto ™ 4-3-3 configuration showed acceptable leucocyte carryover.
