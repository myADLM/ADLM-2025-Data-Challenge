# E. System Descriptions:

# 1. Device Description:

The Sysmex® XN-Series modules (XN-11, XN-21) are multi-parameter hematology analyzers intended to perform tests on whole blood samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ or $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulant and body fluids (pleural, peritoneal and synovial) collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ anticoagulant. Sysmex® XN-11 and XN-21 are part of the family of XN-Series devices (XN-10, XN-20 which were cleared under k112605) with technical modifications aimed to stabilize the HCT/MCV parameters to within $+ 8 \%$ after storage at room temperature $( 1 8 - 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 24 hours and at refrigerated temperature $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 48 hours. These modifications include software and hardware updates as well as reagent modifications, i.e. CELLSHEATH(C). Software and hardware modifications include the addition of a heating block and changes to the instrument tubing. The listed modifications only impact the RBC/PLT and HGB dilution step: RBC/PLT and HGB will be diluted with CELLSHEATH(C) reagent after prewarming past $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

The complete instrument consists of four principal units: (1) Two Main Units (XN-11, XN-21) which aspirate, dilute, mix, and analyze blood and body fluid samples; (2) Two Auto Sampler Units (SA-10 for a single module, or SA-20 for two modules) which supply samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information Processing Unit) which processes data from the Main Unit and provides the operator interface with the system; (4) Pneumatic Unit which supplies pressure and vacuum from the Main Unit. Operator interface with the IPU is accomplished with the use of a 22-key panel keyboard.

Three configurations for the XN-Series modules are provided:

a. XN-1000 comprised of: 1) XN-11 2) XN-21 3) SA-10 (Auto Sampler for single module)

b. XN-2000 comprised of:

1) Two XN-11 or XN-21 or combination   
2) SA-20 (Auto Sampler for two modules)

c. XN-9000 comprised of:

1) One to nine XN-11 or XN-21 or combination of both modules   
2) One to nine conveyors (CV), one for each XN module or Slide Preparation   
Unit (SP)   
3) SP-10 (Slide Preparation Unit)   
4) BT-40 (Barcode Terminal)

2. Principles of Operation:

The XN-Series analyzers perform analysis using the following methods: Sheath Flow DC Detection Method, and Flow Cytometry Methods using a Semiconductor Laser and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)-hemoglobin. Cells pass through the aperture of the detector surrounded by sheath fluid using the sheath flow method. The principle of flow cytometry is also used. A semiconductor laser beam is emitted to the cells passing through the flow cell. The forward scattered light is received by the photodiode; the lateral scattered light and lateral fluorescent light are received by the photo multiplier tube. This light is converted into electrical pulses, thus making it possible to obtain cell information. Particle characterization and identification is based on detection of forward scatter, fluorescence and adaptive cluster analysis. The system carries out all processes automatically from aspiration of the sample to outputting results and uses Microsoft Windows Operating System.

The body fluid analysis mode of the XN-Series analyzers uses the 4 part differential scattergram and the RBC distribution obtained from a specialized analysis sequence to calculate and display the WBC (WBC-BF) counts, mononuclear cell (MN) / polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) counts and percentages, TC-BF (Total Count) & RBC (RBC-BF) counts found in the body fluid.

Analysis results and graphics are displayed on the IPU screen. They can be printed on any of the available printers or transmitted to a host computer.

3. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes _x _ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes or No _x

4. Specimen Identification:

Specimen identification input is manual (by operator) or by barcode reader.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

There are two modes of sample introduction: (1) Sampler Mode; (2) Manual Mode. Each analysis mode uses the same single fluidic and aspiration pathway.

In the Sampler Analysis Mode the operator loads the sample tubes into a rack, which is then automatically transported and analyzed by the instrument. This mode automatically mixes, aspirates, and analyzes samples without removing their caps.

In the Manual Analysis Mode, there are two sample tube holders: (1) Normal sample tube holder; (2) Micro collection tube holder. In this mode the operator loads and mixes the samples tubes individually by hand.

In the Normal Sample Tube Holder position, whole blood and body fluid samples can be analyzed with cap on or cap off.   
The Micro Collection Tube Holder position is used for analyzing a minute amount of whole blood or whole blood after diluting the sample to 1:7 that has been collected in a micro collection tube. Samples are analyzed with cap off in this position.   
Low WBC Count (LWBC) Mode is used for retesting whole blood samples with low white blood cell counts based on user defined rules criteria. The counting time is set to 3 times that of the Whole Blood mode to increase white blood cell measurement accuracy at very low counts.

# 6. Calibration:

The XN CALTM calibrator (k141962) is used for calibration of the instrument for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT and RET. XN CAL PF TM (k141955) is used for calibration of the instrument for PLT-F (platelet count obtained from the PLT-F channel). Calibration is performed as needed (e.g., when QC data is fluctuating) to ensure accuracy of the system.

7. Quality Control:

The XN CHECKTM (k141964) whole blood quality control material (three levels) and the XN BF CHECKTM (k141957) body fluid quality control material (two levels) are used to monitor the performance of the XN-Series analyzers. Quality control should be run according to licensing agency regulations.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Method comparison:

Whole Blood   
Method comparison studies were performed to access the performance of the XNSeries (XN-11, XN-21) analyzers when compared to the XE-5000 (predicate device). The XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers are the same as the XN-Series (XN-10, XN-20) analyzers (k112605) with modifications to stabilize the HCT/MCV parameter to within $+ 8 \%$ at room temperature $( 1 8 ^ { \circ } { - } 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 24 hours and at refrigerated   
temperature $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 48 hours for commercial and reference laboratories. The changes only impact the RBC/PLT and HGB dilution step. The WBC (WNR, WDF, WPC), RET and PLT-F measuring channels do not use the CELLSHEATH(C) reagent and therefore are not impacted. Method Comparison studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the RBC, HGB, HCT/MCV and PLT-I parameters on the XN-11 and XN-21 Series analyzers when compared to the XE-5000. The method comparison studies consisted of a total of 299 residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples collected by three (3) U.S. sites. All samples were run in the Automated Sampling Mode in singlet on the XE-5000 and within two hours on the XN-11 and XN-21 Series analyzers. Samples covered clinical medical decision levels and of the full reportable measuring ranges of the XN-11 and XN-21 Series analyzers. The results of the linear regression and bias analyses between the XE-5000 and the XN-11, XN-21 Series Whole Blood Mode met the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters. An example of the results between XN-11 and XE-5000 is shown below and   
comparable results were obtained with the XN-21.

# Body Fluid

Method Comparison studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the Body Fluid Mode RBC-BF parameter of the XN-Series (XN-11, XN21) when compared to the XE-5000 using a total of 299 residual body fluid samples at three U.S sites. The body fluids (peritoneal, pleural, and synovial) were collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulant. All samples were run in singlet on the XE-5000 and within two hours on the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers. The samples used in this study covered the full reportable measuring ranges to the extent possible of the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers. The estimation of the bias of the body fluids collected met the bias limits. Shown below are comparison results for XN-11. Similar results were obtained for XN-21.

# Flagging capabilities

Clinical sensitivity/specificity studies were conducted to evaluate the flagging capabilities of the XN-11, XN-21 analyzers using patient samples representing a variety of abnormal conditions in comparison to the XE-5000. The results of the XN11, XN-21 analyzers flagging to the XE-5000 flagging evaluation were divided into two categories: (1) Normal, healthy adults – No Flags, Negative Judgment (2) Patients with positive morphology/Differential – Flags present, Positive Judgment. The results obtained from the flagging comparison study met the specification of $2 9 0 . 0 \%$ Agreement. Note: XN-11, XN-21 Site 2, eight (8) samples were removed due to protocol deviation and three (3) for incomplete results. XN-11, XN-21 Site 3, 14 samples were removed due to protocol deviation and one (1) for incomplete results. Total number of samples excluded or missing $= 2 6$ .

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision/Repeatability Study – Whole Blood Mode

Within-run precision studies of the direct measurement parameters RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT-I which use CELLSHEATH(C) diluent were evaluated by using residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples around medical decision levels and the upper and lower limit of the analytical measuring range. Ten replicates of each sample were tested in the whole blood manual mode at three clinical sites. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample. All sites met manufacturer’s specifications $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ for precision.

# Precision/Reproducibility – Whole Blood Mode

Evaluation of whole blood reproducibility for RBC, HGB, HCT/MCV and PLT-I parameters which use the CELLSHEATH(C) reagent was assessed using three levels of quality control material (Low, Normal, and High) performed on the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers. Each level was run in duplicate twice each day for the length of the study or a minimum of 20 days using a single lot of control, calibration and reagent at each of the three test sites. Controls were automatically mixed by the analyzers before sampling. Results of the whole blood reproducibility included the precision results for each site separately and then combined data to show the within-run, between-run, between-day, between-site and total imprecision. Both XN-11 and XN-21 have similar results and met the acceptance criteria. Table below summarizes results from XN-11.

# Precision/Repeatability – Body Fluid

Repeatability (within-run precision) studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the RBC-BF parameter when diluted with CELLSHEATH(C) reagent. The studies were conducted on the XN-11, XN-21 analyzers Body Fluid Mode at three clinical sites using two high and two low residual body fluid samples for pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids around the upper and lower limit of the analytical measuring range. Pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids were collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulant. Each sample was run 10 consecutive times at each clinical site. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample included in the study. Results of the Precision/Repeatability met the performance specifications $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ for the XN-Series analyzers.

# Precision/Reproducibility – Body Fluid

Evaluation of body fluid reproducibility for the RBC-BF parameter which uses the CELLSHEATH(C) reagent was performed on the XN-11 and XN-21 Body Fluid Mode using two levels of quality control material (Low, and High). Each level was run in duplicate twice each day for the duration of the study or a minimum of 20 days at each of three test sites using a single control, calibration and reagent lot. All other body fluid parameters were analyzed only to show that modifications made to create the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers does not affect the performance of all other reportable parameters. All results met the acceptance criteria for both XN-11 and XN21. Results of XN-11 are shown below.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

a. Specimen Stability Studies:

# Stability – Whole Blood

Whole blood stability was evaluated at one clinical site using a total of 30 (10 normal and 20 abnormal MCV) residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples on the XN-11. Twenty samples (10 normal and 10 abnormal MCV) were tested on the XN-21 due to insufficient sample volume. Two sets of samples were collected from each donor (room temperature and refrigerated). The samples were run in singlet on the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers. Each sample was tested within 2 hours on all methods at baseline or zero (0) time, 8 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours and 56 hours at room temperature (RT) $( 1 8 - 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and refrigerated temperature (LT) $\left( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ . The mean percent difference was recorded for each sample. Stability for HCT/MCV on the XN-11 and XN-21 met bias percent limits at 24 and 48 hours.

# Short Term Stability– Body Fluid

Body fluid short term stability for RBC-BF parameter which uses CELLSHEATH(C) diluent was evaluated using two (2) residual Pleural, Peritoneal and Synovial fluids at Site 3. Pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids were collected in $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ anticoagulant and run in singlet in the Body Fluid Mode. Each sample was carefully mixed by gentle hand inversion at least 10 times before analyzing on the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers and tested at baseline (zero (0) time), 1 hour, 4 hours and 6 hours at room temperature (20- $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The results of the body fluid short term stability study met the acceptance bias percent limits.

b. Anticoagulant Comparison Study - K₂EDTA vs. K₃EDTA whole blood:

Anticoagulant comparison studies were performed to demonstrate comparability between $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples for the RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV and PLT-I parameters using the XN-Series analyzers. A total of 30 paired whole blood samples $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ , $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ ) drawn from healthy subjects were used for this study. The samples were run in singlet on the XN-11 and the results of the $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ samples were compared to the corresponding results of the $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ sample for the same donor. The results of the linear regression analysis and bias between the $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood met the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters. This study was conducted on the XN-11 module since the data output from both the XN-11 and XN-21 is considered equal.

c. Bridging Study- Comparison of venous whole blood samples to capillary

whole blood:

A small comparison study was performed to demonstrate comparability between venous whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples using the XN-21 analyzer. A total of 20 paired whole blood venous samples and capillary samples $( \mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A } )$ ) drawn from healthy subjects were used for this study. The samples were run in singlet on the XN-21 and the results of the venous whole blood sample results were compared to the corresponding results of the capillary sample for the same donor. Testing was performed in the Whole Blood Manual Analysis Mode. The venous whole blood samples were placed in the Normal Tube Position of the Manual Mode and the capillary samples were placed in the Micro-collection Tube Position of the Manual Mode for analysis. Of the 20 samples tested, less than 10 samples contained NRBCs which is an insufficient number for correlation coefficient value. The results of the linear regression analysis and bias between venous whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples on the XN-21 analyzer met the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters.

d. Bridging Study- Comparison of $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ tubes and micro-collection tubes:

Sixty three residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples with analyte concentrations representative of normal patient samples and patient samples across clinical medical decision levels were used to determine the presence or absence of matrix effect between $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ normal tubes and micro collection tubes on the XN-11 analyzer. $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples were first analyzed in singlet in the Manual Mode Normal Tube Position and within two hours of analysis the samples were transferred to micro-collection tubes (without additive) and analyzed in the Manual Mode Micro-collection Tube Position. The results of the linear regression analysis and bias between the $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ tube and micro-collection tubes on the XN-11 analyzers met the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters.

e. Bridging Study- Pre-dilute Mode Normal Tube to Micro Tube Position Comparison:

Twenty (20) residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ (4mL tubes) patient whole blood samples were used to determine the equivalency between the Pre-dilute Mode Normal Tube Position and the Pre-dilute Mode Micro-collection tube position. Pre-dilute (1:7) samples were prepared for each of the 20 samples by dispensing $4 2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the analyzers diluent into plain top tubes (4mL tubes) then adding $7 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of whole blood and mixing 10 times by gentle inversion. The plain top 4mL tubes were analyzed in singlet on the XN-21 analyzer within 1 hour of dilution preparation in the Pre-dilute Mode normal tube position. Immediately following, the samples were mixed 10 times then transferred to microcollection tubes (without additive) and analyzed in the Pre-dilute Mode Micro-collection tube position (Cap Off). The pre-dilute mode automatically multiplies sample results by 7 before results are displayed therefore no additional calculation is required. The results of the linear regression analysis and bias between the Pre-dilute Mode normal tube and Pre-dilute mode microcollection tube on the XN-21 analyzer met the acceptance criteria in the Predilute Mode for all applicable parameters.

f. Bridging Study- Low WBC Mode Normal Tube to Micro Tube Position Comparison:

Forty (40) residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulated whole blood patient samples were selected to determine the equivalency between the Low WBC Mode normal tube position and the Low WBC Mode micro-collection tube position. The patients original $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ tube was mixed by gentle hand inversion 10 times and run in singlet in the Low WBC Mode Normal Tube Position on the XN21 analyzer. The samples were then transferred to micro-collection tubes (without additive), mixed 8-10 times before running in the Low WBC Mode Micro-collection Tube Position (Cap Off) on the XN-21 analyzer within 1 hour of analysis of the Low WBC Mode Normal Tube Position. The results of the linear regression analysis and bias between the Low WBC Mode normal tube position and Low WBC Mode micro-collection tube position met the acceptance criteria for the Low WBC Mode for all applicable parameters.

g. Determination of limit of blank, lower limits of detection and quantitation:

# Verification of Limit of Blank (LoB)

Verification of the Limit of Blank (LoB) was obtained from 40 repeated measurements of one blank sample (CELLPACK) on the XN-11 module. Testing was performed by one operator in the appropriate sampling mode for whole blood and body fluid mode for body fluids. The Mean, SD and Limit of Blank were calculated for the RBC, HCT, HGB, PLT-I, and RBC-BF parameters. The estimated LoB equals the $9 5 \mathrm { t h }$ percentile of the distribution of blank values. The LoB for both the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers for whole blood parameters RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT-I and the body fluid RBC-BF is zero (0) ${ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L } }$ .

# Verification of the Limit of Detection (LoD)

Verification of the Limit of Detection was obtained from 40 repeated measurements of two low concentration samples over a two day period (1 sample each day) on the XN-11 module. Two whole blood $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ samples and two body fluid samples (pleural and peritoneal) were diluted using instrument diluent to achieve low cell concentrations with target values of $0 . 0 2 \dot { - } 0 . 0 6 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ for RBC (HGB,HCT), $1 - 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ for PLT-I and $0 . 0 0 3 - 0 . 0 0 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ for RBC-BF parameters. Testing was performed by one operator in the appropriate sampling mode for whole blood and body fluid mode for body fluids. The mean, SD and LoD were calculated for the RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT-I and RBC-BF parameters.

# Verification of the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

Verification of the Limit of Quantitation was obtained by using the test results from the LoD study to determine the bias and imprecision for that level of analyte. Forty replicate measurements (one sample) of the lowest measured concentration for each analyte were performed on the XN-11 module to verify precision at the low end of the analytical measuring range. The mean, SD and

2SD were calculated for the RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT-I and RBC-BF parameters to verify precision at the lower end of the measuring range for each parameter.

The results of the LoB, LoD and LoQ meet the manufacturer’s expected performance for background limits and the lower limit of the measuring range for RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT-I.

# h. SP-10 automated slide stainer

i. Verification of Method Comparison Using Whole Blood with the addition of the SP-10 automated slide stainer:

Verification of comparability of whole blood on the XN-Series analyzer when connected to the SP-10 automated slide preparation and staining unit were performed by comparing the data from a configuration consisting of two (2) XN-11 analyzers connected to one another and a SP-10 unit was compared with data from a standalone XN-21 analyzer (not connected to a SP-10). Samples included normal healthy donors and abnormal samples with a variety of hematological conditions and spanned the analytical measuring range. Samples were analyzed first on the standalone XN-21 analyzer in the Whole Blood Sampling Mode. Within 2 hours of analysis on the standalone XN-21 analyzer, whole blood samples were analyzed on the XN-11 analyzer that is connected to the SP-10 unit. The XN-11/XN-21 analyzers performed within the manufacturer’s specifications when connected to the SP-10.

ii. Verification of XN-Series Body Fluid Performance when connected to the SP-10 automated stainer:

A small method comparison study was performed to verify performance claims for the XN-11 and XN-21 analyzers are met when connected to each other and a SP-10 unit. Samples used in this study covered the full reportable measuring ranges to the extent possible of the XN-Series analyzers. All samples were collected in $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ anticoagulant. Sample concentrations and dilutions were also used when native samples representing the full reportable range of WBC-BF and RBC-BF parameters were not available. Data from a configuration consisting of two XN-11 analyzers connected to one another and a SP-10 unit was compared with data from a standalone XN-21 analyzer (not connected to a SP-10). The XN-11/XN-21 analyzers performed within the manufacturer’s specifications when connected to the SP-10.

iii. Determination of Limit of Blank (LoB), Lower Limits of Detection (LoD) and Quantitation (LoQ) when connected to the SP-10:

Verification of Limit of Blank (LoB)

Verification of the Limit of Blank (LoB) was obtained from 40 repeated measurements of one blank sample (CELLPACK) on the XN-11 module. Testing was performed by one operator in the appropriate sampling mode for whole blood. The mean, SD and LoB were calculated for the RBC, HCT, HGB and PLT-I parameters.

Verification of the Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The manufacturer’s lower bound analytical range for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT parameters were selected as target values to verify the LoD and LoQ for these parameters. Forty replicate measurements (one sample) of the lowest measured concentration for each analyte were performed in the whole blood mode on the XN-11 module to verify precision at the low end of the analytical measuring range. The mean, SD and 2SD were calculated for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT to verify precision at the lower end of the measuring range for each parameter.

The results of the whole blood LoB, LoD and LoQ for the XN-11 module met the manufacturer’s performance claims for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT parameters.

# iv. SP-10 Functionality - Slides for Positive Specimens

The ability of the SP-10 when connected to two XN-Series analyzers to appropriately read sample barcode identification labels, receive sample judgment results (Negative/Positive) and generate blood smears was conducted using 50 de-identified residual whole blood samples. Sample flagging (Negative/Positive) results generated from the XN-Series analyzers were compared to the number of slides produced by the SP-10 (produced for positive/abnormal samples) and slides not produced by the SP-10 (not produced for negative/normal samples). Slides were divided into two categories: (1) P - slide was made for a Positive sample, and (2) N - no slide was made for a Negative sample. Slides for positive Specimens Analysis results met pre-defined acceptance criteria of the number of samples flagged as Positive (abnormal) and the number of slides produced from the SP-10 will have an Overall Agreement of $2 9 0 \%$ The SP-10 will not produce slides from samples flagged as Negative (normal) by the XN analyzers.

i. Reference Intervals:

# Verification of Adult Reference Intervals

Adult Reference intervals (normal population reference ranges) were assessed for the XN-11 and XN- 21 series analyzers by comparing normal $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulated samples collected from normal male and female donors ${ > } 2 1$ years of age. Pre-established reference intervals from the XE-5000 predicate device were used as a default normal range flag. The study results showed that less than 10 percent of samples tested were outside the proposed reference intervals.

Due to the unavailability of obtaining normal body fluid samples, it is difficult for laboratories to establish reference intervals; therefore, Sysmex

recommends that laboratories reference textbook values for their body fluid reference intervals.

Sysmex recommends that each laboratory establishes its own expected reference intervals based upon the laboratory’s patient population encountered during daily operation. Expected reference intervals may vary due to the differences in sex, age, diet, fluid intake, geographic location.
