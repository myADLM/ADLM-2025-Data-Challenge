Dear Mr. Dennis:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of April 10, 2015.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809] ); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part Parts 801 and 809] ), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, sMisbranding by reference to premarket notifications (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

# Device Description

The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometry System is composed of the following components:

 AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer   
 AQUIOS System Software   
 AQUIOS Tetra-1 Panel CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5   
 AQUIOS Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ Panel CD45-FITC/(CD56+CD16)-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5   
 AQUIOS Immuno-Trol Cells   
 AQUIOS Immuno-Trol Low Cells AQUIOS Lysing Reagent Kit

The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer uses flow cytometric principles to determine qualitative and quantitative measurements of biological and physical properties of cells and other particles. These properties are measured when the cells pass through the laser beam(s) in single file.

The AQUIOS System Software is designed for the AQUIOS CL flow cytometer. It includes the algorithms and test definitions that provide automated analysis and results for AQUIOS Tetra-1 and $^ { 2 + }$ reagents; this application cannot be modified by the user.

The AQUIOS Flow Cytometry System also offers an optional standalone offline workstation. This workstation is identical to the workstation that is physically connected to the instrument and can be used for off-line analysis of results generated by the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer with AQUIOS Tetra-1 and Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ reagents and AQUIOS System software according to the product labeling.

AQUIOS Tetra-1 Panel CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5 reagent provides identification and enumeration of $\mathrm { C D 4 5 ^ { + } } .$ , $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ Low SS, and $\mathrm { C D 3 + / C D 4 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + / C D 8 + }$ , and $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts in peripheral whole blood. AQUIOS Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ Panel CD45-FITC/(CD56+CD16)-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5 provides identification and enumeration of $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ , $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ Low SS, and $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ , CD3- $/ { \mathrm { C D } } 1 9 +$ and $\mathrm { C D 3 - } / \mathrm { C D 5 6 + C D 1 } 6 +$ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts in peripheral whole blood. Additionally, both panels provide for $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ absolute count and $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ Low SS absolute count and percentage.

AQUIOS Immuno-Trol and Immuno-Trol Low Cells are assayed, lysable whole blood quality control product for immunophenotyping analysis using monoclonal antibody reagents and flow cytometry. It provides a positive cell control that is processed in the same manner as a whole blood sample. This allows verification of instrument and reagent performance. It also verifies the methods used for staining targeted cells, lysing erythrocytes, and analyzing samples by the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer.

The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer uses on-board sample preparation as part of the overall system workflow. The AQUIOS Lysing Reagent Kit is comprised of two readyto-use reagents: Reagent A lyses the red blood cells, Reagent B quenches the solution, slowing the lyse reaction down in preparation for analysis. This reagent system provides a rapid, no-wash, standardized, whole blood lysing solution for sample to sample, and laboratory to laboratory reproducibility.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusion to Demonstrate Safety, Effectiveness & Equivalent Performance to Predicate:

The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometry System, that is the subject of this submission, in concert with the conclusions drawn from the performance testing discussed above demonstrate that when compared to the predicate device is as safe, as effective, and meets the performance acceptance criteria.

In summary, the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometry System as described in this submission is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to its predicate devices.

The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer and AQUIOS Tetra-1 and Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ reagents are substantially equivalent to the FACSCalibur CaliBRITE 4 kit and FACSComp Software as well as the UniCel DxH 800, where applicable. The AQUIOS Immuno-Trol and Immuno-Trol Low are substantially equivalent to Immuno-Trol Cells and Immuno-Trol Low Cells.

This summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 and the implementing regulation 21 CFR 807.92.
