# L. Test Principle:

Immunofluorescence (and electronic volume sensing) assay for identification and enumeration of monoclonal antibody labeled leukocytes. Labeled cells in suspension are passed single file through a laser beam and the resultant scattered and fluoresced light is separated with dichroic filters and quantified with photomultiplier tubes to determine the proportion and number of cells bearing the labeled antibodies. Volumetric metering of the sample permits single platform determination of absolute cell count.

The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer is a flow cytometer that has detectors for 4-color analysis. In addition to detection of fluorescence parameters, the system also has the ability to detect relative cell diameter using Forward Scatter (FS), relative cell granularity using Side Scatter (SS), and relative electronic volume (EV) using the Coulter Principle. The AQUIOS CL uses flow cytometric principles to determine qualitative and quantitative measurements of biological and physical properties of cells and other particles. These properties are measured when the cells pass through the laser beam(s) in single file. The AQUIOS System Software is designed for the AQUIOS CL flow cytometer. It includes the algorithms and test definitions that provide automated analysis and results for AQUIOS Tetra-1 and $^ { 2 + }$ reagents; this application cannot be modified by the user.

The AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer uses on-board sample preparation as part of the overall system workflow. The AQUIOS Lysing Reagent Kit is comprised of two ready to-use reagents: Reagent A lyses the red blood cells, Reagent B quenches the solution, slowing the lyse reaction down in preparation for analysis.

The AQUIOS Flow Cytometry System also offers an optional standalone offline workstation. This workstation is identical to the workstation that is physically connected to the instrument and can be used for off-line analysis of results generated by the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer with AQUIOS Tetra-1 and Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ reagents and AQUIOS System software according to the product labeling. Samples are aliquotted, stained, incubated and lysed onboard using a single-use reagent cassette. AQUIOS Tetra-1 Panel CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5 reagent provides identification and enumeration of $\mathrm { C D 3 + / C D 4 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + / C D 8 + }$ , and $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts in peripheral whole blood. AQUIOS Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ Panel CD45-FITC/ $( \mathrm { C D } 5 6 \mathrm { + C D } 1 6 $ )-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5 provides identification and enumeration of $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ , $_ \mathrm { C D 3 - / C D 1 9 + }$ and CD3- $/ \mathrm { C D } 5 6 +$ and/or $\mathrm { C D } 1 6 +$ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts in peripheral whole blood.

AQUIOS Immuno-Trol and Immuno-Trol Low Cells are assayed, lysable whole blood quality control product for immunophenotyping analysis using monoclonal antibody reagents and flow cytometry. They provide a positive cell control that is processed in the same manner as a whole blood sample. This allows verification of instrument and reagent performance. It also verifies the methods used for staining targeted cells, lysing erythrocytes, and analyzing samples by the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Assay Repeatability and Reproducibility Using Control Material

Assay reproducibility was assessed using two levels of control material [AQUIOS ImmunoTrol Cells (IT), and AQUIOS Immuno-Trol Low Cells (ITL)]. Lot variability of AQUIOS Tetra and AQUIOS Lyse was incorporated and assessed as part of the overall variability of the study design.

Three lots each of Tetra-1 reagent, Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ reagent, and Lyse were tested. Each control level was run in duplicate twice each day (morning and afternoon) for a minimum of 20 days. A new vial of control material was opened each day of testing. The test was executed on three AQUIOS CL flow cytometers, with one at each of the three test sites. Less than $1 \%$ of results failed the quality parameters. As instructed in the label, they were excluded from the analysis; in laboratory practice these samples would not be resulted and, as instructed in the labeling, would be re-run on the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer.

At all levels of control material tested, all markers met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria for repeatability and reproducibility (between runs, between days, between sites, and total).

# Assay Repeatability using Whole Blood:

The study included 82 whole blood specimens covering the $\mathrm { C D 3 + / C D 4 + }$ measuring range with emphasis on the medical decision points. The whole blood specimens were prepared in replicates of five with AQUIOS Tetra reagents (AQUIOS Tetra-1 and AQUIOS Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ ) run as a Tetra Combo panel. The test was executed on four AQUIOS CL flow cytometers at four test sites. Data were analyzed and presented to demonstrate the degree of imprecision across the measuring range (data not depicted) and were further summarized to illustrate the imprecision by percentile of results. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for repeatability are the same as listed for reproducibility, above. The results of the repeatability study using whole blood samples are listed in the following table:

Results of the lot-to-lot reproducibility study met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and demonstrated acceptable reproducibility.

# Laser stability:

Both short-term laser performance (e.g. within-day stability; measured signals at $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , 3 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, $2 4 \mathrm { h r }$ ) and long-term laser performance (e.g. between-day stability; measured signals at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours for a period of five (5) days) were conducted on two AQUIOS CL instruments. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria of mean channel of the integral signal intensity does not vary more than $\pm 1 0 \%$ from the average signal channel number obtained over a period of 24 hours for short-term laser performance, and five days for long-term laser performance and the HPCV of the integral signals is $\leq 3 . 0 \%$ was met for each of the instruments tested.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity of fluorescence signals:

Instrument photomultiplier tube linearity was assessed in triplicate with SPHEROTM Rainbow Calibration Particles (RCPs, Spherotech, Chicago, IL). The study was conducted on three (3) AQUIOS CL flow cytometers at Beckman Coulter, Miami, Florida. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $\dot { \mathrm { R } } ^ { 2 } { > } 0 . 9 0 0$ for FL1, FL2, FL3, and FL4 was met for all instruments tested.

# Assay linearity:

White blood cell pools were mixed with red blood cells to create specimens having concentrations of lymphocytes that spanned the measuring range. Each of the concentrations was prepared and analyzed in triplicate on three AQUIOS CL flow cytometers as a Tetra Combo panel with AQUIOS Tetra-1 and AQUIOS Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ reagents. Linearity of all reported analytes was determined on 3 separate instruments using the method described in CLSI EP06-A2, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures. Linearity was evaluated by fitting linear and non-linear (quadratic and cubic) models and assessing that the deviations from linearity (difference between the non-linear and linear fits) were within the acceptance criteria. Deviations from linearity were calculated for the markers that were not statistically linear and were compared to the linearity acceptance limits. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were:

$\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \geq 0 . 9 5 ;$   
For result values in the range 0-300, the acceptable bias is $\pm 3 0$ cells $\mu \mathrm { L }$   
For result values ${ > } 3 0 0$ , the acceptable bias $1 \mathrm { s } \pm 1 0 \%$

Using these criteria, the linear range was determined for each phenotypic subset and the results are listed in the following table:

# Fresh and Prepared Sample Stability:

Samples are automatically processed and run from within 0 to 3 minutes following staining and lysing. Specimens whose analyses are delayed beyond three minutes are flagged for rejection and reprocessing. Specimens are typically run at Time 0, however, analyses that fail are reaquired, providing the acquisition can occur within the 3 minute time frame.

In order to demonstrate sample stability, 73 specimens, including normal and clinical $\mathrm { ( H I V ^ { + } ) }$ donors, spanning the analytical measuring range (AMR, $\mathrm { C D 3 + / C D 4 + }$ : 35-3000 $\operatorname { c e l l } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$ were included in a stability study to compare performance on specimen processed within 8 hours of draw and analyzed at Time 0 following processing to specimens processed at 24 hours and analyzed 3 minutes post processing.

The study results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and supports controlled room temperature ( $1 8 \mathrm { - } 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ stability of 24 hours specimen stability and up to three minutes of prepared sample stability for the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometry System.

# d. Detection limit:

This study established the Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation values for each AQUIOS Tetra marker when tested on the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometry System. Studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP17. The study design incorporated five (5) repetitions of each of the three (3) prepared blank samples which were collected each day over four (4) days yielding a total of 60 data collection points per measuring system. A total of 180 data points were collected for the entire study with three (3) measuring systems. The study incorporated two (2) lots of each AQUIOS Tetra reagent (Tetra-1, Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ ), one lot of AQUIOS Lysing Reagents, three (3) Blank samples (prepared with one (1) lot of Red Cell Pool and three (3) lots of Immuno-Trol Storage Buffer and three (3) AQUIOS CL flow cytometers. The Limit of Blank was established for each marker as the upper $9 5 \%$ of the data as recommended in the EP17-A2 Guideline.

Carryover

A carryover study was performed on three (3) AQUIOS CL flow cytometers according to the methodology presented in CLSI Document: H26-A2, Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology Analyzers; Approved Standard – Second Edition using SPHEROTM AccuCount Ultra-Rainbow Fluorescent Particles. The study measured carryover on each of 3 instruments and in each case was found to be $< 0 . 3 \%$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: In accordance with CLSI EP09-A3, a prospective study was conducted at four sites comparing the accuracy of the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometry System to the BD FACSCalibur with specimens targeting the medically important ranges for CD4. Evaluation included the use of multiple lots of AQUIOS reagents (AQUIOS Tetra-1, Tetra- $^ { 2 + }$ , and Lyse A/B) across the clinical sites. A total of 443 samples that covered the CD4 analytical measuring range, with an emphasis on the medical decision points, were tested on the test system (AQUIOS CL) and the predicate systems: FACSCalibur for assessment of T cell, B cell and NK cell phenotypes, and Beckman Coulter UniCel $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ for assessment of $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ and CD45+Low SS. Donor specimens were comprised of $78 \%$ clinical specimens and $22 \%$ normal specimens. Clinical specimens included specimens submitted for assessments associated with HIV infection, transplant, immunosuppressive therapy (plus other conditions), while the normal specimens consisted of specimens from healthy controls and clinic specimens that were demonstrated to be hematologically normal. SAS 9.3 statistical software was used for data analysis.

Bias for percent positives comparisons was clinically insignificant. A negative bias for the comparison of AQUIOS to the BD FACSCalibur was observed in the absolute count data for all four (4) sites combined. This negative trend was observed for all markers, with smaller differences observed for $\mathrm { C D 3 + / C D 4 + }$ . This bias was clinically insignificant at the medical decision points for $\mathrm { C D 3 + / C D 4 + }$ (e.g., ${ < } 1 ~ \mathsf { c e l l / \mu L }$ bias at $2 0 0 \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ and $< 2$ cells $\mu \mathrm { L }$ bias at $5 0 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). The bias observed for all CD markers was within the sponsor’s acceptance limits.

$\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ Low SS percentage comparisons had clinically insignificant to no bias. A negative bias was observed in the comparison of $\mathrm { C D 4 5 + }$ and $\mathrm { C D 4 5 + }$ Low SS absolute counts obtained from AQUIOS vs. the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ from all four (4) sites combined. The bias observed for all parameters was within the sponsor’s acceptance limits.

In addition, bias was calculated at the medical decision points for $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ cells and the results for the combined sites for AQUIOS Tetra-1 Panel CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8- ECD/CD3-PC5 can be found in the following table:
