# L. Test Principle:

XN Cal™ PF was designed to function as a substitute for fresh whole blood to calibrate the Sysmex XN Series (XN-10, XN-11, XN-20, XN-21) instruments. XN CAL™ PF is an invitro diagnostic device used by a component human observer to adjust calibration of the PLT-F $( \bar { 1 } 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$ measurand on the Sysmex XN Series analyzers (XN-10, XN-11, XN-20, XN-21).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision performance studies were conducted at two sites (Streck and Sysmex America). Each site performed 10 consecutive runs on each analyzer with separate vials of control from three specified lots at the beginning and end of the product dating claim. Control materials were shipped, stored, mixed, and handled in accordance with the instructions for use. The acceptance criteria were based on a compilation of the $C V \%$ for PLT-F. Results collected across the three manufactured lots of XN CAL™ PF demonstrate consistent recovery across the XN-11 and XN-21 instruments at both sites within the parameter specific assay assignment range as demonstrated in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i. Value Assignment:

Value assignment for XN CAL™ PF was based on data collected across three (3) XN-21 analyzers (one internal Streck and two external Sysmex). Data was collected using three separately manufactured lots (3287, 3315, and 3343) and three primary operators. A 10-run reproducibility study was executed for the calibrator at the beginning and end of the stated product dating $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 6 0 )$ ). The acceptance criterion takes into account inter-operator, inter-laboratory, and inter-instrument variability.

ii. Open-Vial Stability:

The 4-hour open-vial stability claim was substantiated by performing duplicate runs over 2-consecutive days at the end of the 49-day end date utilizing: two (2) vials each of three separately manufactured lots (3287, 3315, and 3343), one primary operator, and one XN-21 analyzer at the internal Streck site. Each vial of calibrator was stored in accordance with the instructions for use between $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The calculated $C V \%$ values were within the guidelines indicated in the table above M.1 (a).

iii. Closed-Vial Stability:

The 49-day closed-vial stability claim was substantiated by performing duplicate runs over 21 testing dates spanning the 49-day end date claim utilizing: two (2) vials each of three separately manufactured lots (3287, 3315, and 3343), one primary operator, and one XN-21 analyzer at the internal Streck site. Each vial of calibrator was stored in accordance with the instructions for use between $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2 to provide long-term within-device expected imprecision estimates. The calculated $C V \%$ values were within the guidelines indicated in the table above M.1 (a). The established acceptance criterion takes into account inter-operator, inter-laboratory, and inter-instrument variability.
