Trade name: Virtuoso™ System for IHC PR (1E2) using the VENTANA iScan HT

Common Name: IHC Digital pathology system for immunochemistry-stained slides

Classifications: 21 CFR $\$ 864.1860 –$ Immunohistochemistry reagents and kits

# 807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate devices

This VirtuosoTM System for IHC PR (1E2) using the VENTANA iScan HT is substantially equivalent to its immediate predecessors cleared under K111869 on March 5, 2012, and K122143 on September 19, 2013. The only difference between the two is the use of a new scanner. The new iScan HT scanner is a powerful, high throughput bright field scanner that Ventana Medical Systems has decided to offer as an alternative to the iScan Coreo, which is a low to medium volume instrument currently employed for use with the Virtuoso™ System for IHC PR (1E2). Both the new and the predicate devices are digital pathology system for the consistent assessment of pathology interpretations using immunohistochemically stained slides (in this case, stained for PR expression), and both systems include slide scanner hardware, and software that both automates the procedural steps and performs the analyses.

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The Virtuoso™ System is an instrument-plus-software system designed to assist the qualified pathologist in the consistent assessment of protein expression in immunohistochemically stained histologic sections from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded normal and neoplastic tissues. The system consists of a slide scanner, computer, monitor, keyboard, and mouse for specific immunohistochemical markers, and software with a Windows web browser-based user interface. Virtuoso is a web-based, end-to-end, digital pathology software solution that allows pathology laboratories to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report digital images of pathology specimens. Using the Virtuoso software, the pathologist can view digital images, add annotations and generate reports.

Hardware: The iScan HT scanning device captures digital images of formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage and viewing. The device includes a digital slide scanner, a carousel for loading glass slides, computer, scanner software, keyboard, mouse and monitor.

Software: The Virtuoso software is designed to complement the routine workflow of a qualified pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained histologic slides. The software makes no independent interpretations of the data and requires competent human intervention for all steps in the process. Complete software information, following FDA’s 2005 guidance document for software documentation required for regulatory submissions is being provided in Section 6 of this premarket notification.

# Additional Materials Required:

 Ventana CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody   
 Reagents for visualization, such as DAB chromogen   
 Associated materials for completing immunohistochemical staining according to the appropriate package insert; this submission includes slides stained using both the Benchmark XT and Benchmark ULTRA stainers.   
 Color printer if user wishes to print color copies

# Device Quality Control

The quality of results depends on the laboratory following the quality control instructions recommended in the labeling of the immunohistochemistry (IHC) reagents.

# Device Calibration:

The VENTANA iScan HT slide scanner is calibrated and verified at the manufacturing facility before shipment. Upon installation, calibrations are performed and verified by Roche Customer Support. No additional calibration or verification is required or performed by the end user. Annual preventive maintenance performed by Roche Customer Support is recommended to ensure that the VENTANA iScan HT slide scanner is operating as intended.

# Summary of Procedure

Samples are obtained as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Histologic sections are prepared and mounted onto glass slides. Slides are reacted with the PR (1E2) primary antibody and are then visualized using DAB. Prepared slides are loaded into the Virtuoso system scanner and scanned. The resulting digital images are reviewed by the pathologist on a computer monitor.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use

The VirtuosoTM system provides automated digital slide creation, management, analysis, and viewing. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the display, detection, counting, review and classification of tissues and cells of clinical interest based on particular morphology, color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.

The VirtuosoTM System for IHC PR (1E2) using the VENTANA iScan HT is for the digital read application. This particular Virtuoso system is intended for use as an aid to the pathologist in the qualitative detection of progesterone receptor (PR) protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. This device is an accessory to Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. CONFIRM™ antiProgesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay. The CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom endocrine treatment is being considered (but is not the sole basis for treatment).

Note: The IHC PR (1E2) Digital Read application is an adjunctive computerassisted methodology for the qualified pathologist in the acquisition and interpretation of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer specimens stained for the presence of PR protein. The accuracy of the test results depends on the quality of the immunohistochemical staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as specified in the instructions for the CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody used to assure the validity of the Virtuoso System for IHC PR Digital Read scores. The actual correlation of CONFIRM™ anti-PR antibody to clinical outcome has not been established. This device is intended for IHC slides stained on the BenchMark XT and BenchMark ULTRA stainers. For prescription use only.

# 807.92 (b)(1/2): Brief Description of Clinical Data (Non-clinical data N/A)

The VirtuosoTM System for IHC PR (1E2) using the VENTANA iScan HT was clinically validated via a method comparison (agreement/concordance) study and a precision and reproducibility study. The method comparison study evaluated overall system performance in terms of agreement between the reference manual method (with a traditional microscope) and the digital read (DR) application of the Virtuoso system. Two sets of statistical analyses were performed for the method comparison study: 1) Initial analysis: This analysis involved the primary endpoint analysis for each of the 3 pathologists participating in the study. The primary end points included the overall percent agreement (OPA), positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) between the Digital Read (DR) method and Manual Read (MR) method. 2) The additional analysis employed the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) analysis methodology for the primary endpoint analysis. This additional analysis was associated with model-based results, which enabled appropriate estimation within a repeated-measures design of the average reader performance using the comparator device. The GLMM analysis included all 3 pathologists’ data.

The reproducibility components of the studies involved the intrapathologist/inter-day reproducibility evaluation as well the inter-pathologist reproducibility of the DR Virtuoso application.

The Scanner precision study involved a subset of the clinical cases $[ \mathfrak { n } = 4 0$ , both stainers) that were scanned two more times, and also scanned three times with two different scanners at two separate locations. This study evaluated scanner precision for both inter-scanner precision and intra-scanner/inter-day precision.

The data from both method comparison and precision/reproducibility studies are summarized below.

# Method comparison (Agreement/Concordance)

Virtuoso Digital Read vs Manual Method

Each pathologist’s Virtuoso digital read results were compared to their manual results. The data were categorized as “neg” and “pos” using the PR score of 0 to $0 . 9 9 \%$ positive staining to describe negative, and $2 1 \%$ positive staining to describe positive. The overall percent agreements using negative and positive, as defined above, across the three sites were: $9 8 . 7 \%$ , $8 8 . 9 \%$ , and $9 6 . 2 \%$ , respectively. The overall, negative, and positive percent agreements, with the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown below.

# Scanner Precision

Forty (40) cases representing the useful categories of ${ < } 1 \%$ , $1 - 1 0 \%$ , and $10 \%$ positive staining for PR were scanned on three different scanners at three different sites to assess inter-scanner precision, and three FOVs were captured (t $\mathbf { o t a l } = 1 2 0 $ ) and evaluated. Similarly, these same 40 cases were scanned on three different days by the same scanner, and the same FOVs were applied to the appropriate cases to assess intra-scanner/inter day precision.

Pairwise comparisons were performed between each of the three sites (interscanner), and between each of the three days (sessions, intra-scanner). The precision tables are found below.
