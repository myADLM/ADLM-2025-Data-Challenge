# I. Device Description:

OC-Light S FIT is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic device designed for the immunochemical detection of human hemoglobin (hHb) in stool specimens.

1. Components of OC-Light S FIT: OC-Light S FIT consists of a test strip and a sampling bottle.

a. OC-Light S FIT test strip consists of a nitrocellulose membrane with immobilized mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to human hemoglobin at the test region and immobilized rabbit anti-mouse antibodies at the control region, a sample pad, a conjugate pad which contains human hemoglobin specific mouse monoclonal antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold, an absorption pad, and a plastic backing.

b. OC-Light S FIT sampling bottle is a plastic bottle for collecting fecal sample. It contains $2 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of extraction buffer. The sampling bottle is specially designed for:

i. Proper sampling of feces: Sample probe is attached to the top bottle cap. The sample probe insertion slot is designed to rub off excess amount of stool before it reaches the area with extraction buffer, enabling only stool caught in the grooved portion (approximately $1 0 \mathrm { m g }$ ) of the sample probe to be mixed with the buffer solution.

ii. Thorough mixing of fecal sample with extraction buffer: Sample probe itself acts as a stopper, preventing excess amount of collected stool from entering into the extraction buffer area and buffer solution from leaking outside.

# L. Test Principle:

OC-Light S FIT is a qualitative test designed for the immunochemical detection of human hemoglobin (hHb) in stool specimens. When the sample end of test strip is dipped in the fecal extract, the liquid fecal extract wicks through a series of absorbent materials and contacts colloidal gold conjugated with monoclonal antibodies specific to hHb. If hHb is present in the sample, it reacts with the antibodies on the colloidal gold. When the gold conjugate with hHb reaches the test region of the membrane, it binds with the immobilized antibodies also specific to hHb to form visible reddish/pink line. The procedural control region of the membrane contains anti-mouse antibodies that capture any unreacted/excess antibody-gold conjugates, forming a distinct reddish/pink line. The reddish/pink line in the procedural control region demonstrates the validity of the test.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The repeatability of OC-Light S FIT was evaluated at one intended use site, using one test kit lot and one operator. The repeatability study was performed using 21 replicates of fecal test samples collected in OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles from Hb-free stool specimens spiked with human blood to obtain test samples containing seven different concentrations of human hemoglobin: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $5 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $8 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 5 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), $4 0 \left( { \mathrm { C } } 5 0 , { \mathrm { C } } 9 5 { \mathrm { - } } 2 0 \% \right)$ , 50 (C95, cutoff), 60 $C 9 5 { + } 2 0 \%$ ), 75, and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively.

Reproducibility studies were conducted at three intended use sites in the U.S. The reproducibility of OC-Light S FIT was evaluated by testing 21 replicates of fecal test samples collected in OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles from Hb-free stool specimens spiked with human blood to obtain test samples containing seven different concentrations of human hemoglobin: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $5 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $8 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } / { \underline { { \mathrm { g } } } }$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, $C 9 5 { - } 2 0 \%$ ), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 $( \mathrm { C 9 5 ^ { + } 2 0 \% }$ ), 75, and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively.

OC-Light S FIT repeatability and reproducibility testing was carried out in a random and blinded manner. No invalid or indeterminate results were obtained throughout the precision studies. FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results.

# Prozone (Hook Effect)

Susceptibility of OC-Light S FIT to prozone effect was evaluated by testing Hb-free stool specimens spiked with Human HbA0 solution, HbS whole blood and HbC whole blood. Test samples were prepared by spiking Hb-free stool specimen with known levels of human HbA0 solution to obtain fecal samples with eight different Hb concentrations of each: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $2 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $1 0 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \varrho$ stool, $1 5 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \varrho$ stool, $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, 250 $\mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $3 0 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \varrho$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, that are equivalent to 0, 100, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively. Twenty one aliquots of each sample

concentration were mixed with extraction buffer and tested in randomized order.

Test samples were also prepared by spiking Hb-free stool specimens with known levels of HbS supernatant to obtain fecal samples with eight different HbS concentrations and known levels of HbC supernatant to obtain fecal samples with eight different HbC concentrations: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $2 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $1 0 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \varrho$ stool, $1 5 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \varrho$ stool, $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $2 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $3 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, that are equivalent to 0, 100, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively. Twenty one aliquots of each sample concentration were mixed with extraction buffer and tested in randomized order.

FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the test prozone/hook effect study. OC-Light S FIT was not found susceptible to prozone/hook effect as it would display positive test results with fecal samples containing a hemoglobin concentration up to $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Internal Control: Procedural controls are included in the test device. A reddish/pink line appearing the control region is considered as the internal procedural control. It confirms sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and correct procedural technique.

External Control: Controls are not provided with this kit. It is recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper test performance. The FOBT-CHEK Control Kit, cleared under K041297, is recommended for use as the external controls.

# Stability Studies

# 1. Stability of fecal samples

Samples for stability testing were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven different hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $5 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $8 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 5 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, $C 9 5 { - } 2 0 \%$ ), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 $( \mathrm { C } 9 5 { + } 2 0 \% )$ ), 75 and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively. Twenty one aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles and analyzed in random order.

To claim 30 days of sample stability at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ each sample was tested with OCLight S FIT and stored at 2, 4, 8, and $1 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ at time points of 15, 30, and 31 days from the start of storage. OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles must be brought back to room temperature before testing.

To claim 15 days of sample stability at room temperature each sample was tested with OC-Light S FIT and stored at 15, 25, 30, and $3 2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ at time points of 7, 15, and 16 days from the start of storage.

FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study. Stool samples collected in OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles are stable up to 30 days when stored at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , and stable up to 15 days when stored at room temperature.

# 2. Test Kit Stability (Accelerated)

Accelerated stability study was conducted with 3 lots of OC-Light S FIT test kit (test strips and sampling bottles). Test kit stability testing was performed by preparing 21 aliquots of spiked stool test samples collected in detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles. The Hb-free stool specimens were spiked with human blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven different hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $5 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $8 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 5 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, $C 9 5 { - } 2 0 \%$ ), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 $( \mathrm { C 9 5 ^ { + } 2 0 \% }$ ), 75 and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively. Each spiked stool test sample was analyzed in random order. The three lots of OC-Light S FIT test strips (contained in canisters) and sampling bottles were stored and tested at $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $5 6 ^ { \circ }$ Cand $6 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The test kit stability was performed at the following time intervals:

Device kit stored at $6 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ : 1.04 months (31 days) from the start of storage.   
Device kit stored at $5 6 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ : 1.49 months (45 days) from the start of storage.   
Device kit stored at $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ : 2.58 months (77 days) from the start of storage.

FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study. The results showed that the test kit was stable for an estimated period of 18 months at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ when Arrhenius equation is applied.

# 3. Fecal Sample Shipping Stress Test

Three sets of OC-Light S FIT test kits (3 lots of test strips plus 3 lots of sampling bottles) were evaluated during the fecal sample shipping stress test. Fecal samples were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven different hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $5 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $8 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 5 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, $C 9 5 \small { - } 2 0 \%$ ), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 $( \mathrm { C 9 5 ^ { + } 2 0 \% } )$ ), 75 and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively. Twenty one aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles. The initial tests were performed with randomized samples that are not stressed to confirm that all sets give expected results. The OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles with fecal samples of known Hb concentrations were stored at ${ } _ { - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ , ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ , $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , and $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The stool samples/test kit stored at ${ } _ { - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ and ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ were brought to room temperature on day 1 to have a freeze-thaw cycle, and was then returned to storage. At time points of 2, 3, and 4 days from the start of storage, 147 OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles (21 aliquots of $7 \mathrm { H b }$ concentrations) of each set from the storage were taken out and brought back to room temperature. The samples were randomized and tested with a paired lot of OC-Light S FIT test strips. FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive

Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study. Studies demonstrated that fecal samples collected in OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles are stable for 3 days of storage at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and stable for 3 days with 3 freeze/thaw cycles.

# 4. Test Kit Shipping Stress Test

Three sets of OC-Light S FIT test kits (3 lots of test strips plus 3 lots of sampling bottles) were evaluated during the test kit shipping stress test. The unused sets of OC-Light S FIT test strips and sampling bottles (containing no fecal samples) were stored at ${ } _ { - 4 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ , $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , and $5 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The test kit stored at ${ } _ { - 4 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ were brought to room temperature on day 1 to have a freeze-thaw cycle, and was then returned to storage. At time points 2, 3, and 4 days from the start of storage, 147 OC-Light S FIT test strips and sampling bottles of each test set from the storage were taken out and brought back to room temperature. To evaluate the performance of stressed test kits, fecal samples for testing were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven different hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $5 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $8 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 5 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, $C 9 5 { - } 2 0 \%$ ), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 $( \mathrm { C } 9 5 { + } 2 0 \% )$ ), 75 and 2000 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Twenty one aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles. The samples were randomized and tested with a paired lot of OC-Light S FIT test strips. FOBT-CHECK ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study. Studies demonstrated that OC-Light S FIT test kits are stable for 3 days of storage at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and stable for 3 days with 3 freeze/thaw cycles.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Specificity to human hemoglobin variant

The ability of OC-Light S FIT to detect human hemoglobin variants was determined by testing hemoglobin-S (HbS) and hemoglobin-C (HbC) by preparing spiked stool samples containing seven different hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $5 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $8 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, $1 5 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / g }$ stool that are equivalent to 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, $C 9 5 { - } 2 0 \%$ ), 50 (C95, cut-off), 60 $( \mathrm { C } 9 5 + 2 0 \% )$ , 75 and 2000 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively. Twenty one aliquots of each of the seven concentrations (7 HbS and 7 HbC supernatants) of spiked stool test samples were mixed with detection buffer in OC-Light S FIT sample collection bottles.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison of OC-Light S FIT with the predicate test, Polymedco OC-Light FOB Test, was conducted by assessing patient samples and one Hb-spiked sample of known concentration at $7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (near the cut-off) at each intended use site, physician office laboratories (POLs) and professional medical laboratories (PMLs). The FOBTCHEK external controls (positive and negative) were run prior to testing. Statistical analysis of site-wise test results as well as combined results showed that OC-Light S FIT test results have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement with Polymedco OC-Light FOB test results.

Controls should be assayed according to manufacturer instructions once per kit lot, following the local and state guidelines. If controls do not perform as expected, the test results should not be used.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Test Kit Reaction Time:

Reaction time test samples were prepared by spiking Hb-free stool specimen with known levels of human Hb solution to obtain fecal samples with seven different Hb concentrations: 0, 25 (C5), 40 (C50, $C 9 5 \small { - } 2 0 \%$ ), 50(C95, cut-off), 60 $( \mathrm { C } 9 5 { + } 2 0 \%$ ), 75 and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Each sample was collected with 21 OC-Light S FIT sampling bottles and tested in a randomized order. The test was performed in-house with OC-Light S FIT test strips and the results read at 3, 5, 10, and 30 minutes. Positivity rate of $2 5 \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ was $0 \%$ , positivity rate of $4 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was $43 \%$ , and positivity rate of $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was $100 \%$ at 5 minutes of reaction, and the appropriate reaction time of OC-Light S FIT was demonstrated as 5 minutes. The appropriate reaction time of OC-Light S FIT was demonstrated as 5 minutes.

# 2. Operator Intensity Reading:

The operator intensity reading test was performed by utilizing seven (7) levels of stool samples spiked with Hb concentrations by adding human Hb to Hb-free stool samples with concentrations at 0, 25, 37.5 $( C 9 5 - 2 5 \%$ ), 50 (C95, cut-off), $6 2 . 5 ( \mathrm { C 9 5 } + 2 5 \% )$ , 75, and 2000 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The negative and positive controls were performed in the same manner as the spiked stool test samples. Five groups of samples were created, each group consisting of seven samples per concentration and controls each tested in a randomized order. Five participant readers from an intended use site analyzed the group of samples and recorded the results and graded the intensity of the test line from 6 levels: N (negative), F (faint), $1 + , 2 + , 3 + ,$ , and $^ { 4 + }$ . The intensity of the test line increased in correlation with the Hb concentration of stool test samples. There was no statistical significance in the analyses of the test samples performed by the operators for the intensity reading test study.
