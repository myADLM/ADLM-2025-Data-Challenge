# Options and Accessories

Options and accessories that can be used for this instrument are as follows:

(1) Waste tank (with float switch for waste tank): Waste fluids discharged from the Main Unit enter this tank.   
(2) Wand barcode reader: Reads barcodes to input sample numbers, rack numbers and reagent IDs.   
(3) 2D barcode reader: Reads barcodes to input calibrator’s or reagent’s assay sheet values, normal values and ISI values, and control’s targets/limits.   
(4) IPU cart: The IPU (which includes the keyboard, PC and touch panel display), and the tanks for waste, rinse and CA Clean II can be placed on this cart.   
(5) External indicator light: The status of the instrument is indicated with a red, yellow or green light that can be seen when the operator is not directly in front of the instrument.   
(6) IPU holder: This is an optional holder for the IPU which includes the keyboard, PC and touch panel display which can be installed on the right side of the instrument to minimize the instrument footprint.

The instrument is capable of measuring in the following analysis modes:

(1) Normal mode: Samples for all the analyses including re-analyses are taken into the instrument at the same time and analyzed. In a normal mode, a capped sample tube analysis can be performed. Automatic re-analysis can also be performed.   
(2) Micro-sample mode: Samples set in the sampler or STAT holder are taken into the instrument for each analysis through a secondary dispensing sample probe. When measurements are to be performed in Micro mode, sample tubes must be uncapped. The instrument detects capped tubes automatically and displays an error message. This analysis mode can be performed with less sample volume than normal mode (consult instruction manual for further information). However, automatic re-analysis cannot be performed.

# 7. Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of the substantial equivalence determination.

# 7.1 Method comparison

Method comparison studies designed according to EP09-A3 CLSI Guideline “Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples” were conducted at three external sites in the United States, all sites using the same protocol.

Samples were measured on both the predicate device (Sysmex CA-1500) as well as the new device (Sysmex CS-5100), in random order to eliminate any inherent bias. Results were compared by Passing-Bablok regression analysis as well as Bland-Altman plots. Results from each application met the pre-established acceptance criteria. The following summary of PassingBablok regression shows that the proposed and predicate devices provide equivalent results when used in a clinical setting.

# 7.2 Reproducibility Studies

Twenty-day precision studies were performed at two external sites in Germany and one external site in the United States. Testing followed the scheme of two runs per day, with two replicates per run, at each of the three sites according to CLSI EP05-A2 “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”. The order of the analysis of parameter, samples and quality control samples for each run and day varied to avoid an inherent bias to the study. One calibration curve of each calibrated application was used in the study. Within Run, Between Run, Between Day, and Total With-in Site was calculated. The data is summarized in the following tables.

# 7.3 Detection Capability Results

Detection capability studies were measured for the calibrated assays on the Sysmex CS-5100: Fibrinogen with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Thrombin Reagent, Antithrombin with INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Antithrombin, and D-dimer with INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer. Studies were conducted following the CLSI document EP17-A2 ‘Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures’. Data for all tested reagents met the pre-determined acceptance criteria and support the lower limit of the clinical reportable range claim.

The Sysmex CS-5100 performs tests with three non-calibrated test applications: PT seconds with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Innovin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , PT INR with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Innovin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , and APTT with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Actin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FSL Activated PTT Reagent. There is no detection limit for these reagents and the measuring interval is set at the lower end of the measurement interval by a software setting.

# 7.4 Linearity & Measuring Range

Linearity studies were performed for the following calibrated assays on the Sysmex CS-5100: Fibrinogen with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Thrombin Reagent, Antithrombin with INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Antithrombin, and D-dimer with INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer. All reagents met the pre-determined acceptance criteria and support the clinical reportable range claim. The Sysmex CS-5100 performs tests with three non-calibrated test applications: PT seconds with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Innovin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , PT INR with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Innovin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , and APTT with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Actin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FSL. Linearity testing is not applicable to noncalibrated assays. Studies were conducted as described in CLSI EP6-A “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach”.

# 7.6 D-Dimer PE Exclusion Validation Study

The INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the Sysmex CS-5100 in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) using frozen specimens collected prospectively from 1930 consecutive outpatients presenting to the emergency or ambulatory department with suspected PE. Of these 1930 patients, 96 were excluded for a total of 1834 patients.

All potentially eligible patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate their pre-test probability (PTP) with regard to PE, and then categorized into high, intermediate or low PTP. Patients with a high PTP score were excluded from enrollment.

Patients with no or a positive D-dimer result with the D-dimer assay used at the respective study center were evaluated by imaging methods, e.g. spiral CT and/or VQ scan. Patients with a negative D-dimer result with the D-dimer assay used at the respective study center underwent imaging at the physician’s discretion. All patients with a negative diagnosis of PE at presentation were followed up after three months to evaluate potential development of PE. Patients with unobtainable follow-up data were excluded from analysis resulting in $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 4 6 7$ patients available for final analysis.

The overall prevalence of PE in the 1467 patients was $6 . 9 \%$ (101 of 1467) with $6 . 0 \%$ in the US population and $3 7 . 2 \%$ in the European population. The specimens were tested with the INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer assay and results were compared to a cut-off value of $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU. A D-dimer result $< 0 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU was considered negative and a D-dimer result ${ \geq } 0 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU was considered positive. The instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) with lower bound (LCL) of two-sided $9 5 \%$

confidence interval were obtained with the INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer clinical cut-off of 0.50 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU. Results obtained for each study population are detailed below.

# 8. Conclusions

Because the predicate device was cleared based in part on the results of clinical studies, and because clinical settings are required for a well-validated device, clinical testing was required to support substantial equivalence.

The non-clinical data support the safety of the device.

The hardware and software verification and validation demonstrate that the Sysmex CS-5100 performs as intended in the specified use conditions.

The clinical data demonstrate that the Sysmex CS-5100 performs comparably to the predicate device that is currently marketed for the same intended use.

The data submitted for this Premarket Notification demonstrates that the device raises no new concerns as to safety and effectiveness when compared to the predicate device, and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
