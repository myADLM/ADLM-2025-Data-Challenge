# L. Test Principle:

The BD FACSPresto instrument is an automated multicolor fluorescent imaging cytometer and absorbance spectrometer with camera, light-emitting diode (LED) illumination, touchscreen user-interface, battery backup power, and onboard software algorithms that analyze images and report results. The instrument acquires images of the cartridge at multiple fields of view and images are analyzed using on-board BD FACSPresto Software to determine CD4, $\% C D 4$ , and Hb. Additionally, the instrument has on-board, built in QC features and algorithms to verify its performance at power-on-self-test (POST) and during cartridge runs.

The BD FACSPrestoCD4/Hb Cartridge is designed to take whole blood from a venipuncture or fingerstick, incubate sample for 18 minutes to 2 hours in the BD FACSPresto CD4/Hb Cartridge, and then run on the BD FACSPresto instrument to obtain accurate results. When using an aliquot of blood from an EDTA tube, a pipette will be required to transfer the blood to the cartridge. The BD FACSPresto CD4/Hb Cartridge product provides a disposable transfer pipette for each cartridge to be used for this purpose.

The dried reagent in the BD FACSPresto CD4/Hb Cartridge features controlled release of the reagent upon rehydration and contains EDTA to prevent coagulation of fingerstick specimens. CD4 PE-Cy5 stains CD4-positive cells, while CD3-APC and CD45RA-APC stain total lymphocytes for use in the $\% C D 4$ calculation. CD14-PE is used for staining monocytes to exclude CD4 and/or CD45RA expressing monocytes from analysis.

Image processing and gating is performed automatically in the FACSPresto software. Briefly, the gating logic is first to identify CD14 expressing cells and exclude them from further analysis, second to identify CD3-APC and CD45RA-APC expressing cells to generate the total lymphocyte population, and third to identify CD4-PECy5 expressing cells within the total lymphocyte population. Percent CD4 is calculated directly from the ratio of CD4-expressing to total lymphocytes. CD4 absolute count is the CD4-expressing lymphocyte count divided by the volume of the imaged field of views.

Assay Repeatability and Reproducibility Using Control Material

Bench-Total precision for the BD FACSPresto system was measured for 21 operational days using duplicate Streck CD-Chex Plus BC Normal and CD4-Low controls for CD4 and $\% C D 4$ and duplicate Eurotrol Hb 301 Controls (Levels $1 ^ { - 3 }$ ) for Hemoglobin. Daily precision measurements were performed on alternating BD FACSPresto systems (three instruments in total) in two separate runs per day (morning/afternoon) by three operators. The study was performed with one instrument and operator using one lot for seven days, then the next instrument and operator with a second lot was run for the next seven days, and then the final instrument and operator with a third lot was run for the final seven days. All acceptance criteria were met.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Five samples with evenly spaced CD4 concentrations were evaluated in the lower CD4 range of $4 0 { - } 2 0 0 \ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ . Twelve samples with evenly spaced CD4 concentrations were evaluated in the CD4 range of $4 0 { - } 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ and the total lymphocyte range of $2 0 0 { - } 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ . Eleven evenly spaced samples were evaluated for hemoglobin (Hb) in the range of $2 { - } 2 6 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ . These samples were prepared by manipulating whole blood samples, which were collected in EDTA tubes. The concentration pools for CD4, lymphocytes, and Hb were prepared by proportionally mixing pools of samples with high and low analyte concentrations. Samples were tested in triplicate on BD FACSPresto Cartridges for each study. Three BD FACSPresto instruments and three lots of BD FACSPresto Cartridges wer used for this evaluation.

Because $\% C D 4$ is not an analyte by itself but is determined by CD4 and lymphocyte absolute counts (numerator and denominator, respectively), BD evaluated CD4 and lymphocyte linearity in this study. Linearity for lymphocyte absolute counts was evaluated for the range of 200−5,000 cells/ $\mu \mathrm { L }$ on the BD FACSPresto system.

The reportable ranges of the BD FACSPresto system include: CD4 (40−2500 ${ \mathrm { c e l l s } } / { \mu \mathrm { L } } )$ , $\% C D 4$ $( 5 \mathrm { - } 6 0 \% )$ , and Hb $\left( 5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 8 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } \right)$ .

# Sponsor’s Acceptance Criteria

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

There are currently no international reference standards for CD4 marker antibodies. The BD Multi Check Controls were manufactured by diluting human whole blood containing leukocytes and erythrocytes in a stabilizing medium. The human whole blood was obtained from commercial sources and was tested for markers of infectious substances.

The FACSPresto system was evaluated for its accuracy performance against the HiCN method for hemoglobin determination. Performance was evaluated for the range of $2 { - } 2 2 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ on the BD FACSPresto system and the HiCN reference method system using manipulated and donor samples. Manipulated levels were spaced equidistant from each other. These equidistant levels were prepared by manipulating whole blood samples collected in EDTA tubes. A minimum of one FACSPresto instrument and one lot of BD FACSPresto Cartridges were used for this evaluation. The BD FACSPresto System demonstrated agreement with the HiCN method. The Hb assay is linear and accurate across the reported linear range $\left( 2 { - } 2 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L } \right)$ as compared to the HiCN method.

# Control Value Assignment:

The value assignment for BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low Control included controls were tested on three instruments, with three lots of reagent cartridge, at two incubation time points: 18 minutes and two hours, for a total of 18 values to determine the final value assignment. The BD Multi-Check results acquired on the BD FACSPresto system shall fall within the FACSPresto-specific ranges at least $9 5 \%$ of the time and meet the FACSPresto system error rate of $< 5 \%$ . All acceptance criteria were met. Precision testing was performed on the controls using three lots of BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low Controls performed at three sites on three instruments spanning a minimum of 20 days. In addition to verifying the precision of the process controls on the BD FACSPresto system, this study further verifies the acceptability of the FACSPresto-specific assay ranges.

Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control value assignment was established using vials from each level (1, 2, and 3) of Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control. Three lots of BD FACSPresto Cartridges are tested on three FACSPresto Instruments at three incubation time-points: $1 { - } 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ , 18−30 min and 2 hours $( \pm 1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } ) }$ , for a total of 27 values to determine the final value assignment. The hemoglobin results acquired on the BD FACSPresto system shall fall within the FACSPresto specific ranges at least $9 5 \%$ of the time and meet the FACSPresto system $< 5 \%$ error rate at each site. All acceptance criteria were met. Three lots of Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control were run on three instruments to test precision over 20 days verifying the FACSPrestoassigned ranges were acceptable for use.

# Stability:

Stability studies have been performed and the results support the following claims:

# Sample Stability:

For specimens acquired via the venipuncture method, staining was performed after age of blood reached 22−24 hours. These specimens were stained then analyzed at 18−22 minutes later and then again at 2 hours and $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ after initiating staining. The acceptance criteria was that a 24 hours post-drawn venipuncture blood in EDTA shall remain readable and the bias of CD4 count, $\% C D 4$ , and Hb results shall be within $\pm 1 5 \%$ with $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of fresh ( $\leq 6$ hours post-drawn) venipuncture blood in EDTA. Samples were shown to be stable for up to 22 hours at room temperature.

# Age of Stain:

The acceptable age of staining after reconstitution was determined through the time course evaluation of the BD FACSPresto Cartridge using fresh (within six hours of draw) patient blood (both capillary and venous). These specimens were stained and analyzed for 18−22 minutes after incubation (i.e., standard operating procedures) and then analyzed again at 2 hours and $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ after initiating staining. For specimens acquired via the venipuncture method, age of stain was also performed after age of blood reached 22−24 hours. These specimens were stained then analyzed at 18−22 minutes later and then again at 2 hours and $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ after initiating staining. The staining of the cells was shown to be stable for one hour after the sample has been applied to the cartridge.

# Reagent Cartridge Stability:

Shelf Life: Cartridge for closed pouch expiration is assigned a shelf life of one year in a temperature and humidity range of $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $3 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $10 \%$ to $9 5 \%$ relative humidity. The acceptance criteria of CD4, $\% C D 4$ , or Hb results within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of reference reagent (pouched cartridges at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) were met. Real time stability is ongoing and currently supports a claim of one year.

Open/In use Stability: Open pouch expiration for the cartridges is assigned 30 minute stability in a temperature and humidity range of $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $10 \%$ to $9 5 \%$ relative humidity. The acceptance criteria of CD4, $\% C D 4$ , or Hb results within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of reference reagent (pouched cartridges at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) were met.

# Control Stability:

Shelf Life: The acceptance criteria for the BD Multi-Check Control and BD MultiCheck CD4 Low Control results acquired on the BD FACSPresto system shall fall within the FACSPresto-specific ranges at least $9 5 \%$ of the time and meet the

FACSPresto system error rate of $< 5 \%$ . Three lots of controls were tested. All lots of the BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low Control were within the established acceptance criteria. Expiration dating reflects the validated time period that assures adequate device performance throughout the shelf life of 45 days.

The acceptance criteria for shelf life stability of the Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control was the measurement results of the controls must demonstrate no more than $7 \%$ allowable drift with $9 5 \%$ confidence interval from the mean value at $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ throughout the claimed shelf life. All three lots of the Eurtotrol FACSPresto Hb Control were within the established acceptance criteria. Expiration dating reflects the validated time period that assures adequate device performance throughout the shelf life of one month.

Open Vial/In-use Stability:

Real time stability testing of the BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low Control passed the acceptance criteria for all stability tests through the stated open vial shelf life of nine thermal cycles, stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and sampled at room temperature.

Real time stability testing of two lots of the Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control (Levels 1–3) passed the acceptance criteria for all stability tests through the stated open vial shelf life of 30 days, stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and sampled at room temperature.

# d. Detection limit:

# Limit of Blank (LoB):

For the FACSPresto CD4 assay, the LoB was determined by producing a blank sample for the CD4 assay by blocking all CD4 binding sites with CD4-FITC. The CD4-PECy5 will be prevented from binding. There will be no CD4 signal and the algorithm will not count and gate any CD4 cells. The instrument average of blank samples, after running the blank 60 times, was 5.02 counts, with a SD of 3.16, and the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of blank sample of 9.92.

The sponsor has stated that it is not feasible to use the BD FACSPresto system to perform the Hb assay at zero $\mathrm { g / d L }$ for LoB determination due to an internal algorithm quality control process.

# Limit of Detection (LoD):

For the FACSPresto CD4 assay, the LoD was determined by testing 20 replicates from a sample with the lowest detectible level of analyte and 20 replicates from the blank sample were tested for CD4 per lot of cartridges per instrument. The LoD of the CD4 assay was determined to be $2 2 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

For the FACSPresto Hemoglobin assay the LoD was determined by following the Probit approach in accordance with CSLI EP-17-A2. The LoD of the Hemoglobin assay was determined to be $0 . 9 1 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ .

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):

For the FACSPresto CD4 assay the LoQ was determined by following the variant approach described in Section 6.6 of the CSLI EP17-A2 guideline. Five samples were tested in six replicates for each of two lots of cartridges. The LoQ of the CD4 assay was determined to be $3 5 \mathrm { \ c e l l s / \mu L }$ .

The LoQ for Hemoglobin (Hb) was determined to be $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ . To determine the LoQ of Hb, 20 replicates from a sample with the lowest detectible level of analyte were tested for Hb per lot of cartridges per instrument (60 replicates total). Whole blood was concentrated by removing the plasma to obtain a sample with high Hb level and then diluted with plasma to target an Hb level of $2 \ { \mathrm { g / d L } }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The endogenous and exogenous interference studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2 guidelines. Clinically significant means a $1 5 \%$ or lower difference from a negative control. The acceptance criteria for CD4, $\% C D 4$ , and Hb results were: for each of the sample results, intra-sample precision shall have a CV under $7 \%$ and for each of the analytes, with $9 5 \%$ confidence interval applied, the mean difference (or bias) between the sample with target concentration and the negative control sample shall be less than $1 5 \%$ . The following interfering substances were tested and passed the acceptance criteria for the concentrations stated below.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A study population of $\mathrm { H I V } +$ paired fingerstick (FS) and venipuncture (VP) samples measured in duplicate on the FACSPresto system and the predicate devices. Remnant venous blood samples without corresponding capillary specimens were also included. The tests were performed using three lots of the BD FACSPresto cartridge, three instruments, and two operators.

Venipuncture samples were prospectively obtained from 796 de-identified and delinked donors, of which 692 provided matched capillary blood specimens. Male (322) and female (410) subjects from apparently healthy, HIV negative subjects with other diseases, and HIV positive patients were included. Seven hundred seventeen (717) subjects from CHIL, DIT, KEM, NAR, PEK SIR and SFG were enrolled in the study, and 75 venous blood specimens were procured from an external vendor for sample manipulation at MED and added to the venous portion of the study. The samples were manipulated by combining cell fractions and plasma in appropriate ratios to reach target concentrations of analyte(s) to fill the low bins (CD4 and Hb) or high bins (CD4 and Hb) in the accuracy evaluation. Of the non-manipulated samples, 57 samples were from children (2 to 11 years), 68 samples were from adolescents (12 to 21 years), and 592 samples were from adults $( \geq 2 2$ years). None of the capillary blood specimens was manipulated.

Note that for 14 of the 692 paired capillary vs venous blood samples, the difference in results between matrices would result in different result interpretation based on the cutoff of $2 0 0 \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ . However, as a clinician would not use $2 0 0 \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ alone as an absolute cutoff value for decision making, and all clinical factors are considered important to evaluate the patient diagnosis, having a discordant reading between capillary and venous blood samples in these cases would not result delayed or missed treatment.

Multiple sources of CD4 count variability are recognized, including intra-laboratory measurements and individual patient physiologic factors. CD4 results must be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Two BD FACSPresto instruments and three lots of BD FACSPresto Cartridges were used for testing venous and capillary blood specimens collected from 133 male and 142 female apparently healthy subjects, between 18 to 70 years of age, at one clinical site (BCW). On each day of testing, BD FACSPresto instruments were set up and process controls were run obtaining passing results. The first replicate was used to calculate CD4, %CD4, and Hb values. Data were analyzed using parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric methods described in Section 7.3 of CLSI Guideline EP28-A3c Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline – Third Edition. We recommend that laboratories and other users establish their own reference intervals for their patient populations using the BD FACSPresto system to reflect potential sources of variability, such as patient gender, race, age, and preparation techniques.

# N. Instrument Name:

BD FACSPresto™ System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes _x__ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No ___x_

Yes ____x___ or No

3. Specimen Identification: Specimen identification can be entered either manually or with a barcode reader.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Collection is by aliquot from an EDTA-coated tube containing whole blood from venipuncture or from fingerstick via lancet. To prepare the cartridge, the user transfers the whole blood specimen directly from an EDTA tube or fingerstick to the inlet port of the cartridge. Once blood flows in the cartridge, the cap is closed and the cartridge automatically performs all sample preparation. During this process the sample flows through the reagent disk and into the cartridge channel where staining of white cells by fluorescent-antibody conjugates occurs. The tear-strip on the cartridge label protects the stained sample from light exposure. After 18 minutes (and up to two hours) stain time, the tear-strip is removed and the cartridge can be read on the instrument.

5. Calibration: Performed by manufacturer

6. Quality Control:

BD Multi-Check Control and BD Multi-Check CD4 Low Control are assayed whole blood quality control products for analysis using monoclonal antibody reagents and image cytometry. They provide positive cell controls that are processed in the same manner as a whole blood sample. This allows verification of instrument and reagent performance.

Eurotrol FACSPresto Hb Control is an assayed hemoglobin control product for analysis using spectrophotometry. The control is processed in the same manner as a whole blood sample. This allows verification of instrument and reagent performance.

Fifty seven (57) samples were analyzed, comprised of $1 8 \mathrm { H I V - }$ samples and $3 9 \mathrm { H I V ^ { + } }$ samples on two different BD FACSPresto systems: a BD FACSCalibur instrument with BD Tritest CD3/4/45 (the predicate assay), and a BD FACSCalibur instrument with the BD Multitest Immune Monitoring Kit (IMK) consisting of CD3/4/8/45 and $\mathrm { C D } 3 / 1 6 \substack { + 5 6 / 1 9 / 4 5 }$ (2 tube T/B/NK assay), to compare total lymphocyte counts between methods. The Tritest assay uses SSC and CD45 signals to identify lymphocytes as SSC low and CD45 high. The IMK assay similarly uses SSC and CD45 to identify lymphocytes and then uses CD3, CD19 and $\mathrm { C D } 1 6 { + } \mathrm { C D } 5 6$ to identify these lymphocytes as T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells respectively. Both FACSCalibur methods used BD Trucount beads for calculating absolute lymphocyte counts.
