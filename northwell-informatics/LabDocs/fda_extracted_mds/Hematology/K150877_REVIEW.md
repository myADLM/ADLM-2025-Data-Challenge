# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY

A. 510(k) Number: K150877   
B. Purpose for Submission: To introduce new pre‐analytical features and software on the currently marketed ACL TOP Family (reference: K073377 and K091980 ‒ LAS model).   
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name: Instrumentation Laboratory (IL) Co., ACL TOP Family 50 Series Models: ACL TOP 350 CTS, ACL TOP 550 CTS, ACL TOP 750, ACL TOP 750 CTS, ACL TOP 750 LAS. NOTE: CTS $=$ Closed Tube Sample; LAS $=$ Laboratory Automated System.   
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Clotting, chromogenic and immunological coagulation assays   
E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The ACL TOP Family 50 Series are fully automated coagulation analyzers that utilize the same intuitive software, the same consumables, reagents, calibrators and controls, and provide the same analytical methodology for routine and specialty assay result reporting as the predicate ACL TOP Family. The ACL TOP Family 50 Series instruments perform the following types of tests, using the same optical measuring wavelengths and test parameters as the predicate ACL TOP Family:

• Coagulometric (Turbidimetric) Measurements • Chromogenic (Absorbance) Measurements Immunological Measurements

The ACL TOP Family 50 Series also offers new pre-analytical features not available on the predicate ACL TOP Family as described below. These features are not intended to replace laboratory quality policies. The features simply alert the instrument operator to a potential HIL (Hemoglobin, Icteric and Lipemia) interference situation specific to the assays requested for a sample, underfilled sample tubes or a detected clog.

The new pre-analytical features and software are as follows:

Pre-Analytical HIL Check detects and measures interference caused by the presence of hemoglobin, bilirubin, and light scattering lipids in patient samples.

H – Hemolysis (hemoglobin) • I – Icterus (bilirubin) L – Lipemia (turbidity)

A third measurement wavelength at $5 3 5 \mathrm { n m }$ and an additional emitter control channel have been introduced to support the new Pre‐Analytical HIL Check feature.

Pre‐Analytical Tube Fill Height (THF) Check aids laboratories by screening open and closed tube samples during the first sample aspiration to determine whether the tube fill meets the minimum level based on the tube manufacturer's recommendations.

Pre‐Analytical Clog Detection is performed on all samples during aspiration. A pre‐analytical error or warning for fluidic obstruction is an indication for the user to review the sample integrity, following established laboratory sample quality procedures. A pressure transducer has been introduced to support this new Pre‐Analytical Clog Detection feature.

Instrument software has been updated to support the new features.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

Following is an overview of the ACL TOP Family 50 Series control modules and analytical technology:

# A. Control Module (CM)

The CM provides a user interface and operation control. It consists of a personal computer running Windows™ software, keyboard, touch screen display monitor, mouse, and communications interfaces to the AM and external devices/systems. The CM provides the major functionality associated with the user interface (UI) including data management, data reduction, LIS (Laboratory Information System) communications, sample identification, test materials management, fluid management, reporting, test tracking and QC management, and monitoring.

# B. Analytical Module (AM)

The AM consists primarily of sample and reagent handling hardware. It processes reagents and auxiliary materials. It can perform coagulometric (turbidimetric), chromogenic (absorbance), and immunological measurements.

# C. Coagulometric (Turbidimetric) Measurement

The principle of coagulometric (turbidimetric) clot detection is used in the system to measure and record the amount of time required for a plasma specimen to clot. This technique assesses coagulation endpoint by measuring change in optical density.

Clot detection is based on the principle that light passing through a medium in which fibrinogen is converted to fibrin is absorbed by the fibrin strands. Light ( $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ or $6 7 1 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ is transmitted through a sample onto a photodetector, which is positioned $1 8 0 ^ { \circ }$ to the source. Light absorption increases as fibrin clot formation progresses. Consequently, light transmittance through the sample continuously decreases and is measured by the photodetector. The corresponding electrical signal output from the photodetector changes according to the detected light. The signal output is processed via software through a series of algorithms to determine the clot point.

# D. Chromogenic (Absorbance) Measurement

Chromogenic tests can be either direct or indirect.

Direct test – Test where the analyte of interest (e.g. protein C, plasminogen) acts directly on a specified synthetic substrate.   
Indirect test – Test where the analyte of interest (antithrombin, plasmin inhibitor) reacts with a fixed quantity of enzyme to form inactive complexes. Under optimized test conditions, residual enzyme activity is then measured using a specific synthetic substrate.

In most cases, the reaction is monitored at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ by the continuous release of paranitroaniline (pNA) from the synthetic substrate.

The chromogenic channels use the colorimetric principle of measuring absorbance in the cuvette. An optical sensor reads light $( 4 0 5 \mathrm { n m } )$ that passes through the cuvette. The light is absorbed by the fluid in the cuvette in direct proportion to the concentration of pNA. The amount of light reaching the photodetector is converted into an electrical signal that is proportional to the enzyme activity.

# E. Immunological Measurements

The principle of immunological measurement is used on the system to directly measure and record the amount of an analyte. This technique assesses the physical concentration of the analyte (and not its activity) by measuring change in optical density. Although similar to the turbidimetric method, the immunological method relies on the formation of antigen‐antibody complexes to affect light transmission. Immunological testing of the ACL TOP uses the $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ or the $6 7 1 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ channels depending on the test and the reagent formulation. Both the $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ and the $6 7 1 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ channels use the principle of measuring absorbance in the cuvette. An optical sensor reads the light ( $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ or $6 7 1 \mathrm { n m }$ ) that passes through the cuvette. The light is absorbed by the fluid in the cuvette in direct proportion to the concentration of antigen‐antibody complexes. The amount of light reaching the photodetector is converted into an electrical signal that is proportional or inversely proportional to the analyte concentration.

# External Precision

An external 20‐day precision study was performed at three US external sites on an ACL TOP 550 CTS by three different operators, using 11 representative commercially available assays each with two levels of assayed control materials. Testing included the following assays: PT, APTT, Fibrinogen Clauss, D‐dimer, Antithrombin, Free Protein S (latex), Protein C (chromogenic), Factor V, Factor VII, Factor VIII, and Factor IX. All materials were tested in duplicate, twice a day for 20 days, for a total of 80 replicates per level for each assay on each ACL TOP 55 CTS model. Precision results for all assays at all external sites passed acceptance criteria (see acceptance criteria for internal precision study).

# Reproducibility Study ‐ External

An external 5‐day precision study was performed at three US external sites on an ACL TOP 550 CTS by three different operators, using the same lot of 12 representative commercially available assays, each with two levels of the same lot of assayed control materials. Testing included the following assays: PT (as well as

derived Fibrinogen), APTT, Fibrinogen Clauss, D‐dimer, Antithrombin, Free Protein S (latex), Protein C (chromogenic), Factor V, Factor VII, Factor VIII, and Factor IX. All materials were tested in triplicate, twice a day for 5 days, for a total of 30 replicates per level for each assay on each ACL TOP 550 CTS model. Reproducibility results for all assays at all external sites passed acceptance criteria (see acceptance criteria above for the internal precision study).

# c. Linearity:

An internal linearity study was performed on an ACL TOP 350 CTS, ACL TOP 550 CTS, ACL TOP 750 CTS and ACL TOP 750, using 10 representative commercially available assays and prepared plasma pool panels at a minimum of 9 levels. Each of the different panel levels was tested in quadruplicate on each instrument model with the resultant data supporting equivalent linearity range claims to the current ACL TOP Family. Linearity results for all assays on all instrument models passed the acceptance criteria of Slope $1 . 0 \pm 0 . 1$ and $\mathrm { \Delta r } ^ { 2 } \geq 0 . 9 6 0$ .

# d. Carryover:

# Sample Carryover: Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin carryover was assess in an internal study using two pools prepared as follows: one with no interferent (Normal Pooled Plasma or NPP), and one with high levels of interferent (hemoglobin). A series of samples of each pool were run in the following sequence: NPP, NPP, interferent, interferent, interferent, interferent, and NPP on each model instrument. The results for the seventh cup (i.e., NPP) were compared to the NPP baseline results and percent difference was calculated by (test result‐baseline/baseline) $\textbf { x } 1 0 0$ . The hemoglobin carry over studies were performed on the ACL TOP 350 CTS, ACL TOP 550 CTS, ACL TOP 750 and ACL TOP 750 CTS. Results on all instruments passed the acceptance criteria of $\%$ change from baseline $\pm 1 5 \%$ .

# Sample Carryover: Bilirubin

Bilirubin carryover was assessed in an internal study using two pools prepared as follows: one with no interferent (Normal Pooled Plasma or NPP), and one with high levels of interferent (bilirubin). A series of samples of each pool were run in the following sequence: NPP, NPP, interferent, interferent, interferent, interferent, and NPP on each model instrument. The results for the seventh cup (i.e., NPP) were compared to the NPP baseline results and percent difference was calculated by (test result‐baseline/baseline) $\textbf { x } 1 0 0$ . The bilirubin carry over studies were performed on the ACL TOP 350 CTS, ACL TOP 550 CTS, ACL TOP 750 and ACL TOP 750 CTS. Results on all instruments passed the acceptance criteria of $\%$ change from baseline $\leq$ (4 within‐run SD/control mean) $\mathbf { x } 1 0 0$ , using the within‐run SD and control (or $\leq 1 9 . 6 \%$ ).

Sample Carryover: Lipemia (Turbidity) Lipemia carryover was assess in an internal study with two pools prepared as follows:

one with no interferent (Normal Pooled Plasma or NPP), and one with high levels of interferent (turbidity, i.e. lipemia). A series of samples of each pool were run in the following sequence: NPP, NPP, interferent, interferent, interferent, interferent, and NPP on each model instrument. The results for the seventh cup (i.e., NPP) were compared to the NPP baseline results and percent difference was calculated by (test result‐baseline/baseline) $\textbf { x } 1 0 0$ . The lipemia carry over studies were performed on the ACL TOP 350 CTS, ACL TOP 550 CTS, ACL TOP 750 and ACL TOP 750 CTS. Results on all instruments passed the acceptance criteria of $\%$ change from baseline $\pm 1 5 \%$ .

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

Pre-Analytical Clog Detection Testing

A Pre-Analytical Clog Detection test was conducted internally on ACL TOP Family 50 Series model instruments (2 ACL TOP 350 CTS models; 2 ACL TOP 550 CTS models; 2 ACL TOP 750 models; 2 ACL TOP 750 CTS models; 1 ACL TOP 750 LAS model). All instrument models correctly detected an occluded sample probe.

# Pre-Analytical Tube Fill Height Check Testing

A Pre-Analytical Tube Fill Height Check test was conducted internally on ACL TOP Family 50 Series model instruments (2 ACL TOP 350 CTS models; 2 ACL TOP 550 CTS models; 2 ACL TOP 750 models; 2 ACL TOP 750 CTS models). All instrument models correctly detected when tubes were underfilled.

# Matrix Comparison

Matrix studies were conducted to compare paired samples from the same donor drawn in $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate (test) collection tubes and lithium heparin (comparator method) collection tubes on the HemoCue (Hemoglobin) and Envoy 500 (Total Bilirubin) analyzers as samples used in the internal method comparison. The matrix comparison study results support equivalent performance between the comparator devices (HemoCue and Envoy 500 analyzers) originally cleared sample matrix (lithium heparin) and $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate used in the internal method comparison study.
