# 7. Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of the substantial equivalence determination.

# 7.1 Method comparison

Method comparison studies designed according to EP09-A3 CLSI Guideline “Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples” were conducted at three external sites in the United States, all sites using the same protocols.

Samples were measured on both the predicate device (Sysmex CA-1500) as well as the new device (Sysmex CS-2100i), in random order as to eliminate any inherent bias. Results were compared by Passing-Bablok regression analysis as well as Bland-Altman plots. Results from each application met the pre-established acceptance criteria. The following summary of PassingBablok regression shows that the proposed and predicate devices provide equivalent results when used in a clinical setting.

# 7.2 Reproducibility Studies

Twenty-day precision studies were performed at two external sites in Germany and one external site in the United States. Testing followed the scheme of two runs per day, with two replicates per run, at each of the three sites according to CLSI EP05-A2 “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”. The order of the analysis of parameter, samples and quality control samples for each run and day was varied so as not to add an inherent bias to the study. One calibration curve of each calibrated application was used in the study. Within Run, Between Run, Between Day and Total (within site) variability were calculated. The data for normal mode are summarized in the following tables.

The INNOVANCE $\textcircled{8}$ D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the Sysmex CS-2100i in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) using frozen specimens collected prospectively from 1930 consecutive outpatients presenting to the emergency or ambulatory department with suspected PE. Of these 1930 patients, 96 were excluded for a total of 1834 patients.

All potentially eligible patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate their pre-test probability (PTP) with regard to PE, and then categorized into high, intermediate or low PTP. Patients with a high PTP score were excluded from enrollment. Patients with no or a positive Ddimer result with the D-dimer assay used at the respective study center were evaluated by imaging methods, e.g. spiral CT and/or VQ scan. Patients with a negative D-dimer result with the D-dimer assay used at the respective study center underwent imaging at the physician’s discretion. All patients with a negative diagnosis of PE at presentation were followed up after three months to evaluate potential development of PE. Patients with unobtainable follow-up data were excluded from analysis resulting in $\mathsf { n } { = } 1 4 6 7$ patients available for final analysis.

The overall prevalence of PE in the 1467 patients was $6 . 9 \%$ (101 of 1467) with $6 . 0 \%$ in the US population and $3 7 . 2 \%$ in the European population. The specimens were tested with the INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer assay and results were compared to a cut-off value of $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU. A D-dimer result $< 0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU was considered negative and a D-dimer result $\ge 0 . 5 0 \ m { \mathfrak { g } } / \mathsf { L }$ FEU was considered positive. The instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) with lower bound of a two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence limits (LCL) were obtained with the INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer clinical cut-off of $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU. Results obtained for each study population are detailed below.

# 8. Conclusion

Since the predicate device was cleared based in part on the results of clinical studies, and since clinical settings are required for a well-validated device, clinical testing was required to support substantial equivalence. The non-clinical data support the safety of the device. The hardware and software verification and validation demonstrate that the Sysmex CS-2100i performs as intended in the specified use conditions. The clinical data demonstrates that the Sysmex CS-2100i performs comparably to the predicate device that is currently marketed for the same intended use. The data submitted for this Premarket Notification demonstrate that the device raises no new concerns as to safety and effectiveness when compared to the predicate device, and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
