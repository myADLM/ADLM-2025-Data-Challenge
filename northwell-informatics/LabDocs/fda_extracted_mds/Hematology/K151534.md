Re: K151534 Trade/Device Name: HemosIL D-Dimer HS Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.7320 Regulation Name: Fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products assay Regulatory Class: II Product Code: DAP Dated: June 5, 2015 Received: June 8, 2015

Dear Ms. Malladi:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

When a plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with the LatexReagent and the Reaction Buffer included in the D-Dimer HS kit, thecoated latex particles agglutinate. The degree of agglutination isdirectly proportional to the concentration of D-Dimer in the sampleand is determined by measuring the decrease of the transmittedlight caused by the aggregates (turbidimetric immunoassay).</td></tr></table>

# Comparison to Predicate:

This Special $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ is being submitted to add general information from peer-reviewed published literature to the Summary and Principle section of the HemosIL D-Dimer HS insert sheet regarding the association of patient age with D-Dimer levels.

The submission meets the criteria for a Special 510(k) based on the following:

No change in indications for use or intended use No change in operating principle No change to labeled performance claims, including no change to the assay cut-off No change to stability claims or to storage instructions   
• No change to reagent preparation   
• No change to specimen collection and preparation No change to formulation or materials   
• No change to data reduction software   
• No change to test parameters   
• No change to calibration No change to quality controls

Following is a description of the similarities and differences between the currently marketed HemosIL D-Dimer HS (K070927) and HemosIL D-Dimer HS with the insert sheet modifications:
