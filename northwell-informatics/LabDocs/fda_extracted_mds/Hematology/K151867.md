# D. Indication/Intended Use

The STA R $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathbf { \otimes } }$ is a fully automatic clinical instrument designed to perform tests on human plasmas, the results of which aid in the diagnosis of coagulation abnormalities or in monitoring anticoagulant therapy.

# E. Purpose of the Special 510(k) Notice

The STA R $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathbf { \otimes } }$ is a modification to the company's own legally marketed device, STAR Evolution® Expert Series (K093001).

The modifications of the device involve: -1- Implementation of a new graphical user interface (GUI) to use the graphical chart of Max line of STA Analyzers.

-2- Changes to the external design (colors and shape) of the analyzer which include modifications of the openings and the addition of a new computer table for improved ergonomics.   
-3- Improvement of the communication protocol with a LIS or a middleware so more information can be exchanged.

# F. Description of the device

Diagnostica Stago's STA R $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathbf { \otimes } }$ is a fully automatic clinical laboratory designed as a modification to the company's previously cleared STA-R Evolution® Expert Series analyzer (K093001). It performs tests which aid in the diagnosis of Haemostatic disorders and the monitoring of anticoagulant treatment.

The device consists of the following components:

-1- a cuvette, which holds the patient sample and any needed reagent;   
-2- a metal ball located in the cuvette, that is induced to oscillate to measure coagulation;   
-3- three needles that will aspirate and dispense the patient's sample and reagents into the cuvette;   
-4- oscillation amplitude detection of a metal ball in a cuvette to measure sample coagulation by the chronometric method;   
-5- a light source and sensor to transmit light through the cuvette containing the sample and reagents that subsequently measures the light absorbed as a reaction takes place;   
-6- Software which conducts the measurement and test determination;

# 1) Principles of Operation

The principles of operation are the same as described for STA –R Evolution® Expert Series (predicate device) in submission, K093001. A brief summary follows:

The STA R $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathbf { \otimes } }$ is designed as a fully automatic system. Samples and test reagents are loaded into the instrument where sample handling, reagent delivery, analysis, and reporting of results are performed automatically. A central processing unit controls instrument functions such as, management of patient results, quality control, system supervision, support for instrument maintenance, and workload optimization.

The instrument utilizes Diagnostica Stago reagents in addition to open adaptation of other currently available reagents. Barcoding of test reagents, calibrators and controls facilitate their use on the system and facilitates reagent management. Manual entry of reagent information enables the use of non-barcoded-reagents.

There are two methods used by the instrument to measure coagulation: the chronometric (clotting time or clot-based measurements) and photometric assays (at specific wave lengths) on plasma samples.

# 2) Fundamental technologies

The Technological characteristics are the same for the STA R $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathbf { \otimes } }$ and the STA-R Evolution® Expert Series

Chronometry Measurement Principle

The principle consists in measuring the variations of the ball oscillation amplitude through inductive sensors. The ball has a pendular movement obtained:

- due to the two curved rail tracks in the bottom of the cuvettes - and an alternating electromagnetic field generated by two independent drive coils.

The oscillation amplitude is constant when the viscosity of the medium through which the ball moves remains constant.

The oscillation amplitude decreases when the viscosity of this medium increases as shown in Schema 1.

Schema 1: Amplitude of the ball oscillation during clotting

Photometry Measurement Principle

The detection principle for chromogenic or immunological analyses on the STA R $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathbf { \otimes } }$ is based on the absorbance (optical density, O.D.) of monochromatic (405 nm or $5 4 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ) light passing through a cuvette as an enzymatic or immunological reaction takes place.

The principle underlying the measurement of absorbance is depicted in the Schema 2 below:

![](images/6e3620942a5f63f0e1cc2377ca8f079039caa753bdc40046c9b1da08f34f786a.jpg)  
Schema 2: Measurement principle of absorbance

Incident light $( \mathrm { l } _ { 0 } )$ entering the cuvette is partially absorbed by the reaction medium as it passes through.

The transmitted light $\left( \mathrm { I } _ { 1 } = \mathrm { I } + \mathrm { I } _ { \mathrm { p } } \right)$ is measured.

The effect of stray light $\left( \mathrm { I _ { p } } \right)$ is eliminated by taking two measurements of transmitted light within a brief interval:

$\mathrm { I } _ { 1 } = \mathrm { I } + \mathrm { I } _ { \mathrm { p } }$ (first measurement which includes incident light and stray light)

$\mathrm { I } _ { 2 } = \mathrm { I } _ { \mathrm { p } }$ (second measurement, while blocking incident light, corresponds to the stray light)

$1 _ { 2 }$ is subtracted from $1 _ { 1 }$ to obtain I, which corresponds to light resulting only from incident light. Stray light $\left( \mathrm { I _ { p } } \right)$ is assumed to remain constant between the two measurements.

The absorbance is calculated using the following equation:

$\mathbf { A } = - \mathrm { l o g } ( \mathrm { I } / \mathrm { I } _ { 0 } )$ note: log decimal

Monochromatic incident light $\left( \mathrm { I } _ { 0 } \right)$ is produced by passing light from a tungstenhalogen lamp through a $4 0 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ or $5 4 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ monochromatic filter, placed in a mobile filter holder.

These parts are located inside the optical module. The monochromatic light is directed from the optical module to the measurement heads by optical fibers, then another set of optical fibers carries the light from the measurement heads to the photometry measurement board.

# G. Substantial Equivalence

Comparison between the predicate and subject devices have minor differences. The differences are a result of the obsolescence of computer peripherals such as floppy discs, computer processors, and the addition of the new graphic interface and evolution of the communication protocol have no impact on performance, principle of operation, or fundamental technology. The modifications of external design (e.g. color, weight, dimension, and shape) are ergonomic and cosmetic enhancements, which neither affect the fundamental technology, nor raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness. Thus the two devices are substantially equivalent with respect to their key attributes.

# Conclusion

The STA R $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathbb { Q } }$ and its Predicate Device, STA-R Evolution® Expert Series (K093001), have the same Intended Use/Indications for Use, same fundamental technology, same principles of operation, and comparable performance characteristics. The modifications consist of changes to the software (to integrate a new graphical user interface and a new communication protocol), new peripherals, and new external shape (for ergonomic improvements).

As evidenced by risk assessment and verification and validation activities, no new questions of safety and effectiveness were raised. Therefore we believe, the STA R $\mathbf { M a x } ^ { \mathbb { Q } }$ is substantially equivalent to the STA-R Evolution® Expert Series (K093001) predicate device.
