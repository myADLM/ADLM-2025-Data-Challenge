Dear Dr. Brix:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

# 6. Device Description:

The Dextramer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CMV Kit comprises 5 CMV Dextramers, Negative control as well as 3 antibodies recognizing CD3, CD4, and CD8:

The Dextramer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CMV Kit accurately enumerates CMV-specific T cells in blood samples. This involves a two-step procedure followed by analysis by flow cytometry:

Step 1: Determination of the percentage of CMV-specific ${ \mathsf { C D 3 } } ^ { + } { \mathsf { C D 8 } } ^ { + } { \mathsf { 7 } }$ T cells in the sample (Tube A)

Step 2: Determination of the absolute number of ${ \mathsf { C D 3 } } ^ { + } { \mathsf { C D } } 8 ^ { + }$ T-cells in the sample (Tube C)

The absolute number of CMV-specific ${ \mathsf { C D 3 } } ^ { + } { \mathsf { C D } } 8 ^ { + }$ T cells/µl blood is then determined.

# 7. Intended use(s):

Dextramer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CMV Kit is a semi-quantitative assay intended for the identification and enumeration of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific $\mathtt { C D 8 + }$ T cells in anticoagulated (Na Heparin) whole blood specimens by flow cytometry.

Dextramer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CMV Kit is indicated for assessment of CMV-specific immune status and risk of CMV reactivation in adult human stem cell transplant patients following immunosuppression and used in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.

The kit cannot be used to measure CMV infection or disease.

The kit is limited to individuals with the following HLA types: $\mathsf { A } ^ { \star } 0 1 0 1$ , $\mathsf { A } ^ { \star } 0 2 0 1$ , $\mathsf { B } ^ { \star } 0 7 0 2$ , $\mathtt { B } ^ { \star } 0 8 0 1$ , $\mathtt { B } ^ { \star } 3 5 0 1$ .

Special instrument requirements:

FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

Special instrument requirements:

FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

# 9. Performance Characteristics:

Non-clinical studies

Analytical sensitivity The functional assay sensitivity is $1 { \mathsf { c e l l s } } / \mu \up$ as determined by the lowest concentration of cells $( \mathsf { c e l l s } / \mu \mathsf { l } )$ that can be determined with a $C V \%$ below $20 \%$ .

Analytical specificity

$100 \%$ (35/35) routine blood specimens from CMV seronegative stem cell transplant recipients showed 0.00 – 0.06 cells/µl and thus below the functional assay sensitivity of 1 cell/µl.

Inter-lab reproducibility The inter-lab reproducibility CV ranged between $6 \%$ and $18 \%$ .

Intra-lab reproducibility The intra-lab reproducibility CV ranged between $5 \%$ and $14 \%$ .

Linearity – Recovery The Dextramer CMV assay showed linearity in the range of 1-107 CMV-specific T cells/µl with a slope ranging from 0.98-1.08. Recovery was $7 3 - 1 3 4 \%$ .

# Interference

There was no significant interference from the tested cell populations equivalent to 2x normal level for monocytes, equivalent to 3x normal level for granulocytes, equivalent to $3 \mathsf { x }$ normal level for platelets, and equivalent to 2x normal level for red blood cells.

# Cross-reaction

No significant cross-reaction with allele mismatching CMV Dextramer reagents. All results from analysis of 4 blood samples with CMV-specific T cells with HLA mis-matched CMV Dextramer were within 0.00 – 0.11 cells/µl and thus below the functional assay sensitivity of 1 cell/µl.

# Comparison with predicate

Analysis of blood specimens from stem cell transplant recipients representing 5 alleles for a total of 117 MHC multimer measurements using iTAg MHC Tetramer CMV Kit and Dextramer CMV Kit showed substantial equivalence based on

Deming regression for enumeration of the subset of $\mathtt { C D 8 + }$ T-cells and CMVspecific T-cells.

# Clinical studies

A prospective study with 120 allogeneic SCT patients followed for up to one year for recurrence of CMV infection and determination of numbers of CMV-specific $\mathtt { C D 8 + }$ T cells using the CMV Dextramer Kit. Dextramer analysis were performed pre-transplant at day 30, 100 and 360 and included the alleles HLA-A\*0101, $\mathsf { A } ^ { \star } 0 2 0 1$ , $\mathsf { B } ^ { \star } 0 7 0 2$ , $\mathtt { B } ^ { \star } 0 8 0 1$ and $\mathtt { B } ^ { \star } 3 5 0 1$ .

68 patients were CMV seropositive (recipient and/or donor) prior to transplantation of which 34 patients developed antigenimia.

2x2 tables are provided for each time point posttransplant showing correlation of CMV-specific T-cell and occurance of CMV antigenimia and used for calculation of the risk of CMV infection/antigenimia after Day 100

# Risk of developing CMV antigenemia after Day 100

Risk is defined as risk of patients with less than 7 cells/ul of developing CMV infection post Day 100 compared to patients with more than 7 cells/ul.

Dextramer results were evaluated at Day 30, 100, and Day 365 post-transplant. Only day 100 shows significant association between CMV-specific $\mathtt { C D 8 + }$ T cells status $- 7$ cells/µL or $\geq 7$ cells/µL) and development of antigenemia. Results summarized in the table above show that the relative risk in developing antigenemia is 3.4 $9 5 \%$ CI: 1.57 – 7.46) for patients with $< 7$ cells/µL CMVspecific $\mathtt { C D 8 + }$ T cells determined by the Dextramer CMV kit, as compared to patients with $\geq 7$ cells/µL CMV-specific $\mathtt { C D 8 + }$ T cells.

# 10. Conclusion:

The Dextramer $\textcircled{8}$ CMV Kit has similar intended use and indications as the predicates iTAg MHC Tetramer CMV Kit.

The performance of the Dextramer CMV Kit is substantially equivalent to the performances of iTAg MHC Tetramer CMV Kit.

Clinical data support the use of Dextramer $\textcircled{8}$ CMV Kit for assessment of CMVspecific immune status and risk of CMV reactivation in adult human stem cell transplant patients following immunosuppression and for use in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.
