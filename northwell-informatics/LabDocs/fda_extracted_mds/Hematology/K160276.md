Dear Ms. Malladi:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you; however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, -Misbranding by reference to premarket notification- (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

ACL TOP (ACL TOP 700; ACL TOP 700 CTS; ACL TOP 700 LAS; ACL TOP 500 CTS; ACL TOP 300 CTS)

Indications for Use (Describe)   
The ACL TOP is a bench top, fully automated, random access analyzer designed specifically for in vitro diagnostic clinical use in the hemostasis laboratory for coagulation and/or fibrinolysis testing in the assessment of thrombosis and/or hemostasis.

The system provides results for both direct hemostasis measurements and calculated parameters.

This section applies only to requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.

# Comparison to Predicate:

This Special $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ is being submitted to switch the operating system from Windows XP to Windows 7 for ACL TOP Family Instruments.

The submission meets the criteria for a Special 510(k) based on the following:

 No change in indications for use or intended use   
 No change in operating principle   
 No change to labeled performance claims, for the instrument family of the associated reagents   
 No change to hardware   
 No change to data reduction software   
 No change to test parameters   
 No change to calibration   
 No change to quality controls No change to consumables   
 No change to reagents

Following is a description of the similarities and differences between the currently marketed ACL TOP Family (K073377, K091980 (LAS model) ) and ACL TOP Family with the Software 5. 3 update:

# Conclusion:

Based on the shared indications for use, operating principle, consumables, reagents, controls and calibrators, the ACL TOP Family with software v5.3 running on the Windows 7 operating system can be concluded to be substantially equivalent to the cleared and currently marketed predicate device, ACL TOP Family.
