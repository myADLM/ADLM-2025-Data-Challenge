# Description of the Device

# Clinical Significance

Hemoglobin A1c is an important test recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and its usefulness was clarified by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). Currently, as part of the diabetes management program, HbA1c testing should be performed at least biannually in all patients and quarterly for patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting treatment goals. Glycohemoglobin is produced by non-enzymatic addition of glucose to amino groups in hemoglobin. HbA1c refers to glucose modified hemoglobin A (HbA) specifically at N-terminal valine residues of hemoglobin beta chains. HbA1c test is used both as an index of mean glycemia and as a measure of risk for the development of diabetes complications. Therefore, the HbA1c test is a good indicator of glycemic control in the preceding 2-3 months.

# Assay Principle

Diazyme Direct HbA1c test is an enzymatic assay in which lysed whole blood samples are subjected to extensive protease digestion with Bacillus sp protease. This process releases amino acids including glycated valines from the hemoglobin beta chains. Glycated valines then serve as substrates for specific recombinant fructosyl valine oxidase (FVO) enzyme. The recombinant FVO specifically cleaves N-terminal valines and produces hydrogen peroxide. This, in turn, is measured using a horseradish peroxidase (POD) catalyzed reaction and a suitable chromogen. No separate measurement for total Hemoglobin (Hb) is needed in this Direct HbA1c Assay.

# Detailer Device Description

1. The Diazyme Direct HbA1c assay kit (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) is comprised of a Reagent 1, Reagent 2, Lysis Buffer.   
2. Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay Calibrator Set: 2 levels, human whole blood based in lyophilized form. It is intended to be used for calibration of Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis).   
3. Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay Control Set: 2 levels, human whole blood based in lyophilized form. It is intended to be used for quality control by monitoring accuracy and precision of Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis).

The verification and/or validation studies were performed on the automated chemistry analyzer Roche Modular P (k953239/005). Modular $\mathrm { P }$ analyzer is a high through-put automated chemistry analyzer and that can process 800 samples per hour. The predicate performance studies at submission were performed on Hitachi 917 which is an obsolete member of the Roche Mod P Roche family of instruments. The Control Unit of the Roche Modular P analyzer uses a graphical interface to control all instrument functions. The computer, keyboard, and touchscreen monitor allows users to navigate through the software, enter assay, calibrator, and control information, and make test selections. The Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay Modular $\mathrm { P }$ application parameters provided are programmed into the Modular P analyzers. The reagents, calibrators and controls are loaded into the analyzer. The Roche Modular $\mathrm { P }$ stores the Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay reagents in a refrigerated compartment. Reagent and sample pipettes automatically aspirate and dispense specified amounts of reagents or calibrators, controls, and samples into reaction cells. The change in absorbance is measured at specified wavelengths.

# Assay Scheme for Roche Modular P Analyzer

Use the following scheme as a guideline for analyzer application. Note: Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay is an end-point assay and the first reading point A1 is right before the addition of reagent R2.

![](images/df6cab0380c23900bdfb8fbcecedbb1010d7d7196fca27d66be308dad2249c14.jpg)  
Blood: $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ Lysis Buffer: $1 2 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$

After a 2-point calibration, linear-fitting is used to fit calibration curve through mean values of the response for calibrators of known concentrations. The Roche Modular $\mathrm { P }$ calculates the $\mathrm { H b A l c \% }$ concentration of a patient sample by interpolation of the obtained signal to a stored 2- point calibration curve.

#: The Modular $\mathrm { P }$ analyzer performs automatic on-board 1: 12.5 dilution using lysis buffer (10 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ sample $+ \ 1 2 5 \ \mu \mathrm { L }$ lysis buffer) for rapid blood sample lysis.

The following key parameters are input into the Mod P user defined channel interface using the provided Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (DZ168C) Parameter sheet.

Conclusion: 20-day reproducibility data for all samples tested showed that the within-run, between-run, between-day, between-lot and total $C V \%$ were less than $2 \%$ , meeting acceptance criteria.

2) Multiple Site Precision Study (Three sites)   
Multiple site precision study was performed at two external sites and the Diazyme site. In this study, same sets of samples were used at all sites. Multiple site precision of the Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay was evaluated according to a modified CLSI EP5-A2 guideline on Roche Modular $\mathrm { P }$ analyzer. Five whole blood samples containing $4 . 6 \%$ , $5 . 4 \%$ , $7 . 5 \%$ , $9 . 7 \%$ and $1 1 . 9 \%$ HbA1c spanning assay AMR, three lots of calibrators and three lots of controls were tested in duplicates per run, 2 runs per day for 5 working days with the same lot of the reagent to evaluate between site assay precision. Testing was conducted at 3 different sites, by 3 different operators, on 3 different Modular $\mathrm { P }$ instruments. Within-run, between-run, between-day, between-site, and total precision were calculated.

Multiple site precision data is summarized in the following table:

# Summary of Rationale for Considering the Device Substantially Equivalent to Devices Approved for Interstate Commerce

In summary, the Intended Use of the modified device has not changed. The assay principle and fundamental scientific technology of the modified device has not changed. The major changes are in the number of reagents supplied (from 3 reagent plus lysis buffer to 2 reagents plus lysis buffer), Concentration of components in the reagents and labeling changes reflecting the modification. Design control activities including precision, limit of quantitation, linearity, accuracy and interference studies demonstrates that the Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) is substantially similar to the predicate device (k070734) and is safe and effective. There is no significant deviation between performance of the modified device Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) and the predicate device. The differences in the assay steps should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Diazyme Direct Hba1c assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis). Diazyme Direct HbA1c assay calibrator is traceable to NGSP certification for the modified device. The legally marketed device Tosoh HPLC HbA1c Test is used as standard NGSP certification method in NGSP reference laboratories and was thus selected for accuracy study. The Tosoh HPLC HbA1c Test is also the device used in accuracy studies for the predicate Diazyme HbA1c Enzymatic assay device (k070734). The accuracy studies with whole blood samples tested with the modified device unequivocally demonstrated excellent correlation. In conclusion, the Diazyme Direct HbA1c Assay (Enzymatic, On-Board Lysis) for measurement of HbA1c in patient whole blood samples is substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices. The differences in the assay steps should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Diazyme Direct HbA1c assay (Enzymatic, OnBoard Lysis) and risk analysis performed indicates no change in risk stance. The Diazyme Direct HbA1c assay gives similar diagnostic information as the other legally marketed HbA1c tests and offers users a rapid and convenient device for measuring HbA1c in human blood.
