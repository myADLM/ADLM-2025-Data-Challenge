# I. Special Control/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI H59-A Quantitative D-dimer for the Exclusion of Venous Thromboembolic Disease

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

Applicable analytical performance studies using the INNOVANCE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer assay on the Sysmex CS-2100i are documented in K151259. The following studies were performed and were not necessary to reproduce for this submission because the performance remains unchanged: method comparison with predicate device, clinical cutoff validation for pulmonary embolism (PE), precision/reproducibility, linearity, detection limit, carryover, interfering substances, on-board stability for reagent and control material, ambient temperature tolerance testing, expected values/reference range, dilution options comparison, and normal mode vs. micro mode comparison.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

Clinical cut-off: Validation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

The INNOVANCE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer in a multi-center study at U.S. and foreign (European) sites to validate the exclusion of a first event of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These sites were emergency or ambulatory departments.

All potentially eligible patients who were suspected of having a first event DVT were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate their pre-test probability (PTP), and then categorized into likely or unlikely, or alternatively as high, intermediate or low PTP. Patients with a high PTP score were excluded from enrollment. Patients with no or a positive D-dimer result with the D-dimer assay used at each study center were

evaluated by imaging methods . Patients with a negative D-dimer result with the Ddimer assay used at each study center underwent imaging at the physician’s discretion.

All patients with a negative clinical diagnosis of DVT at presentation were followed up after three months to evaluate potential development of DVT.

Specimens were collected prospectively from 1907 consecutive outpatients and stored frozen. Of these 1907 patients, 368 were excluded from analysis based on the preanalytical and post-analytical exclusion criteria (including 213 patients reported to have a previously documented or chronic DVT), resulting in a total of 1539 patients. In addition, patients with unobtainable follow-up data were excluded from analysis resulting in 1317 patients available for final analysis. The overall prevalence of DVT in the 1317 patients was $6 . 1 \%$ (80 of 1317) with $7 . 0 \%$ in the U.S. patients and $4 . 7 \%$ in the European patients.

The specimens collected in clinical sites were tested with the INNOVANCE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ DDimer assay on the Sysmex CS-2100i analyzer and results were compared to a cut-off value of $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU. A D-dimer result $< 0 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU was considered negative and a D-dimer result ${ \geq } 0 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU was considered positive. Instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) with lower bound (LCL) of a two-sided $9 5 \ \%$ confidence interval were calculated. Results obtained for each study population are detailed below:
