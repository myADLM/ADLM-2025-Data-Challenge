Dear Mr. Neumann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, sMisbranding by reference to premarket notifications (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

The subject of this 510(k) notification is to expand the use of the INNOVANCE $\textcircled{8}$ D-Dimer for the exclusion of Deep Vein Thrombosis on Sysmex CS-5100. All other established indications, performance and technology characteristics as cleared under K150678 remain unchanged.

# 5. Intended Use / Indications for Use

The Sysmex CS-5100 is a fully automated blood coagulation analyzer intended for in vitro diagnostic use using plasma collected from venous blood samples in $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate tubes to analyze clotting, chromogenic and immunoassay methods in the clinical laboratory.

For determination of:

Prothrombin Time (PT) seconds and PT INR with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Innovin® Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) with Dade $\textcircled{8}$ Actin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FSL Fibrinogen (Fbg) with Dade $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Thrombin Reagent Antithrombin (AT) with INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Antithrombin − D-dimer with INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer.

The performance of this device has not been established in neonate and pediatric patient populations.

# 6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics with the Predicate Device

Both the subject and predicate instruments employ the same technological characteristics in that they automatically analyze various clotting tests using reagents, calibrators and controls previously cleared for automated coagulation analyzers. The reagents perform at least equally well on both the subject and predicate instruments. At a high level, the devices have the following same technological elements:

# 7.1 D-Dimer DVT Exclusion Validation Study

The INNOVANCE $\textcircled{8}$ D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS-5100 System in a multicenter study to validate the exclusion of a first event of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) using frozen specimens collected prospectively from 1907 consecutive outpatients presenting to the emergency or ambulatory department with suspected DVT. Of these 1907 patients, 368 were excluded from analysis (including 213 patients reported to have a previously documented or chronic DVT) resulting in a total of 1539 patients. All potentially eligible patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate their pre-test probability (PTP) with regard to DVT, and then categorized into likely or unlikely, or alternatively as high, intermediate or low PTP. Patients with a high PTP score were excluded from enrollment. Patients with no or a positive D-dimer result with the D-dimer assay used at the respective study center were evaluated by imaging methods, e.g. ultrasound. Patients with a negative D-dimer result with the D-dimer assay used at the respective study center underwent imaging at the physician’s discretion. All patients with a negative clinical diagnosis of DVT at presentation were followed up after three months to evaluate potential development of DVT. Patients with unobtainable follow-up data were excluded from analysis resulting in $\mathsf { n } = \mathsf { 1 } 3 \mathsf { 1 7 }$ patients available for final analysis. The overall prevalence of DVT in the 1317 patients was $6 . 1 \%$ (80 of 1317) with $7 . 0 \%$ in the US population and $4 . 7 \%$ in the European population.

The specimens were tested with the INNOVANCE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer assay and results were compared to a cut-off value of $0 . 5 0 \mathsf { m g / L }$ FEU. A D-dimer result ${ < } 0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FEU was considered negative and a D-dimer result $\ge 0 . 5 0 \ m { \mathfrak { g } } / \mathrm { L }$ FEU was considered positive. The instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) with lower bound (LCL) of a two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval were calculated. Results obtained for each study population are detailed below.
