Dear Dr. Dissmann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

# Options and Accessories

Options and accessories that can be used for this instrument are as follows:

(1) Waste tank (with float switch for waste tank): Waste fluids discharged from the Main Unit enter this tank.   
(2) Wand barcode reader: Reads barcodes to input sample numbers, rack numbers and reagent IDs.   
(3) 2D barcode reader: Reads barcodes to input calibrator’s or reagent’s assay sheet values, normal values and ISI values, and control’s targets/limits.   
(4) IPU cart: The IPU (which includes the keyboard, PC and touch panel display), and the tanks for waste, rinse and CA Clean II can be placed on this cart.   
(5) External indicator light: The status of the instrument is indicated with a red, yellow or green light that can be seen when the operator is not directly in front of the instrument.   
(6) IPU holder: This is an optional holder for the IPU which includes the keyboard, PC and touch panel display which can be installed on the right side of the instrument to minimize the instrument footprint.

The instrument is capable of measuring in the following analysis modes:

(1) Normal mode: Samples for all the analyses including re-analyses are taken into the instrument at the same time and analyzed. In a normal mode, a capped sample tube analysis can be performed. Automatic re-analysis can also be performed.   
(2) Micro-sample mode: Samples set in the sampler or STAT holder are taken into the instrument for each analysis through a secondary dispensing sample probe. When measurements are to be performed in Micro mode, sample tubes must be uncapped. The instrument detects capped tubes automatically and displays an error message. This analysis mode can be performed with less sample volume than normal mode (consult instruction manual for further information). However, automatic re-analysis cannot be performed.

# 7 Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of the substantial equivalence determination.

# 7.1 Method comparison

Method comparison studies designed according to EP09-A3 CLSI Guideline ‘Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples’ were conducted at four external sites in the United States, all sites using the same protocol.

Samples were measured on both the predicate device (Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA-1500) as well as the new device (Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS-5100), in random order to eliminate any inherent bias. Results were compared by Passing-Bablok regression analysis as well as Bland-Altman plots. Results from each application met the predetermined acceptance criteria. The following summary of PassingBablok regression shows that the proposed and predicate devices provide equivalent results when used in a clinical setting.

# 7.2 Reproducibility Studies

Twenty-day precision studies were performed at two external sites in Germany and one external site in the United States. Testing followed the scheme of two runs per day, with two replicates per run, at each of the three sites according to CLSI EP05-A2 ‘Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods’. The order of the analysis of parameter, samples and quality control samples for each run and day varied to avoid an inherent bias to the study. One calibration curve of each calibrated application was used in the study. Within Run, Between Run, Between Day, and Total (within site) were calculated. The data is summarized in the following tables.

# 8 Conclusions

Because the predicate device was cleared based in part on the results of clinical studies, and because clinical settings are required for a well-validated device, clinical testing was required to support substantial equivalence.

The non-clinical data support the safety of the device.

The clinical data demonstrate that the Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS-5100 performs comparably to the predicate device that is currently marketed for the same intended use.

The data submitted for this premarket notification demonstrates that the device raises no new concerns as to safety and effectiveness when compared to the predicate device, and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
