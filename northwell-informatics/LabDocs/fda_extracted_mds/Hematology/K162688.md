Dear Ms. Noeh:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

The instrument is capable of measuring in the following analysis modes:

(1) Normal mode: Samples for all the analyses including re-analyses are taken into the instrument at the same time and analyzed. Automatic re-analysis can also be performed.

(2) Micro-sample mode: The sample volume from samples set in the sampler or STAT holder is taken into the instrument for each analysis through dispensing sample probe and analyzed. This analysis mode can also be performed with less sample volume than normal mode; however, automatic re-analysis cannot be performed.

The above described differences do not raise new questions as to safety and effectiveness of the new device.

# 7 Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of the substantial equivalence determination.

# 7.1 Method comparison

Method comparison studies designed according to EP09-A3 CLSI Guideline ‘Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples’ were conducted at four external sites in the United States, all sites using the same protocol.

Samples were measured on both the predicate device (Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA-1500) as well as the new device (Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS-2100i), in random order to eliminate any inherent bias. Results were compared by Passing-Bablok regression analysis as well as Bland-Altman plots. Results from each application met the predetermined acceptance criteria. The following summary of PassingBablok regression from the multi-center study shows that the proposed and predicate devices provide equivalent results when used in a clinical setting.

# 7.2 Reproducibility Studies

Twenty-day precision studies were performed at two external sites in Germany and one external site in the United States. Testing followed the scheme of two runs per day, with two replicates per run, at each of the three sites according to CLSI EP05-A2 ‘Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods’. The order of the analysis of parameter, samples and quality control samples for each run and day varied to avoid an inherent bias to the study. One calibration curve of each calibrated application was used in the study. Within Run, Between Run, Between Day, and Total (within site) were calculated. The data is summarized in the following tables.

# 8 Conclusions

Because the predicate device was cleared based in part on the results of clinical studies, and because clinical settings are required for a well-validated device, clinical testing was required to support substantial equivalence.

The non-clinical data support the safety of the device.

The clinical data demonstrate that the Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS-2100i performs comparably to the predicate device that is currently marketed for the same intended use.

The data submitted for this premarket notification demonstrates that the device raises no new concerns as to safety and effectiveness when compared to the predicate device, and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
