# Value Assignment

VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kits are manufactured such that an equal relationship exists among Levels 1 through 5; Level 1 being the lowest concentration and Level 5 being the highest. Levels 1 and 5 are prepared independently by the addition of D-Dimer to a human plasma base matrix. Levels 1 through 5 must meet specified D-Dimer target ranges at all stages of testing.

Specific recovery targets for Levels 1 through 5 are determined by the upper and lower detection limits for D-Dimer. Intermediate Levels 2, 3, and 4 are subsequently prepared from Levels 1 and 5 by equal part dilutions following EP6-A guidelines. Typical value ranges are provided in the package insert.

Typical recovery values, presented in Table 1, were established for Level 1 and Level 5 by testing 30 replicates, with values for Mid-Levels 2, 3, and 4 calculated based on an equal distance (delta) between levels.

The product is designed for laboratories to satisfy the requirements for calibration verification and verification of the systems reportable range as specified in the current CLIA regulations section 493.1255.

Table 1   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=8>Set</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Instrument</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Units</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=5>Levels1        2       3       4        5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Stago STA-R®</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>D-Dimer</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ug/mL FEU</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.32</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.05</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.78</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.50</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.23</td></tr></table>

A linear relationship exists between each level in a kit. The quantitative determination of linearity, calibration verification, and verification of reportable range relies on the known relationship between each of the levels of the product, in this case equal deltas, as outlined in the CLSI EP6-A referenced standard.

This kit is not intended for use as a calibration material.

# Precision/Reproducibility

Precision was evaluated on the Stago STA- $\cdot \mathsf { R } ^ { \otimes }$ Evolution instrument system with the VALIDATE® D-Dimer product following the product package insert instructions. Three lots of VALIDATE® D-Dimer product were tested with one lot of Stago Liatest D-Dimer reagent and quality controls on the Stago STA $\cdot \mathsf { R } ^ { \otimes }$ instrument system over 20 days, 2 runs per day, 2 replicates per run for Level 1 through Level 5 with a minimum of two operators to obtain a total of eighty (80) replicates per kit Level. All levels of the VALIDATE® D-Dimer kit met the $0 \%$ acceptance criteria on the Stago STA- $\cdot \mathsf { R } ^ { \otimes }$ instrument system.

Reproducibility was evaluated on the Stago $\mathsf { S T A } ^ { \otimes }$ instrument system with the VALIDATE® D-Dimer kit containing 5 levels following the product package insert instructions. One lot of VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit was tested with one lot of Stago LiaTest D-Dimer reagent and quality controls on three instruments, multi-site, over 5 days, with 1 run per day of Level 1-5, 5 replicates per run and a minimum of three operators to obtain seventy-five (75) replicates per kit level. All levels of the VALIDATE® D-Dimer kit met the CV% acceptance criteria on the Stago STA® instrument system.

# Traceability

This product is traceable to a reference standard based on the automated instrument platform it is used on. The traceability of our product was established on the Stago STA$\mathsf { R } ^ { \otimes }$ Evolution instrument system and is traceable to the Stago LiaTest calibrator.

# Stability

Stability testing was performed using the Stago STA- $\cdot \mathsf { R } ^ { \otimes }$ Evolution instrument system. The study testing time points included date of manufacture (DoM), followed by testing at specific intervals post manufacture.

A freeze-thaw vial stability assessment was also conducted in support of the product package insert four (4) freeze-thaw open vial events claim. All product levels tested within the acceptance criteria limits after 6 freeze-thaw vial events.

Shelf Life Claim: Stability of the VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit was set at 4 months based on available real-time stability studies. Real time stability studies are ongoing to support an extended stability claim. The recommended storage temperature is -10 to $\yen 2500$ .

# Linearity:

Linearity testing was carried out with the new device VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kits on the Stago STA $R ^ { \circledast }$ Evolution coagulation instrument. All supporting data is retained on file at Maine Standards Company LLC.

# G. Conclusion:

Based upon the purpose of the device, the descriptions and labeling of the predicate device, the VALIDATE® D-Dimer Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit behaves substantially equivalent to the predicate for the quantitative determination of linearity, calibration verification and verification of reportable range for the D-Dimer analyte. The product is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, k152961
