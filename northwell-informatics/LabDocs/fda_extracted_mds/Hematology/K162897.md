Dear Zaily Rodriguez:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm.

# Intended Use:

Navios EX Flow Cytometry System Indications for Use:

The Navios EX Flow Cytometer is intended for use as an in vitro diagnostic device for immunophenotyping using up to four fluorescent detection channels using a blue $\langle 4 8 8 \mathsf { n m } \rangle$ laser and two light scatter detection channels. . It is intended for use with in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays and software that are indicated for use with the instrument.

Navios EX tetra Software Indications for Use:

The Navios EX tetra Software is intended for use as an in vitro diagnostic device for immunophenotyping with CYTO‐STAT tetraCHROME CD45‐FITC/CD4‐RD1/ CD8‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 and CYTO‐STAT tetraCHROME CD45‐FITC/CD56‐RD1/CD19‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 monoclonal antibody reagents on the Navios EX Flow Cytometer.

It provides automated analysis and results for the identification and enumeration of $\mathsf { C D 3 + C D 4 + } ,$ , ${ \mathsf { C D 3 + C D 8 + } }$ , ${ \mathsf { C D 3 + } }$ , ${ \mathsf { C D 1 9 + } }$ and ${ \mathsf { C D 3 - C D 5 6 + } }$ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts in peripheral whole blood. Absolute counts may be determined by the Navios EX Flow Cytometers using Flow‐Count Fluorospheres (Single Platform Technology (SPT) Method) or separate hematology results (Dual Platform Method). It is indicated for use in the immunologic assessment of patients having or suspected of having immune deficiency.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusion to Demonstrate Safety, Effectiveness & Equivalent Performance to Predicate:

The Navios EX Flow Cytometry System, that is the subject of this submission, in concert with the conclusions drawn from the performance testing discussed above demonstrate that when compared to the predicate device is as safe, as effective, and meets the performance acceptance criteria.

In summary, the Navios EX Flow Cytometry System as described in this submission is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to its predicate devices.

The Navios EX Flow Cytometer, Navios EX tetra software, and tetraCHROME reagents are substantially equivalent to the Navios Flow Cytometer, Navios tetra software, and tetraCHROME reagents.

This summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 and the implementing regulation 21 CFR 807.92.
