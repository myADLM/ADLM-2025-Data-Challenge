# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Navios EX uses flow cytometric principles to determine qualitative and quantitative measurements of biological and physical properties of cells and other particles when the cells pass through the laser beam(s) in single file.

The Navios EX Flow Cytometer includes the $4 8 8 \mathrm { n m }$ laser as part of three available manufactured instrument configurations (same as the predicate, K130373).

Navios EX Flow Cytometer, 6 Color/2 Laser

Navios EX Flow Cytometer, 8 Color/2 Laser

Navios EX Flow Cytometer, 10 Color/3 Laser

The lower level configurations are upgradeable to higher level configurations by adding filters, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and activating a laser, if required. Only the $4 8 8 \mathrm { n m }$ laser is utilized for cleared IVD applications (tetraCHROME cleared in K130373) and for the $4 8 8 \mathrm { n m }$ laser, only fluorescence channel 1 (FL1) through FL4 are the subject of this 510(k) submission.

The Navios EX Flow Cytometer system consists of:

• Navios EX Flow Cytometer • Navios EX tetra Software • Navios EX Software (optional off‐line) • CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME reagents • Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres • Flow‐Check Pro Fluorospheres

• Flow‐Count Fluorospheres   
• Immuno‐Trol Cells   
• Immuno‐Trol Low Cells   
• COULTER IMMUNOPREP Reagent System   
• QuickCOMP 2 and QuickCOMP 4 Kits   
• CYTO‐COMP Cell Kit   
• ISOFLOW Sheath Fluid   
• FlowClean Cleaning Reagent   
• TQ-Prep Workstation (Accessory for Sample Preparation)   
• PrepPlus 2 Workstation (Accessory for Sample Preparation)

The Navios EX Flow Cytometer is a modification to the Navios Flow Cytometer (K130373). There are no changes to the consumables or preparation devices. The changes include:

Replacement of optical assemblies and flow cell

Navios EX System Software (on‐board): The Navios EX Flow Cytometer contains on‐board software which enables the user to acquire data from the Navios EX Flow Cytometer and to analyze, display, print and export acquired listmode data. The software has the following functions:

Daily Routine (Startup/Shutdown)   
· Setup Mode & AutoSetup   
· Quality Assurance (Controls/Calibration) Sample Analysis   
· Data Review   
· Listmode Replay Report Generation

Navios EX Software is also offered as an optional software package for use on an independent computer workstation for off‐line analysis of listmode files generated by the Navios EX Flow Cytometer with the monoclonal antibody reagents. The off‐line version utilizes the same executable software as the on-board software with the instrument control portion/features disabled. Analysis must be performed in accordance with the product labeling.

The Navios EX tetra Software is an optional software package that is separate from the

Navios EX System software. It is used for immunophenotyping with CYTO‐STAT tetraCHROME CD45‐FITC/CD4‐RD1/ CD8‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 and CYTO‐STAT tetraCHROME CD45‐FITC/CD56‐RD1/CD19‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 monoclonal antibody reagents on the Navios EX Flow Cytometer. It provides automated analysis and results for the identification and enumeration of $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ , ${ \mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + } } ,$ $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ , $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 +$ and CD3‐ $\mathrm { C D } 5 6 +$ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts in peripheral whole blood. Absolute counts may be determined by the Navios EX Flow Cytometers using Flow‐Count Fluorospheres (Single Platform Technology (SPT) Method) or separate hematology results (Dual Platform Method).

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The Navios EX flow cytometer aligns cells in suspension by hydrodynamic focusing and passes them through a laser beam one cell at a time. The scattered and fluoresced light that emanates from these cells as they intersect the laser beam is collected by photomultipler tubes and transduced to an electronic pulse and counted by the instrument’s computer. The utility of this device depends on the ability of a monoclonal antibody to bind to the surface of cells expressing discrete antigenic determinants. Specific cell staining is accomplished by incubating whole blood with the monoclonal antibody reagent, the CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8- ECD/CD3-PC5 and CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19- ECD/CD3-PC5. Monoclonal antibody reagents are each a combination of four murine monoclonal antibodies, each conjugated to a specific fluorochrome and specific for a different cell surface antigen.

Red blood cells are lysed with the COULTER ImmunoPrep Reagent System. The remaining white blood cells are analyzed on a Navios EX flow cytometer with the CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME reagents and the Navios EX tetra Software package. Navios EX System Software and Navios EX tetra Software, in conjunction with quality control reagents, provide automated standardization of light scatter and fluorescence intensities and automated adjustment of color compensation settings. The Navios EX tetra Software, in conjunction with the Navios EX Software, and CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5 and CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5 reagents, provides automated analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations.

3. Modes of Operation: Batch or single tube

4. Specimen Identification: Barcode reader or manual entry

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling: The automated sample loader for the instrument uses a carousel that holds thirty-two $1 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$

75-mm test tubes and includes a barcode reader.

6. Calibration:

Fluorescence intensity is calibrated by adjusting photomultiplier voltage using Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres (K130373). The absolute count of a population is based on the calibration factor (CAL Factor) and the number of Flow-Count fluorospheres particles within a user defined CAL region.

7. Quality Control:

IMMUNO-TROL Cells and IMMUNO-TROL Low Cells (K030828) are assayed, lysable, whole-blood quality control products used to verify the activity of the CYTOSTAT tetraCHROME reagents and to verify the methods used for staining targeted cells, lysing erythrocytes, and analyzing samples with flow cytometry.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

For all studies, the performance data met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and were found to be acceptable.

1. Method Comparisons:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP09‐A3, Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Third Edition. This prospective study was conducted with specimens collected and tested at four sites. Subjects included the population of patients presenting for diagnosis and/or prognosis of HIV or being evaluated for immune competency, patients monitored following transplantation and immunosuppression, and apparently healthy, hematologically normal individuals between 18–85 years old. A total of 424 whole blood specimens combined from all clinical sites with emphasis on the medical decision ranges for $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ (50, 100, 200, 350 and $5 0 0 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) were tested on the instrument (Navios EX) and the predicate (Navios).

The test system consisted of the Navios EX Flow Cytometer with Navios EX tetra Software and tetraCHROME reagents for $\mathrm { C D } 3 + .$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + }$ , CD3‐ $\mathrm { C D } 5 6 +$ , $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 +$ percent and absolute count with a single platform approach for absolute count using Flow‐Count Fluorospheres. The Predicate system consisted of the Navios Flow Cytometer with Navios tetra software and tetraCHROME reagents for $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + }$ , CD3‐CD $^ { 5 6 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 +$ percent and absolute count with a single platform approach for absolute count using Flow‐Count Fluorospheres.

Whole blood specimens were held at room temperature and tested at one site within 24 hours from venipuncture. Specimens were prepared in duplicate with tetraCHROME reagents (CD45‐FITC/CD4‐RD1/CD8‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 [Tetra 1] and CD45‐FTC/CD56‐RD1/CD19‐ECD/CD3‐PC5 [Tetra 2]) using the TQPrep Workstation and PrepPlus 2 Workstation analyzed once on both the Navios (predicate) and Navios EX (test) flow cytometers. The same preparation was analyzed on each cytometer. Testing between test and predicate systems was randomized daily to minimize system bias and was within 2.5 hours of each other. Three lots of reagent were used across the sites.

The data met the acceptance criteria for all parameters including $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ at medical decision levels when analyzed for each site individually as well as when all sites were combined (shown in table below).

Bias between methods was calculated from the regression line at the 25‐th, 50‐th and 75‐th percentile of the range of the comparator for all analytes and for different medical decision points of $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ counts. Confidence limits of bias estimates were calculated based of standard errors of bias and $9 5 \%$ confidence. The upper/lower confidence limits were compared to the acceptance criteria.

Navios EX flow cytometry system demonstrated acceptable accuracy compared to the predicate, Navios flow cytometer and demonstrated performance across the analytical measuring interval (AMI).

# $b$ . Instrument Configuration Comparisons

Comparability of the performance of the Navios EX flow cytometer with Navios EX tetra Software was verified for all three configurations (6 color/2 laser, 8 color/2 laser, and 10 color/3 laser) and relative to the predicate Navios flow cytometer with Navios tetra Software for absolute counts and percent positive recovery of tetraCHROME target populations. Forty-one specimens (targeting approximately $1 5 \%$ normal and $8 5 \%$ clinical) targeting medical decision points for $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ at

50, 100, 200, 350 and $5 0 0 \ { \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L } }$ were analyzed on three Navios EX flow cytometer configurations (6 color/2 laser, 8 color/2 laser and 10 color/3 laser) with Navios EX tetra Software and the predicate device, Navios flow cytometer with Navios tetra Software using tetraCHROME reagents and Flow‐Count Fluorospheres. Specimens were analyzed within 24 of venipuncture. Clinical donors were presenting for diagnosis and/or prognosis of HIV infection. Specimen samples were prepared in quadruplicate using a TQ‐Prep and PrepPlus 2 and analyzed singly on each flow cytometer.

2. Precision and Reproducibilty

# a. Precision–Long Term Imprecision

Precision Study 1: Precision study with control material using Navios EX tetra software.

Precision studies with control materials were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline. Two levels of control material (IMMUNO-TROL Cells and IMMUNO-TROL Low Cells) were evaluated in the study. The controls were prepared with tetraCHROME reagents (CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3- PC5 and CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5) and Flow-Count Fluorospheres. At one external site, controls were run in duplicate twice each day (morning and afternoon) for 20 days. At two additional external sites, controls were run in triplicate twice each day (morning and afternoon) for five days. Percent positive and absolute counts were measured for $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ , ${ \mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + } } _ { \mathrm { ; } }$ , CD3‐ $\mathrm { C D } 5 6 +$ , and $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 +$ populations for each level of control product. Absolute counts were determined using Flow‐Count Fluorospheres. A new vial of control material was opened each day of testing. The lot of control material for this testing was the same at each site so that data could be pooled during analysis. Three lots of tetraCHROME reagents, Flow‐Count Fluorospheres, and ImmunoPrep reagents were tested across the external sites. All parameters met the precision and reproducibility criteria for each site when analyzed separately and with all sites combined.

# b. Precision – Whole Blood Repeatability

The precision study was conducted with whole blood samples in accordance with CLSI guideline H26‐A2, Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology Analyzers; Approved Standard ‐ Second Edition guideline, and CLSI guideline EP05‐A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Third Edition guideline. Whole blood specimens $\mathrm { ( n { = } 1 4 1 }$ ) were selected to cover the $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ analytical measuring interval with emphasis on the medical decision levels (50, 100, 200, 350, and $5 0 0 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ ). Four $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ ranges were targeted: 20–100, 101–350, 351–500, and ${ > } 5 0 0$ . A minimum of ten clinical or hematologically normal specimens range were collected for each range across all sites. All other markers were assessed at the levels found in the clinical conditions representing the $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ levels. Two preparations were made for each tetraCHROME reagent and then each preparation was analyzed three times on the Navios EX flow cytometer using Navios EX tetra Software and Flow‐Count Fluorospheres. The study was conducted at four sites. A minimum of three lots of tetraCHROME reagents, Flow Count Fluorospheres, and ImmunoPrep reagents were tested across the clinical sites.

# c. Precision – Whole Blood Site-to-Site Variability

The site‐to‐site variability study was conducted using the $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ absolute count and percentage from a subset of the specimens collected for the whole blood repeatability study. Four different levels within the four $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ ranges were targeted across three sites. Forty-three specimens were selected based on the recovery of the predicate Navios system. Specimens at each level were chosen so that similar measurand recoveries were achieved across the sites to ensure poolability of the data and to minimize the effect of biological variability on the variability measurement. A minimum of three specimens per $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ level per site were targeted for a minimum of twelve specimens per site. Different specimens were used in the $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ percentage and $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ absolute count analyses. The study was conducted at three sites. Three lots of tetraCHROME reagents (Tetra 1), Flow Count Fluorospheres, and ImmunoPrep reagents were tested across the clinical sites.

3. Linearity:

1. Instrument Linearity

Instrument linearity was assessed with two beads of different fluorescent intensities (SpheroTechTM Rainbow particles level 4 and 5) analyzed at five different voltages covering the dynamic range of each PMT from the first decade (values of 0.1 to 1) to the fourth decade (values of 100 to 1000). The study was conducted on four Navios EX flow cytometers. The beads were run and the voltage of each PMT was adjusted so that the lower of the two peaks falls in the first decade (mean channel $< 1 . 0$ ) of the histogram. The beads were then “marched” across the dynamic range of the instrument by increasing the voltage until the brightest bead was positioned in the upper half of the top decade. The mean channel fluorescent intensity ratios of pairs were calculated for each PMT and these met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria demonstrating that the intensity differences between the beads were constant across the range of voltages assessed. Linearity of the Navios flow cytometer, from the photomultiplier tubes (PMT) to the electronics, independent of the application and gating methodology was demonstrated.

# 2. Assay Linearity

Linearity of the tetraCHROME reagents on the Navios EX Flow Cytometer with Navios EX tetra software and the manual gating method was established in accordance with CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. Linearity samples were prepared using White Cell Pool (WCP) that is used to manufacture IMMUNOTROL and mixed with a diluent prepared using Red Blood Cell pool (RBC pool). This study established that the Navios EX instrument was linear for the tested phenotypes over the following ranges:

4. Carryover:

# a. Carryover Using Beads

A carryover study was performed using Flow Check Pro fluorospheres on each of four Navios EX flow cytometers according to the methodology presented in CLSI Document: H26-A2, Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology Analyzers; Approved Standard – Second Edition, Section 5.7. Testing consisted of a high concentration sample (Flow‐ Check Pro Fluorospheres) analyzed consecutively three times (HTV1, HTV2, HTV3) followed immediately by testing a low concentration sample (IsoFlow Sheath Fluid) three times (LTV1, LTV2, LTV3). Acceptable carryover was demonstrated.

# b. Carryover Using Reagent

Carryover studies were conducted on three Navios EX instruments according to the methodology presented in CLSI H26‐A2: Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology analyzers; Approved Standard‐Second Edition, Section 5.7 with regard to high or low value sample order. Two studies were conducted to evaluate specimen and reagent carryover. Scatter and fluorescence carryover was demonstrated to be less than $1 \%$ from one specimen to another when the numbers of gated events was 10,000 or greater. Acceptable carryover was demonstrated.

e. Interfering Substances: Not applicable

5. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

a. Detection limit:

The LOB, LOD, and LOQ studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP17‐A2: Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline‐2nd Edition.

i. Limit of Blank (LoB): The study design incorporated five repetitions of each of the three prepared blank samples which were collected each day over four days, yielding a total of 60 data collection points per measuring system for each tetraCHROME reagent. Samples were prepared using the PrepPlus 2 sample

preparation method (PrepPlus 2 with TQ‐Prep). A total of 360 data points were collected for the study using three blank sample preparations, one lot of each reagent and three Navios EX flow cytometers. LOB was calculated for each marker as the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence level of the data as recommended in the CLSI EP17‐A2 Guideline. LoB was calculated separately for each of the three instruments. A nonparametric approach based on the ranks of observations was used in the study to calculate LoB for each tetraCHROME marker.

ii. Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): LoD and LoQ experiments were designed and analyzed according to the variant (precision profile) approach of CLSI EP17‐A2. Eight dilutions of ImmunoTrol cells were prepared in ImmunoTrol erythrocytes and were treated with each of the two tetraCHROME reagents, Immunoprep reagents and Flow-Count to measure the LoD and LoQ. Testing was conducted over five days on three Navios EX Flow Cytometers. Each day, one lot of cells was prepared for each cytometer and five replicates of each dilution were tested on each flow cytometer. This resulted in a total of 1200 data points. The results from these studies are presented in the table below:

# c. Specimen and Prepared Sample Stability

Forty specimens having CD4 counts across the AMI were prepared using CYTO‐STAT tetraCHROME reagents in duplicate within eight hours and held at room temperature for 24 and 48 hours and prepared again in order to verify the expected stability as reported in the literature. Specimens held 24 and 48 hours were refrigerated and tested again after an additional 24 and 48 hours. Samples were prepared by a TQ‐Prep and PrepPlus 2 in duplicate for each specimen for each time point tested and analyzed singly. Flow‐Count Fluorospheres were used to determine absolute counts for all samples analyzed. Analysis was performed using two Navios EX flow cytometers running Navios EX tetra Software. All parameters were verified to demonstrate the claimed stability of 24 hours for whole blood stored at room temperature and 24 hours for prepared specimens stored at refrigerated temperature.

# d. Laser Performance:

Laser performance was assessed on two Navios EX Flow Cytometers using FlowCheck Pro Fluorospheres at one site and it was demonstrated that neither integral signal intensity nor half peak coefficient of variation (HPCV) for forward light scatter (FS) and each of the linear fluorescence parameters vary more than acceptable levels over a period of 24 hours for Short-term Laser Performance and 8 days for Long-term Laser Performance. Stability of the laser performance of the Navios EX flow cytometer over time was demonstrated.

# e. Combined IVD/RUO Functionality

The Navios EX will be marketed in three different configurations, which contain the same IVD functionality, but differ each in their RUO functionality. These three configurations are:
