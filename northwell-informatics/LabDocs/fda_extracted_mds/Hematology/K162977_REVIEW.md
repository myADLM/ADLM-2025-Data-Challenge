# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The ADVIA 2120/2120i is a fully automated differential cell counter and consists of an analytical module that aspirates, dilutes, and analyzes whole blood samples; an autosampler that automatically mixes, identifies, and presents samples for processing; a computer workstation that controls the instrument, provides primary user interface with the instrument and manages the data produced by the instrument; and a printer that optionally generates reports based on the instrument results.

2. Principles of Operation:

# WBC Count

The whole blood sample is mixed with ADVIA 120/2120/2120i BASO reagent that contains acid and surfactant. The red blood cells are hemolyzed, and the white blood cells are then analyzed using two-angle laser light scatter signals.

Red Blood Cell and Platelet Counts

Red blood cells and platelets are analyzed by a single optical cytometer after appropriate dilution of the blood sample with ADVIA 120/2120/2120i RBC/PLT reagent (CBC TIMEPAC). The red blood cells are isovolumetrically sphered and lightly fixed to preserve the spherical shape. Red cells and platelets are counted from the signals from a common detector with two different gain settings.

# Red Blood Cell and Platelet Size

Simultaneous measurement of laser light scattered at two different angular intervals is used to determine the size of red blood cells and platelets.

# Hemoglobin

The hemoglobin method employs a modification of the manual cyanmethemoglobin method.

# WBC Differential (DIFF) Method

The ADVIA 2120/2120i utilizes the Peroxidase and Basophil/Lobularity methods to quantitatively measure the following hematological parameters: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, large unstained cells, and basophils. With the Peroxidase method, leukocytes are classified by the characteristic properties exhibited by cell-specific constituents when the cells are treated with cytochemical stains. With the Basophil/Lobularity method, red blood cells are hemolyzed and the cytoplasm is stripped from all white blood cells except basophils. The sample is then analyzed by two-angle laser light scattering detection using a laser diode. The white cells are classified into three categories: basophils, mononuclear (MN) cells, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells.

# Reticulocyte Count and Size

To determine the reticulocyte count, the ADVIA120/2120/2120i autoRETIC reagent isovolumetrically spheres the erythroid cells and stains cellular RNA. Low-angle laser light scatter, high-angle laser light scatter, and absorption characteristics of all cells are counted and measured. The absorption data are used to classify each cell as a reticulocyte or mature red blood cell based on its RNA content. The method of sizing reticulocytes uses the simultaneous measurement of laser light scattered at two different angular intervals.

The CSF sample is mixed with ADVIA 120/2120/2120i CSF reagent, which spheres and fixes the cells. After a minimum 4-minute to 4-hour incubation period, the prepared sample is then aspirated directly into the ADVIA 120/2120/2120i system. The cells are then detected and enumerated based on light scatter and absorbance measurements using the ADVIA 120/2120/2120i laser optics. A scatter versus scatter and scatter versus absorbance cytogram is displayed with the thresholds and results automatically calculated for each sample. Reportable parameters are WBC and RBC counts along with absolute and percentage counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, polymorphonuclear (PMN), and mononuclear (MN) cells.

# Body Fluid Method

The ADVIA 2120/2120i Body Fluid Application uses the Basophil/Lobularity and RBC/Plt channels to enumerate the total nucleated (TNC) and RBC counts. The TNC count is derived from the Basophil/Lobularity channel. The ADVIA120/2120/2120i BASO reagent contains surfactant and phthalic acid which, in the presence of low heat in the Baso channel reaction chamber, lyses RBCs and strips the cytoplasmic membrane from all leukocytes except basophils. This cell suspension is subsequently passed through the flowcell. The cell suspension is intercepted by light from the laser diode where the low-angle light scatter $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 ^ { \circ }$ ) and high-angle light scatter $5 ^ { \circ }$ to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ ) signals of each cell are counted.

The RBC count is derived from the RBC/Plt channel. The ADVIA120/2120/2120i RBC/Plt reagent spheres and fixes the RBCs. The same flowcell, low-angle and highangle light scatter signals as the Basophil/Lobularity channel are used to count the RBCs.

3. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ___X____ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No __ _X

4. Specimen Identification:

Sample identification is performed by the following methods: manual entry, scanning with a barcode reader, automatic incremental numbering, and rack/position numbering in the autosampler mode.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Body fluid and whole blood samples must be manually mixed by gentle inversion when analyzed in the manual open tube and manual closed tube modes.

Whole blood samples aspirated in the automated closed tube mode are automatically mixed. The automated closed tube sampler rotates first to $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ then to $1 3 5 ^ { \circ }$ , staying at each orientation for a minimum of 0.6 seconds and a maximum of 15 seconds. A total of 25 mixer-cycles are required before aspiration. Fully mixed samples which have a dwell of over 15 seconds require an additional 20 mixer cycles before aspiration. If a dwell exceeds 5 minutes, the samples must be mixed again for 45 cycles before aspiration.

6. Calibration:

The system must be calibrated for all parameters except %Retic. The ADVIA SETpoint Calibrator is recommended.

7. Quality Control:

ADVIA TESTpoint Hematology Controls are the recommended assayed quality controls. Quality controls should be assayed at an interval selected by the laboratory, after a change in reagent lot number, and after the replacement of any part or component of the analytical module that may affect the analytical performance.

8. Software:

# $b$ . Precision/Reproducibility:

To obtain measures of within-run (repeatability) imprecision $\% C \mathrm { V }$ and SD), normal and pathological whole blood samples were analyzed in the following modes of operation: autosampler (AS), manual closed tube sampler (MCT), and manual open tube sampler (MOT). At least 30 replicates were performed for each sample analyzed. The result for each whole blood parameter was within the predefined acceptance criteria for SD or $\% \mathrm { C V }$ .

Within-run imprecision of CSF was evaluated in the MOT mode; whereas, body fluids were analyzed in the MOT and MCT modes. At least 30 replicates were performed for each sample analyzed. The results for each sample matrix and

parameter were within the predefined acceptance criteria for SD or $\% \mathrm { C V }$ .

To obtain measures of within-device imprecision $\% C \mathrm { V }$ and SD), three levels of ADVIA TESTpoint 3in1 Controls (Abnormal 1, Abnormal 2, and Normal) and two levels of CSF Controls (Level 1 and Level 2) were analyzed over 28 days, two runs per day and two replicates per run. The results of each study were within the predefined acceptance criteria for SD or $\% \mathrm { C V }$ .

# c. Linearity:

The linear ranges for the WBC, RBC, Hgb, PLT and $\%$ Retic parameters were established by testing two different sample sets (for each parameter with a wide overlap) prepared by diluting FDA cleared commercially available linearity materials to span the analytical measuring range (AMR). The linear ranges for the CSF RBC and body fluid (BF) RBC parameters were established by testing diluted samples prepared from anticoagulated whole blood. Results for each parameter were within the predefined acceptance criteria.

# d. Carryover:

Carryover studies for the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters were conducted using pooled whole blood as high target value (HTV) samples and plasma as low target value (LTV) samples. Testing was conducted by aspirating a HTV whole blood

sample in triplicate followed by triplicate analysis of plasma-based LTV samples.   
Carryover was calculated according to the following calculation.

$$
\% c a r r y o v e r = ( L T V I - L T V 3 ) / ( H T V 3 - L T V 3 ) \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 0
$$

The results of the carryover study were within the predefined specifications of $\leq 1 . 0 \%$ for WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT in the autosampler, manual-open and manual-closed tube modes.
