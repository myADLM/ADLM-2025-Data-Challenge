# L. Test Principle:

AFIAS iFOB is an immunoassay system based on antigen-antibody reaction and fluorescence technology. When a human fecal sample is mixed with the extraction buffer, human hemoglobin in fecal occult blood (FOB) is extracted from the fecal sample. When the extracted sample is loaded into the sample well of the test cartridge, human hemoglobin binds with mouse monoclonal anti-hemoglobin-fluorescence located at the glaze line. This complex migrates through the nitrocellulose matrix of the test strip. The fluorochromelabeled detector antibody-FOB hemoglobin complexes get captured on to the antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-hemoglobin) which have been immobilized at the test line on the test strip. As a result, the fluorochrome-labeled complexes of the detector antibody and FOB hemoglobin capture-antibody are accumulated at the test line on the test cartridge membrane. The more hemoglobin in the human fecal sample, the more complexes that will be accumulated at the test line on the test cartridge membrane. The test strip also contains rabbit IgG immobilized at a control line. The control line of AFIAS iFOB test cartridge functions as the built-in procedural control.

AFIAS-50 is a fluorescence-scanning instrument to be used in conjunction with the AFIAS iFOB test which are based on antigen-antibody reaction and fluorescence technology (Fluorescence Immuno-Assay). AFIAS iFOB test cartridges and sample mixed extraction buffer tubes are inserted into the designated positions on AFIAS-50 for testing. AFIAS-50 uses a semiconductor diode laser as the excitation light source for illuminating the sampleloaded AFIAS iFOB cartridge(s) inserted in its magazine station(s); thereby triggering fluorescence from the fluorochrome-labeled complexes of hemoglobin accumulated at the test line on the cartridge membrane as well as the control line. The fluorescent light is collected together with the scattered laser light. Pure fluorescence is filtered from the mixture of the scattered and fluorescent light. Intensity of the fluorescence generated at the ‘test line’ and ‘control line’ is scanned and collected by the optical assembly onto a photo sensor and converted into an electric signal which correlates to the intensity of fluorescence and hence to the concentration of occult blood, fecal hemoglobin in the test sample. The on-board microprocessor computes the occult blood, fecal hemoglobin concentration based on a preprogrammed calibration derived from the “AFIAS iFOB ID Chip” inserted in the ID chip port. The computed and converted result is displayed by AFIAS-50 in a qualitative (positive or negative) manner based on the analytical cut-off value $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or $8 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g }$ hemoglobin/g stool.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability was evaluated using a single test kit lot, one intended use site and one operator. Reproducibility was conducted across three intended use sites using three test kit lots, three operators, three AFIAS-50 instruments. For reproducibility, one run per day was performed for three non-consecutive days. $i$ -CHROMA iFOB Negative and Positive Controls were also tested daily to ensure the validity of the test results.

For repeatability and reproducibility, Hb-free fecal samples were collected and spiked with human whole blood with known hemoglobin levels to achieve the following seven fecal hemoglobin concentrations: $4 \mu \mathrm { g H b } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $6 . 8 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } \mathrm { H b / g }$ stool, $7 . 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ $\mathrm { H b } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $8 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g H b } / \mathrm { g }$ stool, $8 . 4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } \mathrm { H b / g }$ stool, $8 . 8 ~ \mu \ g \mathrm { H b / g }$ stool, and $8 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } \mathrm { H b / g }$ stool, that are equivalent to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $9 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , respectively. Fourteen replicates were performed for each sample and concentration level. Repeatability and reproducibility results at all test sites were within the defined acceptance criteria.

# 5. Stability of $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB Controls

Stability of $i$ -CHROMA iFOB Controls was evaluated by real time stability testing using 10 aliquots of each of the control levels. One lot of AFIAS iFOB test kits and three lots of $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB Controls (negative and positive) were evaluated during the shelf-life and open-vial stability studies of the $i .$ -CHROMA iFOB Controls.

The shelf-life stability was evaluated by using separate vials (of each lot) of the controls for each periodic testing. The open-vial stability was evaluated by using the same vial of the control for the initial as well as all successive periodic testing. $i$ -CHROMA iFOB controls from each lot were stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $8 \%$ and $2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and tested at time points of initial start of 0 and biweekly up to 16 weeks from the start of the stability study. The results showed that the $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB controls shelf-life stability was three months and the open-vial stability was one month when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Specificity to Human Hemoglobin Variant

The sensitivity of the AFIAS iFOB test to hemoglobin S (HbS) was determined using one kit lot and one operator. Spiked stool samples containing five different HbS concentrations were prepared: $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and 150 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Twenty aliquots of each of the five concentrations of spiked stool samples were mixed with extraction buffer in AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes. Samples were tested in a randomized order. Results showed that the AFIAS iFOB is sensitive to HbS.

# Cross-Reactivity

Cross-reactivity of AFIAS iFOB test with non-human hemoglobin was evaluated by using one kit lot and one operator. Test samples were prepared by spiking Hb-free stool specimens with known levels of six different human hemoglobin solutions to obtain fecal samples with the following hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 50 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Twenty aliquots of the six stool concentrations listed above were spiked with the intended level of respective non-human hemoglobin: bovine Hb $( 2 , 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ), pig Hb $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , fish Hb ( $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m L } )$ ), horse Hb $\scriptstyle 5 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ ), goat Hb $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , rabbit Hb $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , sheep $( 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , and chicken Hb $ { 5 0 0 }  { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ ).

All samples were mixed with extraction buffer in AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes and tested in a randomized order. There was no significant interference observed for the non-human hemoglobins listed above.

Test samples were prepared by spiking stool samples containing six different hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Twenty aliquots of the six stool concentrations listed above were spiked with the intended level of Vitamin C $( 3 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , bilirubin $( 2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ , albumin $( 6 0 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , myoglobin $( 2 , 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ), glucose ( $1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and triglyceride $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ).

All samples were mixed with extraction buffer in AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes and tested in a randomized order. There was no significant interference observed for Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), bilirubin, albumin, myoglobin, glucose and triglyceride.

# f. Assay cut-off:

The cut-off value for the AFIAS iFOB test was validated in-house. Fecal test samples were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood of known hemoglobin concentration, to obtain the following fecal hemoglobin concentrations: $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 85 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Forty aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed with extraction buffer in AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes and 40 aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were mixed with the predicate ( $i$ -CHROMA iFOB) sample collection tubes. Samples were tested in randomized order. Testing was performed side-by-side with the predicate by comparing the test results of the device with that of the predicate. The cut-off was determined to be 8.0 $\mu \mathrm { g }$ hemoglobin/g stool or $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with detection buffer).

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison of AFIAS iFOB test with the predicate test, $i \cdot$ -CHROMA iFOB test, was conducted by assessing 522 patient samples, 165 of which were positive, and 357 negative. The method comparison study was performed at one professional medical laboratory in the U.S. and two international professional medical laboratories by three different operators (one) at each site. The $i$ -CHROMA iFOB external controls (positive and negative) were run prior to testing. Statistical analysis of sitewide test results as well as combined results showed that AFIAS iFOB test results have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement with $i$ -CHROMA iFOB test results. The method comparison study (Table 4) demonstrated that the analytical performance of the AFIAS iFOB test is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Yes ___x_ __ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Enter patient identification information manually on the label of the collection slide or extraction buffer tube. Patient identification can also be entered into the AFIAS-50 manually, by barcode reader or the AFIAS-50 will assign specific patient ID as ‘P01’, $\mathbf { \widetilde { P } 0 } 2 \mathbf { \widetilde { \Gamma } }$ , and so on.

# 4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

To collect human fecal samples for testing, two different sample collection methods are available. AFIAS iFOB uses specific sampling devices (collection slide and sampling stick). Using a collection slide (for use by patients), fecal samples are collected with an applicator stick applied into the windows which are provided inside of the collection slide. After collecting the fecal sample, the sample strip, which detaches from the back of the collection slide will be inserted into the extraction buffer tube. The patient submits the test sample to the hospital/laboratory for testing. The fecal test sample can also be collected using a sampling stick (intended to be used by professional/reference laboratories only) which is attached in the bottom cap of the extraction buffer tube. After collection of the fecal sample, the sampling stick with fecal sample will be inserted into the extraction buffer tube.

# 5. Calibration:

The “ID Chip” provided with AFIAS iFOB test cartridge(s) contains a memory device which contains encoded calibration data. An ID chip having a lot number matching with that of the test cartridge and the extraction buffer collection tube is inserted into the designated port of the AFIAS-50 which utilizes the calibration data for computing the test result(s). The end-user is not required to perform routine calibration before performing the test.

6. Quality Control:

AFIAS iFOB Cartridge Internal Control: The Procedural Control is found in the procedural control region of the test cartridge to assure the operator that the test has been properly performed. This control does not ensure that the capture antibody is accurately detecting the presence or absence of Hb in the sample.

# AFIAS-50

Pre-programmed System Self-Check and System Check of AFIAS-50 using System Check Cartridge & ID Chip are electronic control mechanisms to check whether electronic features of the AFIAS-50 are within specifications.

External control: External controls are used to assure the operator that the capture and conjugated antibodies are present and reactive. Controls should be assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions once per kit lot, following the local and state guidelines. If controls do not perform as expected, the test results should not be used.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Specimen Collection Verification:

Verification that the sample collection methods using a sample collection slide and applicator stick (used by patients and laboratories) versus sampling stick (used by laboratories only) consistently delivers the specified amount of stool required for optimal test performance was performed by using one lot of AFIAS iFOB extraction buffer tubes (with sampling sticks) and collection slides (with applicator stick). Hb-free fecal samples were collected and spiked with human blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to obtain fecal samples containing eight different hemoglobin concentrations: $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , 120 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $1 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Twenty aliquots of each of the eight concentrations of spiked stool test samples were tested by each sample collection method. $i \cdot$ - CHROMA iFOB Negative and Positive Controls were also tested to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results. Statistical analysis of the sample collection verification study shows that the test results from the two sampling methods have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement. There was no statistical significance in the analyses of the test samples by the two sampling methods.

# Carry-Over:

The carry-over study was conducted by using hemoglobin-negative fecal samples spiked with human blood (of known hemoglobin concentration) to obtain fecal samples containing $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ as the low concentration and $2 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ as the high concentration. Four replicates for each low concentration sample (labeled as L1, L2, L3 and L4) and four replicates each high concentration sample (labeled as H1, H2, H3 and H4) were tested. According to the test results and acceptance criteria, “Carry Over $( \% ) ^ { , }$ for all test results were less than $1 \%$ . There is no significant carry-over with the AFIAS iFOB test on the AFIAS-50.
