# Test Principle:

The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer utilizes a dual wavelength LED light source by which the hemoglobin absorbance is detected and converted into an electrical signal. The signal is directly proportional to the amount of hemoglobin present in the sample. The concentration of hemoglobin is calculated based on a pre-programmed calibration. The hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette is specifically designed for the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Approximately 15 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ of capillary or venous blood is taken up by capillary action using the tip of the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette or by direct volume pipetting of the sample. The blood filled Microcuvette is inserted onto the microcuvette holder, and the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer measures the degree of light absorption with a spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the light from the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette is converted into an electrical signal. The optical distance between the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette walls is fixed and permits photometric determination of the hemoglobin in undiluted blood samples.

# Analytical performance:

# Repeatability

Repeatability was assessed in-house using three hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette test lots, three hemochroma PLUS Analyzers, three operators and hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin). Five test samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ tubes with hemoglobin concentrations evenly distributed throughout the lower and upper limits and medical decision levels of the analytical measuring range of the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer were tested. Each hemochroma PLUS Analyzer was tested seven (7) times in duplicate (duplicate runs in the morning and duplicate runs in the evening) for a total of 84 tests results for each hemoglobin concentration. Sample Level 1 $( 5 . 6 ~ \mathrm { g / d L } )$ and Sample Level 5 $( 2 3 . 7 \ \mathrm { g / d L } )$ were prepared by spiking natural human whole blood samples. Sample Levels 2 $( 1 1 . 3 \ : \mathrm { g / d L } )$ ), 3 ( $1 4 . 6 \ : \mathrm { g / d L ) }$ , and 4 $( 1 8 . 4 \ : \mathrm { g / d L } )$ were sourced from unmodified natural samples. Repeatability results were within the defined acceptance criteria.

Three additional repeatability studies were accessed in-house using five test samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA tubes with hemoglobin concentrations evenly distributed throughout the lower and upper limits and medical decision levels of the analytical measuring range of the hemochroma

PLUS Analyzer were tested.

Between Operator: In order to evaluate the performance for repeatability between operators, three operators conducted the testing with five hemoglobin levels of test samples using the same lot of the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette and the same instrument. Each operator repeated the test seven times in duplicate (duplicate runs in the morning and duplicate runs in the evening) runs.

Between Lot: In order to evaluate the performance for repeatability between the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette lots, one operator conducted the testing with five hemoglobin levels of test samples using three different lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette and the same instrument. Each Microcuvette lot was tested seven (7) times in duplicate (duplicate runs in the morning and duplicate runs in the evening) runs.

Between Instrument: In order to evaluate the performance for repeatability between the instruments, one operator conducted the testing with five hemoglobin levels of test samples using one lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette and three different hemochroma PLUS instruments.

# Linearity/assay reportable range:

# Quality Microbiological, Serological and Immunological Reagents

The linearity study was conducted using low and high-level hemoglobin concentrations prepared from a venous blood sample. A total of eleven hemoglobin concentration levels (2.5, 4.8, 7.1, 9.4, 11.7, 14.1, 16.4, 18.7, 21.0, 23.3, and 25.6) spanning the claimed measuring range of the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer $\mathrm { \langle 5 . 0 { - } 2 5 . 6 \ g / d L \rangle }$ were tested in triplicate and analyzed using one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer and one lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes. The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high) were tested to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results obtained with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The mean result for each concentration was plotted against the expected value. Linear regression was performed and based on the data analysis, the hemochroma PLUS System demonstrated linearity over the claimed measuring range of $5 . 0 { - } 2 5 . 6 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ .

Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high) Value Assignment

The hemochroma PLUS Controls were produced into three levels (low, middle, high). Each control level was tested in 15 replicates using the same lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes on the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The percent difference between the expected value and the mean value of the 15 replicates was calculated. The average of the 15 replicates was set as the mean value: $8 . 5 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (low control), $1 2 . 5 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (middle control), and $1 6 . 2 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (high control).

Value assignment was conducted using three hemochroma PLUS Analyzers with three lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes and one lot of each control level. Each control level was tested in 10 replicates on each hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. All data points for the hemochroma PLUS Analyzers were within the acceptance criteria.

# Quality Control Stability

Closed vial stability was determined by using three lots of hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high) stored at refrigerated temperature $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and tested one day every month in triplicate for 10 months. Controls should be brought to room temperature $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before testing. hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high) closed vial stability study data support a stability claim of 6 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Open vial stability was determined by using three lots of hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high) stored once opened at $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The controls were tested every day in triplicate for 17 days. After one hour of leaving the controls outside of the refrigerator, the controls were tested and then placed back in the refrigerator at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The opened vial stability claim has been established at 14 days after opening when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after each use.

# Quality Microbiological, Serological and Immunological Reagents

hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes shelf life stability was determined by using three lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes stored at $1 5 { - } 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Testing was performed one day per month in triplicate for 27 months. The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin) were tested during the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes shelf life stability to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results obtained with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The study data support a shelf life stability claim of 24 months when stored at $1 5 { - } 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes open container (in-use) stability was determined by using three lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes stored at $1 5 { - } 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Testing was performed one day per month in triplicate for 27 months. Every month, three lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes were removed from the container and tested with fresh hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin) in triplicate with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer and each replicate was tested in 1-hour intervals (total of nine test results each month). The study data support a stability claim of 24 months when stored at $1 5 { - } 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after the seal is broken.

# Sample Stability

The sample stability study was assessed using one lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes and one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Thirty-seven fresh venous blood samples were collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA tubes and measured immediately with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The venous blood test samples were then stored in the refrigerator $\left( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ and tested at various time intervals (3, 6, 12 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 days). The venous blood test samples were inverted gently 10 times to ensure mixing of anticoagulant with blood prior to testing. The venous blood test samples stored in the refrigerator were brought to room temperature before testing. Percent recovery was calculated for each venous blood test sample after each time point from the fresh venous blood sample test results. The study data support a stability claim of 24 hours when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB) testing was performed using five blank hemoglobin depleted human plasma samples measured in five replicates tested over a period of 3 days with three different lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes and three hemochroma PLUS Analyzers for a total of 75 test results per lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes. LoB was calculated by parametric analysis of the study data. LoB of hemochroma PLUS System was found to be $0 . 2 3 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

LoD testing was performed using six Hgb-low samples prepared by spiking plasma with red blood cells. Five replicates of each of the six Hgb-low samples was tested over a period of 3 days with three different lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes using one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer for a total of 90 test results per lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes. LoD was calculated by parametric analysis of the study data. LoD of hemochroma PLUS System was

# Quality Microbiological, Serological and Immunological Reagents

found to be $1 . 6 6 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by testing six low Hgb samples prepared by spiking plasma with red blood cells. Each sample was tested in five replicates over a period of three days with three different lots of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes using one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer for a total of 90 test results per lot of hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes. The LoQ data are considered acceptable when the $\%$ Total-error is smaller than the desired total error for the measurand. LoQ of the hemochroma PLUS System was determined to be $4 . 5 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# Analytical specificity:

An interference study was conducted to evaluate the potential of various endogenous and exogenous substances that may affect hemoglobin results. Three hemoglobin levels of human whole blood samples were spiked with various potential interfering substances listed in the table 6 below. Three hemoglobin levels were verified with the HemoCue Hb 301. Control samples (no interfering substances) and test samples (with interfering substances) were tested in five replicates with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. All tested interference substances (endogenous and exogenous) showed non-significant interference up to the concentrations given in the table below.

# Quality Microbiological, Serological and Immunological Reagents

venous blood samples in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA tubes. An additional 10 hemoglobin samples in extreme hemoglobin ranges were spiked in order to assess performance at the lower and upper ends of the measurement range (for venous blood samples only). Testing was performed using three hemochroma PLUS Analyzers (one at each site), three operators (one at each site), and three lots of the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes (one at each site). The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin) were run prior to testing. Linear regression analyses demonstrate comparable performance between hemochroma PLUS System and HemoCue Hb 301 System across the analytical measuring range. The method comparison study demonstrated that the analytical performance of the hemochroma PLUS System test is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

# Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate comparability between venous whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples using the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The matrix comparison was performed using whole blood (venous and capillary) from 80 study participants with one hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette lot and one hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high) were run prior to testing. Percent difference between capillary blood and venous blood $( \mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A } )$ ) was calculated. A BlandAltman plot was used to analyze the agreement between capillary blood and venous blood. The results of the Bland-Altman plot analysis and $\%$ difference between venous whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples on the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer met the acceptance criteria.

Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function for the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Samples are applied directly to the microcuvettes as they are collected. The end user must develop a manual system to identify patients that are tested with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer.

# Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Capillary or venous whole blood is directly applied from the finger or blood tube (using a disposable pipette) to the Microcuvette. Wipe off excess blood from the surface of the microcuvette using a piece of soft gauze. The blood-filled Microcuvette is then inserted into the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer.

# Calibration:

The hemochroma PLUS Optical System Check is used to assure the performance of the Optic System of the hemochroma PLUS.

# Quality Control:

The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin) are intended for use as quality control material to assure the validity and performance of the hemochroma PLUS System in measuring the human hemoglobin concentration. The hemochroma PLUS Controls should be assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and following the local and state guidelines. If controls do not perform as expected, the test results should not be used.

# Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Comparison of hemochroma PLUS Analyzer and HemoCue Hb 301 Analyzer for Disease Conditions:

A study was conducted to determine the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer and HemoCue Hb 301 Analyzer performance when testing certain disease conditions. Venous blood specimens were collected from diseased donors: 3 specimens from donors with Polycythemia, 2 specimens from the donors with hypochromia, 3 specimens from the donors with high WBC count, and 2 specimens from sickle cell donors. Each test specimen was tested 5 times with the HemoCue Hb 301 Analyzer and 5 times with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. These results indicate that hemochroma PLUS System

# Quality Microbiological, Serological and Immunological Reagents

hemoglobin assay meets the expected performance criteria therefore, no interference was observed in these disease conditions.

2. Anticoagulant Comparison (K2EDTA vs K3EDTA, Lithium Heparin, Sodium Heparin, and Sodium Citrate):

To evaluate the effect of anticoagulants (K2EDTA, K3EDTA, Lithium Heparin, Sodium Heparin, and Sodium Citrate) on the performance of the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer, venous blood was collected in each of $2 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ anticoagulant tubes $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ , $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ , Lithium Heparin, Sodium Heparin, and Sodium Citrate) from 50 study participants. Spiked plasma samples were used for hemoglobin concentrations in the extreme hemoglobin (low and high) measuring ranges. The $\%$ difference between $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA and 4 different anticoagulants $\mathrm { \ K _ { 3 } E D T A }$ , Lithium heparin, Sodium heparin, and Sodium Citrate) was calculated. A Bland-Altman plot was used to analyze the agreement between the $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ tube and the 4 other anticoagulant tubes. The results of the Bland-Altman plot analysis and $\%$ difference between the $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ tube and 4 different anticoagulants on the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer were within the defined acceptance criteria.

3. Cleaning Disinfection and Robustness Testing:

To perform the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer cleaning step, the operator should use a Micro-Kill Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipe to wipe all surface areas of the analyzer to remove all blood and other body fluids. During the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer disinfection step, the operator uses Micro-Kill Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipes to thoroughly wet all surface areas of the analyzer. The operator also carefully disinfects the entire surface of the hemochroma PLUS Instrument and the holder for microcuvettes with the Micro-Kill Bleach Germicidal Bleach Wipes. There was a minimum 5-minute rest period between each the cleaning.

The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer lifespan claim is 27375 cleaning cycles which is equivalent to 3 years of analyzer life.

One (1) cycle $=$ One (1) wipe for cleaning $^ +$ One (1) wipe for disinfecting 25 cleaning cycles per day $\textbf { X } 3 6 5$ days x (3) years $= 2 7 3 7 5$ cleaning cycles.

The lifespan of the analyzer will vary depending on actual usage.
