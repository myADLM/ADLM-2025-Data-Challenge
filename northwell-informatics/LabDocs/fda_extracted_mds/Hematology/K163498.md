The set is provided to establish the relationship between theoretical and actual performance of Heparin Anti-X activity.Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test kit was tested at the donor level using FDA approved methods and was found to be non-reactive for HBsAG and to antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2.

# E. Intended use

VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit solutions are assayed quality control materials intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of linearity, calibration verification and verification of reportable range for Heparin Anti-Xa activity on automated instruments in a clinical laboratory setting by laboratory personnel. The product is intended for use on the IL ACL TOP $\mathsf { J o o @ }$ analyzer.

# F. Summary of Performance Data:

The performance of the new VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit was compared to the predicate device k09209, HemosIL® Liquid LMW/UF Heparin Controls.

# Value Assignment

VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kits are manufactured such that an equal relationship exists among Levels 1 through 5; Level 1 being the lowest concentration and Level 5 being the highest. Levels 1 and 5 are prepared independently by the addition of Heparin to a human plasma base matrix. Levels 1 through 5 must meet specified Heparin Anti-Xa target ranges at all stages of testing.

Specific recovery targets for Levels 1 through 5 are determined by the upper and lower detection limits for Heparin Anti-Xa. Intermediate Levels 2, 3, and 4 are subsequently prepared from Levels 1 and 5 by equal part dilutions following EP6-A guidelines. Typical value ranges are provided in the package insert.

Typical recovery values, presented in Table 2, were established for Level 1 and Level 5 by testing 30 replicates, with values for Mid-Levels 2, 3, and 4 calculated based on an equal distance (delta) between levels.

The product is designed for laboratories to satisfy the requirements for calibration verification and verification of the systems reportable range as specified in the current CLIA regulations section 493.1255.

Table 2- Typical Recovery Values   

<table><tr><td colspan="8">Set</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Instrument</td><td rowspan="2">Analyte</td><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="5">Levels</td></tr><tr><td>Units 1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>IL ACL TOP 500®</td><td>Heparin Anti-Xa</td><td>IU/mL</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.52</td><td>0.94</td><td>1.36</td><td>1.77</td></tr></table>

A linear relationship exists between each level in a kit. The quantitative determination of linearity, calibration verification, and verification of reportable range relies on the known relationship between each of the levels of the product, in this case equal deltas, as outlined in the CLSI EP6-A referenced standard.

This kit is not intended for use as calibration material.

# Precision/Reproducibility

Precision was evaluated on the Instrumentation Laboratory (IL) IL ACL TOP $5 0 0 \textcircled { \mathbb { R } }$ instrument system with the VALIDATE® Heparin product following the product package insert instructions. Three lots of VALIDATE® Heparin product were tested with one lot of IL HemosIL® Liquid Anti-Xa reagent and quality controls on one IL ACL TOP $5 0 0 \textcircled { \mathsf { R } }$ instrument system over 20 days, 2 runs per day, 2 replicates per run for Level 1 through Level 5 with a minimum of two operators to obtain a total of eighty (80) replicates per kit Level. All levels of the VALIDATE® Heparin kit met the $0 \%$ acceptance criteria on the IL ACL TOP $\mathsf { J o o @ }$ instrument system.

Reproducibility was evaluated on the IL ACL TOP $5 0 0 \textcircled { \mathbb { R } }$ instrument system with the VALIDATE® Heparin kit containing 5 levels following the product package insert instructions. One lot of VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit was tested with one lot of IL Heparin HemosIL® reagent and quality controls on three instruments, multi-site, over 5 days, with 1 run per day of Level 1-5, 5 replicates per run and a minimum of three operators to obtain seventy-five (75) replicates per kit level. All levels of the VALIDATE® Heparin kit met the $0 \%$ acceptance criteria on the IL ACL TOP $5 0 0 \textcircled { \mathbb { R } }$ instrument system.

# Traceability

This product is traceable to a reference standard based on the automated instrument platform it is used on. The traceability of this product will be established per the respective end user automated instrument method calibrator traceability reference statement. The VALIDATE® Heparin kit is traceable through the IL HemosIL® calibrator to the 5th International WHO Standard 97/578 for UF heparin and the 2nd International WHO Standard 01/608 for LMW heparin.

# Stability

Stability testing on four product lots was performed using the IL ACL TOP $\mathsf { J o o @ }$ instrument system. The study testing time points included date of manufacture (DOM), followed by testing at specific intervals post manufacture. Acceptance criteria are defined as 90 to $110 \%$ of DOM value.

A freeze-thaw/open vial stress stability assessment was also conducted in support of the product package insert two (2) freeze-thaw open vial events claim. All product levels tested within the acceptance criteria limits after 2 freeze-thaw vial events.

Shelf Life Claim: Stability of the VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit was set at 5 months based on available real-time stability studies. Real time stability studies are ongoing to support an extended stability claim. The recommended storage temperature is $- 1 0$ to $\yen 2500$ .

# Linearity:

Linearity testing was carried out with the new device VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kits on the Instrumentation Laboratory IL ACL TOP $5 0 0 \textcircled { \mathbb { R } }$ coagulation instrument. Product linearity performance was demonstrated for this automated system. All supporting data is retained on file at Maine Standards Company LLC.

# G. Conclusion:

Based upon the purpose of the device, the descriptions and labeling of the predicate device, the VALIDATE® Heparin Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit behaves substantially equivalent to the predicate device, K090209, HemosIL® Liquid LMW/UF Heparin Controls.
