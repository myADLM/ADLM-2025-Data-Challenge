# I. Device Description:

The CoaguChek Vantus System consists of a hand-held CoaguChek Vantus meter, used in combination with the CoaguChek XS PT test strips. The CoaguChek Vantus meter is a small handheld instrument intended for the quantitative measurement of INR based on a PT response by using a single electrochemical test strip. The CoaguChek XS PT test strip contains a lyophilized reagent (reagent in dried form). The reactive components of this reagent consist of thromboplastin and a peptide substrate.

The test strip has one reaction chamber, which includes both the prothrombin time reaction and on-board quality control (OBC). The prothrombin time test reaction and OBC tests run simultaneously, which are based on electrochemical technology. If the quality control are within limits, the strip integrity is verified. If the OBC is not within limits, the meter displays an according error and the test result is not reported.

# L. Test Principle:

When a blood sample is applied to the test strip, thromboplastin activates the coagulation cascade which leads to the formation of thrombin. The activity of thrombin, the final protease for both plasmatic coagulation pathways, is monitored during the test instead of detecting the clot by mechanical or optical methods. Thrombin cleaves the thrombin substrate creating an electrochemically active peptide, which generates an electrical signal. The signal is converted to a PT/INR value and displayed by the CoaguChek Vantus meter.

The CoaguChek Vantus System connects with the CoaguChek $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ XS PT test strip by means of seven main electronic pins. These contact points allow the CoaguChek Vantus meter to generate and display valid PT/INR results even if there are minor defects on the test strip (e.g. small scratches).

CoaguChek Vantus uses the identical electrochemical technology as the CoaguChek XS System to perform the PT test and the on-board quality control (OBC) test simultaneously. The OBCchecks the test strip integrity for damage from extreme temperature, humidity or light. The chemical components of the OBC are added directly to the formulation of the thromboplastin reagent. This ensures that the check for the test strip integrity is performed for every single strip at the same place and same time as the PT test (“on the spot OBC”). The test system determines whether the OBC result is within preset limits, if it is, then the strip integrity is verified, and the meter reports the PT test. If the OBC is not within limits, the meter displays an error and a test result is not reported. Release testing during manufacturing determines and sets the lot-specific ranges for the OBC.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

i. Linearity: Not applicable

ii. Assay Reportable Range: The assay reportable range $( 0 . 8 - 6 . 0 \mathrm { I N R } )$ of the CoaguChek Vantus System was established through method comparison studies against both the predicate (Roche CoaguChek XS System) and the reference device (Sysmex CA-1500 laboratory analyzer using Dade Innovin Reagent).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i. Traceability: Each lot of CoaguChek XS PT test strips is factory calibrated to a reference lot of human recombinant thromboplastin traceable to the WHO International Reference Preparation, rTF/95.

ii. Closed Vial and Transport Stability: The CoaguChek XS PT test strips were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 6 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested after a storage time of 3, 6, 16 and 25 months.

iii. Open Vial Stability: Open vial stability simulates the repeated opening and closing of the vial by the customer when test strips are removed from the vial for measurement. Open vial stability was tested by opening the vials once per day for at least one minute at $3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $8 5 \%$ relative humidity (RH) over a period of 30 days.

iv. Out of Vial Stability: Out of vial stability was tested to demonstrate that the test strips can be kept outside the vial before measurement for at least 10 minutes when directly exposed to $3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $8 5 \%$ RH. This was verified by storing the test strip outside the vial under the specified environmental conditions for 14 minutes before measurement.

# d. Detection limit:

Factor sensitivity was assessed for coagulation factors II, V, VII and X using four lots of CoaguChek XS PT test strips. The factor sensitivity was performed using standard human plasma that was mixed with varying amounts of factor II, V, VII and X deficient plasma to obtain plasma samples with different factor activities (0, 1, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and $100 \%$ ). For each CoaguChek XS PT test strip, four measurements were performed per coagulation factor and dilution level. The study verifies factor sensitivity for the CoaguChek XS PT test strips at the following levels: Factor $1 \text{‰}$ ; Factor $\mathrm { V } < 4 6 \%$ ; Factor $\mathrm { V I I } < 4 4 \%$ ; and Factor $X < 5 0 \%$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The interference studies were performed for the following interferents: bilirubin, hemolysis, heparin, LMWH and triglycerides. In addition, an interference study was conducted to characterize the levels of other known drugs: oritavancin, daptomycin, clopidogrel, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban.

Interference limits were established using up to four CoaguChek XS PT test strip lots, using fresh citrated venous whole blood from both normal and warfarin blood samples spiked separately with the interferents. The acceptance criteria for interference effect of the aforementioned interferents were met. The interference study results demonstrate that the following interferents do not interfere with test results up to following concentrations:

This lot-specific calibration information is embedded within the code chip, which is required by the CoaguChek Vantus meter prior to using the specific lot of the CoaguChek XS PT test strip.

6. Quality Control:

The CoaguChek Vantus System provides On-Board Controls (OBC), which provide a quality control check for each individual CoaguChek XS PT test strip used with the CoaguChek Vantus meter. There are no additional steps required by the user to activate the OBC.

When a test strip is inserted, the CoaguChek Vantus meter, the first check assesses potential issues with the reagent. The second check ensures that the test strip has not been exposed to environment conditions or physical stresses, like bending. If either of these checks do not pass, then no INR result is provided.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Temperature and Altitude Study: The purpose of this study was to examine the specified operating temperature and humidity conditions for the CoaguChek XS PT test strip on the CoaguChek Vantus instrument. Using the CoaguChek XS PT test strip, operating temperature range was evaluated using two different levels of CoaguChek XS PT Controls over the specified temperature range of $1 5 { - } 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 5 9 { - } 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and the specified relative humidity (RH) range of $10 \mathrm { - } 8 5 \%$ . Additional temperature conditions were also tested in combination with $60 \%$ RH: $9 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $1 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $3 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 6 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Results from these studies met the acceptance criteria and demonstrated that the performance of the CoaguChek XS PT test strip on the CoaguChek Vantus instrument is not affected by operating temperatures under the conditions specified above.
