Dear Ms. Zhou:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of July 3, 2017.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

In accordance with FDA Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Bundling Multiple Devices or Multiple Indications in a Single Submission, dated June 22, 2007, four Multitest assays with the instrument, beads and process controls are bundled within this submission.

The FACSLyric System with Multitest Reagents is intended for the immunological assessment of normal individuals, and patients having, or suspected of having, immune deficiency using flow cytometry applications.

The system is an immunofluorescence assay system for identification and enumeration of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral whole blood. When blood is added to the monoclonal antibody reagent, the fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in the reagent bind specifically to lymphocyte surface antigens. During acquisition, the cells travel past one or more laser beams in a single file and scatter the laser light. The stained cells fluoresce. The scatter and fluorescence light is detected by the flow cytometer, separated by dichroic mirrors and optical filters, and then quantified with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to determine the percent lymphocyte of particular cell populations.

Multiple monoclonal antibodies each labeled with a different fluorochrome are contained within one reagent tube to simultaneously identify multiple lymphocyte subset populations. The use of Trucount tubes provides the absolute number of the fluorochrome-labeled antibody bound cells.

The FACSLyric System with Multitest Reagents is intended for Prescription Use Only and will be labeled “Rx Only”.

A summary of the comparison is included as follows:

The subject device is similar to the predicate device as follows:

Used for identification and enumeration of human lymphocyte cell subsets • Performs the same flow cytometric assays with the same Multitest reagents and the same process controls Uses the same Trucount Tubes with a known number of beads per sample volume to calculate absolute cell counts Based on multicolor fluorescence Uses red, blue and violet lasers to provide excitation illumination for the specific wavelengths of the fluorophores ; only the red and blue are used in the Multitest assays. Uses dichroic mirrors to split fluorescence emissions into wavelength ranges for each fluorophore to be detected • Uses photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for the detection of fluorescence emission signal

The subject device differs from the predicate device as follows:

Is available in four optical configurations : 3 - 1 , 4-2 , 4-2-2 , and 4-3 -3 , whereas the Predicate Device is available in 3 optical configurations: 4-2, 4-2-2 and 5-3.   
Has a high powered red laser that yields higher detection sensitivity compared to the predicate device   
Instrument QC is performed using C S&T Beads and fluorescence compensation is established by using FC beads 7-color k wheres  h eicteviAC-coetu bea eusedjus uetevotae eait Tv and is capable of more accurately assessing the instrument performance.   
Uses the optional FAC S Universal Loader to automate loading tubes in 3 0- or 40-tube rack, whereas the predicate device uses FACS Loader which accommodates up to 40 tubes in a carousel.   
Smaller footprint with no separate wet cart for fluidics and generates much lower noise output than the predicate device .
