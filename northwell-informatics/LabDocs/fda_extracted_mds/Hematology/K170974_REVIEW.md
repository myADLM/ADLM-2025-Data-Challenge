1. Analytical performance:

a. Accuracy:

The Accuracy study was performed based on recommendations in the CLSI document CLSI EP9-A3, Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline- Third Edition. The accuracy study demonstrates equivalence between the test system BD FACSLyric™ with BD FACSuite™ clinical software and the BD FACSCantoII™ (predicate) with BD FACSCanto™ clinical software. Method comparison with the predicate instrument was used to determine accuracy through comparative evaluation of the same specimen stained with the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color; IMK) and the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent (TBNK) and analyzed in parallel with the new instrument and the predicate device. A total of 297 specimens were tested using Multitest 6-Color TBNK and 336 specimens from apparently healthy normals and HIV patients were tested with Multitest IMK kit at five clinical sites. Seven manipulated specimens were included in the analysis. Results are presented in the tables below:

Instrument Configuration Comparison was performed with 44 specimens comprised of $\mathrm { H I V } +$ donors and normal donors. Four of the normal donor samples were manipulated in order to provide for absolute CD4 count across the AMR.

Manipulations were done by diluting the whole blood specimen using cell free plasma and PBS to yield the desired $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ absolute count. The comparison demonstrated the performance equivalency of the six IVD channels between the 3-1, 4-2, 4-2-2 and 4-3-3 optical configurations of the FACSLyric flow cytometer.

b. Precision/Reproducibility: The precision study was performed based on recommendations in the CLSI document CLSI EP5-A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline-Third Edition.

# Repeatability:

Within-Site Repeatability was performed for the enumeration of the lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts across four FACSLyric flow cytometers, each with a different optical configuration. Testing was performed by four operators, two runs per day for 21 days using Streck CD-Chex Plus (K960894) and Streck CD-Chex Plus CD4 Low (K931825) as the control samples with four lots of 6-color TBNK reagent and four lots of IMK reagent. Multi-Check and Multi-Check CD4 Low Controls were used as the process controls. Each sample was stained in duplicate in Trucount tubes.

Whole Blood Repeatability performance was determined by enumeration of $\mathrm { C D } 3 +$ , $\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 8 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 +$ and $\mathrm { C D } 1 6 { + } 5 6 { + }$ lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts across all configurations of BD FACSLyric cytometers, using the BD Multitest 4-Color TBNK reagents (BD Multitest CD3/CD8/CD45/CD4 and BD Multitest $\mathrm { C D 3 / C D 1 6 + C D 5 6 / C D 4 5 / C D 1 9 ) }$ and BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK reagents in Trucount tubes. A total of 12 instruments were used with the 4-color assay and 9 instruments were used with the 6-color assay. Patient specimens were run in duplicate per instrument x three instruments x four configurations for 4-color reagents and 3 configurations for 6-color reagents. Specimens were tested with representation of values for CD4 across the AMR.

Whole Blood Repeatability was also performed for absolute CD4counts. The study was performed with 44 samples including normal and $\mathrm { H I V } +$ patient samples. Specimens spanned the analytical measuring range (AMR) and closely bracketed the medical decision points (very low $< 5 0$ CD4 cells $\mu \mathrm { L }$ and low 50 to $< 2 0 0$ CD4 ${ \mathrm { c e l l s } } / { \mu \mathrm { L } } )$ .

# Reproducibility:

Inter-laboratory reproducibility was carried out at four clinical sites using Streck CDChex Plus (K960894) process control materials tested for a minimum of 5 nonconsecutive days with one operator per site and one instrument per site. Three replicates of each level (normal and low) of the control material were tested during two runs per day on the FACSLyric system.

c. Linearity/assay reportable range: The linearity study was performed based on recommendations in the CLSI document CLSI EP6-A6, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline.

Linearity was evaluated using triplicate measurements of 11 concentrations of lymphocyte subsets across a range approximately 20 to $30 \%$ wider than the anticipated linear range. In addition, seven supplemental concentration levels for CD4 were used to evaluate linearity near the medical decision point at $5 0 \ \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ and 200 ${ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L } }$ for CD4 absolute counts. Linearity studies were performed on each configuration to verify that the relationship between the observed values and the true concentrations of the analyte was linear for each configuration. The objective of each linearity study was to estimate the linearity of the BD FACSLyric with BD FACSuite™ clinical software using the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color) and the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent for the lyse/no-wash method of sample preparation.

Whole blood samples collected in EDTA tubes were fractionated by centrifugation to isolate PBMCs, plasma, and RBCs. A low concentration pool was created using autologous plasma reconstituted with RBCs; a high concentration pool was created using concentrated PBMCs in autologous plasma and RBCs. Intermediate concentration levels were created by proportionally mixing high and low pools. Replicates of each dilution were stained with the BD Multitest IMK Kit (4-color) and BD Multitest 6-color TBNK Reagent in Trucount tubes.

Regression statistics were provided for all each cellular subset. The instrument system using the FACSuiteClinical software for the IMK and TBNK assay was found to be linear for each parameter (absolute counts) for each configuration.

d. Carryover: The carryover studies were performed based on CLSI H26-A2 Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology Analyzers; Approved Standard- Second Edition.

Sample Carryover:

Specimen carry over studies were performed on the BD FACSLyric™ to determine whether results were affected by contamination from neighboring samples. System carryover was evaluated by estimating the percent carryover of abnormally high leucocyte count samples to abnormally low leucocyte count samples. Three high leucocyte concentration samples were acquired sequentially, immediately followed by the sequential acquisition of three low leucocyte concentration samples. Carryover of both BD FACS Universal Loader (UL) and manual acquisition was evaluated on three FACSLyric instruments (one 3-1 and two 4-3-3) using two different sample volumes, $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { u L }$ and $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { u L }$ and calculating the percent difference according to the formula $\%$ Carryover $= [ ( \mathrm { L } 1 . \mathrm { L } 3 ) / \mathrm { H } 3 . \mathrm { L } 3 ) ] ^ { \ast } 1 0 0 .$ .

Carryover from one specimen to another was demonstrated to be leucocyte carryover less than or equal to $0 . 1 \%$ for low carryover and less than or equal to $0 . 5 \%$ for

standard carryover on all three FACSLyric instruments.

# Reagent Carryover:

Percent volume carryover was measured by enumeration of Trucount Control beads in known concentrations and sample volumes. Percent reagent carryover was then calculated using the volume carryover because the amount of reagent is consistent throughout the sample. Three replicates of Trucount tubes with Trucount High Control beads were run first, followed by three replicates of Trucount tubes without Trucount Control beads. The volume carryover was quantified by the number of Trucount High Control beads present in the first tube without Trucount Control beads (L1) after subtracting the number of events present in the third tube without Trucount Control beads (L3), this tube is considered background. This procedure was repeated three times on each instrument and each run was evaluated individually. The volume carryover experiment was carried out on three FACSLyric instruments using UL acquisition on two instruments and manual acquisition on one instrument. The amount of reagent being carried over is found to be well below the amount of reagent required for effective staining of the sample.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

Limit of Blank (LoB); Limit of Detection (LoD); Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved GuidelineSecond Edition.

Twenty four samples with sixty total replicates were evaluated for each blank for LoB and low concentration sample for LoD per reagent lot, across four test days for each instrument configuration. Three lots of the reagent were collected for a total of 180 data points per assay and configuration combination. LoB and LoD for all reagents tested was less than $1 5 \mathrm { \ c e l l s / \mu L }$ . For CD4 Lymphocyte subset absolute counts of each of the reagents, the established LoB and LoD were less than $5 0 \ \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

For LoQ determination, four low concentration pools were created by diluting normal whole blood with cell free plasma to achieve CD4 absolute counts of 10, 20, 30 and 50 ${ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L } }$ . Forty replicates were prepared from each of the concentration pools and were stained with two different lots of each reagent. Ten replicates from each concentration pool were run on each FACSLyric instrument configuration. The remaining ten replicates were run on the predicate device, FACSCanto II. The LoQ of the FACSLyric system with Multitest reagents was established for the $\mathrm { C D } 3 + .$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 4 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D 3 + C D 8 + }$ , $\mathrm { C D } 1 9 +$ , $\mathrm { C D } 1 6 { + } \mathrm { C D } 5 6 { + }$ and $\mathrm { C D 4 5 + }$ lymphocyte subsets. The LoQ is less than $5 0 \ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ for CD4 absolute count.

The reference interval study was performed based on recommendations in the CLSI document CLSI EP28-A3c, How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory, Approved Guideline-Second Edition. A total of 134 samples for Multitest 6-Color TBNK and 130 samples for Multitest IMK kit from one clinical site were evaluated. Reference Intervals for all lymphocyte subsets in the Multitest 6-Color TBNK and Multitest IMK kit were established for the FACSLyric system. Testing was performed using prospectively procured EDTA venous blood specimens from apparently healthy adult male and female subjects free of hematological abnormalities to satisfy age.
