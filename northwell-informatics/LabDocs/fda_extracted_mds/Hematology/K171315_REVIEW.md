# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

CellaVision DM96 and DM1200 Systems

The CellaVision DM96 and DM1200 (hereafter DM systems) both consist of a slide scanning unit (SSU) and a computer system. The SSU consists of a microscope, camera and a slide feeder unit; whereas the computer system contains the acquisition and classification software–CellaVision DM Software (CDMS). The DM96 and DM1200 perform the following functionalities:

· Scan a user-defined area on a slide   
· Locate and present images of every located cell or object found on the smear   
· Store images and results in a database   
· Present an overview image of a user-defined area on a slide   
· Create digital slides

# Advanced RBC Application

The Advanced RBC Application is an optional software module of the CellaVision DM Software (CDMS) that replaces the existing (standard) RBC functionality of the CellaVision DM Software installed on the CellaVision DM96 and DM1200. General functionality of the Advanced RBC Application includes:

Present and suggest 21 morphological characteristics in an overview image of red blood cells on a screen   
· Allow operators to confirm or modify the pre-characterization of the red blood cell morphology   
· Organize, present, and suggest a morphology for every individual red blood cell image on a screen Allow operators to confirm or modify the suggested classification of the red blood cells

The results for the red blood cells (RBCs) are presented as absolute cell counts and proportional counts and classified according to the user-predefined 4-grade scale for each morphological characteristic.

The major difference between the standard RBC functionality and the Advanced RBC Application is that the Advanced RBC Application pre-characterizes RBCs based on size, color, shape, and inclusion using trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into 21 morphological characteristics whereas the standard RBC functionality pre-characterizes into six morphological characteristics and does not have trained artificial neural networks (ANNs). Additionally, with the Advanced RBC Application, pre-characterized RBCs are displayed individually and in an overview screen image whereas the standard RBC functionality displays an overview screen image only.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

Patient blood smears are wedged and stained outside the device on standard rectangular glass slides by standardized staining methods provided in the labeling. Prepared slides are coded with a barcode label and placed in a barcode-labeled magazine, which is then loaded into the DM system. The DM system identifies the barcode on the magazines and the slides. The DM system requests order information from the Laboratory Information System, using the slide barcode information. If the DM System cannot communicate with the LIS, it defines the type of analysis from the information given by the barcode on the magazine and the predefined analysis settings. When a red blood cell image is ordered, an overview image is captured. The Advanced RBC Application precharacterizes the RBCs into 21 different morphological characteristics and calculates the relative percentage of distribution for each characteristic. Based on the relative percentages, a grade (0–3) is suggested for each characteristic. The operator views the overview or a panel of individual cell images and either verifies the results or performs a manual re-characterization. The operator can also re-characterize each cell into 10 different user defined morphology characteristics. The operator also has the capability of viewing the cells automatically excluded from analysis. A summary of the red blood cell analysis is presented. The operator signs the slide result with user name and password. The results can be sent to the LIS and/or be printed.

3. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ____X____ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

4. Specimen Identification: The device requires barcode labeled slides for processing.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

A peripheral blood sample collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ or $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ tubes is mixed manually by inversion. A thin blood film is wedged on a clean dry glass slide (a blood smear) and stained with Romanowsky stain. Body fluid samples are centrifuged onto a glass slide and stained with Romanowsky stain. The slide preparation occurs separately from the device.

6. Calibration: Not applicable

7. Quality Control:

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

Method comparison studies were performed at five clinical sites including two U.S. sites and three sites outside the U.S. The Advanced RBC Application on CellaVision DM96 and CellaVision DM1200 was compared with manual microscopy (reference method) and results from automated differential cell counters. An automated differential cell counter was used at four of the five clinical sites to characterize the RBC size (i.e., macrocytes, microcytes, or anisocytosis). At three of the five sites both the automated differential cell counter and manual microscopy were used for the comparison study. At the remaining two sites, one site used manual microscopy as the comparison method and the other site used the cell counter method as the comparison method to evaluate group size. For one of the five sites, an expert operator reviewed all images and then judged the morphology for each class by overriding (or confirming) the suggested grading. The results for the remaining sites were achieved by re-characterization of individual cell images into appropriate cell characteristics, thereby altering the suggested grading. At each study site, venous whole blood was collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ Vacutainer tubes. From each sample one slide was prepared. A total of 1598 samples were collected and tested for RBC characterization on DM96 and DM1200 at five different laboratories. The study population consisted of $4 7 . 3 \%$ males and $5 2 . 4 \%$ females including pediatric (i.e. neonates, infants, children, and adolescents) and adult subjects up to 101 years of age. The gender for $0 . 3 \%$ of the study population (5 samples) was reported as unknown. In addition to healthy individuals, subjects with the following clinical conditions were included in the studies: iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, megaloblastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (including sideroblastic anemia and myelofibrosis), hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic microangiopathy (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , hemolytic uremic syndrome ), post-splenectomy and malaria.

The evaluation was divided into two parts, a primary evaluation at group level and a secondary evaluation for individual morphologies. The secondary evaluation was in turn divided into two sub-levels as described below:

· Primary evaluation of the groups color, size, shape and inclusions Secondary evaluation of individual morphologies: Ø Part 1: Evaluation of the group of clinically significant morphologies and parasites: schistocytes (+helmet cells), target cells, sickle cells, tear drop cells and parasites. Ø Part 2: Evaluation of the remaining individual morphologies: polychromatic cells, hypochromatic cells, anisocytosis, microcytes, macrocytes,

poikilocytosis, spherocytes, elliptocytes, ovalocytes, stomatocytes, acanthocytes, echinocytes, Howell-Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies and basophilic stippling.

To determine agreement between the Advanced RBC Application and manual microscopy reference method, the efficiency, analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity were calculated along with the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for color, size and shape. Comparison between the DM system with Advanced RBC Application and the automated differential cell counter method for size was provided as overall agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) along with the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision performance using the Advanced RBC Application on CellaVision DM96 and CellaVision DM1200 was evaluated by performing repeatability and reproducibility studies across three clinical laboratories.

# Repeatability

The repeatability study was performed at three clinical laboratories. The samples included both normal and elevated levels for each of the 21 RBC morphological characteristics included in the Advanced RBC Application. At two of the three sites, six samples were run on DM96 and seven samples were run on DM1200, respectively. At the third site, seven samples were run on DM96 and eight samples were run on DM1200. From each sample, two slides were prepared as replicates. Slides were run two times a day with two replicates per run for 20 days on both DM96 and DM1200. The study was designed to provide repeatability data for both qualitative results (e.g. grade 0, 1, 2 and 3) and quantitative results (e.g. proportional count) for each morphological characteristic. The grading agreement was calculated for each slide and for each sample by determining the relation between the occurrence of true grade and the total number of runs for each morphological characteristic. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria. Representative data from one site is presented below.

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility study was performed at three sites with samples collected from routine workflow that included normal and elevated levels for each of the 21 RBC morphological characteristics. From each sample, three slides were prepared. The slides were then run at each site two times a day for 5 days. Seven blood samples were used for the DM96 study and five samples were used for the DM1200 study. The grading reproducibility was calculated by determining the relation between the occurrence of true grade and the total number of runs. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria.
