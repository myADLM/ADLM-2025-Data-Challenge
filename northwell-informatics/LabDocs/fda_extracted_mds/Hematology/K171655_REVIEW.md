# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system is an automated hematology analyzer with integrated slide making capability and digital cell imaging technology. It uses digital morphology to provide a complete blood count, 5-part differential, and reticulocyte enumeration from capillary or venous whole blood samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ or $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ . It also uses digital imaging to classify red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets based on morphological characteristics.

The cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system consists of the following major components:

§ The analyzer   
§ Viewing station   
§ Associated consumables and components   
Cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system software for the analyzer, viewing station and image analysis   
§ Printer

# cobas m 511 analyzer

The cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ analyzer is a stand-alone hematology analyzer with integrated slide making capability and digital cell imaging that contains a rack transport system for sample tubes. It has five processing stations: sample mixing, slide printing, slide staining, slide imaging (low and high magnification) and slide output. It also includes a separate compartment, which houses the necessary consumables and waste containers.

# cobas m 511 viewing station

The viewing station hardware is a computer with software that provides the graphical user interface for the system. It is designed to interface with a standard Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result reporting. It can be configured as the control station or as a review station

# Consumables and components

The DigiMAC³ stain pack is intended to fix and stain cells from a whole blood sample or control/calibrator material that have been applied to a slide by the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ analyzer. The DigiMAC3 stain pack is comprised of the following four separate solutions, which are individually applied to each processed slide: DigiMAC3 fix, DigiMAC3 eosin, DigiMAC3 methylene blue, and DigiMAC3 rinse. The application of these stain solutions results in a Romanowsky type stain.

DigiMAC³ reticulocyte is intended to stain a whole blood sample or control material before it is applied to a slide by the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ analyzer, in order to make the reticulocytes suitable for automated imaging or manual microscopy.

DigiMAC3 wash is used to clean all specimen-contacting surfaces, including blood fluid pathways, following processing of each blood sample.

DigiMAC3 clean is used to remove protein build-up from the surfaces of the cobas m 511 analyzer components that come in contact with blood samples.

The DigiMAC³ slide is a glass substrate on which a whole blood sample or control/calibrator material is applied and stained by the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ analyzer, in order to enable automated imaging or manual microscopy.

Software Used in cobas m 511 system

The cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system includes three major software components: viewing station software, analyzer software, and the image analysis application.

# Viewing Station Software

The viewing station software provides the user interface to the cobas m 511 analyzer, including: managing system configuration and consumables; reporting analyzer and sample processing status; troubleshooting and error recover; quality control processing and results; reviewing sample results; classifying/reclassifying cells; and evaluating cell morphology.

Analyzer Software

The analyzer software runs the analyzer computer and manages all hardware elements, sample processing, data management, and viewing station communications.

Image Analysis Application

The image analysis application runs on the analyzer computer and communicates with the cameras and motion-control hardware to acquire images at both the low- and highmagnification imaging stations. The program identifies and measures cells in the images, and it reports the cell counts and measurements to the analyzer software. It also saves images for display on the viewing station.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system uses digital morphology from an automatically produced Romanowsky stained monolayer slide, to provide the complete blood count (CBC), automated white blood cell (WBC) differential, and the enumeration of reticulocytes. This is done through the use of proprietary imaging algorithms that locate, count and evaluate red and white blood cells, platelets and nucleated red blood cells.

The cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system prints a consistent sample volume (1 uL) onto a glass microscope slide using a precision application method. In the stainer module, four reagents are applied to the cells on the slide: a fixative, an eosin stain, a methylene blue stain, and a rinse. Following staining, the slide is imaged at low magnification using a $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ lens to locate, image, and count white and red blood cells, nucleated red blood cells, and platelets. The system selects a specific number of white blood cell locations and provides their coordinates to the high magnification module for additional analysis. In the high magnification module, a $5 0 \mathrm { x }$ lens is used to classify white blood cell types, evaluate red blood cells, and platelets and to evaluate cellular morphology. The white blood cells are categorized into five types (NEUT, LYM, MONO, EO, BASO), or as unclassified cells by the instrument. This allows a skilled technologist to review images of the cells on the viewing station or to perform a full microscopic review of the slide. This $5 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification is also used to identify and count the reticulocytes when a reticulocyte test is requested. For reticulocyte processing, an additional slide is produced from blood in the sample cup that is first incubated with a supravital stain. The cells are then printed onto the slide, stained using DigiMAC3 stain and imaged to determine the number and percentage of reticulocytes and reticulocyte hemoglobin.

Following processing, results and images can be viewed on the viewing station. The viewing station allows the operator to monitor system processes and status, and to view sample processing and results. The viewing station also allows a skilled medical technologist to perform a full white blood cell differential and a morphological review of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets for samples requiring further review.

# 3. Modes of Operation:

Yes ____X____ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No ___X_

4. Specimen Identification:

Specimen identification is manual entry by keyboard, hand-held barcode reader or automated identification by barcode reader.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Samples can be introduced onto the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system using either the closed tube (automated rack mode) or open tube modes. In the closed tube mode, the operator loads the sample tubes into a custom rack. The rack is then mechanically transported into the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system for processing. In this mode the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system automatically mixes, aspirates, and analyzes samples while the sample caps remain intact. In the open tube mode, the operator processes individual samples by manually mixing the sample collection tube by hand and then introducing the sample to the open port aspiration probe presented by the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system. The operator will position the tube such that the aspiration probe is immersed into the approximate center of the blood volume.

6. Calibration:

The DigiMAC3 calibrator is used for calibration of the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system. The calibrator is a stable suspension of cells of human or animal origin. It is used for calibrating the following hematology parameters of the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system: WBC, RBC, MCH, MCV, PLT, and MPV.

7. Quality Control:

DigiMAC3 controls are hematology quality control (QC) materials which consist of stable suspensions of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets of human or animal origin. There are three levels of controls (L1, L2 and L3), which are used in conjunction with each other for monitoring the performance of the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ analyzer.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

Accuracy and Comparison at Medical Decision Levels

This study was conducted to evaluate accuracy of the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system compared to reference methods and the Symex XN-10 for samples at medical decision levels for hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean cell volume (MCV), platelet (PLT) and reticulocytes (RET). The results of 50 samples from the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system were compared to the following methods: cyanmethemoglobin for the HGB parameter, packed cell volume (PCV) for the HCT parameter, and a ratio using the PCV and RBC count to determine the MCV parameter and Sysmex analyzer for PLT and RET paremeters. Bias to the applicable method and its $9 5 \%$ CI were determined both separately and combined using data obtained from each cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system and each medical decision level studied. All results were within the predefined acceptance criteria.

# Accuracy for Leukopenia Samples

This study was conducted to evaluate accuracy of the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system compared to the 200-cell manual differential of leukopenia samples performed by two medical technologists using the reference method. Ten granulocytopenia samples with granulocytes $\leq 1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ and 20 leukopenia samples with white blood cell counts $\dot { \leq } 4 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } \dot { 1 0 ^ { 3 } } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ were included in the analysis. For both the test and reference methods, the five WBC differential parameters, nucleated red blood cells and immature/abnormal cell types (e.g. blast and immature granulocytes) were differentiated and enumerated. Sensitivity and specificity were caluculated for the detection of distributional and morphological abnormalities for the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ image, automated differential, system messages and slides versus the reference method. The test method results were compared with the results of the reference method to assess bias. The results met the overall acceptance criteria.

# b. Method Comparison:

# Method Comparison of Subjects with Medical Conditions

This study was conducted to demonstrate that results produced by the cobas m 511 system are comparable to those produced by the Sysmex XN-10 analyzer when samples from patients with specific medical conditions are evaluated. One-hundred thirty residual whole blood samples were obtained for 23 targeted medical conditions: leukopenia, leukocytosis, neutropenia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, basophilia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, polycythemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, hemoglobin SC disease, hemolytic anemia, multiple myeloma and septicemia. Each sample was processed in singlicate on the cobas m 511 system and Sysmex XN-10. Deming regression (slope, intercept, $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals and correlation coefficient) was performed according to CLSI EP09-A3. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

# Method Comparison

Method comparison studies were performed at five clinical sites (three sites in U.S. and two sites in the European Union) to evaluate the performance of the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system compared to the Sysmex XN-10 analyzer using a total of 1,859 residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous whole blood samples. This study included both pediatric (neonate to $\leq 2 1$ years) and adult subjects, as well as samples from patients with hematologic conditions and ditributional abnormalities (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, elevated hematocrit, elevated nucleated red blood cells).

Bias was determined based on the results of either a Passing-Bablok or Deming regression model. For all parameters, except those with an expected large number of valid results of zero (i.e., %EO, #EO, $\%$ BASO and #BASO), the Passing-Bablok regression model was used to determine the intercept and slope of the regression line.

For those parameters with a large number of valid results of zero, the Deming (orthogonal) regression model was used. For either regression model used, the sample size (N), Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), slope and intercept along with their $9 5 \%$ CIs, and the range of comparative measurement procedure values are reported. Bias was determined based on the results of either a Passing-Bablok or Deming regression model. The calculated bias along with its $9 5 \%$ CI are also reported for the critical bias points at the low end, high end, and crossover point. All results were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

Ψbias was calculated using the mean difference between the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system result and the Sysmex XN-10

# Sensitivity and Specificity

For the sensitivity and specificity analysis, the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ automated differential, cobas m 511 system messages and cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ images were compared to a 400-cell differential derived from two independent 200-cell microscopic reviews of a blood smear (reference method). For this analysis, separate $2 \mathbf { x } 2$ tables were constructed in order to determine sensitivity for both morphological and distributional abnormalities.

# Morphological Grading

To determine the performance of the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system (images and slides) with respect to reporting of morphology grading, data was analyzed using percent agreement analysis. The morphology grading of 163 sample results from cobas m 511 images and cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ slides was compared to morphology grading obtained by a trained independent reviewer (IR) from a single blood smear. WBC morphology, platelet morphology and RBC size, color and shape characteristics that were graded using a quantitative grading system (e.g., 0 to $^ { 4 + }$ grading scale), the sample size (N), the number of results that agree (A), the number of results that disagree (D), and the percent agreement were reported. RBC inclusions (parasites, basophilic stippling, Howell-jolly bodies, and Pappenheimer bodies) were graded using a present/not present grading system, the sample size (N), the number of results that agree (A and D), the number of results that disagree (B and C), the percent positive and negative agreements (PPA and NPA, respectively), and total agreement are reported. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

# c. Precision/Reproducibility:

Two studies were conducted to assess repeatability on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system. The first study evaluated inter-intrument precision of whole blood samples and the second study evaluted within-run precision.

Inter-instrument precision was evaluated using whole blood samples from five healthy volunteer donors and 21 residual abnormal samples. Eleven replicates were processed from each sample on three different cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ systems (33 replicates total per sample) at one site. Abnormal samples included low and high reticulocyte counts $( \% \mathrm { R E T } \leq 0 . 5 \%$ and $\ge 5 . 0 \%$ , respectively) and medical decision level samples including anemia (HGB $6 { - } 1 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L } )$ , thrombocytopenia $( \mathrm { P L T } \leq 1 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$ , and severe leukopenia (WBC $0 { - } 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$ ). The mean, standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% \mathrm { C V } )$ with corresponding $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals were calculated for each parameter using a variance component analysis. Within-run precision (repeatability), between-instrument variability, and total variability (interinstrument precision) were analyzed. All results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

To evaluate repeatability (i.e., within-run precision) whole blood samples were processed 31 consecutive times on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system. Residual whole blood samples were selected for the WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT parameters at targeted low, middle and high ranges. In addition, samples at medical decision levels of anemia, thrombocytopenia, severe leukopenia, and nucleated red blood cells were evaluated. At each of the four sites, 48 samples were targeted for collection (36 residual whole blood samples and 12 medical decision level samples). Repeatability results were calculated for all sites combined and all results met their predefined acceptance criteria.

# Reproducibility

Two studies were conducted to assess reproducibility on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system. The first study evaluated total precision of a single cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ instrument at one site and the second study evaluated total precision of the cobas system across multiple sites.

To evaluate single-site reproducibility, testing was performed using a single cobas m 511 system with three lots of DigiMAC3 stain packs, wash solution, and reticulocyte stain and three different lots of DigiMAC3 controls. Three different operators conducted the study over the course of 20 operating days with wo runs per day and two replicates per run. The following components of precision were evaluated: repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-day, between-lot, between-operator, and within-laboratory (total precision). All results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

To evalute precision at all sites, one lot of control material (L1, L2, L3) was used across four sites for five days with two runs per day and three replicates per run. The data generated from this assessment was used to calculate repeatability (within-run precision), between-day and between-run precision, between-laboratory precision (includes variability of different systems and operators), and reproducibility (total precision). For each reported parameter and for each level of control tested, the sample size (N), mean, SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of the various components of precision were calculated along with the $9 5 \%$ CI of the SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for repeatability and reproducibility (total precision). All results met the predefined acceptance criteria.

\*Parameters were evaluated based on SD.

# c. Linearity:

Linearity for RBC, HGB, HCT and WBC was evaluated using fresh whole blood samples. PLT linearity was evaluated using fresh platelet apheresis samples and corresponding whole blood samples. Reticulocyte (RET) linearity was evaluated using residual whole blood samples. Each sample was concentrated and diluted as necessary to create three separate linearity series, each consisting of a high pool, a low pool, and seven intermediate concentrations. The low pool concentrations for WBCs ranged from $0 . 0 4 { - } 0 . 0 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { { \mu L } }$ and the high pool concentrations ranged from $4 0 4 . 8 { - } 5 6 1 . 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ . In the linearity series for PLT the low pool concentration ranged from $0 { - } 9 \mathrm { ~ x ~ i 0 } ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the high pool concentration ranged from $5 0 0 0 { - } 5 1 3 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ $1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The low pool concentrations in each of the three separate linearity series for RET ranged from $0 . 0 1 { - } 0 . 0 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ and the high pool concentrations ranged from $0 . 6 3 \mathrm { - } 0 . 7 \bar { 5 } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ . Each of the nine concentrations, in each of the three linearity series, was processed to obtain six replicates in each of the closed tube and open tube modes. Each linearity series was processed in both open and closed tube modes on three cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ systems.

Regression analysis was used to assess linearity for first order model (e.g. linear), and weighted polynomial regression was used to assess linearity for second and third order models (e.g, quadratic and cubic). RBC achieved linearity with a first order model while for all other parameters linearity was achieved through polynomial regression.

# d. Carryover:

Carryover study was conducted at targeted thresholds for WBC, RBC, PLT and samples with a high percentage of blasts. For each of the four sample types, three independent carryover experiments were conducted at each site using residual hightarget value (HTV) whole blood samples for a total of 48 samples [12 samples for each of the four categories]. Filtered serum samples were used as low-target value (LTV) samples. For each experiment at each site, the HTV samples were run three consecutive times immediately followed by three LTV serum samples. Slides from the LTV serum samples were reviewed by an external hematopathologist to determine WBC, RBC, PLT and blast percent carryover from the HTV samples. Carryover for the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system met all predefined acceptance criteria.

# e. Interfering Substances:

The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential interference effects of hemolysis, lipemia, icterus (unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin), high levels of white blood cells $\mathrm { ( W B C > 1 0 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } / L ) }$ ) and high levels of platelets $\mathrm { ( P L T > 1 0 0 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } / L ) }$ ). Each interfering substance was tested in a series of six incremental concentrations.

Results showed there were no significant interference effects of unconjugated bilirubin or conjugated bilirubin up to the maximum tested concentration of $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the evaluated parameters.

There were no significant hemolysis interference effects up to the maximum tested concentration of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for evaluated parameters.

Clinically significant hemolysis interference effects were observed at $\geq 6 7 2 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ for HGB and $\geq 7 9 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for HCT.

There were no significant lipemia interference effects up to the maximum tested concentration of $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for evaluated parameters.

Clinically significant lipemia interference effects were observed at $\geq 1 6 4 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for WBC and $\geq 2 4 5 9 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for LYMPH #.

High concentrations of white blood cells (up to $1 0 0 . 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L } )$ and high concentrations of platelets (up to $1 1 6 6 \times \mathrm { i } 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { \mu L }$ ) did not cause any clinically significant bias in any of the evaluated parameters.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

a. Reference Intervals

The normal adult reference interval for all parameters reported by the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system was established by analyzing whole blood samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ from a total population of 489 healthy individuals $\mathrm { N } { = } 2 4 0$ males, $\mathrm { N } { = } 2 4 9$ females).

A literature reference interval verification study was performed for the pediatric population. A total of 504 samples were collected from apparently healthy pediatric patients that ranged from $< 1$ day old to 18 years (258 samples) and 18 to $\leq 2 2$ years (246 samples) to support the Intended Use. All samples were collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulant and analyzed in singlet in the automated whole blood sampling mode.

# b. Mode to Mode Comparison

To demonstrate equivalency between results of samples processed in the closed tube (i.e. automated) mode of operation and the open tube (i.e. manual) mode of operation on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system, a comparison study was conducted using 140 residual samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ . Correlation and bias between the closed tube and open tube processing mode results were determined based on the results of either a Passing-Bablok or Deming regression model. For the $\% { \mathrm { N R B C } }$ and #NRBC parameters the mean difference was used to calculate bias. All reportable parameters that were evaluated met their predefined bias acceptance criteria.

# c. Open Mode studies

# Precision (repeatability)

To evaluate repeatability in open tube mode performance, 12 residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples selected at random from the routine laboratory population as well as two residual whole blood samples with reticulocytes $\ge 5 \%$ were used for this study. Eleven replicates were processed from each random sample on three different cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ systems (33 replicates per sample) in the open tube mode. The results from all three systems were pooled for analysis. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and percent coefficient of variation $( \% \mathrm { C V } )$ with corresponding $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals were calculated for each parameter using a variance component analysis in accordance with the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Within-run precision (repeatability), between-instrument variability, and total variability (inter-instrument precision) were analyzed. All results were within the predefined acceptance criteria.

# Morphology

To assess the WBC differential parameters and WBC, RBC and PLT morphology in open tube mode, two studies were conducted using 24 targeted residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples. The samples were processed in both open tube and closed tube modes on each of three cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ systems. Two separate analyses were conducted. In Part IIA the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system automated WBC differential results for the 24 samples were compared between the open tube and closed tube modes. Correlation and bias were determined in accordance with the CLSI EP09-A3 guideline. In Part IIB, each of three medical technologists (MTs) reviewed on the viewing station all of the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ images generated from the 24 samples from all three systems, which were run in both open tube and closed tube modes. This analysis was conducted to determine whether WBC, RBC and PLT morphology were consistent between the

two modes and between systems. Two analysis methods were used to evaluate results from this portion of the study. Agreement analysis was performed for each morphological characteristic using either a qualitative grading system (e.g., Present / Not Present) or a quantitative grading system (e.g., 0 to $^ { 4 + }$ grading scale). All results were within the predefined acceptance criteria.

# Carryover

Carryover in the open tube mode was evaluated using four residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples, each selected as a high target value (HTV) sample type. Three separate experiments were run for each of the WBC, RBC, PLT and blasts samples. In each experiment, the HTV sample was processed three consecutive times immediately followed by three tubes of low target value (LTV) samples. The HTV and LTV samples were run in open tube mode on a single cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system. The LTV samples, were comprised of filtered serum equilibrated to room temperature. By design, when serum samples are run on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system, the instrument will make a slide but will ultimately reject the sample when it is presented at the lowmagnification imaging station because it does not contain sufficient cells for the imaging microscopes to focus. The LTV slides, however, were retrieved from the instrument and manually reviewed under a microscope to assess if any carryover was evident from the three prior runs of HTV samples. Carryover in the open tube mode for the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system met all predefined acceptance criteria.

d. Limits of Detection, Blank, and Quantitation (LoD, LoB, and LoQ)

This study was conducted to evaluate LoB, LoD and LoQ WBC and PLT parameters on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system. The study was conducted using three cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ systems. To determine LoB, testing was performed on three individual test days, using five preserved Streck RBC samples which contained no white blood cells or platelets. These samples were processed two times per test day on each of two cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ systems, yielding a total of 60 measurements. To determine LoD, residual $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ whole blood samples with targeted low level values that were greater than the LoB were used. The LoD samples were processed four consecutive times on each of three cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ systems, for a total of 72 measurements for both WBC and PLT samples. To determine LoQ, residual whole blood samples with targeted low level values that were greater than the LoD were used. The LoB, LoD and LoQ were successfully determined and met all pre-specified acceptance criteria.

# e. $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ Performance Comparison

This study was conducted to demonstrate comparability between whole blood samples collected into $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA. This study was performed using 44 whole blood samples from healthy volunteer donors. For each sample, the $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ results were compared to $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ results for all parameters. All acceptance criteria were met, demonstrating equivalency of results between samples collected into $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ .

To evaluate whole blood samples collected with $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ a method comparison study was conducted with 40 abnormal samples on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ and Sysmex XN10. Bias was determined based on the results of either a Passing-Bablok or Deming regression model, except for the $\% { \mathrm { N R B C } }$ and #NRBC parameters. For these two parameters, no regression analysis was used; rather, the bias was calculated as the mean difference between the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system and Sysmex Analyzer. Results were within predefined critical bias limits.

# f. Venous and Capillary Blood Performance Comparisons

This study was conducted to demonstrate comparability between capillary and venous blood processed on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system from the same donor. This study was performed using 40 paired whole blood samples from healthy volunteer donors. Blood was drawn twice from each donor, once via venipuncture (venous) and once via finger-stick (capillary). For all samples, results from the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system were comparable for capillary and venous blood. Overall, the data demonstrate that both capillary and venous blood can be processed on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system and produce similar results.

To evaluate abnormal capillary whole blood samples on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system a method comparison study was conducted with 40 abnormal capillary samples on the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ and Sysmex XN-10. Bias was determined based on the results of either a Passing-Bablok or Deming regression model, except for the $\% { \mathrm { N R B C } }$ and #NRBC parameters. For these two parameters, no regression analysis was used; rather, the bias was calculated as the mean difference between the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system and Sysmex Analyzer. Results were within predefined bias limits.

# g. Sample Stability

Sample stability was determined for normal and abnormal samples at two clinical sites. Normal samples were processed in duplicate at each of the following time points: baseline (time zero (0)) and after 9, 20, 26, 38, and 50 hours in both ambient $( 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and refrigerated $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ storage conditions. Abnormal samples were processed in duplicate at each of the following time points: baseline (time zero (0)) and after 9, 26, and 50 hours in both ambient $( 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and refrigerated $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ storage conditions. For each time point, results were compared to the respective baseline (zero (0) hour) results. The combined results from both protocols demonstrated stability for normal and abnormal samples for 48 hours.

# h. Stability of cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ Slides

This study was conducted to demonstrate that cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ slides stored for 30 days produce similar results compared to original (baseline) results, with respect to manual microscopic reviews for the WBC differential and morphology. The results from all evaluations performed during this study were successful and met predefined acceptance criteria. This demonstrates that slides generated by the cobas $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 5 1 1$ system are stable for manual microscopic review for a minimum of 30 days.
