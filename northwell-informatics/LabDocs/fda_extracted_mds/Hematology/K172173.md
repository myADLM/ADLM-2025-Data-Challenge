# VII. Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was determined in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”. Two precision studies were performed at the clinical sites per protocol EKF-PS-01. One study was a 20-Day multi-site study using

three levels of external control material, and the other study was a single-day, single-site precision study with 5 levels of natural and manipulated K2EDTA venous blood.

# 20-Day Precision

The 20-Day precision was performed by running external controls in duplicate twice per day by two operators at each of three sites (a $2 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 3$ format with 6 operators, 3 lots, 3 instruments and 3 sites). Lots and instruments were nested with sites. The study was performed by six of the same operators who performed the Method Comparison studies. The 20-Day precision data met the criteria of $< 7 \%$ CV.

# Single-Day Precision

Single-Day precision was performed at a single site using $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous whole blood. Five donors provided 5 samples, some of which were manipulated by removing plasma to increase hemoglobin, or diluting with the same donor’s plasma to decrease hemoglobin. The study was performed at a new single site using 3 instruments, 3 lots and 3 untrained operators who had no prior experience running the DiaSpect Tm, and self-trained on the system. Each of 3 operators ran duplicate tests on all 5 levels with 3 lots of cuvettes in each of 3 instruments, providing 54 measurements for each level. The higher $\% \mathrm { C V }$ found for Level 5 may be due to the increased viscosity of the abnormally high hematocrit for the samples. The Single-Day precision study met the criteria of $< 7 \%$ CV.

# b. Linearity

A linearity study was conducted based on CLSI EP6-A. Specimens having eleven hemoglobin levels were prepared from venous whole blood. Each level was tested in triplicate on one DiaSpect Tm analyzer. Average results were plotted against results obtained from a HemoPoint $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ H2 analyzer, which was used as the reference method. Summarized results are presented in the following diagram. The correlation coefficient was greater than 0.95 and the slope of the linear equation was within $1 . 0 { \pm } 0 . 1$ which met acceptance criteria.

# d. Detection Limit:

LoB

Plasma samples were obtained from (5) individual whole blood donors. The five (5) plasma “blank” samples were tested for 3 days on one (1) DiaSpect Tm meter in quadruplicate $\left( \mathbf { x } 4 \right)$ using two (2) different lots of DiaSpect Tm cuvettes.

# LoD

Four (4) whole blood samples (K2EDTA) were collected from different donors. Four (4) independent samples covering Hgb concentrations 0.1 to $0 . 4 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ were prepared. Each sample was tested sixty (60) times on (1) DiaSpect Tm device using two (2) different lots of DiaSpect Tm cuvettes for 3 days.

Nine (9) unique donor whole blood samples were used to prepare concentrations from 0.7-1.5 $\mathrm { g / d L }$ . Each sample was tested using two lots of DiaSpect Tm cuvettes on one DiaSpect Tm analyzer at least ten times for each lot for three days to achieve variability. The mean and SD for each sample concentration for each cuvette lot was determined and the bias for each of the nine levels calculated. LoQ was determined from the specified Total Error to be $1 . 2 \mathrm { g } \backslash \mathrm { d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference and cross-reactivity studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI guidance EP7-A2 “Interference testing in clinical chemistry”.

Whole venous blood was collected with $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ tubes and was manipulated to create 3 hemoglobin concentrations of 11.0, 14.0, and $1 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Each hemoglobin concentration was spiked with potential interferent at the test concentrations listed below.

For Disease Conditions $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous blood specimens from up to five (5) donors with the following conditions were collected: Polycythemia, Hypochromia, High WBC Count and Sickle Cell. The predicate device HemoPoint(H2) was used as the reference method to obtain the Hgb concentration. Each sample was tested in duplicate on the H2 and five times on the DiaSpect Tm device. The predicate HemoPoint(H2) average was used to calculate the bias against each individual DiaSpect Tm result.

Conclusion: The DiaSpect Tm cuvette has a shelf life of at least 2.5 years.

# h. Calibration

The DiaSpect Tm analyzer is factory calibrated and is not user adjustable.

# i. Quality Control

The DiaSpect Tm system includes 3 levels of control solutions with known hemoglobin concentration. The DiaSpect Control HBT is produced in three concentrations that correspond to three levels of human hemoglobin. Each vial contains $1 . 9 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of a solution of a red dye (Rhodamine) in purified water. The reagent does not contain any material of human or animal origin.

The DiaSpect Control HBT is 510(k) exempt.

# 2. Method Comparison Studies

Method comparison:

Method comparison studies were performed across four sites to support the substantial equivalence of the DiaSpect Tm Hemoglobin System with the predicate device. Finger stick capillary, $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and lithium heparin venous whole blood specimens from a total of 399 subjects across four point-of-care clinical sites were tested on-site with both the DiaSpect Tm system (in singlicate) and in the HemoPoint® H2 Hemoglobin Analyzer (comparative method, in duplicate). IRB approval was obtained prior to initiating the studies.

A total of 364 male and female subjects, ranging from 9 months to 89 years of age, provided 363 capillary samples ranging from 8.5 to $2 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ , 349 EDTA venous samples ranging from 6.5 to $1 9 . 9 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ and 120 heparin venous samples ranging from 10.4 to $2 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ when tested in the DiaSpect Tm system. An additional 35 contrived EDTA venous samples were divided between three sites and tested to challenge the full measuring range of the DiaSpect Tm system. Of the 349 EDTA venous samples, five samples with hemoglobin values of $6 { - } 7 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ were tested in comparison with the predicate at one additional internal site to demonstrate the performance of the device around these levels.

Testing was performed over a 5-week period by 9 operators using four DiaSpect Tm analyzers and three lots of DiaSpect Tm Cuvettes. A single lot of tri-level DiaSpect Control HBT external controls were run each day specimens were tested. Clinical Study sites were required to have a current Certificate of Waiver and all operators were untrained, intended use operators. Operators were full time employees of the Certificate of Waiver test sites used in the study, who normally perform phlebotomy and/or participate in patient testing. Capillary whole blood and $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA venous whole blood were tested at the four sites by 9 operators. Lithium heparin was tested at one site by two operators. The results for all natural and contrived samples combined are summarized in Table below.

# Matrix Comparison

120 paired natural EDTA and heparin samples, ranging from $1 0 . 4 - 1 9 . 9 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ (EDTA) or $1 0 . 4 - 2 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (heparin) Hgb, agreed closely and can be used interchangeably in the DiaSpect Tm system. Agreement between capillary and EDTA samples in the DiaSpect was favourable to that of the predicate system, and thus the DiaSpect Tm and predicate are substantially equivalent.

Reference interval calculations were performed to verify that the results obtained for a normal reference population using the DiaSpect Tm Hemoglobin Measuring System are equivalent to published ranges (Dacie and Lewis, Practical Haematology, Twelfth Edition, Elsevier Limited 2017). Prospective fingerstick and venous EDTA DiaSpect Tm values from normal, healthy individuals enrolled in the method comparison studies were pooled and used. The interval between the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles was taken as the reference interval. Results for subjects with no medications, capillary and EDTA venous samples combined.
