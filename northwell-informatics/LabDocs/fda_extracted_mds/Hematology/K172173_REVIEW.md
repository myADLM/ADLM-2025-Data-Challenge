# L. Test Principle:

The DiaSpect Tm utilizes a broad spectrum, multi-chromatic sensor which measures the absorbance over a wide spectral range in a clear plastic cuvette. The system uses a photometric approach to measure the concentration of hemoglobin per the Lambert-Beer Law, which states the relationship between the concentration of the material $c$ (hemoglobin, in this case), the path length of the light travelling through the material $l$ and the specific absorption coefficient at a distinct wavelength $\varepsilon$

$$
A { = } { \varepsilon } l c
$$

As the path length (which is the fixed cavity depth of the cuvettes) and the absorption coefficient are constant and known, the hemoglobin concentration is a linear function of the absorbance. With a mathematical model, a wavelength range was found where Hb and HbO2 have the same absorbance integral. Turbidity from the unhemolyzed blood, as well as the impact of possible interfering substances (such as bilirubin or white blood cells), are addressed by performane of reference measurements at infrared ( $6 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ to $7 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ) and blue ( $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ to $5 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ). During the measurement interval, a white LED is flashed. The light beam is sent through the sample to an optical sensor element and the sensor detects the absorbance of the blood sample at a broad wavelength range. A “light trap” prevents scattered light from arriving at the sensor.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

20-day Precision/Reproducibility

Reproducibility was conducted at three intended use sites over 20 operating days using three DiaSpect Cuvette lots (one lot per site), three DiaSpect Tm Analyzers (one instrument per site), and one lot of DiaSpect Controls (Levels 1, 2 and 3). Each control set was run in duplicate twice daily for 20 days, by two operators at each site. A total of 160 test results were generated for each control level at each site. SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for within-run, between-run, between-day, between-operator, and between-site were calculated for each site and all sites combined. Reproducibility results at all test sites were within the defined acceptance criteria.

# Single-day Precision

Single-day precision was performed at a single site using $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ venous whole blood. Five donors provided five samples (one sample each), some of which were manipulated to increase or decrease hemoglobin levels. The study was performed at a single site using three instruments, three lots of cuvettes, and three operators. Each of three operators ran duplicate tests on all five levels, providing 54 measurements for each level. Single-day precision results were within the defined acceptance criteria.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted using low and high-level hemoglobin concentrations prepared from a single, venous whole blood sample. A total of 11 hemoglobin concentrations (0.0, 0.2, 1.6, 3.7, 7.2, 10.4, 13.2, 16.5, 19.0, 23.7, $2 5 . 6 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ ) spanning the claimed measuring range of the DiaSpect Tm Analyzer $( 0 . 3 { - } 2 5 . 5 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ were tested in triplicate and analyzed using one DiaSpect Tm Analyzer and one lot of DiaSpect Tm Cuvettes. Average results were plotted against results obtained from a HemoPoint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ H2 analyzer, which was used as the reference method. The data was analyzed using linear regression. The DiaSpect Tm demonstrated linearity over the claimed measuring range of $0 . 3 { - } 2 5 . 5 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

DiaSpect Tm Cuvette Stability

DiaSpect Cuvette shelf-life was determined by using 12 different lots of DiaSpect Tm Cuvettes produced over a 2.5 year period. At the end of the 2.5 years, four cuvettes from each lot were tested by measuring the medium level of the DiaSpect Control HB, target value $1 2 . 6 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ , on the DiaSpect Tm Analyzer. The mean value of the measurements from all lots is $1 2 . 5 9 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ , with a total CV $0 . 7 5 \%$ . The data support a shelf-life stability claim of 2.5 years.

# Sample Stability

Sample stability was assessed using one lot of DiaSpect Tm Cuvettes and one DiaSpect Tm analyzer. Five volunteers were used to donate two venous samples (one $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and one lithium heparin). Samples were aliquoted into $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquots for each time point of the study, labeled, and stored at refrigerated temperature $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and at room temperature $( 1 9 - 2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for the duration of the study. Refrigerated

samples were tested at various time intervals (18, 23, 48, 72, 95, and 236 hours). Room temperature samples were also tested at various time intervals (4.5, 6.5, 19.25, 26, and 30.25 hours). The mean values of three replicates for each sample, storing temperature, anticoagulant, and measurement point were recorded. The study data support the recommended stability claim of 72 hours when stored at refrigerated temperatures $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The study also demonstrates sample stability of up to 30 hours at room temperature $( 1 9 - 2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB)

To determine Limit of Blank (LoB), plasma samples were obtained from five individual whole blood donors. The five plasma “blank” samples were tested for three days on one DiaSpect Tm meter in quadruplicate using two different lots of DiaSpect Tm Cuvettes for a total of 120 replicates. LoB was calculated by rank ordering the 60 samples per cuvette lot from low to high and averaging the 57th and 58th results (being the 95th percentile). LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

To determine Limit of Detection (LoD), four $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous whole blood samples were collected from different donors. Four independent samples were prepared covering Hgb concentrations $ { 0 . 1 - 0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { g / d L } }$ . Each sample was tested 60 times on one DiaSpect Tm device using two different lots of DiaSpect Tm Cuvettes for 3 days. LoD was calculated by nonparametric analysis and was determined to be $0 . 3 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

To determine Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), nine unique donor venous whole blood samples were used to prepare concentrations from $0 . 7 \mathrm { - } 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ . Each sample was tested 10 times per day using two lots of DiaSpect Tm Cuvettes on one DiaSpect Tm analyzer for 3 days to achieve variability. The mean and SD for each sample concentration for each cuvette lot was determined and the bias for each of the nine levels calculated. LoQ was determined from the specified Total Error to be $1 . 2 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of potential interferents on the DiaSpect Tm Analyzer. Venous whole blood collected in $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ tubes was manipulated to create three hemoglobin concentrations of 11.0, 14.0, and $1 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Each hemoglobin concentration was spiked with a potential interferent at the test concentrations listed below. For disease conditions, $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous blood specimens from a minimum of five donors with the following conditions were collected: polycythemia, hypochromia, high WBC count and sickle cell. The predicate device HemoPoint(H2) was used as the reference method to obtain the Hgb concentration. Each sample was tested in duplicate on the Hemopoint (H2) and five times on the DiaSpect Tm Analyzer. The predicate HemoPoint (H2) average was used to calculate the bias against each individual DiaSpect Tm result. All potential interferents tested showed no significant interference up to the concentrations listed in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison studies were performed across four sites to support the substantial equivalence of the DiaSpect Tm Hemoglobin System with the predicate device. Capillary (fingerstick), $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ , and lithium heparin venous whole blood specimens from a total of 399 subjects across four point-of-care clinical sites were tested on-site with both the DiaSpect Tm system (in singlicate) and in the HemoPoint H2 Hemoglobin Analyzer (comparative method, in duplicate).

A total of 364 male and female subjects, ranging from 9 months to 89 years of age, provided 363 capillary samples ranging from 8.5 to $2 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $3 4 9 \mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous samples ranging from 6.5 to $1 9 . 9 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ and 120 heparin venous samples ranging from 10.4 to $2 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ when tested on the DiaSpect Tm system. An additional 35 contrived $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous samples were divided between three sites and tested to challenge the full measuring range of the DiaSpect Tm system. Of the $3 4 9 \mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous samples, five samples with hemoglobin values of $6 { - } 7 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ were tested in comparison with the predicate at one additional internal site to demonstrate the performance of the device around these levels.

Testing was performed by nine operators using four DiaSpect Tm analyzers and three lots of DiaSpect Tm Cuvettes. Capillary whole blood and $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ venous whole blood were tested at all four sites by nine operators. Lithium heparin was tested at one site by two operators. The results for all natural and contrived samples combined are summarized in the table below.

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

A comparison between $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and lithium heparin venous blood was performed on the overall data comparing results for matched natural specimens from the same subjects tested with the DiaSpect Tm system. Paired natural $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and heparin samples $\mathrm { ( n { = } l { 2 0 } ) }$ ), ranging from $1 0 . 4 - 1 9 . 9 $ $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A } )$ or $1 0 . 4 - 2 0 . 0 $ (heparin) $\mathrm { { g / d L } }$ Hgb, agreed closely and can be used interchangeably in the DiaSpect Tm system. A comparison between $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and capillary blood was also performed on the overall data comparing results for matched natural specimens from the same subjects tested with the DiaSpect Tm system. Agreement between capillary and $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ samples in the DiaSpect was comparable to that of the predicate system as summarized in the table below.

N. Instrument Name: DiaSpect Tm analyzer

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes _ or No _X

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No ____X_

2. Software:

In accordance with FDA Guidance “Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices”, the risk to a patient in the event of the occurrence of harm and severity of harm if there was a cybersecurity threat or some level of vulnerability was considered. The DiaSpect Tm design and associated controls ensure that the software employed does not pose a cybersecurity threat to the device functionality and safety.

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ____X____ or No _

3. Specimen Identification: There is no sample identification function for the DiaSpect Tm.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: The DiaSpect Hemoglobin cuvette draws a small amount (approximately $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) of venous or capillary blood by capillary effect. The cuvette is then inserted into the meter.

5. Calibration:

The DiaSpect Tm analyzer is factory calibrated and is not user adjustable.

6. Quality Control:

The DiaSpect Tm system includes 3 levels of control solutions with known hemoglobin concentration. The DiaSpect Control HBT is produced in three concentrations that correspond to three levels of human hemoglobin. Each vial contains $1 . 9 \mathrm { m L }$ of a solution of a red dye (Rhodamine) in purified water. The reagent does not contain any material of human or animal origin. Users are directed to perform control testing on each day of testing, when a new canister of test cartridge is opened, or when test results seem inaccurate. The DiaSpect Control HBT is exempt from premarket notification.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Cleaning and Disinfection Validation Study

A cleaning and disinfection validation study was conducted to validate virucidal efficacy using the selected disinfectant with the recommended disinfection protocol. In the presence of a $100 \%$ duck serum organic load, PDI Super Sani-Cloth $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Germicidal Disposable Wipes (EPA Registration No. 9480‐4), a ready to use pre-saturated towelette, demonstrated complete inactivation of Duck Hepatitis B virus (surrogate for Human Hepatitis B virus) for all tested materials, following two-minute exposure at $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Results of the study also demonstrate no significant change in appearance and function of the DiaSpect Tm analyzer after 5000 disinfection and cleaning cycles designed to simulate a 5-year life span of the meter.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
