Dear Donna Noeh:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR

Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) at its toll-free number (800) 638- 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/default.htm. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to

The instrument is capable of measuring in the following analysis modes:

(1) Normal mode: Samples for all the analyses including re-analyses are taken into the instrument at the same time and analyzed. Automatic re-analysis can also be performed.

(2) Micro-sample mode: The sample volume from samples set in the sampler or STAT holder is taken into the instrument for each analysis through dispensing sample probe and analyzed. This analysis mode can also be performed with less sample volume than normal mode; however, automatic re-analysis cannot be performed.

Options and accessories that can be used for this instrument are as follows:

(1) Waste tank (with float switch for waste tank): Waste fluids discharged from the Main Unit enter this tank.   
(2) Wand barcode reader: Reads barcodes to input sample numbers, rack numbers and reagent IDs.   
(3) 2D barcode reader: Reads barcodes to input calibrator’s or reagent’s assay sheet values, normal values and ISI values, and control’s targets/limits.   
(4) IPU cart: The IPU (which includes the keyboard, PC and touch panel display), and the tanks for waste, rinse and CA Clean II can be placed on this cart.

(5) External indicator light: The status of the instrument is indicated with a red, yellow or green light that can be seen when the operator is not directly in front of the instrument.

(6) IPU holder: This is an optional holder for the IPU which includes the keyboard, PC and touch panel display which can be installed on the right side of the instrument to minimize the instrument footprint.

# 7 Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of the substantial equivalence determination.

# 7.1 Method comparison

Method comparison studies designed according to EP09-A3 CLSI Guideline ‘Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples’ were conducted at four external sites; 3 in the United States and one in Germany, all sites using the same protocol.

Samples were measured on both the predicate device (Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA-1500) as well as the new device (Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS-5100), in random order to eliminate any inherent bias. Results were compared by Passing-Bablok regression analysis as well as Bland-Altman plots. Results from each application met the predetermined acceptance criteria. The following summary of Passing-Bablok regression shows that the proposed and predicate devices provide equivalent results when used in a clinical setting.

# 7.2 Reproducibility Studies

Twenty-day precision studies were performed at one external site in Germany and two external sites in the United States. Testing followed the scheme of two runs per day, with two replicates per run, at each of the three sites according to CLSI EP05-A2 ‘Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods’. The order of the analysis of parameter, samples and quality control samples for each run and day varied to avoid an inherent bias to the study. One calibration curve of each calibrated application was used in the study. Within Run, Between Run, Between Day, and Total (within site) were calculated. The data for Within Run and Total (within site) is summarized in the following tables.

# 7.6 Factor V Leiden Cut-off Study

A cut-off of 1.8 (ratio) was validated on the CS-5100 instrument in a performance evaluation study. Citrated plasma samples from patients submitted for thrombophilia screening were collected by three different clinical sites (one site in the US and two sites in Germany). The samples were frozen and measured with the FV Leiden assay on the CS-5100 instrument. The FV Leiden assay results were classified using the cut-off of 1.8: a ratio ${ \le } 1 . 8$ is suggestive for FV Leiden variant (single point mutation G1691A) and a ratio ${ > } 1 . 8$ is considered as negative for the FV Leiden variant. The FV Leiden assay results were subsequently compared to the Factor V Leiden genotype to calculate the positive and negative percentage agreement. In total, $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 3 8 1$ patients of which $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 2 7$ patients came from the US were included. The results are shown in the tables below.

# 8 Conclusion

The predicate device was cleared based in part on the results of clinical studies; therefore clinical testing was required to support substantial equivalence.

The non-clinical and clinical data support the safety of the device.

The clinical data demonstrate that the Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS-5100 performs comparably to the predicate device that is currently marketed for the same intended use.

The data submitted for this premarket notification demonstrates that the device raises no new concerns as to safety and effectiveness when compared to the predicate device, and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
