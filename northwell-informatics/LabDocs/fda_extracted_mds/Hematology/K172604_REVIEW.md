Sysmex America Inc., XW-100 Automated Hematology Analyzer for CLIA Waived Use

# D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

Complete blood count (WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, PLT) and leukocyte 3-part differential $\mathrm { L Y M \% }$ , Other $W B C \%$ , NEUT%, LYM#, Other WBC#, NEUT#).

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The XW-100 Automated Hematology Analyzer (XW-100) is an electrical resistance blood cell counter. This technology may also be referred to as Direct Current (DC) or impedance. The XW-100 analyzes human whole blood specimens anticoagulated with $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ or $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ and reports results for 12 hematology parameters, including the basic complete blood count (CBC), 3-part white blood cell (WBC) differential.

2. Principles of Operation:

The XW-100 uses direct current with hydrodynamic focusing for all parameters except hemoglobin, which is measured photometrically. The patient sample is aspirated, measured, diluted with diluent (and lysed for WBC measurement), then directed into a transducer chamber by a hydrodynamic focusing nozzle. The transducer chamber has a minute hole, or aperture. Electrodes are mounted on both sides of the aperture chamber, through which the direct current flows. Blood cells suspended in the diluted sample are injected through the aperture by the hydrodynamic focusing nozzle. The hydrodynamic focusing nozzle is positioned in front of the aperture and in line with the aperture’s center. All blood cells are separated from each other and pass through the aperture in one direction, one cell at a time. When a cell passes through the aperture, it causes a change in the direct current resistance, which is proportional to the cell’s size. These resistance changes are captured as electric pulses. The various blood cell counts are calculated by counting the pulses that occur in each cell size category. The analyzer then determines blood cell volume and identifies cells by creating and analyzing histograms of the various cell populations using their respective pulse heights. Hemoglobin is measured photometrically using a non-cyanide method.

3. Modes of Operation:

The XW-100 operates by automated whole blood analysis.

The XW-100 processes anticoagulated venous whole blood collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ or $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ collection tubes. Samples are manually mixed by inversion and loaded into an onboard sample adapter one at a time.

6. Calibration:

The XW-100 is factory calibrated.

7. Quality Control:

The XW-100 system performance is evaluated using XW QC CHECK, a stabilized whole blood matrix quality control material designed for statistical process control of the analyzer.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Accuracy:

A clinical comparison study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the XW100 in the hands of the intended users (untrained operators) when performed in a CLIA waived setting. Reference submission CW170012 for the details of this study.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

For each hematology parameter, information about total error of the XW-100 in the hands of untrained operators for three sub-ranges (Low, Medium and High) were compared to the total imprecision in the reproducibility study of the XW-100 in the hands of trained operators using precision profiles. Reference submission CW170012 for details regarding total error. For details regarding the reproducibility study, refer to the Decision Summary for K143577. Analysis of the precision profiles described in the table below demonstrate that the XW-100 device in the hands of untrained and trained operators have similar imprecision. The imprecsion estimates include repeatability, different runs, different days, and different sites.

c. Linearity:

Measuring ranges of the new device were narrower than those of the XW-100 in the hands of trained operators, therefore, linearity data of the XW-100 were applicable to the new device. Refer to submission K143577 for the details of the linearity study.

d. Carryover:

Carryover of the XW-100 was evaluated during the clearance of the device for the POC setting. Refer to submission K143577 for the details of this study.

e. Interfering Substances:

An interference study was conducted to determine the interference level with the hematology results generated by the XW-100 for the following interfering substances: Bilirubin F, Bilirubin C, hemolytic hemoglobin, chyle, and lipids (Intralipid). Refer to submission K143577 for the details of this study.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

In 2008 and 2009, the Hematology and Pathology Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee met to provide advice and recommendations to the FDA regarding the CLIA waiver application for an automated WBC analyzer. The panel expressed several key concerns during the meeting leading to a recommendation that the WBC analyzer not be granted waived status. Below is a list of panel concerns and the solutions implemented by Sysmex to mitigate these concerns.

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Panel Questions/Concerns</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Solution</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Do clinically important but undetectedinterferences, such as NRBC or abnormalWBC, affect the system's status as a simpletest?</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">A sample challenge study was conducted toverify that the XW-100 will appropriately flagand/or suppress results for samples withabnormal findings, such as Nucleated RedBlood Cells (NRBC's), that could lead to thereporting of erroneous results in the CLIAwaived setting.For all 229 samples tested, with a variety ofpotential sources of error, the XW-100 resultswere appropriately suppressed and the presenceof potentially interfering substances did notresult in the reporting of erroneous results.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Reflex testing in moderately complexlaboratories, triggered by abnormal WBCresults, can enable diagnosis of clinicallyserious diseases. Does the absence of suchreflex testing increase the potential for anerroneous clinical impression in a waivedsetting?</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">For results that are outside the reference range,the XW-100 prompts the user to repeat testingbefore results are printed by the device. Oncethe printout is received, the clinician will thenmake the decision of how to proceed based onthe results and within the context of thepatient's clinical presentation.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Is this ATE zone consistent with what is neededfor adequate clinical performance across allWBC levels and clinical contexts?</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The Allowable Total Error (ATE) utilizing theCLIA '88 42 CFR 493.941 ranges was defined.The CLIA '88 regulations were not appropriatefor performance validation requirements andmore stringent ATE limits for reportableparameters on the XW-100 in the CLIA waivedsetting were developed. Reference submissionCW170012 for ATE values for all reportedparameters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The intent of Congress when CLIA '88 waspassed was that all tests should be the same andpatients should expect the same level ofaccuracy from a lab test performed by theirpersonal physician as they do from a lab testconducted in a large hospital or a commerciallab.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The accuracy of the XW-100 was previouslydemonstrated in the point-of-care setting(K143577). In addition, the data generated fromthe clinical field study for the XW-100 in theCLIA waived setting in conjunction with theflex studies demonstrates the XW-100 is simpleto use and does not generate erroneous results.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Quality control should be required.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The XW-100 requires quality control be runevery 8 hours and have acceptable results. Theacceptability of QC results is interpreted by theinstrument software and not the operator in thewaived setting. If QC does not pass, theoperator is locked out and patient testing isprevented.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">What do the error codes signify and how manyerror codes are there?</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">All error resolution is performed by the systemautomatically. The exceptions are simple powercycling and insertion of XW CELLCLEANwhich is done by the operator when promptedby an on-screen message. There are no errorcodes an operator has to interpret.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">If operator training is necessary, is the devicereally simple? Can any of the setup features belocked so that an operator cannot skip thecorrect setup?</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The XW-100 does not require operator training.On-screen prompts and Quick Guides areavailable to direct the operator throughinstrument setup and testing. The devicesoftware does not allow the operator to skipsteps in the device setup or in running patientsamples.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">What would happen if an EDTA sample isinadequately mixed?</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">A flex study was conducted to assess the use ofa sample that is inadequately mixed by thephlebotomist post venipuncture as well asinadequate mixing prior to testing the sample.Results from this study demonstrate thatinadequate mixing of blood samples by thephlebotomist immediately post collection isunlikely to impact results. Results also revealedthat testing samples that have been allowed tosettle for more than 10 minutes without propermixing prior to testing will impact results. Theon-screen prompt provides a reminder to mixthe tube prior to testing. The flagging/suppression rules will lead to retesting thesamples when results are outside of the normalrange.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Current cell counters are complicated. Theyrequire substantial maintenance and regularcalibration.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The only maintenance required for the XW-100is weekly cleaning of the transducer and wastechamber which is automatically prompted andperformed by the system. The operator isprompted to insert a tube of ready-to-use XWCELLCLEAN. Once the XW CELLCLEAN isinserted, the device performs weekly cleaning.After completion of weekly cleaning, thedevice prompts the operator to open the sampledoor and remove and dispose of the used tube.The weekly cleaning takes less than 10 minutesand is required every 7 days. Weekly cleaningis tracked automatically by the device.The operator never performs calibration. TheXW-100 is calibrated prior to shipping tocustomers. Quality control (QC) is requiredevery 8 hours to ensure the system isfunctioning properly. If QC fails twice in a row,the user is instructed to call Sysmex TechnicalAssistance Center (TAC). A replacementinstrument is sent to the customer and thecurrent instrument will be returned for serviceand/or recalibration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Since these systems report many components ofthe complete blood count, understanding of allthe results often requires interpretation by amedical technologist or a physician.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The operator is not required to interpret results.Results are printed with the reference rangecomparatives for the indicated age of thepatient by the system with no operatorinvolvement. For any parameter results outsideof the normal range, the operator will beprompted by the software to repeat testing. Ifthe results from the second run confirm theresults from the first run, the results will print.If the results from the second run do notconfirm the results from the first run, the resultsare suppressed on the printout. The instrumentinstructs the operator to deliver the printout tothe ordering clinician. Once the printout isreceived, the clinician will then make thedecision of how to proceed based on the resultsand within the context of the patient's clinicalpresentation.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The CLIA waived study was not performed inthe U.S. Is there sufficient data to show that thetest can be performed with a reasonable degreeof accuracy that would not invalidate itsmedical usefulness when used by CLIA waivedoperators in CLIA waived settings?</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The XW-100 clinical study was conducted atsix CLIA waived testing sites in the U.S. atlocations with diverse patient and operatordemographics. The sites covered a wide rangeof specialties, including family practice,internal medicine, diabetes practice, andpediatrics.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Has the performance of the device beenadequately studied in the leukopenicpopulation. For example, cancer patientsundergoing chemotherapy or many African-Americans with benign leukopenia.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The XW-100 is contraindicated for use indiagnosing or monitoring patients with primaryor secondary chronic hematologicdiseases/disorders, oncology patients, orchildren under the age of 2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Another criterion for a simple test is thatinstruction for confirmatory testing should beprovided where advisable. Clear criteria forconfirmatory testing of abnormal orinconsistent test results should be established.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">When the XW-100 detects a specimenabnormality, the instrument printout contains amessage for the clinician that reads"RECOMMEND FURTHER TESTING." Thismessage alerts clinicians that further testing isrecommended. Sending these samples to themoderately/highly complex lab for furthertesting is in line with current standard of careand will not cause a delay in patient diagnosis.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The number one patient safety issue, is patientidentification. Is there some ability to enter orstore that information to ensure accurate resultsare matched with the right patient?</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The instrument produces a printout with thepatient ID, date of birth, results, and any flags.Results are not displayed on the screen of thedevice. This reduces the risk of an operatorproviding results of an incorrect patient to theclinician or making a transcription error whendocumenting results in a medical record.The instrument instructs the operator to deliverthe printout to the clinician. The operator hasno other responsibility in this process.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">When you have normal versus abnormal, howmuch judgment is required? Can results beprinted, saved, or retrieved so there is a recordof the results.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Results are printed with the reference rangecomparatives for the indicated age of thepatient by the system with no operatorinvolvement. For results that are outside thereference range, the XW-100 will print one ofthe following:1) numeric result plus a "High" or "Low" flag*** (suppressed result) plus an "ALERTL" or "ALERT H" flag.A results printout is always produced by theinstrument when testing is fully completed.</td></tr></table>
