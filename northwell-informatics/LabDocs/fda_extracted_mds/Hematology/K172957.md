Re: K172957 Trade/Device Name: Kawasumi Laboratories Blood Drawing Kit (BDK) System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.9875 Regulation Name: Transfer set Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: KSB, LHI, FMI Dated: August 21, 2018 Received: August 28, 2018

Dear Lisa Michels:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic.

# IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Kawasumi Laboratories Blood Drawing Kit (BDK) System is a therapeutic device used to access a patient’s vein for blood removal from the patient to a blood bag reservoir to aid in the treatment of a disease or other condition. The device is not intended for blood transfusion.

The Kawasumi Laboratories Blood Drawing Kit (BDK) System consists of a Blood Drawing Kit device that is designed with an integral Antineedle Stick Protector that provides a safety feature intended to minimize accidental needle stick injuries when the device is activated during removal from the patient’s vein and may incorporate a needleless access connector site used for blood sampling.

The Blood Drawing Kit System is a single use, disposable Ethylene Oxide Sterilized medical device. Sterilization Validation was conducted per ISO 11135-1: 2007 – Sterilization of Health Care Products – Ethylene Oxide – Part 1: Requirements for Development, Validation, and Routine Control of a Sterilization Process for Medical Devices. The Blood Drawing Kit System is considered blood path, indirect, limited contact $( < 2 4$ hours) per section 5.2.2 (a) of ISO 10993-1: 2009 - Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices -Part 1: Evaluation and Testing within a Risk Management Process.

The Kawasumi Laboratories Blood Drawing Kit (BDK) System is a sterile, single-use device that consists of the following components:

$^ { \star } ( \mathsf { Y } )$ means the fluid contact components

Needle Protector • Cannula (Y) • Hub (Y) • Wing (Y – skin contact only) • Antineedle Stick Protector “K-Shield” • Tubing (Y) • Needleless Access Connector (NAC) Y-Site (Y) • Clamp • Blood Bag Unit Reservoir (Y)

The device is intended for use at healthcare facilities or in hospitals.

# V. INDICATIONS FOR USE

The Blood Drawing Kit with Antineedle Stick Protector is a single use, sterile transfer set designed for vascular access for blood withdrawal. Use of the Needleless Access Connector allows the clinician needlefree blood withdrawal when blood sampling is required. The Antineedle Stick Protector is an integral, active safety device intended to minimize accidental needle stick injuries when used to shield needles. The device is not intended for blood transfusion.
