# Test Principle:

This assay is a Driven Flow chromatographic immunoassay. The device consists of one test strip in a plastic cassette. The test strip consists of:

 A burgundy colored conjugate pad treated with mouse anti-hHb antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold.

A strip of nitrocellulose membrane with a Test line (T-line) and a Control line (C-line). The T-line is coated with anti-hHb antibodies, and the C-line is coated with goat anti-mouse $\mathrm { I g G }$ antibodies.

When an adequate volume of test specimen is dispensed into the sample well of the device, the test specimen migrates across the test strip. If the concentration of hHb in the specimen is at or above $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , the T-line appears as a visible burgundy line. The intensity of the T-line may vary according to the concentration of the hHB in the samples. If the concentration of hHb in the specimen is below the detectable level, no T-line develops. The C-line is coated with goat anti-mouse antibody, which binds to the conjugated monoclonal antibody, regardless of the presence of hHb in the sample.

# Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability was evaluated using three lots of devices, in-house by two trained laboratory professionals. For repeatability Hb-free fecal samples were collected and spiked with human whole blood with known hemoglobin levels to achieve the following six fecal hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $5 5 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . Fifty replicates were performed for each concentration level.

Reproducibility was conducted across three intended use sites using three device lots (same three lots at all sites), and three operators (one at each site) over a minimum of 5 days. For reproducibility Hb-free fecal samples were collected and spiked with human whole blood with known hemoglobin levels to achieve the following nine fecal hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $5 5 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , and 500 $\mathrm { n g / m l }$ . Fourteen replicates were performed for each sample and concentration level. Insure® FIT™ FOBT Controls (K101831) Negative and Positive Controls were also tested daily to ensure the validity of the test results.

# Prozone Effect Study:

The Prozone effect was evaluated using three device lots, by two operators testing Hbfree stool specimens spiked with human blood of known hemoglobin concentrations so as to obtain fecal test samples with different Hb concentrations: $1 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ $( 1 \mathrm { u g / m l } )$ ,

$2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ $( 2 \mathrm { u g / m l } )$ , $3 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ $( 3 \mathrm { u g / m l } )$ , $4 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ $\mathrm { 4 \ u g / m l ) }$ , $5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (5 $\mathsf { u g } / \mathrm { m l } )$ , $5 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $\mathrm { \langle 5 0 u g / m l \rangle }$ , and $5 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { u g / m l } )$ . Twenty aliquots of each sample concentration were mixed with extraction buffer in the specimen collection tubes and tested in a randomized order. The results show that Instant-view-plusTM Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test was not affected by highly concentrated hemoglobin in specimen, no prozone effect was observed in the above Hb concentrations.

# Stability Studies:

Insure® FIT™ FOBT Controls (K101831) Negative and Positive Controls were also tested daily to ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability studies.

1. Test Kit Stability (Accelerated)

The accelerated stability study was conducted with three lots of Instant-view-plus™ Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test. Hb-free stool specimens were spiked with human blood (of known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing six different hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , 72 $\mathrm { n g / m l }$ , and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . Each hemoglobin concentration was tested with two devices from each lot. (2) operator tested the three lots stored at following four temperatures: $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( 6 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ , $2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 7 3 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ , $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $( 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ , and $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 1 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ and test results were collected each day for 20 days. The test kit was determined to be stable for 24 months, when stored at the temperatures between $8 \cdot 2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 4 6 . 4 - 7 3 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ .

2. Test Kit Stability (Real Time)

The real time stability study was conducted with three lots of Instant-view-plus™ Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test.

The 3 replicates of spiked hemoglobin-negative stool concentrations were spiked with iron $( 0 . 5 \% \mathrm { ( w / v ) }$ , and sodium L-ascorbate $0 . 5 \%$ (w/v). All samples were mixed with detection buffer in Instant-viewplus™ Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test sample collection bottles and tested in a randomized order. Instant-view-plus™ Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test did not show significant interference from iron and sodium L-ascorbate.

Interference from Toilet Water Susceptibility of Instant-view-plus™ Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test to interference from toilet water was evaluated by testing 40 replicates of prepared test samples by spiking Hb-free stool specimen with known levels of human Hb solution to obtain fecal samples with seven different Hb concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $4 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $4 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $7 2 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . Twenty replicates of spiked hemoglobinnegative stool concentrations were collected without toilet water and 20 replicates of spiked hemoglobin-negative stool concentrations were collected submerged with toilet water. All samples were mixed with detection buffer in Instant-view-plus™ Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test sample collection bottles and tested in a randomized order. Instant-view-plus™ Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test did not show significant interference from samples collected in toilet water.

# Assay cut-off:

The cut-off value for the Instant-view plusTM Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test was validated in-house. Fecal test samples were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood of known hemoglobin concentration, to obtain the following fecal hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $4 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , $6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , 72 $\mathrm { n g / m l }$ and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . Twenty aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were tested in randomized order. Testing was performed side-by-side with the predicate by comparing the test results of the device with that of the predicate. The cut-off was determined to be $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with detection buffer).

# Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison of Instant-view plusTM Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test with the predicate test, Instant-viewTM Fecal Occult Blood Rapid Test, was conducted by assessing 299 patient samples. The method comparison study was performed at three POC testing sites by two 2 operators at each site. The Insure® FIT™ FOBT Controls (K101831) Negative and Positive Controls were run prior to testing. Statistical analysis of site-wide test results as well as combined results showed that Instant-view plusTM Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test results have acceptable overall percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement with Instant-viewTM Fecal Occult Blood Rapid Test. The method comparison study demonstrated that the analytical performance of the Instant-view plusTM Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
