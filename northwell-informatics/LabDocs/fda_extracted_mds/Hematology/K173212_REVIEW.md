# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)]: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff. Issued on: July 28, 2017.

# L. Test Principle:

This assay is a Driven Flow chromatographic immunoassay. The device consists of one test strip in a plastic cassette. The test strip consists of:

· A conjugate pad treated with mouse anti-human hemoglobin antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold. A strip of nitrocellulose membrane with a Test line (T-line) and a Control line (C-line). The T-line is coated with anti-hHb antibodies, and the C-line is coated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies.

When an adequate volume of test specimen is dispensed into the sample well of the cassette, the test specimen migrates across the test strip. If the concentration of hHb in the specimen is at or above $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , the T-line visibly appears as a burgundy line. The intensity of the Tline may vary according to the concentration of the hHb in the sample. If the concentration of hHb in the sample is below $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , a T-line does not visibly appear. The C-line is coated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, which binds to the conjugated monoclonal antibody regardless of whether hHb is present in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

All manufacturer’s predetermined performance acceptance criteria were met.

1. Analytical performance:

Twenty replicates of each spiked sample were collected both without contact with toilet water and after being submerged in toilet water. All samples were mixed with detection buffer in Instantview-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test sample collection bottles and tested in a randomized order. Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test did not show significant interference from samples collected in toilet water.

# f. Assay cut-off:

The cut-off value for the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test was verified against the predicate cutoff. Fecal test samples were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood of known hemoglobin concentration, to obtain the following fecal hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 25 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $4 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $7 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Twenty aliquots of each of the seven concentrations of spiked stool test samples were tested in randomized order. Testing was performed side-by-side with the predicate by comparing the test results of the device with that of the predicate. The cut-off was verified to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with detection buffer).

In addition, a consumer study with over-the-counter untrained users was performed by testing the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test in parallel to the predicate test, the INSTANT-VIEW Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) SelfTest. In this study, Hb-free stool specimens were spiked with hemoglobin to obtain fecal samples with the following hemoglobin concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 50 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The results of this study are shown in the table below.

1. Specimen Collection Verification:

The purpose of this study was to verify that the applicator device for the Instantview-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test kit, consistently delivers the specified amount of stool required for optimal test performance. The study was conducted by five untrained users who each tested five positive and five negative clinical samples. The amount of stool specimen collected using the applicator

device, did not show a significant difference between users. The average weight of the stool specimens collected by the users was $0 . 9 4 \mathrm { m g }$ . Results found that by following the instructions for use in the labeling, an accurate amount of sample can be obtained.

# 2. Sample Volume Study:

The sample test volume compatible with accurate and consistent performance of the Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test was demonstrated in a study that evaluated three device lots tested with both a negative sample (25 $\mathrm { n g / m l } )$ and a positive sample $( 6 0 \mathrm { n g / m l } )$ . One to five drops of each sample were tested for each device lot.. In order for the sample volume to be considered adequate for test performance, the control (C) line had to appear in less than 20 seconds and the test (T) line had to appear within one min for positive samples (and be absent for negative samples). The sample volume study demonstrated that for Instant-view-plus Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test device, one drop of sample consistently produced correct results within the specified timeframe.
