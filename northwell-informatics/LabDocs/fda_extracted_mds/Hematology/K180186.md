Predicate Device: K110648 - Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System

Device Description: The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is designed to be a low cost, low maintenance analyzer for the hospital laboratory setting. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator packs, auto-cartridge quality control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials (external controls) and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Optionally, it provides for reading of barcode labels (such as operator badges and data sheets).

The system architecture and user interface for this proposed device is based on the previously cleared Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer System (K131703). The predicate for this proposed device is the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648).

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not reporting them) will also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards:

# Primary Sensor Card Port:

There are two options for the primary sensor card:

Primary Sensor Card 1 shall enable and report the following listed analytes: o Hct, tHb, ${ \mathsf { S O } } _ { 2 }$ , $O _ { 2 } H _ { 2 }$ , COHb, MetHb, HHb   
Primary Sensor Card 2 shall enable and report the following listed analytes: o Hct, tHb, ${ \mathsf { S O } } _ { 2 }$ , $O _ { 2 } H _ { 2 }$ , COHb, MetHb, HHb

Similar to the predicate device, the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is a blood gas/cooximetry/electrolyte/chemistry and hematology analyzer with an enhanced test menu and multiple quality control options. Both traditional internal and external quality control will be used, as well as an on-board Quality Management System (QMS), an electronic monitoring approach that insures the analyzer is working properly at all times.

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer accepts samples from syringes, open tubes, and small cups.   
The minimum sample size for analysis is $1 3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

Sample collection, preparation and application to the analyzer are the same as for the previously cleared predicate. The end user can select which analytes are to be tested in the panel.

# Summary of the Technological Characteristics:

The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared for market Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648) in intended use. It uses the same sensor technology and measurement algorithms, and the formulations of the internal and external controls and the calibration cartridge are the same for the tested parameters. The External Control solutions for use with the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer are substantially equivalent to those cleared for use with the predicate Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System (K110648). See Table 1 for comparison of the predicate and proposed devices.

# Principles of Measurement: Oxygen Saturation:

Oxygen saturation $( \mathsf { S O 2 \% } )$ ) represents the percent of hemoglobin bound to oxygen, expressed as a fraction of the amount of hemoglobin capable of binding to oxygen (oxyhemoglobin plus deoxyhemoglobin). As the level of $S O 2 \%$ changes within a blood sample, the color of the whole blood changes. Oxygen Saturation is determined by using a standard equation.

# Hematocrit:

Hematocrit is defined as the percentage of red blood cells to the total blood volume and can be obtained by measuring electrical resistance of the blood sample. Two standard solutions are used to calibrate the hematocrit sensor and to obtain the slope. The analyzer then measures the electrical resistance of the blood sample to obtain the hematocrit value. The hematocrit value obtained is corrected for the concentration of the sodium ion.

# Total Hemoglobin:

Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.

Total Hemoglobin is the sum of all measured hemoglobin fractions expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in a specified volume of whole blood. Total Hemoglobin is calculated using a standard equation.

# Oxyhemoglobin:

Oxyhemoglobin is the combined form of hemoglobin and oxygen. Oxygen is bound reversibly and is readily given up to the tissues because of the lower tissue oxygen tension. Conversely in the lungs, there is a higher oxygen tension and greater oxygen uptake by hemoglobin. The percentage of oxyhemoglobin is determined using a standard equation.

# Carboxyhemoglobin:

Carboxyhemoglobin is the combined form of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin. The affinity of hemoglobin for carbon monoxide is approximately 210 times greater than for oxygen. Because of this high affinity, inhalation of large amounts of carbon monoxide can lead to death if left undiagnosed. The percentage of carboxyhemoglobin is determined by using a standard equation.

# Methemoglobin:

Methemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin in which the iron has been oxidized from the ferrous to the ferric state. Oxygen cannot bind with methemoglobin. Therefore, increased amounts can lead to cyanosis, tissue anoxia, and death. There are congenital and acquired forms of methemoglobinemia. The percentage of methemoglobin is determined by using a standard equation.

# Deoxyhemoglobin:

Deoxyhemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin that is not combined with oxygen but can easily uptake oxygen in the lungs. The percentage of deoxyhemoglobin is determined by using a standard equation.

# Summary of Performance Testing:

Performance testing was completed to demonstrate that the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is substantially equivalent in performance, safety and efficacy to the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra Analyzer System. The performance testing included:

# Method Comparison Studies:

A study was performed to compare the Stat Profile Prime Plus to the Nova Stat Profile pHOx Ultra analyzer to assess the equivalence of the analyzers in the measurement of Hematocrit, Oxygen Saturation, Total Hemoglobin, Oxyhemoglobin, Carboxyhemoglobin, Methemoglobin, and Deoxyhemoglobin in heparinized whole blood in a clinical laboratory setting.

The blood comparison data for Hematocrit, Oxygen Saturation, Total Hemoglobin, Oxyhemoglobin, Carboxyhemoglobin, Methemoglobin, and Deoxyhemoglobin for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers meet the acceptance criteria.

# Precision/Reproducibility - Within Run and Run to Run Studies:

Within Run and Run to Run precision was evaluated by replication studies performed on three Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

Within Run Precision testing consisted of one run of each of the following sample types and levels was performed, 20 replicates per run:

• Stat Profile Prime Plus Internal Controls: Levels 1- 5 • Stat Profile Prime Plus Ampuled Controls: Levels 1- 5 • Two whole bloods, sampled from syringes

To assess Run to Run Precision for whole blood, triplicate analyses were performed on a single whole blood sample in ten separate runs during a single day. The systems were recalibrated before each triplicate run.

The precision data for all parameters meet the within run imprecision specifications for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

The precision data for all parameters meet the between analyzer run to run imprecision specifications for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers.

# Linearity Testing:

The study assessed the linearity of all parameters to establish and/or verify the Analytical Measurement Range (AMR) for the Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer on whole blood. The linearity was measured using method comparison. The evaluation of the linear range included lower and upper limits of the AMR and various medical decision limits.

All Stat Profile Prime Plus results were compared to the reference analyzer and/or the product specifications.

The linearity comparison data for all parameters for the Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzers shows good correlation and linearity to the reference analyzers across the claimed measurement range for all parameters and met the acceptance criteria.

# Specificity / Interference Testing:

The purpose of this study was to identify substances that may interfere with the Stat Profile Prime Plus sensors. If interference was identified, a dose response study was performed to determine the concentration where the interfering substance may alter results.

This Interference Testing study was performed using whole blood collected in lithium heparin vacutainers. The possible interfering substances were tested at two analyte concentrations.

Many substances were screened as potential interferents through analysis on the Prime Plus analyzers. Substance screening was completed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. The interfering substances identified during the screening process are listed in the table below:
