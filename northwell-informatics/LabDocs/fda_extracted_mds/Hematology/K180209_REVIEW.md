# L. Test Principle:

Diazyme’s 1,5-AG assay uses the enzyme pyranose oxidase (PROD) to oxidize the 2nd position hydroxyl group of 1,5-AG and to detect the generated hydrogen peroxide by colorimetry using peroxidase (POD). To eliminate reactive glucose in sample, it is pretreated by enzymatic reactions using hexokinase and pyruvate kinase (PK). Hexokinase uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to convert glucose into non-reactive glucose-6-phosphate (G6-P), generating adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The reaction is driven to completion with PK, as ADP is phosphorylated to ATP during the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: 2. a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed using six serum samples containing the following concentrations of 1,5-AG: 3.1, 5.7, 11.6, 23.2, 61.8 and $9 7 . 3 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ . Two levels of quality control (QC) material (3.6 and $1 2 . 3 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ ) and one level of calibrator solution $( 2 1 . 1 \mathrm { u g / m L } )$ were also tested. Samples were tested in duplicate using three reagent lots over 20 days with two runs per day $( 2 0 \mathrm { x } 2 \mathrm { x } 2$ design). Samples were analyzed using the Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay run on a Beckman AU680 analyzer. The results of data analysis of the combined three lots $\mathrm { ( n { = } 2 4 0 }$ ) are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated using high and low 1,5-AG serum pools that were mixed to create the following eleven samples containing 1,5-AG concentrations spanning the measuring range: 0.2, 10.9, 22.1, 34.4, 45.3, 58.5, 68.6, 81.1, 92.7, 103.2, and 116.7 ug/mL 1,5-AG. Samples were measured in triplicate using one lot of reagent on a Beckman AU860 analyzer. The results of the linear regression analysis are summarized below:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 1 4 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 8 3 5 1 , \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 8
$$

The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 0.5 to 110 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

The Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using highly purified 1,5-AG, referred to as the Master Calibrator. The Master Calibrator was prepared by spiking the appropriate amount of pure 1,5-AG into a phosphate buffer solution. The Master Calibrator was subsequently value assigned.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) study was performed with five serum samples, which were dialyzed to removed endogenous 1,5-AG, and two reagent lots. The samples were

tested in quadruplicate over three days ( $\scriptstyle \mathbf { n } = 6 0$ samples per reagent lot). The LoB was determined to be $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ .

The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed with five serum samples that were prepared by diluting native serum samples with serum that was dialyzed to removed endogenous 1,5-AG, with two reagent lots. Samples were tested in quadruplicate over three days $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 6 0$ samples per reagent lot). The LoD was calculated as the $\mathrm { L o B } + ( 1 . 6 5 3 \cdots$ D of LoD samples). The LoD was determined to be $0 . 4 5 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ .

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study was performed using five serum samples ranging from approximately 1 to 16 times the claimed LoB. Samples were either native serum or serum diluted with dialyzed serum to obtain the relevant 1,5-AG concentrations. The diluted serum samples were then tested in 8 replicates per day over 5 days using two lots of reagents. The sponsor defines LoQ as the lowest concentration which meets an imprecision $( \% C V )$ of $< 2 0 \%$ . The LoQ was determined to be $0 . 6 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were conducted with serum samples adjusted to three levels of 1,5-AG (approximately 5.0, 23.0, and ${ 5 0 \mathrm { u g / m L } }$ ). Each sample was divided into a test pool and a control pool, and potentially interfering substances were added to the test pool. Test pool samples with various concentrations of substances were compared to non-spiked controls. The sponsor defines significant interference as greater than $\pm 1 0 \%$ bias between the test and control samples measured using the Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay on a Beckman AU680 analyzer. The following substances were tested up to the levels indicated and demonstrated no significant interference:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Highest concentration of substancetested that did not demonstratesignificant interference (mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Conjugated Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>125</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1000</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ascorbic Acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>37.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glucose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1000</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Maltose</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Uric Acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Creatinine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Urea</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr></table>

Based on the testing completed, the sponsor has included the following limitation in the labeling:

WARNING: Significant negative bias $( > 1 0 \% )$ was observed at bilirubin levels $> 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This should be taken into consideration for patients with conditions that cause hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert’s disease, Jaundice, etc.).

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

3. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was conducted by comparing the results from the 1,5- AG Assay to the to the predicate method (GlycoMark 1,5-AG, K031604) on a Beckman AU680 analyzer. Serum samples ranging in 1,5-AG concentration from 1.7 to $3 6 . 2 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ were collected from 91 diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. In order to obtain sufficient samples in the high 1,5-AG concentration range, 11 additional samples were spiked to obtain concentrations between 39.0 and $1 0 3 . 7 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ 1,5-AG. Samples were tested in singlet. The results of linear regression analysis are as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 1 6 4 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 2 0 4 2 ; \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 5
$$

# b. Matrix comparison:

To evaluate anticoagulant effects, paired serum/K2EDTA plasma and serum/Lithium Heparin plasma samples were tested on the Beckman AU680 analyzer with the Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay. Fifty-two serum vs. $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA plasma and 52 serum vs. Lithium Heparin plasma paired sample sets were evaluated. The results of the linear regression analysis are presented below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tube Type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Regression</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R{2$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Test range ug/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lithium-heparinplasma vs serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y = 1.0059x + 0.0465</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.8 - 109</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>K2EDTA plasmavs serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y = 1.0071x - 0.6457</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.994</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.7 - 105.6</td></tr></table>

The study data supports the sponsor’s claim that the Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay is suitable for use with human specimens consisting of serum, $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ plasma, and Lithium Heparin plasma.

4. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

5. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

6. Expected values/Reference range:

To establish the reference interval of 1,5-AG for a normal population, serum samples from 280 apparently healthy adults, 140 males and 140 females, were tested using the Diazyme 1,5-AG Assay on the Beckman AU680 analyzer. Using non-parametric 5th95th percentiles, the reference interval was established to be from 8.19 to $3 2 . 1 9 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ for males and 6.00 to $2 9 . 1 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ for females.
