This data supports the claim that the Quo-Test A1c assay imprecision is $\leq 3 \%$ CV.

# b. Linearity

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the linearity of the Quo-Test A1C assays across their reportable range: $4 - 1 5 \%$ A1c. To establish a linear range, the specimens used in an initial experiment should cover a range 20 to $30 \%$ wider than the anticipated analytical range. This allows specimens at the end points to be removed in a subsequent experiment if the initial experiment detects non-linearity.

This study followed the guidelines laid out in document CLSI EP6-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline (2003).

The study was carried out by Isala Ziekenhuis, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Zwolle, The Netherlands in August 2018.

Patient samples with a low HbA1c value of approximately $4 . 8 \%$ and a high HbAlc value of approximately $1 5 . 2 \%$ were mixed in incremental amounts to generate a series of samples over a broad HbA1c concentration range $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 1$

All testing was performed in accordance with the product package insert. Patient samples with a low A1c value and a high Alc value of approximately were mixed in the amounts given in table 1 to generate a series of samples over a broad A1c concentration range $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 1$

All samples were analysed fivefold.

Acceptance criteria were achieved supporting a claim that the linear range for the Quo-Test assay is $4 - 1 5 \% \mathrm { A l C }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (Controls, Calibrators)

# Traceability

The Quo-Test A1C System is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC).

The Quo- Test Analyzer and A1C Test Cartridges have been calibrated using samples provided by the ERL via the NGSP network.

Results obtained using the Quo-Test A1C System are traceable to the IFCC reference method.

# Stability

The stability of reconstituted quality controls when stored over a period of 16 days as recommended by the manufacturer at temperatures at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was tested.

The quality control kit is manufactured for EKF-Diagnostics GmbH, Barleben by an OEM supplier (Canterbury Scientific Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand).

Three EKF A1c Control Kits with each a Normal and Abnormal Control were used. The controls were reconstituted in accordance with the product instructions for use on Day 0 of the study as per the manufacturer's instruction, stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for a 16-day period and tested on every second working day.

To ensure the total sample volume of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ from every Level of every lot 4 bottles of each control have been used which have been reconstituted at the same time and joined together to a sample pool.

All testing was performed in accordance with the product instructions for use and all cartridges and analysers suitably equilibrated to room temperature prior to use.

During the trial period the results obtained by the reconstituted quality controls were within the allowable deviation to the target value. The single CVs range from $0 . 5 0 \% -$ $3 . 3 7 \%$ .

The Reconstituted Quality Controls are stable over a period of 16 days when stored as recommended at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Expected values

A reasonable A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults is $7 \%$ $5 3 \mathrm { m m o l / m o l } \mathrm { \Omega } _ { \mathrm { / } }$ .Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as $6 . 5 \%$ $[ 4 8 \mathrm { m m o l / m o l } ]$ for selected individual patients if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment (i.e., polypharmacy).

Appropriate patients might include those with short duration of diabetes, type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle or metformin only, long life expectancy, or no significant cardiovascular disease. Less stringent A1C goals (such as $8 \%$ $\mathrm { 6 4 m m o l / m o l ] }$ may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or long-standing diabetes in whom the goal is difficult to achieve despite diabetes self-management education, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin.

# d. Detection Limit

The claimed measuring range of $4 . 0 { - } 1 5 . 0 \%$ HbA1c for the Quo-Test A1c System is based on linearity. See section 1b above.

# e. Analytical Specificity

The study was designed to assess the effects of some of the most common endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the Quo-Test A1c assay. The design of the study followed the CLSI guideline Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry CLSI document CLSI EP07 - A2.

Hemoglobin variants

A hemoglobin variant study was performed using venous whole blood samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA tubes spread across the analytical measurement range (4.6-11.6 $\%$ HbAlc). The Quo-Test A1C Test was found to be unaffected by the following hemoglobin variants:

HbAS $( \leq 4 0 ~ \% ~ \mathrm { S } )$ , HbAC $( \leq 3 4 \% \mathrm { ~ C ~ } )$ , HbAD $( \leq 4 1 \ \% \ \mathrm { D } )$ , HbAJ $( \leq 5 1 ~ \% ~ \mathrm { J } )$ , HbDD $( \leq$ $9 5 \ \%$ D), B-thalassemia $( \leq 5 . 7 ~ \%$ A2) and elevated fetal hemoglobin $( \leq 1 1 \ \% \ \mathrm { F }$

The Quo-Test showed no interference from labile glycated hemoglobin and carbamylated hemoglobin $( \leq 1 2 . 9 \% )$ .

# g. Stability

Real time studies were performed to verify that Quo-Test cartridges can be stored at 2 - $8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 25 months. The study evaluated the performance of the Quo-Test cartridges when stored at the recommended storage conditions $( 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ using real-time intervals up to a period of 25 months.

Performance of the test were monitored by testing three blood samples, which covered the relevant clinical range $( 5 - 1 1 \%$ A1C), and the normal and abnormal kit controls at various time points.

This protocol followed the CLSI guidelines EP25-A Evaluation of stability of in vitro diagnostic devices: approved guidelines.

All testing has been performed in accordance to the product IFU and all cartridges and analysers suitably equilibrated to room temperature prior to use. Each cartridge lot was measured on all three devices. Each of the five samples have been measured $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ times on each of the three Quo-Test analysers at five interval time points over a 15-month period. Fresh whole blood and fresh reconstituted Controls were used at each time of the measurement.

The study confirmed a shelf life of twelve months for the Quo-Test cartridges when stored at the recommended temperature of 2-8°. In addition, it could be shown that the kits are still operational for at least three months after the expiry date.

# h. Calibration

The Quo-Test A1C System is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC).

The Quo- Test Analyzer and A1C Test cartridges have been calibrated using samples provided by the European Reference Laboratory (ERL) via the NGSP network.

Results obtained using the Quo-Test A1C System are traceable to the IFCC reference method.

# i. Quality Control

The Quo-Test A1C Control Kit is a two-level, lyophilized control consisting of human blood, preservatives and stabilizers. The controls are formulated to enhance shelf life. Two levels are provided, one in the region of a normal patient response $( 4 - 7 \%$ A1C) and one in the region of an abnormally high patient sample $\mathrm { \sim } 1 0 \%$ A1C). A dropper bottle containing distilled water to reconstitute the controls is also provided. The two Control solutions require target values and an acceptable range. The method used for value assignment was to run each lot of controls with at least 3 different lots of QuoTest A1C Test cartridges. During manufacture, the cartridge lots are calibrated to give NGSP/IFCC aligned results using standards supplied by the European reference Laboratory. The target values assigned to the Controls are therefore traceable to the NGSP/IFCC. The acceptable range for results produced with these controls was defined as being 3 standard deviations away from the mean.

Although the Controls are manufactured from Human blood, the level of A1C present in the Controls (particularly the abnormal control) has been artificially altered. Tests have been carried out to assess the level of matrix effects potentially increased by this manipulation and found to have limited to no effect when using the Quo-Test A1C System.

Human sourced materials are used in the manufacture of this product. Each donor unit was (and will be in the future) tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), antibodies to hepatitis C (HCV) and antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2), HIV-1 antigen and Syphilis and were all found to be negative. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that HIV, Hepatitis B or C viruses, or other infectious agents are absent, these products should be handled as potentially infectious i.e. with the same precautions used with patient specimens.

The Control kit is manufactured on behalf of EKF Diagnostics by an OEM supplier (Canterbury Scientific Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand).

On July 11, 2017, the Federal Register published a list of class II devices that are exempt from premarket notification. The Quo-Test A1c Control Kit is in the list of exempted class II devices.

# 2. Method Comparison Studies

# Method Comparison

Method comparison studies were performed according to Protocol EKF-A1C-MC-01 to support the substantial equivalence of the Quo-Test A1C System with other legally marketed HbA1c test devices. Venous specimens from a total of 424 subjects across three clinical sites were tested with the Quo-Test system. To ensure that HbA1c values in the low end of the measuring range were included, 115 normal subjects $( 2 7 . 1 \% )$ were included.

The K2EDTA venous whole blood specimens were forwarded to an NGSP-certified reference laboratory (Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory, Columbia, MO) and tested with the Tosoh 8 analyzer to provide reference method values. Matrix equivalence with lithium heparin anti-coagulated whole blood was performed on 150 subjects at a single site. IRB approval was obtained prior to initiating the studies.

A total of 209 male and 215 female subjects, ranging from 21 to 89 years of age, provided 423 EDTA venous samples and 149 heparin venous samples. HbA1c values ranged from $4 . 5 \%$ to $1 4 . 6 \%$ when tested in the NGSP-certified reference laboratory. Summary results for all subjects tested are provided in Table 1a below. Since the intended use population does not include "normal" subjects, the data were also calculated for only subjects with diabetes (Table 1b).
