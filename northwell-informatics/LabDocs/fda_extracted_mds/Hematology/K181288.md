# Description of Device:

The Athelas One is an automated diagnostic device intended to perform tests on whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA or capillary finger stick samples collected directly into the Athelas One test strip. The system is intended to be placed within the Point of Care, and Clinical Laboratory sites. Athelas One returns WBC and Neut% metrics from the blood sample.

A clinician places a sample on the Athelas One test strip either directly from finger or via pipette from K2EDTA whole blood tube. The Athelas One test strip stains and creates a monolayer of the blood sample within the chamber. The strip is inserted into the test strip slot of the Athelas One device and the device returns results by conducting image analysis of cells present. Result-viewing and device control are conducted through a companion tablet/mobile application.

The precision/bias goals of the device are provided below:

Target Evaluation Criteria:

WBC Precision: $7 . 5 \%$ CV above 2K/µL WBC. 0.25 K/µL SD below 2K/µL WBC.   
WBC Bias/Error: $\pm 7 . 5 \%$ error above 2K/µL WBC. $\pm 0 . 2 5$ K/µL error below 2K/µL WBC.

Neutrophil $\%$ Precision: $5 \%$ SD OR $15 \%$ CV (updated based on Sysmex XW-100 Neut% CV criteria).

Neutrophil $\%$ Bias: $\pm 1 0 \%$ bias or $\pm5 \%$ Neut% total error (whichever larger).

These targets were chosen based on CLSI clinical precision/bias recommendations for WBC and Neut%. Constant value targets where set to account for asymptotically increasing percent imprecision towards lower concentrations as per the poisson distribution.

# Description of Intended Setting:

The Athelas One is designed for use in Point of Care (PoC) and Clinical Laboratory settings. The intended PoC setting is one in which the device is placed in a safe, stationary location only accessible by authorized staff. As per the cybersecurity suggestions, the device should be connected to the internet either via a wired ethernet connection or a protected WPA 802.11n network. The network of the PoC setting should be placed behind a firewall that strictly regulates access to only those services that need it.

In the intended setting, the Athelas One is to remain in a stationary location free from movements and any potential vibrations. Operators are not to move the device from one location to another. The device should be placed in an environment with a temperature between $6 8 – 7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { F }$ and the Athelas One test strips should also be stored in a similar setting.

# Summary of Technological Characteristics Compared to Predicate Devices:

The Athelas One and Sysmex XE-5000 are both intended for automated analysis of WBC and Neut% values from K2EDTA and Capillary Whole Blood. The Athelas One utilizes a microfluidic chamber and image processing to analyze cells. The Sysmex XE-5000 utilizes aspiration of blood, Hydro Dynamic Focusing (DC Detection), and flow cytometry methods (using a semiconductor laser). In both cases, cells are analyzed and classified based on morphological, granule characterization, and size parameters.

Testing: ​Both Bench and Clinical testing were conducted to showcase substantial equivalence between the Athelas One and predicate device.

# Bench

Within-run Precision/Reproducibility

# Within-run Precision Repeatability

Precision studies were performed using K2EDTA whole blood samples around medical decision levels and the upper and lower limit of the analytical measuring range. The study was conducted with nine whole blood samples, three different operators and three different test strip lots. Care was taken to include both normal and abnormal samples.

Three operators and three test strip lots were used in conjunction. Per operator, per lot, ten replicates of each sample were tested and the results were recorded. 90 tests were run per sample, with 810 tests run in total. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample. All results met the predefined specifications $( \mathsf { C V } \% )$ for precision (targets shown on below table as well).

# Precision Reproducibility (between run)

Precision/Reproducibility studies were performed on the Athelas One Whole Blood Manual Mode using three levels of ATH-check quality control material (Low, Normal and High). The 20-day study used three sites, with three analyzers (one instrument per site), three lots of test strips, and one lot of quality control materials (all levels). We performed two runs per day and two replicates per run with two operators per site. A total of 80 readings were generated at each site for each level of control (2 runs x 20 days x 2 replicates $= 8 0$ readings). As per Agency recommendation results were analyzed using ANOVA analysis and taking into account the nested design of the study.

A site by site analysis was also conducted as per Agency recommendation, also falling within evaluation criteria. Overall reproducibility levels were found to meet the acceptance criteria of $7 . 5 \%$ CV for WBC and $5 \%$ SD or $1 5 \%$ CV for Neutrophils across all three levels and all sites.

# Linearity

10 samples across the reporting range were run in 4 replicates across 4 devices and one test strip lot. The samples were obtained by pooling together one low WBC concentration fresh whole blood sample one high WBC concentration sample in different volumes which is a recommended option in CLSI EP6-A.

The method has been demonstrated to be linear from lower limit to upper limit and within measured allowable max $\%$ diff for each interval. The primary analyte (WBC) was analyzed in linearity as per CLSI EP06-A guidance. The CLSI recommended OLS regression of the linearity data is provided below:

# Reference Intervals

Adult reference intervals for the Athelas One were verified across 120 healthy donors in comparison to pre-established reference intervals for the Sysmex XE-5000 utilizing whole blood samples.

# Limit of Blank (LoB) – Whole Blood

The LoB was obtained from 120 total repeated measurements of blank samples analyzed in the sampling modes for whole blood. The mean, SD and LoB were calculated for the analyzer. The LoB for whole blood parameters WBC is zero (0) K/μL.

# Limit of Detection (LoD) – Whole Blood

As per Agency recommendation, Limit of Detection was conducted using run as follows:

● 2 test strip lots (60 strips each)   
● 2 instruments   
● 3 days   
● 5 low level samples 2 replicates per sample

As shown in the Limit of Blank section, the LoB was found to be 0.

The LoD of Lot 1 was $0 . 0 5 5 \mathsf { K } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ while the LoD of Lot 2 was $0 . 0 7 9 \mathsf { K } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ . The maximum LoD of the two lots was established as the final LoD. Hence, the LoD was set to be $0 . 0 7 9 \mathsf { K } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ .

The LoD was found to be $\mathbf { 0 . 0 7 9 \ K / \mu L }$ which is well below the LoQ of 0.44 K WBC/µL.

Limit of Quantification (LoQ) – Whole Blood

The Limit of Quantification study was designed to estimate the lowest measurement concentration that can be measured on the Athelas One and meet the predefined total error goals. The study was conducted over two test-strip lots, 1 instrument, 3 days, 3 replicates per sample, and 4 independent low-level whole blood samples. ​The samples were distinct whole blood samples acquired from patients in ${ \mathsf { K } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { E D T A } }$ tubes. The original concentrations were obtained from the predicate analyzer (Sysmex XE-5000). These samples were then diluted to reach an approximate concentration of $0 . 4 5 \mathsf { K W B C / \mu L }$ . The original concentrations, the volume of diluent, and the final concentrations of the samples are shown in the table below.

The Limit of Quantification of the Athelas One was determined to be 0.44 K WBC/µL​ as per CLSI EP17-A2. This is below the lower limit of the Athelas One’s reporting range of 1.0K WBC/µL.

# Specimen Stability Studies

Whole blood stability - Room temperature vs Refrigerated temperature

Whole blood stability was evaluated on the Athelas One device by conducting a 48 hour stability study on nine different venous blood samples with low $( 0 . 5 - 3 \mathsf { K } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ , normal $( 4 { - } 1 0 \mathsf { K } / \mathsf { \mu L } )$ , and high $( > 1 0 ~ \mathsf { K / \mu L } )$ WBC levels. The study was designed in accordance with recommendations from CLSI EP25-A.

Based on results evaluating deviation from pre-defined bias and precision criteria, the stability duration for all samples can be set to 24 hours with observed degradation at 48 hours for both the WBC and Neutrophil $\%$ parameters. Overall, all samples tested within 24 hours of collection time were found to meet the pre-set acceptance criteria of $7 . 5 \%$ CV for WBC precision, $\pm 7 . 5 \%$ Bias for WBC, $5 \%$ SD OR $1 5 \%$ CV for Neutrophils (updated based on Sysmex XW-100 Neut% CV criteria), and $\pm 1 0 \%$ Bias across the whole study.

# Test Strip Stability over time

A 16 week test strip stability study was conducted to assess the shelf life stability of the Athelas test strips. The strips were tested weekly over 16 weeks to justify a 15 week expiration. The study was designed in accordance with recommendations from CLSI EP25-A.

In particular, the study was conducted over 16 weeks, across two test strip lots, 4 analyzers, two replicates, and one lot of quality control materials. Each week, we performed two replicates per two lots of strips across 3 levels of control fluid.

From the study it can be observed that none of the analyzed test strips manifested statistically significant degradation/drift over the 105-day study $( \mathsf { p } > 0 . 0 5 )$ as recommended by the CLSI EP25-A regression slope analysis. The stability duration for all samples can be set to 98 days with no observed degradation at 105 days, the last time point of the study.

# Clinical

# Method Comparison

Method comparison studies were performed to assess the performance of the Athelas One analyzer when compared to the predicate Sysmex XE-5000 analyzer on a total of 312 patient samples taken at 3 point of care sites in the US. All samples were run in the Automated Sampling Modes in singlet on the XE-5000.

Samples covered clinical medical decision levels, and included normal and abnormal samples. The full reportable measuring ranges of the Athelas One analyzer were tested in method comparison. All evaluation criteria (slope, r, bias at medical decision levels, overall bias, bland altman analysis, intercept) were met, and even more specifically: manufacture-defined criteria for equivalence between two predicate Sysmex XE-5000 devices was also met by the Athelas One.

The overall results across three sites are shown in the table below.

# Flagging Comparison

As per Agency recommendation, a Flagging Comparison study was conducted to determine the ability for the Athelas One to successfully flag abnormal samples for manual review. The study design of a Sysmex XN series analyzer (FDA 510k K112605) was used, and a similar evaluation criteria of $90 \%$ flagging accuracy.

# Morphological Flags

The results of the Athelas One morphological flagging compared to the XE-5000 flagging evaluation were divided into two categories: (1) No Flags, Negative Judgement (2) Patients with positive Morphology/Differential abnormalities - Flags present, Positive Judgement. The study was limited to WBC and DIFF related flags. The results obtained from the flagging comparison study met the specification of $\geq 9 0 \%$ .

# Matrix Comparison

Experiments were conducted to determine the comparability of venous and capillary whole blood on the Athelas One device across 59 patients. These were in addition to the method comparison trials that used a combination of venous and capillary blood tested against venous samples run on the predicate device.

Capillary finger-prick blood samples were placed directly onto Athelas test strips from subjects. Venous whole blood samples were collected in K2EDTA vacutainer tubes for the same patients. The capillary whole blood and the venous whole blood samples were analyzed on Athelas One devices. It was concluded that there is no statistical difference between the systems when analyzing venous and capillary samples.

The regression parameters and $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of bias at the medical decision levels were calculated as per recommendation of CLSI EP5-A3 and H26-A2 and met all evaluation criteria. The information is summarized on the tables below:
