Re: K181475 Trade/Device Name: DxH 520 Hematology Instrument Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.5220 Regulation Name: Automated differential cell counter Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: GKZ Dated: June 1, 2018 Received: June 4, 2018

Dear Samy Puccio:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of March 1, 2019.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent for the indications for use stated in the enclosure to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act and the limitations described below. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at   
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

The Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that this device will be used for an intended use not identified in the proposed labeling and that such use could cause harm. Therefore, in accordance with Section 513(i)(1)(E) of the Act, the following limitation must appear in the Intended Use statement of the device's labeling:

All numerical results reported for Basophil count and percent values must be reflexed for manual microscopy or followed up for additional testing based on the laboratory’s SOP.

Furthermore, the intended use/indication for use:

The DxH 520 is a quantitative, multi-parameter, automated hematology analyzer for in vitro diagnostic use in clinical laboratories and physician's office laboratories. It is used to identify the normal patient with normal system-generated parameters from patients with abnormal parameters and/or flags that require additional studies.

The DxH 520 identifies and enumerates the following parameters: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, RDW-SD, PLT, MPV, LY%, LY#, $M O \%$ , MO#, NE%, NE#, EO%, EO#, $B A \%$ , BA# in whole blood samples (venous and capillary) collected in K2EDTA and K3EDTA anticoagulants, and prediluted whole blood.

The instrument is for use in adult and pediatric populations, including neonates.

must be prominently displayed in all labeling, including pouch box, and carton labels, instructions for use, and other promotional materials, in close proximity to the trade name, of a similar point size, and in bold print.

Please note that the above labeling limitations are required by Section 513(i)(1)(E) of the Act. Therefore, a new 510(k) is required before these limitations are modified in any way or removed from the device's labeling.

The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and permits your device to proceed to the market. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification if the limitation statement described above is added to your labeling.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (http://www.fda.gov/DICE) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

# Device Description

The DxH 520 instrument provides a complete blood count (CBC with Five Part Differential (5PD)). Blood specimens are processed using a Closed Vial sampling method as default and have the option to run as Open Vial per operator selection.

![](images/4ed618d37cf9f26182afb6ad43178ef8dc6706176b07b38a9836e0255eddc174.jpg)

RBC, WBC and PLT cell counts and sizes are determined using the Coulter Principle (impedance). The WBC 5 part differential is determined using a combination of the impedance WBC data and the direct optical measurement (Axial Light Loss - ALL) using a blue LED focused through the WBC aperture. With the addition of the DxH 500 Series Lyse, the RBCs are lysed and the released hemoglobin is converted into stable Oxyhemoglobin (or Carboxyhemoglobin, if present). The resulting complex is then measured by spectrophotometry.

The data obtained from the counting, sizing, optical and hemoglobin measurements is processed to create the DxH 520 hematological measurement that the device reports. Raw information is digitized from all

analytical modules and passed to an embedded computer processing. Algorithms using dynamic gates to differentiate WBC subpopulations and flagging are performed within the embedded computer.

Controls and calibrators are used to monitor the performance of the instrument.

The compact bench top design of the $\mathrm { D x H } 5 2 0$ will benefit small laboratories where bench space is limited. The integrated color display with graphical icon based user interface is intended to facilitate ease of use and operator training. The small bench-top $\mathrm { D x H } 5 2 0$ instrument utilizes fully featured integrated software usually found on larger instrumentation.

# Intended use

It is used to identify the normal patient with normal system-generated parameters from patients with abnormal parameters and/or flags that require additional studies.

The DxH 520 identifies and enumerates the following parameters: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, RDW-SD, PLT, MPV, $\mathrm { L Y \% }$ , LY#, $M O \%$ , MO#, $\mathrm { N E } \%$ , NE#, $\mathrm { E O \% }$ , EO#, $\mathrm { B A } \%$ , BA# in whole blood samples (venous and capillary) collected in K2EDTA and K3EDTA anticoagulants, and prediluted whole blood.

The instrument is for use in adult and pediatric populations, including neonates.
