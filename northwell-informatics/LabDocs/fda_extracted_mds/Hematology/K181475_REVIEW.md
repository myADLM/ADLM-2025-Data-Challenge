# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The $\mathrm { D x H } 5 2 0$ instrument system is comprised of the analyzer, software, and reagents that allow for quantitative determination of hematological measurements through the use of impedance, spectrophotometry, and optical technology. Additional reagents provide system cleaning, quality control and calibration. The system includes the following reagents :

DxH 500 series Lyse – a cyanide-free, aldehyde-free erythrocyte lytic agent for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin, dilution for the classification of WBC subpopulations, and counting leukocytes.   
DxH 500 Series Diluent – an aldehyde-free, isotonic-buffered saline solution that is used to dilute the specimen and used to rinse module components between sample analyses.   
DxH 500 Series Cleaner – a cyanide-free, aldehyde-free cleaning agent for components that come in contact with blood samples to remove residual material from the system.

2. Principles of Operation:

# Measurement of Hemoglobin

Using the DxH 520 hemoglobin reagent (DxH 500 Series Lyse), the hemoglobin derivatives are stabilized in an oxyhemoglobin ferrous form. The resulting complex is then measured by spectrophotometry using a LED $\lambda { = } 5 4 5 \mathrm { n m }$ with a $\delta \lambda { = } 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ $( + / - 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ bandwidth).

Determination of Count/Size for White Blood Cells, Red Blood Cells and Platelets The Coulter Principle (impedance) is used to count and size cells by detecting and measuring changes in electrical resistance when a particle (such as a cell) in a conductive liquid passes through a small aperture. Platelet counting and sizing are performed in the RBC bath. Thresholds separate the platelet pulses, which are much smaller than the RBC pulses.

# RBC and PLT Histograms

Red blood cells (RBCs) are categorized by size (volume) and plotted on a size distribution curve to form the RBC histogram. Platelets are also categorized according to size to develop a size distribution curve of the particles.

# Leukocyte 5-Part Differential

The leukocyte 5-part differential is determined by using the simultaneous measurement of impedance and direct optical measurement (Axial Light Loss - ALL) using a blue LED focused through the WBC aperture.

3. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ___X____ or No _

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No ___ _X

4. Specimen Identification:

Specimen identification is performed by manual entry using a keyboard or hand-held barcode reader.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Whole blood specimens are processed using a closed-vial sampling method as default with the option to run in open-vial mode if selected by the operator. For open-vial

sampling, the whole blood specimen (single tube) is to be manually mixed and presented to the analyzer by the operator.

6. Calibration:

The DxH 500 Series Calibrator is intended for the determination of CBC calibration factors (WBC, RBC, HGB, MCV, PLT and MPV). The calibrator is comprised of human and animal cells to simulate human blood cell populations.

7. Quality Control:

The $\mathrm { D x H } 5 0 0$ Series Control is a hematology tri-level (low, normal and high) quality control material intended to monitor the system’s performance for the CBC and 5-part differential parameters. The calibrator is comprised of human and animal cells to simulate human blood cells.

# J. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Method Comparison

The method comparison studies were performed at six sites (three clinical laboratories and three physican office laboratories–also referred to as POLs) to compare the performance of the DxH 520 Hematology Instrument to the UniCel DxH 800 COULTER Cellular Analysis System using a total of 688 residual whole blood samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulant collection tubes. Venous $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { \overbrace { n \mathrm { = } 6 0 0 } } }$ ) and capillary $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 8 8 )$ ) whole blood samples were analyzed in the open- and closed-vial

sampling modes. The study included pediatric (neonate to $\leq 2 1$ years) and adult subjects with the following conditions: anemia, thrombocytosis, sickle cell anemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloblastic leukemia (CML), pancytopenia, polycythemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, infection and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Deming regressions were used to estimate the regression models (i.e. slope, intercept, $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) and correlation coefficient (r)). Bland-Altman (difference) plots and $9 5 \%$ limits of agreement (LOA) were presented to show the average of the test and reference value on the X-axis and the difference between the test and the reference methods on the Y-axis. Bias at medical decision points were also evaluated for each site and for all sites combined. All results were within the predefined acceptance criteria and found to be acceptable with the exception of the basophil parameters.

# b. Precision/Reproducibility:

To evaluate precision and reproducibility, studies were conducted in clinical laboratories and POL sites.

# Repeatability

The repeatability study was conducted at multiple clinical laboratory sites using multiple operators and multiple $\mathrm { D x H } 5 2 0$ analyzers over multiple operating days. A total of 112 samples residual native whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA collection tubes were selected within the defined ranges and around medical decision points per the CLSI H26-A2 standard. Each sample was analyzed 10 consecutive times in the closed-vial sampling mode. All results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable.

To evaluate operator variability at POL sites, a repeatability study was conducted in whole blood closed-vial mode and the pre-dilute testing mode using 24 residual samples. Whole blood samples were analyzed by each operator for 10 replicates (each sample) analyzed in the closed-vial mode. Pre-diluted samples were also analyzed by each operator in the pre-dilute mode for 10 replicates. Samples were tested by two or three operators at the POL sites. All results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable.

# Reproducibility

To evaluate reproducibility at clinical laboratory sites, three different levels of quality control materials (low, normal, high) were used. The same lot was tested across all sites. Control vials were run in duplicate twice each day for a minimum of 20 days at one site and in triplicate twice each day for five days at the other two sites. All results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable.

To evalute reproducibility at POL sites, one lot of quality control material (low, normal, high) was run once a day across three sites for five days with five replicates for each QC level. The data generated from this assessment was used to calculate repeatability (within-run precision), between-day and between-site, and reproducibility (total precision). For each reported parameter and for each level of control tested, the sample size (N), mean, SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of the various components of precision were calculated along with the $9 5 \%$ CI of the SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for repeatability and reproducibility (total precision). All results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable.

# c. Linearity:

Linearity was assessed by demonstrating that the reported results were directly proportional to the concentration of the measurand in a test sample for the WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT parameters. The linearity stutdy was performed using three

instruments.

Regression analysis was used to assess linearity for the first-order model (e.g. linear), and weighted polynomial regression was used to assess linearity for the second- and third-order models (e.g, quadratic and cubic). WBC, PLT and HGB achieved linearity with a first-order model whereas RBC linearity was achieved through polynomial regression (third order model).

d. Carryover:

Carryover studies for the WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT parameters were conducted at three sites in the closed-vial sampling mode. Fresh and contrived whole blood samples were used to create high target value (HTV) samples for WBC and HGB. Diluent was used for low target value (LTV) sample. Testing was performed on four instruments. Each HTV sample was analyzed in triplicate, followed by three aspirations of a LTV sample. The results of the carryover study were within the predefined acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable for each parameter tested.

# e. Interfering Substances:

The interference effect of hemolysis, lipemia, icterus (unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin), high levels of WBCs $( 1 0 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } \mathrm { 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu L } )$ ) and high levels of platelets (PLT $>$ $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) were evaluated in the interference study. For lipemia, seven concentrations were analyzed in five replicates. For hemolysis, icterus and high levels of WBCs, test concentrations selected from the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline were analyzed in ten replicates. The concentrations indicated in the table below for lipemia, conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, and hemoglobin are the highest concentrations that did not interfere with the following parameters: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCHC, RDW, RDW-SD, PLT and MPV. For high levels of platelets (as an interferent), the following parameters were evaluated: WBC, RBC, HGB, PLT and MPV. For high levels of WBCs (as an interferent), the HGB parameter was evaluated.

# Limits of Detection, Blank, and Quantitation (LoD, LoB, and LoQ)

Studies were conducted to evaluate LoB, LoD and LoQ for the WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT parameters on the DxH 520 Hematology Analyzer. The study was conducted using three DxH 520 instruments and two reagent lots. To determine LoB, testing was performed on three individual test days, with 40 runs per day using diluent as a test sample for each DxH 520 instrument yielding a total of 120 measurements/instrument. To determine limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ), four samples per parameter were evaluated. Three sets of 11 dilutions of the stock solution were prepared. Five replicates of each dilution level was analyzed on each test instrument. The LoD and LoQ study was carried out over two days on the same three instruments. The LoB, LoD and LoQ were determined as follows.

# Specimen Stability

To evaluate sample stability for all claimed parameters in predilute mode a total of 20 residual K2EDTA whole blood samples were prepared and stored at the defined condition for each specimen. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate at different time points according to the study design. The sample stability at room temperature for all parameters was established at 15 minutes from the time of sample preparation (dilution).

To evaluate sample stability of whole blood (undiluted) samples, 21 normal and 15 abnormal whole blood specimens were collected and analyzed on three to four DxH 520 instruments. Sample stability was performed at both room temperature and refrigerated storage. All parameters reported on DxH520 were assessed. Aliquots were prepared and stored at the defined condition for each specimen, then analyzed in duplicate at different time points according to the study design. The sample stability in the whole blood mode for RBC, HGB, MCV, HCT, MCH, MCHC, RDW, RDW-SD, PLT, and MPV is 24 hours at room temperature $1 8 \mathrm { - } 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and refrigerated temperature $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ while the sample stability for WBC and the 5-part differential parameters is 24 hours at room

temperature $( 1 8 - 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and 8 hours at refrigerated temperature $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ from the time of collection.

# Comparison Studies

Pre-Dilute vs. Whole Blood Sampling Modes

To demonstrate equivalency between pre-dilute and whole blood modes, fresh whole blood samples were collected within 8 hours of venipuncture in K2EDTA collection tubes. Whole blood (normal and abnormal) samples run in duplicate in the Cap Pierce mode was compared to two $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA whole blood dilutions prepared by the operator run in the pre-dilute mode. Deming and weighted Deming approaches were used to estimate the parameters of the regression model (slope, intercept, $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals and correlation coefficient) of the comparison. Results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were found to be acceptable.

Sampling Modes (Cap Pierce, Open Vial and Tube Holder Open Vial) Cap piercing, open-vial and tube holder open-vial (THOV) modes were tested with the same blood samples on the same instrument using the same reagents. A total of 44 samples (normal and abnormal) were included in analysis for the mode equivalency testing. Deming and weighted Deming regressions were used to estimate the parameters of the regression model (slope, intercept, $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals and correlation coefficient) of the comparison. Results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable.

# Anticoagulant and Matrix Comparison

K2EDTA and K3EDTA anticoagulant and matrix (venous or capillary) comparison studies were conducted in the whole blood cap-piercing mode. K2EDTA venous whole blood was compared to K3EDTA venous whole blood or K2EDTA capillary whole blood. A total of 49 samples (normal and abnormal) were included in the analysis for the anticoagulant comparison and a total of 48 samples were included in analysis for the matrix comparison. Deming and weighted Deming regressions were used to estimate the regression model (slope, intercept, $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals and correlation coefficient) for the comparisons. The results met the predefined acceptance criteria and were found to be acceptable.

# Reference Intervals

The normal adult reference interval for all parameters reported by the DxH 520 system were established by analyzing whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA from a total of 279 healthy individuals $\mathrm { N } { = } 1 2 6$ males, $\mathrm { N } { = } 1 5 3$ females). Statistical analysis was performed using the nonparametric method in accordance with the reference limits calculated using $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals.

A literature reference interval verification study was performed for the pediatric population. A total of 208 samples were collected from apparently healthy pediatric patients in pediatric subcategories (0 to 30 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 0 )$ ), 31 days to 2 years $( \mathrm { n } \mathrm { = } 2 7$ ), 3 to 12 years $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 9 4 )$ and 13 to 21 days $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 6 7 )$ ) to support the Intended Use. All samples were collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant and analyzed in the whole blood sampling mode.
