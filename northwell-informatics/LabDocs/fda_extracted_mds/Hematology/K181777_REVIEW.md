# L. Test Principle:

The AggreGuide A-100 instrument uses a laser diode and photodetector to measure light scatter. A whole blood sample is added to the reaction chamber of the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridge. The reaction chamber contains a preloaded freeze-dried agonist, ADP, as well as a magnetically activated rotor that mixes the agonist with the whole blood sample. ADP activates platelets by binding to the ADP receptors on the platelet surface resulting in platelet aggregation. P2Y12 inhibitors inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation by blocking the P2Y12 ADP receptor on the platelet surface. The laser in the AggreGuide A-100 instrument emits light into the sample and platelet aggregates are detected by the observation of light scatter. The amount of platelet aggregation is proportional to the amount of platelet aggregates detected in the sample. Test results are reported as a Platelet Activity Index (PAI), where higher values are associated with more platelet activity/aggregation and lower values are associated with less platelet activity/aggregation.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The repeatability study was conducted using one instrument, with three donor samples across the reportable range including a high level sample $( > 6 . 5$ PAI), a sample near the cut-off (3.7–5.7 PAI) and a low level sample $( < 3 . 7 \mathrm { P A I } )$ . For each donor, five to ten whole blood sample tubes were collected and three replicates were performed per tube on three different days, for a total of minimum of 60 measurements per donor. The SD results for the levels below 4.7 PAI and the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ results for the levels above 4.7 PAI were found to be acceptable.

The reproducibility study was conducted with three normal donors, three lots of cartridges and three instruments where a single cartridge lot was used on each instrument. For each donor, seven to ten whole blood sample tubes were collected three observations per tube, for multiple days with a minimum of 3 days to 20 days. Four runs were performed with five replicates per run on each instrument per tube. To demonstrate precision performance for each sample/donor, the $\% C V$ and SD for each component of variability were calculated; including, within-run, between-run, between-lot and betweeninstrument. Due to biological variation of platelet function, between-donor and betweenday variability was not calculated.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity is not applicable.

Assay Reportable Range:

The numerical values of PAI are reported between the values of 2.1 and 12.0. When levels of aggregation are less than 2.1, the PAI is reported as “LOW” accompanied by a message “No Detectable Aggregation.” When levels of aggregation are greater than 12.0, the PAI is reported as “HIGH”, accompanied by a message “Aggregation is High, reliability of a PAI greater than 12 has not been established.”

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability is not applicable.

# Shelf Life Stability:

In accordance with CLSI EP25-A, the shelf-life stability study was conducted for the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridges using an isochronous study design with four different time points including baseline. Six donors representing high (normal), medium (normal) and low (dysfunctional due to P2Y12 inhibitor) were used to test shelf-life stability. Donor samples were tested on three different lots of aged cartridges (previously manufactured production lots) compared to one freshly manufactured lot that was less than one week old. Each donor was tested with each cartridge lot in five replicates per time point using a single instrument. Shelf-life stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for each donor and lot. The data provided were found to be acceptable to support the 18-month shelf-life stability claim at room temperature.

# Transportation Stability:

The transportation (shipping) stability study was conducted with one cartridge lot, one instrument and a single donor sample. The donor sample was collected in sodium citrate anticoagulant and tested under stressed $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and unstressed (room temperature) conditions, for five runs and two replicates per run. To simulate a stressed condition, the assay cartridge was placed in a temperature control test compartment under different temperature cycles. The compartment temperature was lowered to $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and raised to $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . At each temperature, the cartridges were maintained for 60 minutes. The transition time from $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was 15 minutes. The transition time from $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was 25 minutes. The data provided for the transportation stability study was assessed with a linear regression analysis and was found to be acceptable.

Shipping temperature is monitored by an indicator attached to the box label which will change color if the temperature of the box exceeds $5 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Sample Stability:

Sample stability was determined using whole blood samples collected from donors. The samples were stored at room temperature $( 2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and subsequently analyzed using one assay cartridge lot on one instrument at a minimum of eight different time points (ranging from 2 minutes to more than 6 hours from collection). The data supported a sample stability claim at room temperature for 30 minutes to 4 hours post-collection.

# Open-pouch Stability:

The AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridges are packaged in Mylar pouches. An open-pouch stability study was conducted to demonstrate stability of the cartridges after removal from the Mylar pouch. The study was conducted by testing three normal donor samples at four different time points (ranging from 1 minute to 60 minutes). Each time point consisted of one test and one control observation on the same instrument which was operated by the same user. For each time point, test results were compared to the respective baseline results. The data demonstrate that the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridges should be used within 12 minutes of opening the Mylar pouch.

# Expected Values for Controls:

The labeling for the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay requires the quality control cartridge (QC2) test to be performed on the AggreGuide A-100 instrument every 30 days, or every 200 assays, whichever occurs first. The QC2 cartridge serves as a method of detecting gross failure of the AggreGuide A-100 instrument. The AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cannot be performed on the AggreGuide A-100 instrument unless a QC2 test has been successfully performed within the defined interval (30 days or 200 assays).

There are no manufactured external controls for AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay. The manufacturer recommends that laboratories establish their own donor reagent controls and may consider the following when establishing control donor groups:

Normal PAI: In accordance with the specimen collection and handling instructions provided in the labeling, collect whole blood from healthy adult donors. The donor must not have taken any medication that is known to affect platelet function for at least seven days and should have prior platelet   
aggregation tests with results within the normal range established by the laboratory. The manufacturer recommends using donors whose PAI value is $>$ 4.7.   
Abnormal PAI: In accordance with the specimen collection and handling instructions provided in the labeling, collect whole blood from a donor under chronic aspirin treatment. The manufacturer recommends using donors whose PAI value is $< 4 . 7$ .

The manufacturer recommends performing quality control (normal and abnormal) for each new lot of AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay cartridges. Quality control may be performed more frequently in accordance with laboratory procedures.

Expected Values for Calibrators:

The AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay is factory calibrated, as such, calibration is not performed by the user of the device.

# d. Detection limit:

In accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, the Limit of Blank (LoB) study was conducted by testing five K2EDTA whole blood samples over 30 days, 30 runs per day, 2 replicates per run. Twenty-eight cartridge lots were run on one AggreGuide A-100 instrument. The LoB was determined to be 0.8 PAI.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical specificity for the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay was determined by spiking normal whole blood samples collected in sodium citrate anticoagulant with various concentrations of interferents. The following endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were evaluated and showed no significant interference up to the specified concentration in whole blood samples collected in $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate anticoagulant tubes.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

A clinical study was conducted at seven intended use sites in the U.S. using three instruments and six assay cartridge lots. For each study subject, whole blood was collected and tested at baseline and at each time point of the on-therapy state. Note: each study subject adhered to an aspirin regimen which included aspirin ingestion prior to the collection of the baseline sample and a daily $8 1 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ dose post-baseline.

In addition to the baseline measurement, samples were collected from subjects on ticagrelor therapy at the following time points to represent the respective phase of the ontherapy state: 3–6 hours (post-loading, “full-effect”), 24 hours to represent the “not fulleffect” and 7 days (post-maintenance, “full-effect”). In addition to the baseline measurement, samples were collected from subjects on prasugrel at the following time points to represent the respective phase of the on-therapy state: 24 hours and 7 days (post-maintenance) which represent the “full-effect” states. All study samples were tested with the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay and the VerifyNow PRUTest.

Note: Although the clinical study included three study arms in which patients receiving ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel were evaluated, the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay is intended to detect platelet dysfunction in patients receiving ticagrelor and patients receiving prasugrel. The data provided in the tables below represent the performance of ticagrelor and prasugrel as claimed in the Intended Use.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and $b$ . are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The reference range for the AggreGuide A-100 ADP Assay was established in a study involving 129 healthy adult subjects (22–75 years of age) who were not receiving antiplatelet medication. The study cohort consisted of a diverse population of males and females with different ethnic backgrounds representative of the U.S. population. The reference range was determined by the one-sided lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval. The lower limit is 4.54 PAI.
