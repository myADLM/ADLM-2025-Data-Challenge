807.92 (a)(2): Device name- trade name and common name, and classification

Trade name: Sysmex UD-10 Fully Automated Urine Particle Digital Imaging Device

Common Name: Automated cell-locating device (urine sediments)

Classification: 21 CFR 864.5260

807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate devices MICRO21 with Urine Sediment Analysis (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Palm Beach Gardens, FL), cleared under K982301.

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The Sysmex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ UD-10 is a medical device that captures images of cells and particles found in urine with a camera and displays the images on a display screen. The displayed data consists of images of individual particles that are extracted from the original captured whole field images. The device sorts urine particle images based on their size into eight groups (Class 1-8). These images are transferred to the UDM (Urinalysis Data Manager), where the operator enters the classification of the particle images based on their visual examination. The classification of the particles by the operator is a designation of what type of particles are observed (e.g., WBCs, RBCs, casts, bacteria).

The size ranges of cells and particles that fall under each size group (Class 1-8) are provided below, along with the number of display images for each group.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Nonclinical Data

# Precision- Reproducibility

The objective was to determine if technologists can use the UD-10 device to reproducibly identify the presence of elements in an abnormal quality control (QC) sample (L2), and the absence of elements in normal QC (L1) sample, over time. The study was conducted at four (4) US clinical sites using commercially available ${ \mathrm { M A S } } ^ { \textregistered }$ UA control material (Level 1 and Level 2). Three aliquots of each level of control was poured into sample tubes, barcoded with a unique identifier and processed in a random order on the UD-10. The samples were processed twice per day for a minimum of five days (the days were not consecutive). One technologist reviewed and identified particle images (RBCs and WBCs) displayed in each class (one to eight) and recorded the results of each sample.

The results of the precision (reproducibility) study from all sites combined are presented in the table below.

# Results Conclusion

The reproducibility study, completed for four clinical sites, resulted in a total of 240 evaluations of images displayed on the UD-10 using MAS UA abnormal control material and normal control (containing WBCs and RBCs).

Overall, technologists reported the presence of elements in only five cases when testing the normal control material, which was not element free. The remaining 235 evaluations, inclusive of the 120 cases of negatives (normal), were concordant with the QC material, resulting in $9 7 . 9 \%$ overall agreement with a $9 5 . 2 \%$ lower confidence limit. In that this limit exceeds the $8 0 . 9 \%$ minimum requirement, the reproducibility primary study objective was statistically achieved as planned at $9 7 . 5 \%$ confidence (1-sided).

The study objective was to determine if technologists can use the UD-10 device to repeatedly identify the presence of elements in both abnormal and normal urine samples. The study was conducted at four (4) US clinical sites using normal and abnormal residual urine samples, collected without preservatives. Each site aimed to obtain one abnormal and one normal sample from each cell/particle group as outlined in the below. An individual sample may be representative of one or more cell/particle groups (e.g., RBCs and WBCs). Five replicates of each sample were assayed on the UD-10. Reference results were provided by screening the samples with the Sysmex UF-1000i urine analyzer (K070910).

Two technologists independently reviewed and identified the particle images displayed in each class (one to eight) for each sample run. Each technologist’s results were treated and recorded as an independent observation.

# Results Conclusion

The repeatability study, completed for four clinical sites, resulted in a total of 170 evaluations of abnormal and normal urine samples representing the cell/particle groups: microorganisms, blood cells, epithelial cells, casts, crystals, and miscellaneous.

Overall, technologists correctly reported the presence of elements representing one or more of these cell/particle groups for all sample replicates. This study achieved $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ overall agreement. with a $9 7 . 8 \%$ lower confidence limit. In that this limit exceeds the $8 5 . 2 \%$ minimum requirement, the repeatability primary study objective was statistically achieved as planned at $9 7 . 5 \%$ confidence (1-sided).

# Carryover

The objective of this study was to determine if visual diagnostic carryover is present in low concentration samples (normal samples) when preceded by high concentration samples (abnormal samples) in consecutive order. The study was conducted at four (4) US sites for BACT and three (3) sites for WBC and RBC using residual urine samples, collected without preservatives, with high concentrations of WBCs, RBCs and bacteria (High Sample) and low concentrations of WBCs, RBCs and bacteria (Low Sample).

Sample selection was determined based on the Sysmex UF-1000i results. Urine samples with WBC, RBC and bacteria counts near the upper measurement range were used as the High Sample and urine samples with WBCs, RBCs and bacteria counts near the lower measurement range were used as the Low Sample for this study.

Each sample was mixed, split into three separate sample aliquot tubes (three high sample aliquots and three low sample aliquots), and then barcoded with a unique identifier. The three high concentration samples were assayed on the UD-10 in consecutive order, immediately followed by the three low concentration samples. A technologist reviewed images displayed in each class (one to eight) from each low sample and recorded the results of their findings as present/absent to indicate the presence or absence of WBCs, RBCs and bacteria of each low sample. The data are presented below.

# Discussion:

Based on the results of technologists’ visual observations of images displayed on the UD-10, Site 06 (bacteria and WBCs), and Site 04 (RBCs) indicated the presence of cell/particles in Low Samples. However, the samples were not “zero” as per the reference testing, and therefore further analysis was undertaken.

Using a logistic regression model, the predicted probabilities of a technologist indicating the presence or absence of elements in low sample replicates, given its concentration value as recorded in the above table (UF-1000i, Low Sample Cell Count), were calculated for each parameter, site and replicate. Probabilities are expected to be close to 1 for high concentration samples, and close to 0 for low concentration samples. These probabilities were then used to compute the carryover effect $( \% ) = 1 0 0 \mathrm { ( L 1 \mathrm { - } L 3 ) / ( H 3 \mathrm { - } H 3 ) }$ , for Low Sample replicates 1 and 3 and High Sample replicate 3.

# Discussion Conclusion

As demonstrated in the above table, the carryover effect for RBC had a site range of $9 . 8 2 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 2 3 0 } \%$ to $4 . 1 6 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 1 4 0 } \%$ . The carryover effect for BACT had a site range of $0 . 0 0 \%$ to $- 2 . 5 7 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 2 6 0 } \%$ . The carryover effect for WBC had a site range of $1 . 0 5 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 0 } \%$ to $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ .

These above results demonstrated that there was no carryover for RBC and BACT for any site but minimal carryover for WBC at Site 06 where the technologist indicated the presence of one (1) WBC seen in the Low Sample #1. The presence of one (1) WBC was determined to be clinically insignificant as it would not shift the patient from one diagnostic group to another.

As standard laboratory practice, the identification of cell/particle images displayed on the UD-10 by a technologist should be used as a part of an overall diagnosis including clinical symptoms and other examination results.

# Method Comparison

The objective of the study was to determine if independent technologists, using the UD-10 device and manual microscopy (reference method), can comparably identify the presence of elements in abnormal and normal urine samples. Also, due to the subjective nature of sediment analysis, the UF-1000i was included as a referee method. The identification of the presence of elements using the UD-10 and manual microscopy was evaluated per element (cell/particle group) across sites and by site. This relationship was quantified in terms of positive, negative, and overall $\%$ agreement.

The study was conducted at four (4) US clinical sites using residual urine samples, collected without preservatives, from the daily routine laboratory workload. Samples were transferred to two sample tubes without preservatives and de-identified to ensure the identity of the subject was not known. Sample selection for the evaluation included a mix of normal and abnormal samples which were determined based on the Sysmex UF-1000i Urine Particle Counter results, i.e., normal samples (results without flags and within the established reference range) and abnormal samples (results with flags and outside the established reference range). UF-1000i reportable parameters include RBC, WBC, epithelial cells, casts and bacteria, and flagging parameters include pathological cast, crystals, sperm, yeast-like cell and mucus.

One technologist classified cell and formed elements displayed on the UD-10 imaging device, while a second technologist performed classification and identification of cells and formed elements by visual read using the manual light microscopy method All testing was done in a blinded fashion. The time interval between sample analyses on both methods was less than or equal to 1 hour.

# Results (all) Conclusion

The method comparison study, completed for four clinical sites, utilized both UD-10 and manual microscopy to evaluate a total of 746 abnormal and normal samples representing the cell/particle groups: RBC, WBC, epithelial cells, casts, crystals, microorganisms and miscellaneous elements.

The overall level of agreement between UD-10 and manual microscopy was $9 2 . 0 \%$ with $9 5 \%$ (2- sided) confidence interval $( 8 9 . 8 \%$ , $9 3 . 7 \%$ exceeding the $8 5 . 2 \%$ proposed requirement. The results demonstrate the UD-10 can be used to identify urine elements in place of manual microscopy.

Per Element Comparison of UD-10 Results to Manual Microscopy Results

The identification of the presence of elements using the UD-10 and manual microscopy was evaluated per element (cell/particle group) across sites and by site. This relationship was quantified in terms of positive, negative, and overall $\%$ agreement. The results of the agreement analysis between UD-10 and manual microscopy for microorganisms, RBCs, WBCs, crystals, epithelial cells (ECs), casts and miscellaneous elements for all sites combined and individual sites are provided in the following table.
