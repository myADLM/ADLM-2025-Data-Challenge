Sysmex America, Inc., Sysmex® UD-10 Fully Automated Urine Particle Digital Imaging Device

# D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:

The Sysmex UD-10 locates urine particles, measures the size of the particle, and sorts the particles by size into eight groups (Class 1–8).

# E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The Sysmex UD-10 is a urine cell particle locating device that consists of the following components which perform the following functions:

Main analyzer: for sample aspiration, cell particle imaging, touch panel for operator interfacing with the system · Sampler Section CV-11: to automatically transport samples to the main analyzer · Data Processor (IPU): to process data received from the analyzer · Pneumatic unit; to regulate the pressure supplied to the analyzer · Urinalysis Data Manager (UDM) Software: to allow the operator to monitor and manage data generated on the Sysmex UD-10, enter and manage patient information and results, validate imaging results, check quality control results, connect to a host computer. The UDM Software does not modify the data generated by the Sysmex UD-10 nor does it control the Sysmex UD-10 analyzer. Software of UD-10: for analyzer operation and to store/review data Accessories: sample rack set, hand-held barcode reader, and power cord

2. Principles of Operation:

The Sysmex UD-10 aspirates uncentrifuged urine samples using an aspiration pipette and introduces the sample to an imaging cell. The sample is allowed to sit for a specified

duration of time, during which particles settle to the bottom of the imaging cell. The LED emits pulses of light as the imaging cell is moved, and images are captured with the camera. The captured image is analyzed on the IPU (information processing unit) and the particles in the image are displayed by size into one of the following eight groups. The number of particles per size group does not represent a reportable cell or particle count.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Size Group</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Size Range (μm)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Class 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2-6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Class 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6-10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Class 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10-16</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Class 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1636</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Class 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3671</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Class 6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>71101</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Class 7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>101151</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Class 8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≥151</td></tr></table>

The displayed data consists of images of individual particles extracted from the original captured whole field images. The images are transferred to the UDM where the operator manually enters the classification of the particle images based on their visual examination, where the classified particle is reported as present or absent. The classification of the particles by the operator is a designation of type of particles observed (e.g., WBCs, RBCs, casts, bacteria).

# Method Comparison

A method comparison study was conducted to compare the Sysmex UD-10 to manual microscopy with normal and abnormal urine samples. The study was conducted at four U.S. sites using 746 unique residual urine samples, collected without preservatives from patients undergoing routine urinalysis. The patient demographics included patients from 6 days old to 96 years of age and comprised of 366 males and 380 females. The identification of the presence of elements (red blood cells; RBCs, white blood cells; WBCs, crystals, epithelial cells, bacteria (microorganisms), casts and miscellaneous elements) using the UD-10 and manual microscopy was evaluated per element (cell/particle group) by site and for all sites combined.

The results of the agreement analysis between the UD-10 and manual microscopy for all cell/particle groups and sites combined are provided in the following table. The comparison is provided as overall agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) along with the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for overall cell/particle groups and sites.

b. Precision/Reproducibility: Repeatability

A repeatability study was conducted at four U.S. sites using both normal and abnormal urine samples, collected without preservatives. Five replicates were performed for each sample. Two technologists independently reviewed and identified the particle images displayed in each class (one to eight) for each sample run. Each technologist’s results were treated and recorded as an independent observation. The following operator classifications were evaluated: RBCs, WBCs, crystals, epithelial cells, bacteria (microorganisms), casts and miscellaneous elements. Overall agreement with the $9 5 \%$ CI was calculated and provided: $100 \%$ $( 9 7 . 8 \%$ , $100 \%$ ). The results of the repeatability study were determined to be acceptable.

# Reproducibility

Reproducibility studies were performed to determine if technologists can use the UD10 device to reproducibly identify the presence of elements in an abnormal quality control (QC) sample (L2), and the absence of elements in normal QC (L1) sample over time. The objective will be numerically achieved if the overall $\%$ agreement exceeds $8 0 . 9 \%$ between the UD-10 and QC results (L1/L2) over all sites and collection days for the per protocol analysis population. The study was conducted at four (4) US clinical sites using commercially available ${ \mathrm { \mathbf { M A S } } } ^ { \mathbb { ( B ) } }$ UA control material (Level 1 and Level 2). Three aliquots of each level of control was poured into sample tubes, barcoded with a unique identifier and processed in a random order on the UD10. The samples were processed twice per day for a minimum of five non-consecutive days. One technologist reviewed and identified particle images (RBCs and WBCs) displayed in each class (one to eight) and recorded the results of each sample.

c. Linearity:

Not applicable d. Carryover:

Carryover studies were conducted is to determine if visual diagnostic carryover was present in low concentration samples (normal samples) when preceded by high concentration samples (abnormal samples) in consecutive order.

The study was conducted at four U.S. sites to determine carryover for bacteria (BACT) and three sites to determine carryover of WBCs and RBCs using residual urine samples, collected without preservatives, with high concentrations of WBCs, RBCs and bacteria (High Sample) and low concentrations of WBCs, RBCs and bacteria (Low Sample). Sample selection was determined based on the Sysmex UF-1000i results. Urine samples with WBC, RBC and bacteria counts near the upper measurement range were used as the High Sample and urine samples with WBCs, RBCs and bacteria counts near the lower measurement range were used as the Low Sample for this study.

Each sample was mixed, split into three separate sample aliquot tubes (three high sample aliquots and three low sample aliquots), and then barcoded with a unique identifier. The three high concentration samples were assayed on the UD-10 in consecutive order, immediately followed by the three low concentration samples. A technologist reviewed images displayed in each class (one to eight) from each low sample and recorded the results of their findings as present/absent to indicate the presence or absence of WBCs, RBCs and Bacteria of each low sample.
