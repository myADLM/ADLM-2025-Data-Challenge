# I. Device Description:

The hemochroma PLUS System consists of a hemochroma PLUS Analyzer, single-use hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes, hemochroma PLUS ID Chip, optical System Check Microcuvette and hemochroma PLUS Controls.

1. hemochroma PLUS Analyzer

The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer is a battery powered, hand-held device used to measure total hemoglobin concentration in human whole blood. Whole blood may be collected by fingerstick (capillary) or venipuncture and analyzed without pre-processing. The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer uses hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes with dual ports where the user applies samples either through capillary action or direct volume pipetting. The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer determines hemoglobin concentration in whole blood samples using a dual wavelength photo-absorption method and measures the degree of light absorption with a spectrophotometer. The optical distance between the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette walls is fixed and permits photometric determination of hemoglobin in undiluted blood samples. The computed end result is displayed on a LCD display and can be printed on an external printer (optional).

# 2. hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette

The hemochroma PLUS Microcuvettes are specially designed for use with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. The microcuvettes function as measuring devices specifically holding $1 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of blood and are inserted into the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer by placing it into the cuvette holder. The optical distance between the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette walls is fixed and by measuring the degree of light absorption permits photometric determination of the hemoglobin in undiluted blood samples.

# 3. hemochroma PLUS ID Chip

The hemochroma PLUS ID chip contains encoded memory with the calibration data/information of the Microcuvette lot. With the ID chip inserted in the designated port, the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer reads and utilizes the calibration data regarding the lot under consideration and applies appropriate correction to the conversion formula while computing the test result.

4. hemochroma PLUS Optical System Check Microcuvette hemochroma PLUS Optical System Check Microcuvette is designed for use with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer only. The Optical System Check Microcuvette is a special glass filter used to measure the degree of light absorption with the spectrophotometric method. If the result is between $1 1 . 7 \mathrm { - } 1 2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ , the optic system is working properly according to specification.

# 5. hemochroma PLUS Controls

The hemochroma PLUS Controls: Level 1 (Low), Level 2 (Middle), and Level 3 (High), are external quality controls designed for use with hemochroma PLUS Analyzer only.

# L. Test Principle:

The hemochroma PLUS Analyzer utilizes a dual wavelength LED light source by which the hemoglobin absorbance is detected and converted into an electrical signal. The signal is directly proportional to the amount of hemoglobin present in the sample. The concentration of hemoglobin is calculated based on a pre-programmed calibration. The hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette is specifically designed for the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Approximately $1 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of capillary or venous blood is taken up by capillary action using the tip of the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette or by direct volume pipetting of the sample. The blood filled Microcuvette is inserted onto the microcuvette holder, and the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer measures the degree of light absorption with a spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the light from the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette is converted into an electrical signal. The optical distance between the hemochroma PLUS Microcuvette walls is fixed and permits photometric determination of the hemoglobin in undiluted blood samples.

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes or No ___X_

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No ___X_

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes __X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function for the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer. Samples are applied directly to the microcuvettes as they are collected. The end user must develop a manual system to identify patients that are tested with the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Capillary or venous whole blood is directly applied from the finger or blood tube (using a disposable pipette) to the Microcuvette. Wipe off excess blood from the surface of the microcuvette using a piece of soft gauze. The blood-filled Microcuvette is then inserted into the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer.

5. Calibration:

The hemochroma PLUS ID chip contains encoded memory with the calibration data/information of the Microcuvette lot. With the ID chip inserted in the designated port, the hemochroma PLUS Analyzer reads and utilizes the calibration data regarding the lot under consideration and applies appropriate correction to the conversion formula while computing the test result.

# 6. Quality Control:

The hemochroma PLUS Controls (low, middle, and high hemoglobin) are intended for use as quality control material to assure the validity and performance of the hemochroma PLUS System in measuring the human hemoglobin concentration. The hemochroma PLUS Controls should be assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and following the local and state guidelines. If controls do not perform as expected, the test results should not be used.

The hemochroma PLUS Optical System Check is used to assure the performance of the Optic System of the hemochroma PLUS. The Optical System Check Microcuvette is a special glass filter used to measure the degree of light absorption with the spectrophotometric method. If the result is between $1 1 . 7 \mathrm { - } 1 2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ , the optic system is working properly according to specification.
