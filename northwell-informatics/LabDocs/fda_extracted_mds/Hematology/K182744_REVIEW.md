# I. Device Description:

HemoTrol WB is an assayed hemoglobin quality control material intended for professional use in the verification of the precision and accuracy of the HemoCue 301 and HemoCue 801 systems. HemoTrol WB contains bovine red blood cells with hemoglobin lysates in MetHb and additional stabilizers. For daily quality control, three physiologically relevant levels are available.

HemoTrol WB solutions are filled in reclosable plastic primary containers. Each bottle contains $1 . 1 \ \mathrm { g }$ of HemoTrol WB solution. The primary containers are equipped with colored polypropylene caps. Cap color depends on the concentration of hemoglobin (Low: red cap; Normal: white cap; High: blue cap). Two bottles of the same level are placed in a plastic blister and packed in a product box together with the combined instructions for use (IFU) and value sheet. Both the primary containers and product box are labeled.

CLSI EP05-A3; Evaluation of Precision Performance of Qualitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline - Third Edition.

CLSI EP25-A; Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents; Approved Guideline

# L. Test Principle:

The absorbance of hemoglobin in the control materials is measured by using a dual wavelength ( $5 0 6 \mathrm { n m }$ and $8 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ) spectrophotometric technology in the HemoCue Hb 301 and HemoCue Hb 801 Systems.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

One lot of control material at three hemoglobin levels was tested on both analyzers - HemoCue Hb 301 System and HemoCue Hb 801 System. The samples were tested with five replicates per analyzer per day over five operating days. Total precision was within the defined acceptance criteria.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability- Shelf Life

Shelf life stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was assessed using control materials of three hemoglobin levels. Three lots of each hemoglobin level were tested with 3–6 replicates per lot per time point. Eight time points between 0 to 127 days were tested on both analyzers - HemoCue Hb 301 System and HemoCue $\mathrm { H b } 8 0 1$ System. Shipping conditions with temperature ranges of either $2 2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or ${ \bf - 1 0 } { \bf - } 3 ^ { \circ } { \bf C }$ were applied on Day 7–14. The study data supported the recommended stability claim of 108 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# In-use stability

In-use stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was assessed using control materials of three hemoglobin levels. Five time points (0, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days) were tested on both analyzers - HemoCue Hb 301 System and HemoCue Hb 801 System. Each hemoglobin level was tested with 2–4 replicates per lot per time point. The study data supported the recommended stability claim of 31 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Expected Values

Three physiologically relevant levels are available:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HemoTrol WBLevel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Target TotalHemoglobin (g/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>130</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>160</td></tr></table>

# Value Assignment

Value assignment is performed for each new lot of HemoTrol WB. Three samples of control materials were evaluated on three HemoCue Hb 801 Systems, with three lots of microcuvettes. Each sample is measured once per microcuvette lot per analyzer, providing 27 replicates. If the 27 measurements are within the acceptance criteria $( 4 \%$ for Normal and $7 \%$ for Low and High), a value range is assigned to the lot as the mean value of these 27 measurements with $\pm 4 \%$ for Normal and $\pm 7 \%$ for Low and High.
