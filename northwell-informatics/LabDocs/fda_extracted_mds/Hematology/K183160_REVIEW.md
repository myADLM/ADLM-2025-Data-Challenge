# I. Device Description:

The TEG 6s Hemostasis System is comprised of the following components: TEG Hemostasis analyzer and TEG 6s Assay Cartridge. The TEG 6s Hemostasis System is intended for in vitro diagnostic use to measure the physical and developmental properties (rate, strength, and stability) of clot formation in a whole blood sample through the oscillating motion of a pendant drop of blood in response to external vibration. As the sample transitions from a liquid state to a gel-like state during clotting, the modulus of elasticity and resonant frequency increase, thus, the analyzer measures these variations in resonant frequency during clotting and lysis. The system output consists of a table of numerical values or graphic representation of the results from the hemostasis process over time.

The TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is used to perform the Citrated Kaolin (CK), Citrated RapidTEG (CRT) and Citrated Functional Fibrinogen (CFF) assays and consists of three independent measurement channels, each pre-filled with the dried reagents. The CK assay channel contains Kaolin and CaCl2, the CRT assay channel contains Kaolin, CaCl2 and Tissue Factor, and the CFF assay channel contains abciximab, Tissue Factor and CaCl2.

CK (Citrated Kaolin) Assay: Kaolin acts as a contact surface activator (intrinsic pathway) which activates Factor XII and platelets and stimulates the reserve clotting ability of a blood sample. Kaolin is combined with CaCl2 to neutralize any sodium citrated in the blood. Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameters Clotting Time (R), the time from the start of the test until in initial fibrin formation, and Clot Lysis (LY30), a measurement of the rate of fibrinolysis 30 minutes after Maximum Clot Strength (MA) is reached.

CRT (Citrated RapidTEG) Assay: In the CRT Assay, the clotting process is accelerated by simultaneously activating the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways using a high concentration of Kaolin and Tissue Factor. Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameter Maximum Clot Strength (MA).

CFF (Citrated Functional Fibrinogen) Assay: In the CFF Assay, the extrinsic pathway is activated using Tissue Factor and inhibits platelet aggregation using abciximab, a platelet inhibitor that binds to GPIIb/IIIa receptors. By excluding the platelet aggregation contribution to clot strength (MA), the assay determines fibrinogen contribution. Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameter Maximum Clot Strength (MA).

# L. Test Principle:

The TEG 6s Hemostasis Analyzer has four independent measurement channels. Each channel consists of a short vertically-oriented injection molded tube (ring) with a diameter of $2 . 5 \mathrm { m m }$ and a length of $4 . 5 \mathrm { m m }$ . The TEG 6s Hemostasis analyzer uses a resonant frequency technology with optic analysis by assessment of clot viscoelasticity through the response to vibrations over the spectrum of frequency. With LED illumination, a detector measures in the vertical motion of the blood meniscus. The resulting motion of the meniscus is monitored optically and recorded by the analyzer to calculate the resonant frequency and the clot’s physical development such as clot rate, strength and stability. To measure the clot strength

with the resonance method, the sample is exposed to a fixed vibration frequency. The frequency leading to resonance is identified and then converted to the TEG system readout. The exact frequencies at which resonance occurs will depend on the clot stiffness and mass of the sample. During coagulation, the stronger clots will have higher resonant frequencies and higher TEG readouts. During fibrinolysis, the clot begins breaking down and the resonant frequencies decrease.

To perform a test, a disposable TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is inserted into the analyzer. Twenty microliters $( 2 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ of whole blood sample ( $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrated whole blood) or control (AQC/LQC) material is added to an entry port on the cartridge and drawn into the cartridge under analyzer control. The amount of the sample drawn into the cartridge is automatically determined by the volume of the blood chambers in the cartridge and is metered into separate analysis channels. Reconstitution of dried reagents within the cartridge is accomplished by moving the sample back and forth through the reagent chambers, under the control of microfluidic valves and pumps within the cartridge. After each sample has been mixed with reagent, it is delivered to three designated test cells where it is monitored for visco-elastic changes due to coagulation. Excess sample material is moved under microfluidic control into an enclosed waste chamber within the cartridge.

In a typical test, blood that has been delivered to the test cell will not clot for several minutes. During this time the sample has no inherent stiffness except that provided by surface tension, and since this remains constant the measured resonant frequencies will not change. During coagulation, however, a clot will bind to the test tube (ring) and the resonant frequency will rise with increasing firmness of the clot. During fibrinolysis, the process is reversed, the clot stiffness and resonant frequencies decrease. The TEG 6s Analyzer collects meniscus motion data, tracks changing resonant frequencies and analyzes the frequency data to provide semiquantitative parameters describing the clot.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

The design of the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is identical to the design of the TEG 6s Citrated Multichannel Cartridge: K, KH, RT, FF Assay Cartridge (formerly named the Citrated Multichannel Cartridge), cleared in K150041. Both cartridges also contain the same reagents. The difference between assay cartridges is the exclusion of the Citrated Kaolin with Heparinase (CKH) assay channel and the addition of the CK-LY30 parameter in the CK Assay for the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge (subject device cartridge). Therefore, CK-LY30 was the only parameter evaluated for the precision, linearity/assay reportable range and stability studies. The performance of the CRT and CFF Assays in addition to the CK-R parameter in the CK Assay for the precision, linearity/assay reportable range and stability studies, were evaluated in K150041.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The CK-LY30 precision study was conducted using sodium citrated whole blood collected from three normal donors. Three sample types (no tPA, low tPA, high tPA) were made for each donor. A tPA working solution was used to create a low tPA blood sample with approximately $5 \%$ lysis and a high tPA blood sample with approximately $22 \%$ lysis. Testing was performed in 12 replicates per sample by three operators, using three reagent lots and 12 analyzers for five days. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ of each set of CK-LY30 values were calculated for each donor per sample (no tPA, low tPA, high tPA) per day. The determination of acceptability was based on the SD or $\% \mathrm { C V }$ .

The reproducibility study was conducted with three normal donors, three lots of cartridges on 36 instruments where all three cartridge lots were used on each instrument. Three sample types (no tPA, low tPA, high tPA) were made for each donor, where six runs per sample type and two replicates per run were performed for five days. To demonstrate precision performance for each sample per donor (no tPA, low tPA, high tPA), the mean, SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for each component of variability were calculated including: within-run, between-operator, between-lot, between-day and total reproducibility. The determination of acceptability was based on the SD or $\% \mathrm { C V }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Shelf-life Stability of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge:

To support the shelf-life stability of the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge, normal donor samples were tested on three different lots of aged cartridges (previously manufactured production lots at 8–10 months, 15–16 months and greater than 25 months) compared to one freshly manufactured lot. At each time period, 15 samples (3 lots, 5 per lot) were tested using a single instrument. The study data support a 24-month shelf-life stability claim for the CK-LY30 parameter when the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

In-Use Stability of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge:

Three lots of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge, at three different time points (0, 2 and 4 hours) were evaluated to support the in-use stability of the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge. Sodium citrated whole blood from normal donors were used and tested on 30 cartridges (per time point per lot), for a total of 90 samples per lot using a single instrument. The assays were tested with different fresh normal donor blood at different storage times. The results from each assay were compared with their corresponding reference ranges. The data support a 2-hour in-use stability claim at room temperature.

# Transport Stability of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge:

The transport simulation study was performed on three lots of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge to simulate transport under stressed conditions. To create the stressed condition, three cartridge lots were stored at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours then placed into four different temperature cycles (temperature ranging from $2 2 \mathrm { - } 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with variation of times (4 hours to 192 hours). The donor sample was collected in sodium citrate anticoagulant and tested with stressed cartridges and non-stressed cartridges (stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The study showed that there was no difference between stressed and non-stressed conditions and the data supported the 7-day stability claim at $2 2 -$ $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Sample Stability:

In order to assess sample stability, five consecutive runs of each of three patient samples (normal, hypo- and hypercoagulable) were tested. Blood samples were tested in quadruplicate at each time point demonstrating no significant sample deterioration within 2 hours after sample collection.

# Expected Values for Controls:

Normal Control: The manufacturer does not provide external normal controls for the TEG 6s Citrated K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge. The manufacturer recommends that laboratories establish their own donor normal controls and may consider the following when establishing control donor groups:

• In accordance with the specimen collection and handling instructions provided in the labeling, collect whole blood from healthy adult donors. • The normal donor should not have taken any medication that is known to affect coagulation and should have prior Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge tests that have fallen within the established normal reference range.

Abnormal control: The manufacturer provides an abnormal QC kit (AQC (abnormal QC), bovine plasma based and LQC (lysis QC), tPA activator). To establish the control reference ranges, three lots of AQC and LQC control material were evaluated including both fresh samples and aged samples (samples challenged with elevated temperatures to stimulate storage lifetime), using two different lots of cartridges, on two different diluent water volumes to stimulate the boundary conditions of the water volume specification. These samples were tested the at two different in-use conditions (one was immediately after reconstitution (15 minutes), the other was 2 hours after reconstitution), at two different sites, with three replicates per testing point. Testing was performed on six analyzers by six operators, over three days, for a total of 216 data points collected. The expected values for the AQC and LQC were established using the non-parametric method, two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI as recommended in CLSI C28- A3c guideline.

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was conducted using one lot of TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge on a single instrument. In this study, one sodium citrated whole blood donor was used to prepare samples with prescribed drugs such as direct oral anticoagulants (FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors: dabigatran, lovenox and rivaroxaban) and antiplatelet drugs (P2Y12 inhibitors: aspirin and ticagrelor). Five concentration levels (including control) were tested in triplicate for each interferent with and without tPA. Hemolyzed and hemodilution samples were also tested in the study. For hemolysis testing, the donor blood was pooled and split into two aliquots (one of which was treated with deionized water to generate hemolyzed condition) and comparing hemolyzed sample vs non-hemolyzed sample. A control sample was tested with each condition in which the blood was not treated with the potential interferent. The study was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2. The study found that hemolysis and hemodilution above $30 \%$ interfere with the CRT-MA parameter and hemodilution above $40 \%$ interferes with the CFF-MA parameter.

The following exogenous interfering substances were evaluated and showed no significant interference up to the specified concentration in whole blood samples collected in $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate anticoagulant collection tubes.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison testing with the predicate device, TEG5000, was conducted at 12 Level I and Level II Trauma Centers in the United States. The study enrolled 474 adult patients (326 males and 149 females), ${ \ge } 1 8$ years of age, admitted for blunt, burn, penetrating and other types of trauma conditions. Blood samples were drawn from Emergency Room, Operating Room or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at time of

admission and used for method comparison. The Injury Severity Score $( \mathrm { I S S } ^ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } )$ was assessed on 371 subjects when all diagnostic procedures have been completed. There was $9 7 . 8 4 \%$ of total subjects (363/371) confirmed with an ISS score greater than or equal to one. These ISS scored subjects were categorized into 4 trauma groups: very severe, serve, moderate and minor. The very severe trauma group consisted of $20 \%$ of the total patients in method comparison and had the $\mathrm { I S S } \geq 2 5$ . The severe trauma group consisted of $1 8 \%$ of total patients and had the $\mathrm { I S S } > 1 5$ and ${ \le } 2 4$ . The moderate trauma group consisted of $2 5 \%$ of total patients and had the $\mathrm { I S S } > 8$ and ${ \le } 1 5$ . The minor trauma group consisted of $3 7 \%$ of total patients and had the ISS ${ < } 8$ . Up to $10 \%$ contrived samples were added (blood samples from normal healthy donors were spiked with dabigatran and ReoPro to create hypocoagulable values for CK-R, CKMA and CFF-MA and tPA was used to create low and high lysis) in the study.

Passing-Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altman Plot were performed. The regression analysis of all sites combined was summarized below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The design of the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge is identical to the design of the TEG 6s Citrated Multichannel Cartridge: K, KH, RT, FF Assay Cartridge (formerly named the Citrated Multichannel Cartridge), cleared in K150041. Both cartridges also contain the same reagents. The difference between assay cartridges is the exclusion of the Citrated Kaolin with Heparinase (CKH) assay channel and the addition of the CK-LY30 parameter in the CK Assay for the TEG 6s Citrated: K, RT, FF Assay Cartridge (subject device cartridge). Therefore, CK-LY30 was the only parameter evaluated for the reference range study. The reference ranges for the CRT-MA, CFF-MA and CK-R parameters were established in K150041 (shown in the table below).

The CK-LY30 reference range was established according to CLSI C28-A3c from 132 apparently healthy individuals (58 males and 74 female), greater than 18 years old with no current or recent history of a bleeding disorder or unexpected extended bleeding episodes at three clinical sites in the U.S. Results from all sites were pooled and reference interval was established by calculating the non-parametric $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $( 2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles). The calculated reference range for CK-LY30 is $0 \%$ to $2 . 6 \%$ .
