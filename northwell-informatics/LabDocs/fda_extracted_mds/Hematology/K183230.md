# INTENDED USE

The OneDraw™ A1C Test System, which consists of the OneDraw Blood Collection Device and the OneDraw A1C Test, is intended to collect capillary blood from the upper arm of individuals 18 years of age or older onto filter (matrix) paper within the collection device by a healthcare professional. Samples are delivered to the laboratory for the quantitative measurement of HbA1c for monitoring the long-term control of blood sugar (glucose) in people with diabetes. Testing performed on samples collected with this device should not be used to diagnose or screen for diabetes. The OneDraw A1C Test System should not be used with neonates.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The OneDraw™ A1C Test System includes the OneDraw Blood Collection Device and the OneDraw A1C Test. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device is a single-use, sterile, capillary blood specimen collection device. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device includes a transport sleeve, accessories, and instructions (OneDraw Blood Collection Device Instructions for Use (IFU)) which are needed to collect, package, and mail the sample to the designated certified clinical laboratory for HbA1c testing, using the OneDraw A1C Test.

The OneDraw Blood Collection Device incorporates lancets to make incisions in the skin and a vacuum to draw blood at the surface of the skin through channels to deposit the blood onto collection and stabilization matrices (matrix strips). The matrix strips are contained within a cartridge which is removed from the device after the draw is complete. The cartridge is then inserted into the transport sleeve which encloses and protects the sample during shipping to the clinical laboratory.

Once the transport sleeve containing the sample is received by the clinical laboratory, one of the dry blood sample matrices is removed. The matrix is then eluted in Beckman Hemolyzing Reagent (BHR) in $2 \mathrm { m L }$ tubes or $2 . 2 \mathrm { m L }$ deepwell plates using an orbital shaker. Next, the sample is diluted in BHR to its final concentration and tested using FDA-cleared Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry Analyzer and A1c reagents, including calibrators, (K120199) per the OneDraw A1C Test IFU.

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

# 3. Linearity

The linearity of the OneDraw A1C Test is established as $4 . 7 0 \mathrm { - } 1 4 . 3 \%$ HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) and in accordance with CLSI-EP6-A, determined the following linear fit, $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 6$ ; $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ .

# 4. Interference

Interference was assessed following EP07-A2. Studies were performed to assess common or known exogenous and endogenous substances that could interfere with the OneDraw A1C Test. The exogenous substances were Acetaminophen, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Ibuprofen, L-ascorbic Acid, Metformin, Glyburide; the endogenous substances were Rheumatoid Factors, Triglycerides, Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated); and Hemoglobin Variants (HbC, HbD, HbE, HbF, and HbS).

Interference was calculated as the difference between (a) measurement of blood specimens with interferent as compared to (b) measurement of control group specimens without interferent. Interference is claimed when the difference is equal to or exceeds $\pm 1 0 \%$ bias from the following substances:

Whole blood containing hemoglobin variants A2 $( \leq 5 . 8 \% )$ , C $: ( \leq 4 0 . 1 \% )$ , D $( \leq 4 1 . 2 \% )$ , E $( \leq 2 2 \% )$ , S $( \leq 3 4 . 8 \% )$ , or low F $( \leq 8 . 5 \% )$ do not show significant interference (over $10 \%$ absolute bias) when spotted on matrix strips were compared to the reference laboratory liquid blood values. The OneDraw A1C Test is suitable for adoption in the laboratory with the appropriate disclosure in the labeling that Hemoglobin Variant HbF (elevated) has been known to interfere with test results. The following limitation is presented in the OneDraw A1C Test labeling (OneDraw A1C Test IFU): “Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. Studies show that there is no significant interference for HbA2 $( \leq 5 . 8 \% )$ , HbC $( \leq 4 0 . 1 \% )$ , HbD $( \leq 4 1 . 2 \% )$ , HbE $( \leq 2 2 \% )$ , and HbS $( \leq 3 4 . 8 \% )$ . Samples containing HbF levels $> 8 . 5 \%$ show a significant negative bias with the OneDraw A1C Test. Do not use this test if the patient has this variant.”

# 5. Limits of Detection

The claimed measuring range is $4 . 7 0 \% - 1 4 . 3 \%$ for the OneDraw A1C Test, which is based on linearity testing.

# 6. Product Stability

In accordance with EP25-A and EP09-A3, the difference in test results using aged OneDraw Blood Collection Devices was evaluated. Four levels of HbA1c covering the measuring range were evaluated. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device has an expiry date 12 months after the date of manufacturing. Sample storage and shipping stability studies were conducted using whole blood spotted on matrix strips. Based on these studies, patient samples are stable for up to 21 days at room temperature. The results also demonstrate that extreme temperature excursions of whole blood spotted onto the matrix strips do not cause a significant difference in the measurement of HbA1c using the OneDraw A1C Test. Overall these studies demonstrate the robustness of the matrices and transport sleeves to ensure that they are able to withstand the stressed conditions experienced during shipping and storage of the sample prior to HbA1c testing.

# 7. Flex Studies

Flex studies were conducted to assess any potential pre-analytical error that could be obtained from blood samples by the testing laboratory. These studies evaluated blood sample acceptability in terms of:

(a) the minimum and maximum blood volume collected onto the device matrix strips   
(b) potential interference of hematocrit with the OneDraw A1C Test   
(c) the equivalency between the two matrix strips from the same cartridge for the OneDraw A1C Test   
(d) a comparison of HbA1c results for the following: o Venous whole blood collected in EDTA tubes with venous whole blood spotted on the matrix strips o Venous whole blood collected in EDTA tubes with capillary blood collected using OneDraw Blood Collection Device o Venous whole blood spotted on the OneDraw matrix strips with capillary blood collected using OneDraw Blood Collection Device

# Results of Flex Studies

(a) For minimum and maximum blood sample acceptability, two (2) HbA1c levels were tested with six (6) blood volumes per level. There were 6 matrix strips per volume of blood, 72 matrix strips in total. This study demonstrated that spotted volumes ranging between $5 2 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and $9 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ were within $\pm 1 0 \%$ relative bias when compared to the corresponding $7 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ spotted samples.

(b) The hematocrit interference study used two (2) HbA1c levels tested with the OneDraw A1C Test, six matrix strips per level: six each of control, or “normal” hematocrit, high hematocrit, and low hematocrit specimens. The study demonstrated that varying hematocrit levels do not interfere with the OneDraw A1C Test.   
(c) The two matrix strips contained within the same cartridge were analyzed and compared. The data demonstrates that there is not a significant difference in $\%$ HbA1c results between the two matrices.   
(d) HbA1c results obtained from dried whole blood spotted on matrix strips and from capillary blood collected with the OneDraw Blood Collection Device are comparable to those collected via the standard phlebotomy technique (venous whole blood through venipuncture).

# CONCLUSION

The information and data in this $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ application demonstrate that the samples collected and tested using the OneDraw A1C Test System result in accurate and precise results that correlate well with current cleared methods. Based on the criteria stated above, this device is found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
