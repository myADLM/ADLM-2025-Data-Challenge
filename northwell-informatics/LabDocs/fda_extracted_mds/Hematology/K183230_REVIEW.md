# L. Test Principle:

The OneDraw Blood A1C Test System is intended to collect capillary blood from the upper arm of adults (18 years of age and older) by a healthcare worker for HbA1c testing in a designated laboratory. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device has a mechanism for skin puncture, a mechanism for drawing blood, a mechanism for stabilizing the blood sample, and can be used for temporary storage and shipping of blood. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device uses two stainless steel lancets to create skin punctures for the collection of capillary blood. When actuated, the device collects the blood sample $( 1 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ via vacuum draw onto two collection and stabilization matrix strips, and provides an indicator to confirm that collection is complete. The user removes the cartridge from the collection device and inserts it into the transport sleeve prior to shipping of the sample. The OneDraw Blood Collection Device is designed for one-time sample extraction. Once the dried blood sample is received by the designated laboratory, one matrix strip is removed from the sample cartridge by trained professionals using forceps and eluted with Beckman HbA1c Hemolyzing Reagent (k120199). Once eluted, the sample is assayed using FDA-cleared A1c reagents on the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry analyzer.

# Operator-to-operator precision

The sponsor evaluated operator-to-operator reproducibility of the sample collection method for the OneDraw A1C Test System at two sites. Representative data for one site is shown below. Three healthcare providers collected two to three upper arm capillary blood samples from each of 25 participants using OneDraw Blood Collection Devices from a single lot for each participant (three collection device lots total) for a total of 71 collections. Samples were shipped to the designated laboratory where they were eluted and tested according to the OneDraw A1C Test instructions for use. $\%$ HbA1c values tested ranged from $4 . 6 6 \%$ to $1 4 . 3 8 \%$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted to establish the linear range of the OneDraw HbA1c Test System. The sponsor evaluated 107 capillary blood samples collected with the OneDraw Blood Collection Device as well as seven additional K2 EDTA venous blood samples obtained commercially and spotted onto the matrix strips. The sponsor provided data to support that venous blood samples did not behave differently from capillary blood samples from the upper arm in this study. The samples covered a range of $4 . 7 6 - 1 4 . 7 \%$ HbA1c. Samples were eluted and measured in singlicate on the Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer at the designated laboratory according to the OneDraw A1C Test instructions for use and the results were compared to results from matched liquid K2 EDTA venous blood samples measured using A1c reagents on the Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer (k120199). A Deming regression was calculated with the following results: $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 6$ ; $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ .

The study supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of $4 . 7 - 1 4 . 3 \%$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

The OneDraw A1C Test System has been certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org. The OneDraw HbA1c Test System is traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Reference Method for Measurement of HbA1c.

# Sample stability

Sample stability study at room temperature of sterilized OneDraw Blood Collection Devices was conducted. The matrix strips were spotted with K2 EDTA venous blood from four donors (5.3, 6.4, 7.9, $1 1 . 5 \%$ HbA1c) and extracted/tested within 30 minutes and at various time points after storage at room temperature up to 21 days. At each time point, samples were compared to test results obtained with fresh samples. The results of the study support the labeling claim of 21 days of room temperature stability for blood samples collected with the OneDraw Blood Collection Device.

# Shelf Life

1. Real-time shelf life stability studies of upper arm capillary blood collection, storage, and HbA1c analysis using aged OneDraw Blood Collection Devices are ongoing. Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for these studies were reviewed and found acceptable to support an initial shelf life claim of 18 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 5 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } { - } 7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$

2. OneDraw Blood Collection Devices (packaged and sterilized) were subjected to accelerated and ongoing real time stability studies. Stability protocols and acceptance criteria for these studies were reviewed and found acceptable to support a shelf life claim of 18 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 5 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } { - } 7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ ).

3. The sponsor evaluated the impact of holding the spring that deploys the lancets in a compressed state over time. New (i.e., never installed) and aged springs were subjected to compression testing. The results of this study support the claimed shelf life of 18 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 5 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } { - } 7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ .

# Shipping

Several stability studies were conducted to assess the performance of the OneDraw A1C Test System to collect and measure quality samples after undergoing simulated extreme shipping and distribution conditions (extreme cold, extreme heat, extreme humidity). Real-time shipping studies are ongoing. The shipping stability study protocols and acceptance criteria of the OneDraw A1C Test System were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The study results support the manufacturer’s claim that the OneDraw A1C Test System can perform as indicated following shipping of the packaged OneDraw Blood Collection Devices.

Additional bench testing evaluated on the candidate device:

The sponsor conducted additional studies to assess the OneDraw Blood Collection Device malfunction rate as well as the effect of draw volume, sample collection time, hematocrit interference, and equivalence of the two matrix strips on OneDraw A1C Test System performance. Results for these studies were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection for the OneDraw HbA1c assay is based on the Beckman HbA1c reagents on the AU480 analyzer (cleared in k120199).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous and exogenous interference was evaluated using K2 EDTA venous whole blood at two $\%$ HbA1c levels $( \sim 5 \% )$ and high $( \sim 1 0 \% )$ spiked with the potentially interfering substances. Each sample and an un-spiked control was spotted onto OneDraw Blood Collection Device matrix strips and then eluted and tested per the OneDraw A1C Test instructions for use. Six replicates were tested. Results for spiked samples were compared to the results from control samples. The sponsor defined significant interference as $> 1 0 \%$ difference between spiked and control samples.

# Hemoglobin Variant Interference

Interference from common hemoglobin variants (HbA2, HbC, HbD, HbE, HbS, HbF) was evaluated based on CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. Four to ten K2 EDTA samples with varying levels of $\%$ HbA1c and hemoglobin variants were spotted onto OneDraw Blood Collection Device matrix strips and eluted and measured in replicates of five or six per the OneDraw A1C Test instructions for use. Test results were compared to $\% _ { \mathrm { { H b A l c } } }$ values obtained with an FDA cleared comparator method free of interference from the respective hemoglobin variant. The sponsor defined significant interference as bias $> \pm 1 0 \%$ . The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that there is no significant interference from hemoglobin variants HbA2 $( \leq 5 . 8 \% )$ , HbC $( \leq 4 0 . 1 \% )$ , HbD $( \leq 4 1 . 2 \% )$ , HbE $( \leq 2 2 \% )$ , and HbS $( \leq 3 4 . 8 \% )$ . Samples containing HbF levels $\leq 8 . 5 \%$ show a significant negative bias with the OneDraw HbA1c Test System.

The labeling contains the following statement:

Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. Studies show that there is no significant interference for HbA2 $( \leq 5 . 8 \% )$ , HbC $( \leq 4 0 . 1 \% )$ , HbD (≤ $4 l . 2 \% )$ , HbE $( \leq 2 2 \% )$ , and HbS $( \leq 3 4 . 8 \% )$ . Samples containing HbF levels $> 8 . 5 \%$ show a significant negative bias with the OneDraw A1C Test. Do not use this test if the patient has this variant.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended a reasonable A1c goal for many non-pregnant adults is $< 7 ~ \%$ $5 3 \mathrm { m m o l / m o l }$ ). Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as $6 . 5 \%$ $\mathrm { . 4 8 \ m m o l / m o l ] } )$ for selected individual patients if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Less stringent A1C goals (such as $- 8 \%$ $\left[ 6 4 \mathrm { m m o l / m o l } \right] )$ ) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular o macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or longstanding diabetes in whom the goal is difficult to achieve despite diabetes selfmanagement education, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin.1
