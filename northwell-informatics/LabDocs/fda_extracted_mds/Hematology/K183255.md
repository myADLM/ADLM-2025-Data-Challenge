# Device Description

The Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System is a portable medical device for the measurement of the Prothrombin Time (PT) using fresh capillary whole blood obtained from a finger stick. The Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System is a hand held device and directly detects clot formation. The System measures the PT of fresh capillary whole blood using micro-mechanical end point detection. The test is performed by inserting a test strip into the meter and applying a drop of blood to the sample receptacle of the disposable test strip. The test strip contains a rotating, spoked wheel that draws the sample into the reaction well after it is applied to the sample receptacle. The spokes rotate across the path of an infrared light beam and mix the liquid sample with the thromboplastin which is dried in the reaction well. When the sample clots, the clot is picked up by the spokes, interrupting the path of the infrared light beam that is detected by the meter.

The PT test and the result is displayed as International Normalized Ratio (INR) and seconds (PT). The result is date/time stamped and stored in the memory of the meter.

The device is powered by batteries and/or AC adapter. This PT/INR System uses the exact same test and control strip as the predicate devices.

# Intended Use / Indications for Use

The testing demonstrates that the subject device has comparable performance to the predicate device. The bench testing performed verifies that the subject Coag-Sense PT/INR Monitoring System meets the specified performance specifications and thus, is substantially equivalent to the predicate device for professional and home use.

# Comparison of Strip Lots

Comparative studies were performed using Coag-Sense strip lots calibrated against various standard laboratory tests. The studies confirmed Coag-Sensetest strips correlate extremely well, with no evidence of any bias across the AMR.

# Comparison to Predicate Device

A side by side comparison study was performed with identical test samples to demonstrate that the performance of the modified Coag-Sense PT/INR meter is equivalent or better than the currently marketed predicate Coag-Sense PT/INR meter. Performance testing confirmed no difference in the results obtained on the modified meter when compared to the predicate device.

The subject Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the cleared predicate (#K050243 and #K093243) with respect to indications for use, intended use, and technological characteristics.

The differences between the subject device and the predicate devices do not raise any new or different issues of safety and effectiveness. Design verification testing confirmed that no new questions of safety or effectiveness were identified during testing, and that the subject CoagSense PT/INR Monitoring System performs as intended.

# Conclusion

Based on the comparative analysis, when considering the intended use, principles of operation, performance characteristics and technological characteristics, the Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System does not introduce any new questions of safety and effectiveness. The minor differences between the subject Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System and the predicate device raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Therefore, the Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
