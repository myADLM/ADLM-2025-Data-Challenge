# VII Device Description:

# A Device Description:

The Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System is a modification to the Immedia Prothrombin Time System cleared for professional use (K050243) and the Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System cleared for patient self-testing (K093243). The hardware and operating system have been upgraded in the modified device to address parts and technology obsolescence, and to address current communications technologies. The modified Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System uses the identical test strip, method of detection, thromboplastin reagent and calibration approach as found in the predicate system. The intended use and technological characteristics remain unchanged from that of the predicate device. The new Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System is available in two formats; one for Professional Use and one for Patient Self-Testing.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System measures the PT of fresh capillary whole blood using micro-mechanical end-point detection. The test is performed by inserting a test strip into the meter and applying a drop of blood to the sample receptacle of the test strip. The disposable test strip contains a rotating, spoked wheel that draws the sample into the reaction well after it is applied to the sample receptacle. The reaction well contains a premeasured and dried quantity of thromboplastin. The wheel spokes rotate across the optical path of an infrared light beam. The spokes mix the patient sample with the reagent. As the patient sample transforms into a solid clot, it is picked up by the continuously-rotating spokes and is carried across the path of the infrared light beam interrupting the beam pattern. The time at which the clot interrupts the light beam is reported as the prothrombin time (PT). The PT seconds result is a true Prothrombin Time (patient’s actual clotting time) and not a calculated value. The INR is calculated from the PT in seconds result, the Mean Normal Prothrombin Time (MNPT) and International Sensitivity Index (ISI) values for the reagent are determined by comparison to a WHO reference preparation.

1. Instrument Name: Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR Monitoring System

2. Specimen Identification:

Patient ID information must be scanned using the optional barcode scanner or manually entered in the meter when prompted.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR test strip is intended for single-use only. Once the test strip is inserted into the meter, a drop of fresh capillary whole blood sample collected by fingerstick is manually applied to the test strip target area and analyzed by the Coag-Sense Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR meter.

# 4. Calibration:

The calibration parameters for each master lot of reagent is obtained during production by calibrating a subset of the test strips against a working International Reference Preparation (IRP) standard traceable to the tilt tube reference method adopted by the World Health Organization.

For each test strip lot, the calibration (MNPT and ISI) information used to convert PT in seconds to INR is conveyed to the meter on a lot specific Near Field Communication (NFC) tag, which is read using a built-in wireless NFC reader on the meter. This tag also contains strip lot expiration date and allowable low and high QC strip plasma clotting time ranges. The NFC Tag is located on the test strip box and is a micro data chip with antenna that contains the required test strip kit information. It allows transmission of the test strip kit information to the meter.

# 5. Quality Control:

High Control and Low Control Strips are provided for user quality control purposes and contain the same thromboplastin reagent as the patient test strips as well as plasma of known INR. The CoaguSense control strips form a clot using actual plasma of known INR and the identical lot of thromboplastin used in the manufacturing of the patient test strips. The process of running this liquid quality control tests the reagents’ ability to generate a clot as well as the analyzer’s ability to detect a clot. Control testing should be completed for each new lot of test strip received.

6. Assay Cut-Off:

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A study was conducted comparing the modified device to the predicate device at a single-site using whole blood from normal subjects not on oral anticoagulation therapy as well as from subjects on oral anticoagulation therapy. To validate the performance of the system across the measuring range, plasma samples ranging from 0.9 to 7.4 INR were also tested.

Test meters representing the predicate device (PT1) and the modified device (PT2) were paired in three sets (PT1 vs. PT2) analyzing identical test samples. The test samples included contrived plasma control samples covering medical decision levels of PT/INR measurements as well as whole blood samples from therapeutic patients and normal subjects (not on warfarin therapy). Plasma samples spanning the INR measuring range of the device (INR 0.9–7.4) were included in the study. Each test sample in this study was tested five times on each meter, for a total of 15 data points for PT1 and 15 data points for PT2.

In addition, whole blood samples were obtained from five different therapeutic patients and five different normal subjects. Three separate fingerstick samples were collected, each fingerstick providing two samples for each set of meters. Bland-Altman bias plots were created to evaluate agreement between the two quantitative measurements. The resulting graph shows the difference between the two paired measurements (PT1 -PT 2) plotted against the average of these measures $( ( \mathrm { P T 1 } { + } \mathrm { P T } 2 ) / 2 )$ ). The analysis demonstrates that the acceptance criteria were met, and the modified device has acceptable bias across samples and INR ranges when compared to the predicate device.

Calibration Comparison: RTF/09 vs. RTF/16

During the clearance of the predicate device (PT1), reagents used in the test and control strips were calibrated against International Reference Preparation (IRP) rTF/09. Due to the phasing out of IRP rTF/09, reagents used in the test and control strips for the modified device (PT2) were calibrated to the current IRP rTF/16. To ensure that the change in IRP did not impact the performance of the modified device, an internal study was conducted to compare strip lots calibrated against rTF/09 against strip lots calibrated against rTF/16. Nine different plasma samples spanning the AMR were used in the study. The samples were tested on both PT1 and PT2 meters using test strips containing reagent that were calibrated using IRP rTF/09 and a current test strip lot containing reagents calibrated using IRP rTF/16. Linear regression and bias analysis demonstrate that the two lots of test strips, rTF/09 and rTF/16, correlate well with acceptable performance across the AMR, and that the modified PT2 meter performs the same as the predicate PT1 meter.

# Comparison to Reference Method

Performance of the Coag-Sense PT/INR Monitoring System (modified device) was evaluated by comparison to the laboratory reference method. Customer conducted correlation studies were performed at six clinical sites using 12 POC operators. A fingerstick sample was

collected from each patient and the capillary whole blood was applied to the Coag-Sense test strip. A venous sample was collected at the same time and sent for testing on the plasmabased Diagnostica Stago analyzer. All Coag-Sense test strips used in these studies were calibrated against IRP rTF/16. A total of 203 patient samples were analyzed across the six sites, including INR values ranging between 0.9–5.1.

The pooled customer data was analyzed using regression analysis; the correlation coefficient (r), slope and intercept were determined for the data set, and graphs of the regression and bias analysis results were generated. The data demonstrate acceptable performance.
