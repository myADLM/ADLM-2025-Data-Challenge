# L. Test Principle:

A semen sample is collected in the supplied collection cup. The sample is left in the cup and allowed to liquefy. After liquefying for 30 minutes, $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of semen sample is loaded into the sample well and the device is activated by moving the Slider forward, whereby the media is pushed into the swim-up chamber. A filter separates the semen from the swim-up compartment, allowing only the PMSCs to swim through the filter. The non-motile cells are retained in the semen compartment.

The swim-up compartment contains $7 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) media with $0 . 0 5 \%$ Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT), a dye staining living cells. The motile cells swimming into the chamber are stained purple by MTT stain. An enzyme in the mitochondria of the motile sperms cleaves the substrate and stains the progressive motile spermatozoa. The test device is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature $1 8 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $6 4 { - } 8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ . During this incubation time the progressive motile sperm swim through the filter and up into the swim-up compartment. After incubation, the Slider of the test device is pulled back and the buffer containing the stained motile sperm are aspirated out of the detection chamber by the syringe and the stained motile sperm are trapped on the detection filter letting the media pass through.

The test result is a color reaction which can be read by comparing the color intensity with the color scale at the result window of the device. The darker the color intensity is, the higher the concentration of PMSCs.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability was determined by analyzing the same sample (PMSCs/mL) repetitively over a short period of time under the same measurement conditions (same device lot/operator/location). Seven different progressively motile sperm concentrations $\mathrm { ( P M S C s / m L ) }$ ) covering the measuring range of the test were included. Semen samples were pooled from sperm donors and diluted in autologous semen

plasma to the following concentrations: 0 M, 1.9 M, 4.1 M, $6 . 2 \mathrm { M } .$ , 8.4 M, $1 0 . 1 { \mathrm { M } }$ and $9 7 . 2 \mathrm { M P M S C s / m L }$ , as determined by manual microscopy. The table below provides a summary of the overall repeatability study results:

Reproducibility was evaluated by analyzing the same sample with changes in the conditions (different operators/lots/locations and time points). Due to the instability of fresh semen samples, a modified precision study was conducted. Seven different samples at two timepoints (30 minutes and 60 minutes after collection) were analyzed. The following concentrations were tested based on manual microscopy: 0 M, $1 . 7 \mathrm { M }$ , $3 . 9 1 4$ , $6 . 2 \mathrm { M }$ , $9 . 1 \mathrm { { M } }$ , $1 1 . 4 \mathbf { M }$ and $1 1 6 . 5 \mathrm { M P M S C s / m L }$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Accelerated Stability

An accelerated stability study was conducted to demonstrate that the performance of the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test was not significantly impacted after 20 weeks with storage at $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (corresponding to 3 years of storage at room temperature). A semen sample containing $4 0 \mathrm { M P M S C s / m L }$ as determined by manual microscopy, was measured on two freshly produced SwimCount devices and six SwimCount devices stored at $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 20 weeks. The six SwimCount devices contained three different lots and each lot was tested in duplicate. Paired t-test was used to determine if the test results were significantly different for the devices stored at $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ compared to freshly produced control devices. Results from the accelerated stability study demonstrate that there are no significant differences in the SwimCount results of the devices stored at $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 20 weeks compared to freshly produced devices, supportive of a 3-year real time shelf-life claim.

# Real Time Stability

In addition to the accelerated stability study, the shelf-life stability claim was further supported by performance studies using SwimCount device lots from the first production batch (July 2015). Three different lots were used in the precision study, detection limit study, and pre-condition study. The complete, fully assembled devices were stored at $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with humidity ranges of 20–65 RH (relative humidity). The temperature and humidity for each lot of SwimCount devices was recorded at the beginning of every month for 43 months. Results from the various performance studies and pre-condition study demonstrate that the device lots stored for 3 or more years at the time of testing showed no difference in performance compared to newly produced SwimCount devices. Stability testing results demonstrate that the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test is stable for 3 years at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Transportation Test

A transportation study was conducted to evaluate the stability of the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test during transport. The devices were shipped in two different ways:

1) Simulating shipping from manufacturer directly to end-user in padded envelopes (one device per envelope). 2) Shipping in cardboard boxes to the distributors (may include several devices).

SwimCount Sperm Quality Test kits were packed in padded envelopes and cardboard boxes and transported by a shipping company from one domestic address to another. Upon arrival at the final shipping destination, the boxes were inspected visually for damage and the findings were documented, including photographs. In addition to the visual inspection, the function of the SwimCount device was tested. The test devices were examined for functionality by testing on sperm samples with known concentrations of $\mathrm { P M S C s / m L }$ and compared to devices, that have not been transported. Eight SwimCount Sperm Quality Test devices were tested, four devices with 2.5 M PMSCs/mL and four devices with 8.3 M PMSCs/mL.

# Pre-Conditioning

To evaluate whether different climate conditions encountered during distribution have an effect on device performance, a simulation of different climate conditions was tested. The SwimCount device was “pre-conditioned” for 6 hours at laboratory ambient conditions, followed by the highest and lowest temperature and humidity extremes expected during normal transportation. These conditions were simulated by placing the SwimCount devices in an incubator and freezer. Three test devices were used for each condition and compared to controls stored at room temperature. Semen samples containing $3 . 5 { } \mathrm { M }$ PMSCs/mL and $7 . 5 \mathrm { M P M S C s / m L }$ were tested to examine potential additive/reductive impact.

The three environments and durations tested are illustrated in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Environment</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Time</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Temperature</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Relative Humidity(RH)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Frozen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>72 hours</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-29°Celsius(-20°F)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25-35%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tropical</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>72 hours</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38°Celsius(100°F)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>85% RH</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Desert</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>72 hours</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50°Celsius(120°F)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25-35%</td></tr></table>

Results for the pre-conditioning test met acceptance criteria. It was concluded that the the performance of the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test was not affected by frozen, tropical, and desert conditions that may be encountered during distribution, up to the limits tested.

# Sample Stability

The stability of semen samples was evaluated on the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test by analyzing seven different samples at three timepoints (30 minutes, 60 minutes, and

90 minutes after collection). The following concentrations were tested based on manual microscopy: 0 M, 1.7 M, 3.9 M, 6.2 M, 9.1 M, $1 1 . 4 \mathbf { M }$ and $1 1 6 . 5 \mathrm { M }$ PMSCs/mL. No change in the PMSC concentration was observed at 30 minutes and 60 minutes after collection of the semen sample. Results from the sample stability study demonstrate that the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test provides accurate results for semen samples up to one hour after collection.

# d. Detection limit:

To determine the detection limit of the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test, five semen samples were prepared from a pool of donor semen diluted in seminal plasma to the following concentrations: $3 . 9 1 \mathrm { { \sf M } }$ , 4.0 M, 5.0 M, $6 . 0 \mathrm { M }$ , and $6 . 2 \mathrm { M P M S C s / m L }$ , as determined by manual microscopy. The preparations and counting were performed by one operator. A second operator tested the blinded samples on the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test and read the results. Each concentration was tested in 40 replicates. The 4.0 M PMSCs/mL, 5.0 M PMSCs/mL and 6.0 M PMSC/mL concentrations were tested on two SwimCount lots for a total of 80 replicates per concentration/sample. The detection limit study results are shown in the table below.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The potential interference of various substances on SwimCount results was evaluated by testing elevated concentrations of the following:

Testing was performed in triplicate. Each potential interfering substance was spiked into semen samples from vasectomized men (containing semen plasma only) to investigate any additive effect of interfering substance. Each substance was also spiked into semen samples containing approximately $2 0 \mathbf { M }$ PMSCs/mL to investigate any negative effect.

Results from the study identified urine, RBCs and WBCs as substances that may interfere with the test. All other tested substances caused no interference with the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A multi-center clinical study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test as compared to manual sperm counting by manual microscopy (reference method). Semen samples were obtained from men seeking fertility treatment or from sperm donors. A total of 323 semen samples across four sites were included in the study. All semen samples were analyzed using Makler counting chambers and conventional microscopy and compared to the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test.

Out of the 323 semen samples included in the study, 15 samples were excluded resulting in a net total of 308 samples analyzed. The 15 samples were excluded for the following reasons: four men did not fulfill the criteria of a $^ { < 2 }$ days abstinence period, one man was diagnosed with globozospermia, one with hematospermia, five with leucospermia, two samples contained $< 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ semen and two samples were too viscous to be applied into the SwimCount Sperm Quality Test.
