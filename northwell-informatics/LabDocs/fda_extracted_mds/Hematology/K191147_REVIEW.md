# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The OC-Auto Sensor io iFOB Test is intended for the qualitative detection of fecal occult blood in feces. The test system is comprised of an automated analyzer, reagents, and sample collection bottles. Specific information regarding each component is provided below:

• OC-Auto Sensor io iFOB Test System analyzer: The analyzer measures optical change. The absorbance increases in proportion to HbA0 concentration in the sample due to latex agglutination as a result of antigen-antibody (latex labeled) reaction. The analyzer determines the calibration curve from calibrators of known concentrations and measures HbA0 in the sample based on the calibration curve. The analyzer can be operated by selecting the icons displayed on the operation panel, following the instruction manual. The analyzer contains following components: OC-sensor io main body, power cord, purified water bottle, wash solution bottle, substitute wash solution bottle, substitute buffer bottle, drain tank, sample rack, paper, drain tube, elbow, L-joint, fuse, instruction manual, and rack bar code label.

Latex reagent: The Latex Reagent contains polystyrene latex particles sensitized with polyclonal antibodies to human hemoglobin (i.e. anti-human HbA0 antibodies). One vial contains $7 \mathrm { m L }$ of reagent.

Diluent buffer: One vial contains $2 0 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of buffer with $2 . 3 8 \ \mathrm { g }$ of HEPES (N-2- Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N’-2-ethanesulfonic acid).

Wash concentrate: Aqueous detergent capable of dissolving protein deposits within the fluid path during the cleaning routine. The wash concentrate contains $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of a concentrated wash and each $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ is diluted to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ prior to use. The final wash solution concentration contains less than $5 \%$ sodium hypochlorite.

Calibrator: Contains $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $1 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ purified hemoglobin (i.e. HbA0 derived from human blood) in buffer. The Calibrator is serially diluted prior to analysis with diluent buffer to construct a calibration curve.

Positive control: Contains $5 \mathrm { m L }$ of purified hemoglobin (i.e. HbA0 derived from human blood) targeted around $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (LV1) and $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (LV2) in buffer.

Negative control: Contains $1 \mathrm { m L }$ of buffer.

Sampling bottle: Plastic bottle for collecting fecal sample which contains $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of extraction buffer.

# B Principle of Operation:

The principle of measurement employed for the reagent system is latex agglutination. A latex agglutination reaction is the clumping of antigen- or antibody-sensitized polystyrene latex particles through an antigen-antibody reaction. When anti-human hemoglobin A0 (HbA0) antibody is attached to the polystyrene latex particle and the prepared latex is added to the sample in the cell and agitated, the antigen-antibody reaction starts, and the particle begins to agglutinate. If this agglutination is measured as optical change, the absorbance increases in proportion to HbA0 concentration in the sample. A light beam passes through the reaction liquid to measure changes in the intensity of the transmitted light beam (latex turbidimetry), and changes in the intensity of the scattered light beam (latex nephelometry). Latex turbidimetry is used to measure the amount of an antigen or an antibody by measuring changes in scattered light rays in latex agglutination.

1. Instrument Name:

OC-Auto Sensor io iFOB Test

2. Specimen Identification:

The feces samples are collected into the sampling bottles, each of which includes a barcode. When analyzing, the barcode reader in the equipment automatically reads the sampling bottle barcode.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Patients collect feces from the sample collection paper or from specimen caught in a clean cup. Contamination from toilet water should be avoided. The collection steps include:

(1) Fill in all required information on the sampling bottle. Open green cap by turning to the left and pulling upwards.   
(2) Randomly scrape the surface of the fecal sample with the sample probe. Cover the grooved portion of the sample probe completely with stool sample.   
(3) Close sampling bottle by inserting the sample probe and screwing cap on tightly to the right. The sampling bottle contains $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of extraction buffer. Do not reopen. Return the sample device to doctor or laboratory in mailing envelope.

4. Calibration:

Calibration can be operated both automatically or manually by the operator. A new calibration curve must be created under the following conditions: (1) a new lot of latex reagent (2) the value of OC-Control is not within the indicated range (3) opened latex reagent is left onboard for more than seven days (4) after maintenance.

5. Quality Control:

Positive Control: Contains $5 \mathrm { m L }$ of purified hemoglobin targeted around $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ in buffer. This product utilizes human hemoglobin which is derived from human blood. The blood is tested for HBs antigens and HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) antibodies, and only blood that tests negative is used. Other viruses or pathogens were not tested and may be present. Therefore, when using these reagents, handle them with the same degree of caution as patient samples.

Negative Control: Contains 1 mL of buffer.

The study was performed using three reagent sets with 21 replicates per test. Each reagent set includes different lots of latex reagent, buffer, calibrator, one negative control, and two positive controls.

The closed bottle reagent stability study was conducted at two temperatures (2 and $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) over 13 months (tests on months 0, 6, 12, and 13). The reagents were determined to be stable for 12 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ when unopened.

The stability study for latex reagent of open bottle onboard was conducted at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ over 8 days (tests on days 0, 4, 7, and 8). The latex reagent was determined to be stable for 7 days at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ when left open onboard.

# Calibrator Stability

For calibrator stability study, the calibrator was diluted with five dilution folds: 0, 2, 5, and 20 (target concentrations 1000, 500, 200, and $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). The calibrator stability study was performed using three reagent sets with three replicates per test. Each reagent set includes different lots of latex reagent, buffer, calibrator, one negative control, and two positive controls. The study was conducted at two temperatures (2 and $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) over 19 months (tests on months 0, 6, 12, and 13). The calibrators were determined to be stable for 12 months at $2 -$ $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

# Control Stability

For control stability study, one negative and two positive controls (approximate Hb concentrations 150 and $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ ) were tested. The control stability study was performed using three reagent sets with three replicates per test. Each reagent set includes different lots

Wash buffer stability Wash buffer stability was established in submissions K041408 and K092330.

Value assignment

Value assignment is performed for each new lot of calibrator. The target calibrator concentration is $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . For each lot of calibrator, three bottles were diluted by dilution buffer with four dilution folds: 0, 2, 5, and 20 (target concentrations 1000, 500, 200, and 50 $\mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ . The values of diluted calibrator samples were measured using three lots of latex reagents and one lot of buffer with five replicates. The concentration of each calibrator sample was calculated by multiplying the measured concentration of the diluted sample and the according dilution factor. The calibrator concentration is determined as the average of all calibrator concentrations. The calibrator will be released if the concentration is $1 0 0 0 \pm 3 0$ $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Value assignment is performed for each new lot of positive controls. The target concentrations of the two positive controls are $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (LV1) and $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (LV2). For each lot of controls, the values were measured by using three lots of latex reagents and one lot of buffer with five replicates. The positive controls will be released if the concentrations were $1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } \pm 1 1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (LV1) and $4 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } \pm 3 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (LV2).

Prozone effect (Hook effect)   
To determine the possible hook effect of OC-Auto Sensor io iFOB test, one hemoglobin negative stool sample was spiked with freeze-dried internal hemoglobin standard to achieve hemoglobin concentration $5 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . This high concentration sample is then diluted to concentrations 975, 1953, 3906, 7813, 15625, 31250, 62500, 125000, and $2 5 0 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each concentration was measured with three reagent lots in three replicates.

It was determined that OC-Auto Sensor io iFOB test is not susceptible to prozone/hook effect up to a hemoglobin concentration of $1 9 5 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . “OR” (over range) or “PR” (prozone range) is displayed when the measurement value is above $1 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .
