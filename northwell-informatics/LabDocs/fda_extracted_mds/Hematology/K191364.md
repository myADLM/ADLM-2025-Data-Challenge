Device Name T-TAS 01 System with PL chip

Indications for Use (Describe)

The T-TAS 01 Instrument is intended for use with T-TAS reagent chips in the clinical laboratory.

The T-TAS 01 PL chip is intended for use in the clinical laboratory for the analysis of the platelet thrombus formation process (primary hemostatic function) in patients age 21 and older with a history of conditions associated with impaired primary hemostatic function or use of antiplatelet therapy. The test uses BAPA-anticoagulated whole blood specimens to measure platelet adhesion to a thrombogenic collagen-coated surface and aggregation, which causes an increase in flow pressure inside the PL chip. The test measures primary hemostatic function as the area under the pressure-time curve (AUC), with AUC $< 2 6 0$ suggesting abnormal primary hemostatic function. Additional testing may be necessary to identify the cause(s) of abnormal primary hemostatic function. The test has been evaluated in patients taking antiplatelet therapy, in patients with von Willebrand disease, and in patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. Other primary hemostasis disorders have not been evaluated.

The BAPA tube for T-TAS 01 is intended to be used for the collection, transport, and storage of blood specimens for use with the T-TAS 01 system.

# Device Description:

The T-TAS 01 system is an in vitro diagnostic device that is comprised of tabletop instrument controlled by a dedicated PC and a disposable, single-use flow chamber. The PL Chip for T-TAS 01 is designed to specifically measure platelet thrombus formation (PTF) under physiological conditions on a collagen-coated analytical path consisting of 26 microcapillary channels. Platelet thrombus formation is a direct indicator of the patient's primary hemostatic function. The assay is performed under arterial flow conditions using benzylsulfonyl-D-Arg-Pro-4-amidinobenzylamide (BAPA)-anticoagulated whole blood samples. BAPA is an anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, blocking the coagulation cascade and allowing the PL assay to specifically measure only the platelet thrombus formation process (primary hemostasis). During the assay, the blood sample is exposed to arterial shear stresses at ${ \mathsf { 1 } } , { \mathsf { 5 0 0 5 } } ^ { - 1 }$ in the presence of a collagencoated surface, which causes platelet attachment to collagen mediated by von Willebrand factor (vWF), and platelet activation. Platelet activation causes the release of endogenous factors contained within the platelets that recruit and activate other platelets and cause aggregation, and platelet thrombus formation. The growing platelet thrombus causes occlusion of the microcapillary channels, which increases the flow pressure within the assay chip. The process of platelet thrombus formation in the flow chamber is continuously monitored by a pressure sensor that tracks pressure changes in the flow path. Results are

calculated automatically within 10 minutes or when the pressure a reading reaches $6 0 \mathsf { k P a }$ above the baseline pressure, whichever occurs first. Results are displayed as AUC, which is the area under the flow pressure curve over 10 minutes.

AUC results less than 260 are associated with abnormal primary hemostatic function.

# Intended Use/Indications for Use:

The T-TAS 01 Instrument is intended for use with T-TAS reagent chips in the clinical laboratory.

The T-TAS 01 PL chip is intended for use in the clinical laboratory for the analysis of the platelet thrombus formation process (primary hemostatic function) in patients age 21 and older with a history of conditions associated with impaired primary hemostatic function or use of antiplatelet therapy.

# Summary of Non-clinical Data:

# Precision:

Assay precision was evaluated using three operators, three T-TAS 01 instruments, and three PL chip lots. BAPA-anticoagulated whole blood specimens collected from one control donor and two donors taking aspirin were tested. The blood specimens had AUC results representing specimens with normal primary hemostatic ability (High), abnormal primary hemostatic ability (Low), and hemostatic ability near the assay cutoff (Middle). The results were within the specification of $C \vee \leq 1 5 \%$ or $S D \le 3 9$ and are summarized below.

Between-site reproducibility was also studied by performing 5 replicate PL assay measurements per day over 5 days at each of three different locations using BAPA-anticoagulated whole blood samples from four donors. The donors included a healthy control donor and three donors taking aspirin therapy that had high, middle, and low AUC results similar to the precision study. All results within each day of tested were within the specification of $C \vee \le 1 5 \%$ or $S D \le 3 9$ .

# Assay Interference:

The following substances were tested for their ability to interfere with the PL assay AUC result and did not significantly affect the AUC results when present at the plasma concentrations indicated.

Cilostazol, dipyridamole, ibuprofen, and tirofiban are all known to reduce platelet activity, and cause a dose-dependent reduction in AUC result. The maximum tirofiban concentration without interference was not determined.

Hemodilution up to $20 \%$ and under-filling of the BAPA collection tube up to $50 \%$ did not significantly affect PL assay AUC results.

# Stability Studies:

Stability of the T-TAS 01 PL assay chip and stability of BAPA-anticoagulated blood samples were evaluated using fresh blood samples collected from healthy control donors and donors taking aspirin. PL assay chip stability was evaluated using an isochronous design. Stability of the BAPA tube was determined by measuring the fill volume over time according to CLSI standard GP39-A6.

Closed pouch PL chip stability: 12 months from the date of manufacture $\textcircled { \alpha } 2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ Open pouch PL chip stability: 8 hours $@$ ambient temperature $( 2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } )$ BAPA tube stability: 10 months from the date of manufacture $@$ ambient temperature $( 1 5 - 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ BAPA-anticoagulated blood sample stability: 6 hours $@$ ambient temperature $( 2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } )$

# Summary of Clinical Data:

# Reference Interval:

The AUC reference interval for the T-TAS 01 PL assay is 270.0 – 447.7.

The reference interval was determined from the 5th to 95th percentile (central $90 \%$ ) of AUC results obtained from PL assay measurements at three clinical sites using a population of 142 individuals (96 females, 46 males, age $3 8 . 0 \pm 1 1 . 3 $ years) without a history of inherited or acquired platelet dysfunction, and without laboratory evidence of von Willebrand disease. PL assay AUC results were not influenced by age, gender, ethnicity, or race.

# Clinical Performance:

Sensitivity and negative agreement of the PL assay for detecting conditions associated with associated with abnormal primary hemostatic function were calculated from data obtained from a total of 274 subjects enrolled at a total of 6 investigational sites. Negative agreement was calculated using PL assay results from healthy donors confirmed to have normal primary hemostatic function because they did not have laboratory evidence or prior diagnosis of disorders affecting primary hemostatic function, nor were they taking medications that affect primary hemostatic function. Sensitivity was calculated using PL assay results from the following patient groups with conditions associated with impaired primary hemostatic function: subjects taking antiplatelet therapy (81 mg aspirin monotherapy and dual antiplatelet therapy), subjects diagnosed with von Willebrand disease, and subjects diagnosed with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. Within the vWD patient group, 12 patients had vWD type 1, 10 patients had vWD type 2, and 3 patients had vWD type 3.

Von Willebrand disease severity can be highly variable, particularly in Type 1 vWD, and patients with mild vWD may not present with clinically significant bleeding. Within the vWD patient group, abnormal PFA-100 Col/EPI and Col/ADP demonstrated sensitivity that was similar to the PL assay $8 0 \%$ , $[ 9 5 \% 0 0 ] 6 1 { - } 9 0 \% ]$ ) and there was excellent overall agreement between the PL assay and PFA-100 assay (overall $8 8 \%$ [69-97%], percent positive agreement $72 \%$ $[ 5 1 - 8 8 \% ]$ , percent negative agreement $100 \%$ $[ 4 0 - 1 0 0 \% ]$ ). All 7 of the vWD patients with AUC results above 260 had either normal PFA-100 results or vWF antigen, vWF activity, and FVIII:C results that were all higher than levels considered to be strongly associated with vWD $( 3 0 \% )$ .

# Conclusions:

The data and information provided in this submission demonstrate that the T-TAS 01 System with PL chip is at least as safe and as effective as the legally marketed predicate device, therefore supporting a substantial equivalence determination.
