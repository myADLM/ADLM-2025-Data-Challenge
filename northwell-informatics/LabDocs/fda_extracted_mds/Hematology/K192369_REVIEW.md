# II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission:

Addition of fingerstick capillary whole blood sample claim to the previously cleared PixoTest POCT System – PixoTest POCT Analyzer and PixoTest A1c Test Kit (k181915)

B Measurand: Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)   
C Type of Test: Quantitative Immunoassay

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The PixoTest POCT System, consisting of PixoTest POCT Analyzer and PixoTest A1c Test Kit, is used for the quantitative measurement of glycated hemoglobin (%HbA1c) in fingerstick capillary and venous whole blood samples. It is an in-vitro diagnostic system intended to monitor long term glycemic control in individuals previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.

The PixoTest POCT System is intended for clinical laboratory and Point-of-Care Professional use. It is not intended for use in the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes and is not intended for use on neonates.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

This test should not be used in monitoring daily glucose control and should not be used to replace daily home testing of urine and blood glucose levels. This test should not be used for analyzing samples from patients with conditions causing shortened red blood cell survival, such as hemolytic diseases, pregnancy and significant acute or chronic blood loss. For professional use in clinical laboratory and point-of-care settings. This test is not intended for use in the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes. This test is not intended for use on neonates. For in-vitro diagnostic use only. If the total hemoglobin result is outside the range of $\mathrm { 7 - 2 3 g / d L }$ , the test result could be inaccurate.   
• Collect venous whole blood using K2-EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium heparin or sodium fluoride tubes only. Do not use tubes with any other anticoagulants. Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. The results from the PixoTest POCT System show that there is no significant interference for samples containing Hemoglobin C $: ( \leq 3 6 \% )$ , Hemoglobin D $( \leq 4 1 \% )$ , Hemoglobin E $( \leq 2 8 \% )$ , Hemoglobin S (≤ $40 \%$ ), Hemoglobin F $( \leq 1 9 \% )$ , and Hemoglobin A2 $( < 6 . 5 \% )$ .

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

PixoTest POCT Analyzer

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The iXensor PixoTest POCT System consists of the following components:

1) PixoTest POCT Analyzer, including • PixoHealth POCT A1c App • USB Charger • USB Type C Charge Cable • PixoTest POCT Calibration Card • Instructions for Use

2) PixoTest A1c Test Kit, including

• PixoTest A1c Test Strips Spoits (to acquire $5 \mu \mu$ blood sample by capillary action and to mix blood and buffer together) with Latex-Tablets (containing blue dyed latex micro particles conjugated to specific antibodies for detection of HbA1c) Buffer Solution Tubes   
Instructions for Use

# B Principle of Operation:

The PixoTest A1c Test kit uses an anti-HbA1c antibody which is specific for the first few amino acid residues of the glycated N-terminus of the ß-chain of hemoglobin A0. When whole blood is added to the buffer solution tube and mixed with the spoit, the erythrocytes are instantly lysed to release the glycated hemoglobin (hereafter, HbA1c). When sample mixture is loaded onto the sample port of the test panel, the mixture fluid migrates along the membrane of the test panel by capillary action, and the HbA1c is then immobilized onto the anti-HbA1c antibody coated line. The amount of the blue conjugates on the anti-HbA1c line reflects the amount of HbA1c in the sample. The intensity of hemoglobin color from the desired area on the membrane of test panel is measured. Chemical and immune reaction that occurs on the test strip is measured by the optical system in PixoTest POCT Analyzer. This system measures both fractions and uses an algorithm to convert the result into the percentage HbA1c in the sample.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was conducted at three point of care sites with three intended use operators at each site. Fingerstick capillary whole blood samples from 158 subjects were collected and tested in singlicate with the PixoTest POCT System using one lot of PixoTest A1c Test Kits per site (three lots total). The results obtained with the PixoTest POCT System were compared to the results obtained for paired K2-EDTA anticoagulated venous blood

samples measured with the TOSOH G7 comparative method (k011434). The range of HbA1c tested was $4 . 8 \%$ to $1 3 . 0 \%$ as determined by the TOSOH G7 method. Results of the linear regression analysis are shown below. A usability assessment completed by all intended use operators did not reveal any difficulties with using the device.
