A. Device Description:

# BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16), Novocastra Liquid Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Progesterone Receptor Clone 16 (Concentrated Liquid Antibody Format)

Progesterone Receptor Clone (16) or PR (16) is a mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody produced as a tissue culture supernatant and supplied in Tris buffered saline with carrier protein containing $0 . 3 5 \%$ ProClin 950 as preservative. This antibody is utilized to perform a qualitative IHC assay to identify Progesterone Receptor (PR) expression in human breast cancer tissue routinely processed and paraffin-embedded for histological examination. There are two configurations of the RTU antibody: $7 \mathrm { m L }$ and $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ .

PR (16) Primary Antibody is provided in a Ready-to- Use (RTU) and a concentrated liquid format. The RTU format is supplied in Tris buffered saline with carrier protein, containing $0 . 3 5 \%$ $\mathrm { P r o C l i n ^ { T M } } 9 5 0$ as a preservative and is provided in two volumes (7 mL and $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ). The total protein concentration is approximately $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ and the total antibody concentration is greater than or equal to $1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ as determined by ELISA. The RTU format is optimally diluted for use on the automated BOND-MAX and BOND-III instrument staining platforms in combination with BOND Polymer Refine Detection kit. The concentrated liquid format is for manual staining protocols.

The concentrated liquid antibody format is a liquid tissue culture supernatant containing $1 5 \mathrm { m M }$ sodium azide as a preservative. The total protein concentration is determined on a per batch basis and is described on the vial label, and the antibody concentration is greater than or equal to $3 2 4 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ as determined by ELISA.

# BOND-III Instrument

The BOND-MAX and BOND-III instruments are fully automated slide stainers that perform automated deparaffinization (dewaxing), antigen retrieval, IHC staining/in situ hybridization (ISH) staining, and counterstaining. The major components of the BOND staining platforms are the processing module, computer (BOND controller), handheld ID scanner, and slide label printer. The BOND staining platforms are composed of a number of discrete software components including the BOND

application software, BOND instrument/processing module software, BOND service software, and Laboratory interface system - integration package (LIS-IP).

# B. Principle of Operation:

Immunohistochemical techniques are used to demonstrate the presence of antigens in tissue and cells. The recommended staining protocol for PR (16) primary antibody is IHC Protocol F: Heat induced epitope retrieval is recommended using Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 for 20 minutes. Bond Polymer Refine Detection utilizes a novel controlled polymerization technology to prepare polymeric HRP-linker antibody conjugates.

Bond Polymer Refine Detection works as follows:

The specimen is incubated with hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.   
Bond RTU Primary Antibody PR (16) is applied.   
A post primary antibody solution enhances penetration of the subsequent polymer reagent   
A poly-HRP anti-mouse/rabbit IgG reagent localizes the primary antibody.   
The substrate chromogen, $^ { 3 , 3 ^ { \circ } - }$ diaminobenzidine (DAB), visualizes the complex via a brown precipitate.   
Hematoxylin (blue) counterstaining allows the visualization of cell nuclei using Bond Polymer Refine Detection in combination with the automated BOND-MAX system reduces the possibility of human error and inherent variability resulting from   
individual reagent dilution, manual pipetting and reagent application.

# b. Between-day repeatability

The between-day study involved testing of sectioned slides from 27 unique FFPE breast tumor tissue specimens. The slides consisted of 13 PR negative specimens, 14 PR positive specimens including 5 PR low positive tissue specimens ( $1 \%$ staining). The study was conducted using three BOND-III instruments at one laboratory-testing site. One sectioned slide from each unique breast tumor tissue case (total 27) and three tissue control slides, one per Slide Staining Assembly (SSA) were stained with Lot 1 on Days 1 and 2, Lot 2 on Days 3 and 4, and Lot 3 on Days 5 and 6 on a single BOND-III instrument. Each unique breast tissue case was also stained using 2 additional instruments such that the lots and days tested were varied. BOND-III instrument has 30 slide positions allowing for 9 unique cases and a tissue control to be run on each SSA and for all 27 cases to be stained in a single run. Each day a single case was stained 3 times, once on each of the three instruments. In total, using 3 SSAs per instrument and 3 instruments, 486 measurements were generated (3 instruments x 3 SSAs x 9 slides ${ \textbf { \em X 6 } }$ days) .

Acceptance Criteria for between-days, between-instruments, between lots, between pathologists and between laboratories studies are as follows:

The Overall Agreement (OA), Positive Agreement (PA) and Negative Agreement (NA), shall be $8 5 \%$ of the lower bound of the two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI when the following sources of potential variability are studied: between-days, between-instruments, between-lots, between-pathologists and between-laboratories.

# d. Between-lot repeatability

The between-lot study involved testing of sectioned slides from 27 unique FFPE breast tumor tissue specimens. The slides consisted pf 13 PR negatives, 14 PR positives $( > 1 0 \%$ staining) including 5 PR low positive tissue specimens ( $1 - 1 0 \%$ staining). The study was conducted using three BOND-III instruments at one laboratory-testing site. One sectioned slide from each unique breast tumor tissue case (total 27) and three tissue control slides (one per SSA) were stained with Lot 1 on Days 1 and 2, Lot 2 on Days 3 and 4, and Lot 3 on Days 5 and 6 on a single BOND-III instrument. Each unique breast tissue case was also stained using 2 additional instruments such that lots and days tested varied. BOND-III instrument has 30 slide positions allowing for 9 unique cases and a tissue control to be run on each SSA and for all 27 cases to be stained in a single run. Each day a single case was stained 3 times, once on each of three instruments. In total, using 3 SSAs per instrument and 3 instruments, 486 measurements were generated (3 instruments x 3 SSAs x 9 slides x 6 days).

# Reproducibility Studies

The purpose of the reproducibility study was to generate data in support of the validation of the Leica BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16) on the BOND-III instrument at one internal laboratory-testing site and two external laboratory-testing sites in the US. The study assessed the following potential sources of assay variability for the BOND Readyto-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16) on the BOND-III Instrument:

Between-pathologist reproducibility Between-laboratory reproducibility

The reproducibility panel consisted of slides from 135 cases. Each site stained 1 slide from each of the 135 cases, totaling 405 slides combined. Each slide was read by each of 3 pathologists, totaling 1215 readings combined. Each pathologist (1 per site), read slides from all 3 sites (i.e., each pathologist read a slide from the same case 3 times).

Inter-pathologist study: The concordance between pairs of pathologists (Pathologist 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3 and 2 vs. 3) was calculated by Overall Percent Agreement (OPA) and Average Negative Agreement (ANA). Negative and positive percent agreements (NPA, PPA), were weighted as per their marginal totals. Nonparametric bootstrap methods were used to calculate the confidence interval for APA and ANA to preserve the correlation structure of the pair.   
• Inter-laboratory study: A similar concordance analysis between pairs of laboratorytesting sites (Site 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3 and 2 vs. 3) was carried out for 135 cases with 3 slides per case totaling 405 slides combined.

5. Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The original stability studies on BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16), $7 \mathrm { m L }$ , were submitted in K062615. The sponsor submitted the continued stability studies on the existing $7 \mathrm { m L }$ , and the additional stability studies and justification on the new $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ configuration, including real-time, transport, in use and cut section stability studies in Section 14 of the K193393:

Three batches (lots) of antibody in immediate packaging (batches 1, 2 and 3) were manufactured and then stored under recommended storage conditions $( 4 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C } )$ . All three lots were used in the Real-Time Stability Test to determine the shelf-life of the BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16). In addition to Real-Time Stability testing, all units of batch 1 underwent a transport simulation test. Following the completion of the transport simulation test, units from lot 1 were used for the In-Use test and the Accelerated Stability Testing. Stability studies were performed on both BOND-MAX and BOND-III systems.

Results and Conclusion:

Stability study data support the claim for $7 \mathrm { m L }$ Bond RTU Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16), for shelf life of 18 months (545 days) from the point of manufacture when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .   
Stability study data support the claim for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ Bond RTU Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16), for shelf life of 18 months (545 days) from the point of manufacture when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# B. Comparison Studies:

a. Method Comparison with the Predicate Device:

The objective of the method comparison study was to evaluate the concordance of results obtained using BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16) on BONDIII (subject device), with results obtained using BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16), (K171753), on BOND-MAX (predicate device, K062615). The study was conducted at three laboratory-testing sites. Each site tested 152 of 456 unique FFPE breast whole tissue sections on the BOND-III instrument, and 152 on the BOND-MAX (two unstained slides were received per each of 152 specimens). One trained pathologist interpreted the stained slides at each site. Positive (endometrium) and negative (tonsil) tissue controls were used in the study.

Scoring:

Tissue is considered “PR Positive” when $2 1 \%$ of tumor nuclei are immunoreactive for PR. When $< 1 \%$ of tumor cells are immunoreactive for PR, the tissue is considered “PR Negative”.

Acceptance criteria:

The lower bounds of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval BOND-III of the OPA, PPA and NPA shall be $\ge 8 5 \%$ when using BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16) on BOND-III compared to BOND-MAX.
