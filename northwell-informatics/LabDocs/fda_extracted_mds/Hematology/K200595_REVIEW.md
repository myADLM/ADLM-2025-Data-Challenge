# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The CellaVision DC-1 is a cell-locating device. The CellaVision DC-1 consists of a built-in PC with a Solid-State Disk (SSD) containing CellaVision DM Software (CDMS), a high-power magnification focusing nosepiece micrscope with a LED illumination, an XY stage, a proprietary camera with firmware, built-in motor- and illumination LED controller, a casing and an external power supply.

The CDMS is the software that controls the collection of cell images, stores the images of the located cells and the results, and displays the images in an organized manner to the operator.

The Peripheral Blood Application (PBA) is a software module included as part of the CDMS. The PBA performs pre-classification of WBCs, pre-characterization of RBCs, and facilitates platelet estimation by presenting an overview image captured of a monolayer area.

# B Principle of Operation:

The typical workflow with respect to the CellaVision DC-1 is as follows.

From a peripheral blood sample collected in K2EDTA or K3EDTA tube, typically flagged by a cell-counter indicating an abnormal morphology, a thin blood film is wedged on a glass slide (a blood smear). The blood smear is then stained with Romanowsky stain. The system uses stained microscope slides made either manually or by using an automatic slide makerstainer.   
• The operator enters the order ID for the slide, either manually or using an optional barcode reader. If a Laboratory Information System (LIS) is used, the device automatically fetches order data for the sample from the LIS.   
• The operator places the slide in the loading tray of the device and closes the input hatch. The device automatically moves the slide under the microscope. Starting at $3 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ from the edge of the slide, the device looks for a monolayer in the smear. Once a monolayer is found, the device scans the monolayer in a battlement pattern. While doing this, the device locates any WBCs and stores high quality images of each located WBC. The device also locates and stores an overview image of a part of the RBC monolayer. The device software, PBA, pre-classifies each located WBC. It also pre-characterizes the RBC morphology based on the overview image. By using the overview image, the operator can calculate or estimate the level of PLTs. During the review/verification stage, a skilled operator, trained in the use of the software and in recognition of blood cells, then opens the order to review and verify (or modify) the preliminary results. The review can be done either at the device or using the CellaVision Remote Review Software (CRRS).

# Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: CellaVision DC-1

2. Specimen Identification: All slides must be labeled clearly with patient or order information. To use the optional handheld barcode reader, slides must be labeled with a barcode label.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Slides are processed one at a time. To load slide, manually open the input hatch, place the slide, with the blood smear facing up, in the loading tray, and close the hatch.

4. Calibration: CellaVision recommends that calibration is performed once a year by a service engineer.

5. Quality Control:

Self-Test - The CellaVision DC-1 analyzer performs self-tests during startup of the software, and at certain points during the operation of the analyzer. When the software starts, the analyzer is checked before the user can start analyzing. During this phase, both the hardware and the software components are tested for anomalies, as well as various requirements for the operation of the analyzer.

Cell Location Test - A cell location test shall be run at least once a day and after any changes in the staining procedure or the staining solutions for quality control. Cell location slides are prepared and processed by the customer from a freshly stained slide from a blood sample with a WBC count within the normal range. The cell location test verifies that the quality of the slide preparation process is good enough to allow the analyzer to locate the cells needed for the analysis. It also verifies the analyzer’s ability to locate cells.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three repeatability studies were performed for white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT), respectively to demonstrate the repeatable performance of CellaVision DC-1 across multiple days. Three reproducibility studies were also conducted for WBC, RBC, and PLT to demonstrate that the results generated by the CellaVision DC-1 are reproducible across sites. Each study was conducted at one U.S. site and two sites outside the U.S. The study designs and representative results are summarized below.

# i. WBC Pre-classification Repeatability

The repeatability of WBC pre-classification results generated by CellaVision DC-1 was evaluated across multiple days. At each site, the study included five samples, one was normal sample and four displayed various clinical pathological characteristics (i.e. abnormal samples). The study samples were selected from leftover samples from the laboratory’s daily workflow. All samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell counter available at the site. Each sample was made into two slides to represent two replicates (i.e. both slides were analyzed once in each run to represent two replicate measurements). Each sample was run twice per day for 20 days, resulting in $2 0 \times 2 \times 2$ measurements. The proportional cell count in percent for each cell class was used to estimate total variance and variance components for repeatability, including within-run, between-run, between-day, and within-laboratory, by an ANOVA. The WBC results were evaluated separately for each sample and site.

# ii. RBC Pre-characterization Repeatability

The repeatability of RBC pre-characterization results generated by CellaVision DC-1 was evaluated across multiple days. At each site, the study included five samples, one was normal sample and four displayed abnormal levels of Polychromatic cells,

Hypochromatic cells, Anisocytosis, Microcytes, Macrocytes, Poikilocytosis (i.e. abnormal samples). The study samples were selected from leftover samples from the laboratory’s daily workflow. All five samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell counter available at the site. Each sample was made into two slides to represent two replicates (i.e. both slides were analyzed once in each run to represent two replicate measurements). Each sample was run twice per day for 20 days, resulting in $2 0 \times 2 \times 2$ measurements. The repeatability in terms of grade (0, 1, 2 or 3) for each morphological characteristic was evaluated. The most prevalent grade reported was evaluated, and the agreement (percentage of runs reporting the grade) was calculated for each morphology. The agreement was evaluated for each slide and run, as well as for each sample. The RBC results were evaluated separately for each site.

# iii. PLT Estimation Repeatability

The repeatability of PLT estimation using the overview image captured by the CellaVision DC-1 was evaluated across multiple days. The procedure for estimating PLT concentration with the overview image provided by CellaVision DC-1 includes: 1) First, the overview image is divided into multiple grids and the operator counts the number of platelet in each grid and enters the counted values for all corresponding grids to estimate the concentration of PLT in the sample; 2) Based on the estimated concentration of PLT, the device reports a grade ( $1 =$ significant decreased, $2 =$ decreased, $3 =$ normal, and $4 =$ increased) corresponding to the predefined ranges. At each site, the study included four samples, one was normal sample $( { \sim } 2 5 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ and three abnormal samples, including one significantly decreased $( { \sim } 3 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ , one decreased $( { \sim } 1 0 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ , and one increased $( { \sim } 6 0 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ samples. The study samples were selected from leftover samples from the laboratory’s daily workflow. All four samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell counter available at the site. Each sample was made into two slides to represent two replicates (i.e. both slides were analyzed once in each run to represent two replicate measurements). Each sample was run twice per day for 20 days, resulting in $2 0 \times 2 \times 2$ measurements. The agreement (i.e. percentage of runs reporting the actual PLT level) was evaluated for each PLT level. The PLT results were evaluated separately for each site.

# iv. WBC Reproducibility

A three-site reproducibility study was conducted to demonstrate that the WBC results obtained from using the CellaVision DC-1 were reproducible across multiple sites (devices). The study included five samples, one was normal sample and four displayed various clinical pathological characteristics (i.e. abnormal samples). The study samples were selected from leftover samples from the laboratories’ daily workflow. All five samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell counter. Each sample was made into five slides to represent five replicates (i.e. five slides were analyzed once in each run to represent five replicate measurements) that were run once per day for five days per site, resulting in $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5$ measurements in total. In the primary analysis, the operator-verified results, including the proportional cell count in percent for each cell class, were used to estimate total variation and variance. In addition to analyzing the operator-verified

results, a secondary analysis was performed on the preclassification outputs generated by the CellaVision DC-1 (i.e. without operator verification).

# v. RBC Reproducibility

A three-site reproducibility study was conducted to demonstrate that the RBC results obtained from using the CellaVision DC-1 were reproducible. The study included four samples, one was normal sample and three displayed abnormal levels of Polychromatic cells, Hypochromatic cells, Anisocytosis, Microcytes, Macrocytes, Poikilocytosis (i.e. abnormal samples). The study samples were selected from leftover samples from the laboratory’s daily workflow. All four samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell counter available at the site. Each sample was made into five slides to represent five replicates (i.e. five slides were analyzed once in each run to represent five replicate measurements). The slides were run once per day for five days per site, resulting in $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5$ x 5 measurements in total. Reproducibility in terms of grade $( 0 , 1 , 2 \mathrm { o r } 3 )$ ) for each morphological characteristic was evaluated. The most prevalent grade reported was evaluated, and the agreement (percentage of runs reporting the grade) was calculated.

vi. PLT Reproducibility

A three-site reproducibility study was conducted to demonstrate that the PLT results obtained from using the overview image provided by CellaVision DC-1 were reproducible. The study included four samples, one was normal sample $( { \sim } 2 5 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ and three abnormal samples, including one significantly decreased $( { \sim } 3 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ , one decreased $( { \sim } 1 0 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ , and one increased $( { \sim } 6 0 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } / \mathrm { L } )$ samples. The study samples were leftover samples selected from different laboratories’ daily workflow. All four samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell counter. Each sample was made into five slides to represent five replicates (i.e. five slides were analyzed once in each run to represent five replicate measurements) that were run once per day for five days per site, resulting in $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5$ measurements in total. For each PLT level (significantly decreased, decreased, normal or increased) the agreement (i.e. percentage of runs reporting the actual PLT level) was evaluated. The agreement was evaluated for each sample and site and representative results by sample are presented below.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Three multi-site method comparison studies were conducted for WBC, RBC, and PLT, respectively to demonstrate that the CellaVision DC-1 (DC-1) performs equivalently to the predicate device, CellaVision DM1200 (DM1200). Each study involved three sites, one of which was a U.S. site. A total of seven sites participated in the three studies.

# i. WBC Comparison

A total of 598 samples were analyzed on both the DM1200 and on the DC-1. The samples were leftover samples from the laboratory´s daily workload. Each site collected approximately 200 samples, 100 of which were normal (non-diseased) and 100 were samples with various clinical pathological characteristics (abnormal samples). Normal and abnormal samples were defined in accordance with CLSI H20-A2. The samples covered a wide range of ages and both genders. Three slides (A, B, and Spare) were prepared from each sample and stained using Romanowsky stain as per standard clinical practice. The operator-verified WBC results from the DC-1 were compared to the

corresponding results from the DM1200. The results of one slide (slide A) from the DC-1 were compared to the mean results (slide A and slide B) from the DM1200, also known as the single slide evaluation.

# WBC Evaluation

In this evaluation, the results from one slide per sample (slide A) from the DC-1 were compared to the mean results (slides A and B) from the DM1200. This evaluation was referred to as the duplicate slide evaluation.

A total of 586 slides (one slide per sample) were analyzed on both the DC-1 and the DM1200 across three sites. The samples were leftover samples from the laboratory´s daily workload. Each site collected approximately 200 samples, with 50 samples for each group: normal, color (Polychromasia, Hypochromasia), size (Anisocytosis, Microcytosis, Macrocytosis) and shape (Poikilocytosis). The samples covered a wide range of ages and both genders. The slides were divided into four sets, one for each operator (e.g. 50 slides in each). Each of the operators verified their own allocated slides on both the DM1200 and the DC-1.

The RBCs were characterized for each morphology according to a predefined 4-graded scale (normal (0), slight (1), moderate (2) or marked (3)). The operator-verified RBC results from the DC-1 were compared to the corresponding results from the DM1200. PPA, NPA and OA with two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals, comparing the DC-1 results with the DM1200 results, were calculated. The results were assumed to be normally distributed and calculations of $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals were performed as described in CLSI EP12-A2. The overall agreement results for each group are presented below.

# iii. PLT Comparison

A total of 598 slides were analyzed on both the DC-1 and the DM1200 across three sites. The samples were leftover samples from the laboratory´s daily workload. Each site

collected 200 samples (50 from each PLT level based on cell counter results). The samples covered a wide range of patient demographics. All samples were collected based on the results from the automated cell counters. Each level was assigned a number: $1 =$ Significant Decreased, $2 =$ Decreased, $3 { = }$ Normal, $4 { = }$ Increased. PPA, NPA and OA for each PLT level were calculated by using $2 \mathbf { x } 2$ contingency tables. The $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals were calculated according to CLSI EP12-A2.
