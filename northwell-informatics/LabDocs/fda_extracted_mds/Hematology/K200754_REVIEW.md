# Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Reader with Sample Tray

It is an automated camera-based analyzer. Digital imaging is used to analyze the intensity of the test and control lines resulting from the introduction of the sample to the sandwich dye– conjugate immunoassay. The results (positive, negative, or invalid) are reported on a display screen and as a printout.

The sample tray comprises of a turntable and a turntable motor with a mechanism that positions and controls the sample diluent on the test strip.

# Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Test Cartridge Kit

The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 adopts a patented test cartridge system which is comprised of:

Test Cartridge: It is a polystyrene plastic case that contains a test strip composed of a plastic plate, a water absorption plate, a nitrocellulose film, colloidal gold, and water absorption paper. The nitrocellulose membrane consists of a control line (line C) coated with sheep anti-mouse polyclonal antibody and a reaction line (line T) coated with mouse anti-human hemoglobin monoclonal antibody. The test strip and cartridge are assembled and designed to prevent any ingress of liquid or air that affects the performance of the test strip and, when the sample buffer collection tube with the fecal material is inserted, prevents any spill outside the test cartridge, creating a clean-free system for the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100.

Sample Collection tube: It contains phosphate-buffered saline. The sample collected by the patient is inserted into the test cartridge (molded for correct insertion) and is placed into the reader sample tray.

# Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Control

The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Control has two control solutions, positive control solution and negative control solution.

Positive control solutions are supplied as $2 \mathrm { m L }$ or $5 \mathrm { m L }$ , containing purified human hemoglobin, Tris buffer, bovine serum albumin, and $0 . 0 5 \%$ sodium azide. It is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Negative control solutions are supplied as $2 \mathrm { m L }$ or $5 \mathrm { m L }$ , containing Tris buffer, bovine serum albumin, and $0 . 0 5 \%$ sodium azide. It is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Calibration Cartridge Kit

The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 is supplied with a Calibration Cartridge Kit to check the assay reading performance.

# B Principle of Operation:

The assay principle is based on an automated sandwich dye–conjugate immunoassay that employs a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively identify and provide qualitative determination of human hemoglobin (hHb) in feces. As the test sample flows through the absorbent device, the labeled antibody-dye conjugate binds to the hemoglobin in the specimen forming an antibody-antigen complex. This complex binds to another anti-hemoglobin antibody in the positive test reaction zone and produces a pink-rose color band. In the absence of hemoglobin, there is no line in the positive test reaction zone. The pink-rose color bands in the control reaction zone demonstrate that the reagents and devices are functioning correctly.

The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Reader with Sample Tray is an automated camera-based analyzer. Digital imaging is used to analyze the intensity of the test and control lines resulting from the introduction of the sample to the sandwich dye-conjugate immunoassay.

The samples are collected in the Sample Collection tube that is sent home with the patient. On return, the sample tube and test cartridge are assembled and placed on the sample tray. The analyzer positions the test cartridge to the plunger station to initiate the test cartridge testing by plunging the sample collection buffer tube into the chamber of the cartridge and thereby piercing its aluminum seal. The test fecal sample buffer is released into the test cartridge and fecal sample buffer will migrate on the enclosed test strip affixed on the test cartridge. Results are read after the tray makes one full rotation which takes 5 minutes. Immediately after sample reading, the result (positive, negative, or invalid) is displayed on the touchscreen and printed on paper whose dispensing slot is situated at the top of the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Hemosure $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Accu-Reader™ A100 Reader with Sample Tray

2. Specimen Identification: The feces samples are collected into the Sample Collection tube, each of which includes a barcode. If patient sample ID barcodes are not available, patient sample information must be

manually recorded by the operator after each sample run. Patient sample results can be manually identified by the sample location numbers imprinted on the sample tray.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Samplings is done with the applicator stick which is part of the Sample Collection tube.

4. Calibration:

The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 is supplied with a Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Calibration Cartridge Kit to check the analyzer performance. The kit includes a set of 10 calibration cartridges. It is recommended that Accu-Reader A100 calibration procedure must be conducted every 90 days. The calibration checks if the internal digital camera is functioning correctly, the lens is free from debris, and the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 is working as per the specification.

# 5. Quality Control:

Internal control: The test strip within the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge contains internal control lines to determine whether or not the test has run properly.

External control: Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Control is used in an external control procedure. The control solutions should be run each day before testing patient samples.

Positive Control: two or five milliliters of solution containing purified human hemoglobin, Tris buffer, bovine serum albumin, and $0 . 0 5 \%$ sodium azide. Negative Control: two or five milliliters of solution containing Tris buffer, bovine serum albumin, and $0 . 0 5 \%$ sodium azide.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

a) Human Hemoglobin Variant

The ability of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 to detect abnormal human hemoglobin variants was determined by testing a series of concentrations of Hemoglobin-S (HbS) spiked into human fecal samples. 21 replicates of fecal samples spiked with Hb-S for each concentration were prepared and tested using one lot of test cartridge. The concentrations tested include: 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g } \mathrm { H b } \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { m L }$ . At the concentration of $1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 was consistently positive. The study results suggest that Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 is equally sensitive to detect HbS as to human hemoglobin (hHb).

b) Cross Reactivity i. Animal Hemoglobin

The cross-reactivity of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with non-human hemoglobin was evaluated by using one lot of test cartridge. Human hemoglobin (hHb) fecal samples at different concentrations (0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) were spiked with $5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ hemoglobin from bovine, porcine, fish, equine, goat, rabbit and sheep. All samples were tested in 21 replicates. The results demonstrate no cross-reactivity of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with any of the tested animal hemoglobins.

# ii. Dietary Substance and Vegetable Extracts

The cross-reactivity of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with dietary substances and vegetable extracts were evaluated by using one lot of test cartridge. Hemoglobin free stool samples were spiked with hHb to obtain seven concentrations (0, 80, 100, 110,

120, 140, and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ). Samples at different concentration were then spiked with each of the following: $0 . 5 \%$ (by weight) iron, $0 . 5 \%$ (by weight) vitamin C (sodium L-ascorbate), $2 . 5 \%$ (by weight) of broccoli extracts, $2 . 5 \%$ (by weight) cantaloupe extracts, $2 . 5 \%$ (by weight) horseradish extracts, $2 . 5 \%$ (by weight) red radish extracts, $2 . 5 \%$ (by weight) parsnip extracts, $2 . 5 \%$ (by weight) turnip extracts and $2 . 5 \%$ (by weight) cauliflower extracts. All samples were tested in 21 replicates. The results demonstrate no cross-reactivity of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with the dietary substances and vegetable extracts at the tested concentrations.

# c) Interference

Interference of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with animal meat extracts, toilet cleaners and contaminants were evaluated using one lot of test cartridge. Hemoglobin free stool samples were spiked with normal Hb to obtain seven concentrations: 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140, and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Samples at each concentration were then spiked with the following animal meat extracts: $2 . 5 \%$ of beef, $2 . 5 \%$ of pork, $2 . 5 \%$ of fish, $2 . 5 \%$ of chicken, $2 . 5 \%$ of lamb, $2 . 5 \%$ of horse, $2 . 5 \%$ of goat and $2 . 5 \%$ of rabbit. The results demonstrate no interference of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with animal meat extracts at the tested concentration.

For testing interference with toilet cleaners and other contaminants, Lime-A-Way (5 $\mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), Clorox $( 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , Lysol bleach $( 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , Lysol cleaner $( 5 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ), Scrubbing Bubbles $( 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), Bisacodyl enteric coated tablets $( 2 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , Sennoside tablets $( 2 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , glycerol enema $( 2 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , and hydrogen peroxide enema (25 $\mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ) were tested. All samples were tested in 21 replicates. The results demonstrate no interference of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with the interferents at the tested concentration.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Control has two control solutions, a positive control and a negative control. The negative control contains $5 \mathrm { m L }$ standard dilution buffer. The positive control contains purified human hemoglobin in standard dilution buffer. The positive control is prepared from material derived from human blood. The source materials were tested for the presence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Surface antigens $\mathrm { ( H B S A g ) }$ , Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and found to be negative.

The quality control stability study was performed using three lots of the Hemosure AccuReader A100 Control (three lots of liquid negative control and three lots of liquid positive control) with three replicates per test. One lot of the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kit and one Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Analyzer were used. The study was conducted at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ over 25 months (tests on months 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 and 25). The control solutions were determined to be stable for 24 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

6. Detection Limit: Not applicable

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

The assay cut-off study was performed with a single lot of the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kit.

# Prozone Effect (Hook-Effect)

The prozone study was conducted to determine the effects of high concentrations of human hemoglobin on the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 test results. Hemoglobin-free stool sample was spiked with human blood of known hemoglobin concentration to achieve following concentrations: 500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 2000, 2500 and $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . A total of 21 replicates were tested at each hemoglobin concentration with one lot of the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kit. The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 was not susceptible to the Hook effect up to a concentration of $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# Sample Stability Studies

Stool samples were spiked with different concentrations of human hemoglobin and stored in the Sample Collection tubes at different temperatures for up to 30 days after sampling using three lots of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kits (including the Test Cartridge and the Sample Collection tube). 21 replicates of each of the following hemoglobin concentrations were tested: 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

a. The samples stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ were tested on 0, 6, 11, 14 and 15 days with sample stability in the Sample Collection tube was acceptable for up to 14 days.   
b. For refrigerated conditions, two temperature conditions were tested. Samples were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $^ { - 1 0 }$ to $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and testing was performed at 0, 30 and 32 days. Based on the results, the fecal sample in the Sample Collection tube can be stored for up to 30 days under refrigerated conditions.

# Reagent Stability Studies

a. Realtime Shelf-life Stability Studies The real time stability study was conducted with three lots of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kits (including the Test Cartridge and the Sample Collection tube). A total of three operators at a single site with one device of the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Reader with Sample Tray was used to perform the study. Two storage temperatures ( $4 \%$ and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) were tested. Time points used in the real-time stability study included: 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 37 months. Test cartridge kits were retrieved and tested with different hemoglobin concentrations at the end of each designated time point in the study. Seven hemoglobin concentrations of 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were used. The testing was done with 21 replicates for each concentration level. Based on the real-time stability results, the current data supports the shelf-life of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kits (including the Test Cartridge and the Sample Collection tube) for up to 24 months at both $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

b. Transportation Stability Studies The shipping study was conducted to evaluate the shipping stress to the Hemosure AccuReader A100 Sample Collection tube and its endurance under extreme temperatures.

Before sampling: The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes (containing no fecal samples) were stored at $- 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for different time points (0, 3, 5 and 6 days). Tests were performed with 21 replicates of each hemoglobin concentration (0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) at the end of each designed time point of the study. The study was conducted at one site with one lot of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kit on a single analyzer. The results demonstrate that the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes (before sampling) can be stable for five days under the shipping temperatures of - $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

After sampling: The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes were tested by 21 replicates of hemoglobin free fecal samples spiked with seven different concentrations of hemoglobin (0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ). After sampling, the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes were stored at $- 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for different time points (0, 3, 5 and 6 days). Tests were performed with 21 replicates of each hemoglobin concentration at the end of each designed time point of the study. The study was conducted at one site with one lot of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kit on a single analyzer. The results demonstrate that the Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes (after sampling) can be stable for five days under the shipping temperatures of - $\cdot 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .
