# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The cobas u 701 is a fully automated urine particle analyzer that is used in the clinical laboratory to analyze formed elements in urine samples quantitatively, semi-quantitatively and qualitatively for the presence of particles in the sample. The cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer is a stand-alone system and incorporates a robotic liquid handling system that pipettes an aliquot of the specimen into a disposable cuvette. The filled cuvette is forwarded to the built-in centrifuge for centrifugation of the non-soluble particles. After the centrifugation, all particles are brought to one monolayer to ensure they are all at the same focal plane. A built-in camera takes pictures through a built-in microscope at several positions of the sediment. All images are evaluated by an image processing software which is able to detect and further classify the following urine particles. Particle concentration is calculated using the average count from the assessed images. The cobas u 701 reports analysis results for two quantitative parameters in urine: RBC and WBC, three semi-quantitative parameters: SEC (Squamous epithelial cells), HYA (Hyaline casts) and BAC (Bacteria), and six qualitative parameters: NEC (Non-squamous epithelial cells), PAT (Pathological casts), CRY (Crystals), YEA (Yeast), SPRM (Sperm) and MUC (Mucus). The cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer performs a maximum theoretical throughput of up to 116 samples per hour.

The cobas u 701 consists of several major components:

• Rack transport system   
• Liquid handling system   
• Cuvette cassette compartment   
• Centrifuge   
• Built-in reverse microscope with movable objective lens for focusing procedure   
• High resolution camera system   
• Touch Screen   
• Inbuilt Computer with the imaging and evaluation software for analyzing the sed pictures

The cobas u cuvette is a cassette, containing cuvettes for the in vitro quantitative determination of erythrocytes and leukocytes, the semi-quantitative determination of squamous epithelial cells, bacteria, and hyaline casts and the qualitative determination of non-squamous epithelial cells, crystals, yeasts, pathological casts, mucus, and sperm in urine with the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer. The cobas u cuvette is for professional use only.

The cobas u cuvette is used by the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer to transport, centrifuge and analyze patient and control samples. They are provided separately from the analyzer, in a box holding 400 disposable cuvettes.

# Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer

2. Specimen Identification: Human urine

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The analyzer auto-identifies and processes barcoded tube specimens in 5-position racks by mixing, sampling, and analyzing automatically.

4. Calibration:

No calibration of the device is necessary for its intended use. However, there is a microscope check, which is not a calibration of the device. This microscope check ensures proper functioning of the focusing mechanism of the microscope utilizing a reference cuvette. The reference cuvette is a cuvette with the same dimensions as the sample cuvette, which contains a transparent material with a standardized number of erythrocyte like particles etched in it. For differentiation from the sample cuvettes, the reference cuvette is green and marked with the letter R on the top. This microscope check confirms that the instrument is able to focus accurately on the position of the particles and to count correctly the number of the cells. This microscope check needs to be performed every 4 weeks. A message from the instrument informs the operator when it is due.

5. Quality Control: Recommendation of commercially available control solutions.

The iQ200 system incorporates an iQ200 Automated Urine Microscopy Analyzer, in which a sample is presented as a lamina sandwiched between enveloping layers of suspending fluid to a microscope coupled to a CCD (charge coupling device) video camera. This lamination positions the specimen exactly within the depth of focus and field of view of the objective lens of the microscope. Lamination is the planar equivalent of axial hydrodynamic focusing, used to position cells in certain types of blood cell counters and flow cytometers. It has the added advantage of achieving orthoscopic particle orientation, thereby presenting asymmetric particles with their largest profile facing the direction of view. A CCD digital camera captures five hundred frames per sample, as each microscopic field of view is illuminated by the flash of a strobe lamp.

b. Intermediate Precision

Intermediate precision was performed according to CLSI EP5-A3 to assess long-term precision of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer. However, due to the instability of the human urine samples, only control samples were measured for this study. This assessment was limited to the parameters included in the control material (RBC, WBC). All predefined acceptance criteria were met.

# 2. Linearity:

Linearity of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer was determined for the two quantitative parameters RBC and WBC using one lot of cobas u cuvette and one cobas $\tt { u } 7 0 1$ instrument. Linear regression was calculated according CLSI EP6-A.

Urine specimen pools were created by diluting and spiking natural urine samples with human RBC and WBC particles to cover the full measuring range for each quantitative parameter. One dilution series was prepared for each parameter (RBC & WBC). The RBC linearity set consisted of 25 serial dilutions. The WBC linearity set consisted of 23 serial dilutions. Each dilution concentration was measured in 4-fold determination in a randomized order. For evaluation, every single result was plotted against expected concentrations. Then linearity regression was calculated according CLSI EP6-A by a statistical software tool. The results obtained for RBC and WBC using the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer met the defined acceptance criteria. Data analysis showed linearity for RBC and WBC was achieved through polynomial regression. The linearity was confirmed for a linearity range for RBC from $5 -$ $2 1 6 0 \mathrm { p / \mu L }$ and WBC from ${ 5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 8 0 \ { \mathrm { p / } } { \mu } { \mathrm { L } } }$ . The measuring ranges for RBC $( 5 { - } 1 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p / \mu L } )$ and WBC $( 5 { \mathrm { - } } 9 0 0 \ \mathrm { p / \mu L } )$ were covered by the linearity experiment.

The interference study assessed the potential interferences that may occur on the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer due to its measurement technology; clinical samples were assessed for the individual interferents. The study was determined by using four instruments and nine cuvette lots, on 670 native urine samples. Because of the imaging technology on the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer, testing according EP07-A2 considered only visual/physical interferents; interference of drugs or endogenous substances is not applicable. Interference was confirmed, if the analyzer classification result was different than the visual classification result (KOVA manual counting). Native human urine samples containing the following interfering particles were measured on the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzers: high concentrations of mucus strands, artifacts, clumps, cell fragments, dysmorphic cells, shining particles, crowded samples, diluted samples, highly viscous samples, and high turbidity (Intralipid) samples. Furthermore, challenging native urine samples including amorphous crystals and trichomonas were evaluated. Based on the technological characteristics of the manual microscopy method, when measuring the following particles in the sample on the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer, there is the potential that an incorrect result may be obtained.

4. Accuracy (Instrument):

To assess the accuracy of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer, a method comparison study was performed versus manual counting using KOVA chamber as the defined reference method was performed utilizing clinical samples. Six cobas u cuvette lots and one cobas u 701 instrument per site were used to perform the measurements. Measurements were performed at three sites, each using one cobas u 701 instrument per site and six cobas u cuvette lots. Statistical analysis was then performed comparing the cobas u 701 results and the KOVA chamber results.

Patient demographics included both males and females ranging in age from 1 month old to 98 years of age (355 females, 334 males and 91 pediatrics). A total of 168 subjects with known clinical conditions (kidney, infectious, and metabolic diseases) and 521 subjects with either healthy or unknown clinical condition urine samples were tested. For quantitative parameters, regression analysis (Passing-Bablok), including $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) and estimates of the bias/difference were calculated for each parameter. In addition, BlandAltman plots were generated to show the differences between the two devices for all reportable parameters. For both semi-quantitative and qualitative parameters, the agreement rates, including positive percentage agreement (PPA), negative percentage agreement (NPA) and the lower end $9 5 \%$ confidence limits were calculated.

The results of the method comparison studies performed between cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer and visual counting using the KOVA chamber are shown below. All obtained statistical results from the single sites as well as for the compiled data sets were within the defined specifications and confirmed the substantial equivalence of the automated cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer with the manual KOVA counting method.

# 5. Carry-Over:

Carryover was evaluated by testing residual urine samples without preservatives with high RBC, WBC, BAC, SEC, HYA, YEA, SPRM, and CRY at two sites, using five cobas u cuvette lots and one cobas u 701 instrument per site. First, a negative sample was measured in 25 determinations (reference run). Afterwards, sample blocks with five samples each were measured in alternate measurement mode. Alternating measurements of samples with high and negative concentrations were performed, meaning a high concentration sample block $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 5 )$ ) was measured, then a negative sample block $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ was measured, and then a high concentration sample block was measured $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ , etc.

Each block was measured 5 times for a total of 25 results for the high sample and 25 results for the negative sample. Statistical calculations for the quantitative parameters comprised calculation of mean and standard deviation for the reference run. For the semi-quantitative and qualitative parameters, the results of the negative samples after positive sample testing were assessed to confirm that they were still “negative”. The results of the Sample Carryover assessment for the defined parameters performed on the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer using the cobas u cuvette met the predefined acceptance criteria.

# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

1. Detection Limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB)

Limit of Blank (LoB) of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer was determined using one lot of cobas u cuvette and three cobas u 701 microscopy analyzers. The LoB is the highest observed measured value for samples free of analyte. The Limit of Blank was determined as the 95th percentile of the measurement of blank samples. Five samples per analyte were prepared fresh every day and tested on 3 days. Each day, two runs were performed with five samples measured in singlicate per run. Thirty results were collected for each parameter on each instrument for a total of 90 results per parameter. To determine the LoB, the 90 results for each parameter were sorted low to high. Using the nonparametric approach, determination of the 95th percentile was calculated from the mean of the 85th and 86th ranked results. All predefined acceptance criteria were met. The LoB was determined as follows:

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

Limit of Detection (LoD) of the cobas $\tt { u } 7 0 1$ microscopy analyzer was determined using one lot of cobas u cuvette and three cobas u 701 microscopy analyzers. LoD determines the detection limit for samples with low analyte concentration. The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with a $9 5 \%$ probability. Five samples per parameter were measured. Each sample was measured in a 10-fold determination on each of the three analyzers. Measurements were performed on minimum 3 days. In total, 150 results were collected for each parameter. All predefined acceptance criteria were met. The LoD was calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + ( 1 . 6 4 8 \times \mathrm { S D } )

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer was determined using one lot of cobas u cuvette and three cobas u 701 microscopy analyzers. LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration in a sample that can be reproducibly measured. LoQ was determined for the quantitative parameters RBC and WBC with the same set of samples applied for the LoD determination. LoQ for RBC and WBC parameters met the predefined acceptance criteria.

2. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

# Calibration:

No calibration of the device is necessary due to different particle detection technology. However, there is a microscope check, which is not a calibration of the device. This microscope check ensures proper functioning of the focusing mechanism of the microscope utilizing a reference cuvette. This microscope check needs to be performed every 4 weeks. A message from the instrument informs the operator when it is due.

# Quality control:

Recommendation of commercially available control solutions.

# 3. Sample Stability:

Sample stability testing was performed using anonymized fresh human urine samples and measuring these samples at three different time points: 1) T0 - 0 h sample lifetime; 2) T1 - 2 h sample lifetime, and; 3) T2 - 3 h sample lifetime.

The urine samples were divided into four aliquots, thereof one for each time point and one for visual determination of the parameters SG (specific gravity) and $\mathsf { p H }$ with Chemstrip 10 UA test strips. Prior to and between the measurements of the different time points, the samples were stored at room temperature. For each testing point, a 4-fold determination was performed of urine samples on the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer to rule out imprecision effects, unrelated to the analyte stability. In parallel to the instrument reading, a single determination with Chemstrip $1 0 \mathrm { U A }$ was done at each time point of the same sample to determine the SG and $\mathsf { p H }$ values. The results obtained for sample stability using the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer met the defined acceptance criteria. The $\mathsf { p H }$ and SG measured values remain unchanged over the entire measuring time. Data analysis showed sample stability for negative and positive flagged samples passed at time T2 $( 3 \mathrm { h } )$ when stored at room temperature, one time-point below the sample stability claim of 2 hours.

For semi-quantitative and qualitative assay cut-off determination, range limits were set using empirical and theoretical information from literature, knowledge from clinical practice and the available data from external performed studies.
