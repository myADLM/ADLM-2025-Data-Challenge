# Description of Device:

The Athelas Home is identical to the Athelas One K181288 in its technology, all software, the analytes measured, all components, and usage process. The Athelas Home has additional software and quality control safeguards to enable at-home usage of the device. Additionally, results generated from the Athelas Home are not shown to end-patients, rather are transmitted via the software directly to their healthcare provider. The Athelas Home also has Remote Lockout capabilities, such that a healthcare provider or manufacturer can remotely lock-out a device for safety in usage.

Athelas Home is indicated for the quantitative determination of white blood cells (WBC) and Neutrophil percentages $( \mathsf { N E U T \% } )$ in capillary whole blood. The Athelas Home system is for In Vitro Diagnostic use and for prescription use only. The Athelas Home is only to be used with

Athelas Home Test Strips. The Athelas Home is indicated for use by patients and clinicians within home and point-of-care settings, with results viewable by health care professionals only. The Athelas Home is indicated for operation by adult populations only (aged 21 and older).

The Athelas Home is not indicated to completely replace a patient’s monitoring regimen on reference lab systems. Prescribers should continue monitoring patients using traditional lab-based means as deemed necessary and possible.

The Athelas Home is not indicated to return results directly to patients. The Athelas Home directly transfers results to a health-care professional for interpretation and analysis. The Athelas Home is not indicated to directly diagnose or assist in disease management. Rather, the Athelas Home should be used to quantify WBC and Neut% only, with all decision making owned by the physician as per standard of care.

The Athelas Home uses image processing and microfluidics in order to measure WBC and NEUT% values from whole blood in point-of-care and home settings. For further technological details refer to Athelas One K181288 application.

The precision/bias goals of the device are provided below:

Target Evaluation Criteria:

WBC Precision: $7 . 5 \%$ CV above 2K/µL WBC. 0.25 K/µL SD below 2K/µL WBC. WBC Bias/Error: $\pm 7 . 5 \%$ error above 2K/µL WBC. $\pm 0 . 2 5$ K/µL error below 2K/µL WBC

Neutrophil $\%$ Precision: $5 \%$ SD OR $15 \%$ CV Neutrophil $\%$ Bias: $\pm 1 0 \%$ bias or $\pm5 \%$ Neut% total error (whichever larger).

These targets were chosen based on CLSI clinical precision/bias recommendations for WBC and Neut%. Constant value targets were set to account for asymptotically increasing percent imprecision towards lower concentrations as per the poisson distribution.

# Description of Intended Setting:

The Athelas Home is indicated to be used within a patient’s home in a stationary and dry location. The Athelas Home labeling (Proposed Labeling Section 13) highlights the specific conditions (temperature, humidity) for storage and operation, which are identical to the FDA-cleared Athelas One (K181288).

# Summary of Technological Characteristics Compared to Predicate Devices:

The Athelas Home is identical to the Athelas One in its technology, all software, the analytes measured, all components, and usage process. The Athelas Home has additional software and quality control safeguards to enable at-home usage of the device. Additionally, results generated from the Athelas Home are not shown to end-patients, rather are transmitted via the software directly to their healthcare provider. The Athelas Home also has Remote Lockout capabilities, such that a healthcare provider or manufacturer can remotely lock-out a device for safety in usage.

Testing: Bench, Clinical testing, At-Home testing, and Flex Testing were conducted to showcase substantial equivalence between the Athelas Home and predicate device.

As per Agency guidance in presubmission (Q190305), studies from the Athelas One were used to support the Athelas Home because the devices are identical.

# Bench

Within-run Precision/Reproducibility

From K181288 Athelas One

Within-run Precision Repeatability

Precision studies were performed using K2EDTA whole blood samples around medical decision levels and the upper and lower limit of the analytical measuring range. The study was conducted with nine whole blood samples, three different operators and three different test strip lots. Care was taken to include both normal and abnormal samples.

Three operators and three test strip lots were used in conjunction. Per operator, per lot, ten replicates of each sample were tested and the results were recorded. 90 tests were run per sample, with 810 tests run in total. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample. All results met the predefined specifications $( \mathsf { C V } \% )$ for precision (targets shown on below table as well).

# Precision Reproducibility (between run)

Precision/Reproducibility studies were performed on the Athelas One Whole Blood Manual Mode using three levels of ATH-check quality control material (Low, Normal and High). The 20-day study used three sites, with three analyzers (one instrument per site), three lots of test strips, and one lot of quality control materials (all levels). We performed two runs per day and two replicates per run with two operators per site. A total of 80 readings were generated at each site for each level of control (2 runs x 20 days x 2 replicates $= 8 0$ readings). As per Agency recommendation results were analyzed using ANOVA analysis and taking into account the nested design of the study.

A site by site analysis was also conducted as per Agency recommendation, also falling within evaluation criteria. Overall reproducibility levels were found to meet the acceptance criteria of $7 . 5 \%$ CV for WBC and $5 \%$ SD or $1 5 \%$ CV for Neutrophils across all three levels and all sites.

# At-Home Precision Study

An additional precision repeatability (within-run) study was conducted to showcase the precision performance of the Athelas Home specifically by at-home users. The study design recommended by the Agency was for samples to be collected in duplicate by home users in home environments and analyzed for $C V \%$ to confirm that evaluation criteria for precision were still met.

Patients were instructed to conduct two tests on the Athelas Home following the labeling process. Patients were instructed to collect both samples within 5 minutes of each other following the Athelas Home labeling, filling two unique test strips. This was known as the in-home whole blood self-test group.

A separate group of patients were provided with Athelas Home Quality Control material and asked to use the dropper on the Quality Control Material vial to conduct 3 replicates for the assigned sample to the given patient. This was known as the in-home quality control material self-testing group.

The evaluation criteria is shown below:

# WBC Targets (Evaluation Criteria)

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range (WBC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Target</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Statistic</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0 - 2K</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.25 K/μL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2K +</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV %</td></tr></table>

$C V \%$ was calculated for the two groups (patient blood samples, and quality control material) combined as well as independently in order to evaluate against the Evaluation Criteria. Per-recommendation of CLSI EP05-A3, the primary analyte (WBC) was used for precision evaluation.

The results indicate that the At-Home Precision Repeatability studies met their pre-set evaluation criteria for WBC $C V \%$ and NEUT $\%$ precision ( $7 . 5 \%$ CV for WBC and $5 \%$ SD for NEUT% or $1 5 \%$ CV for NEUT%).

# Patient In-home Whole Blood Studies Self-Test

The in-home whole blood study consisted of 24 patients, and 2 replicates per sample.

# Linearity

10 samples across the reporting range were run in 4 replicates across 4 devices and one test strip lot. The samples were obtained by pooling together one low WBC concentration fresh whole blood sample one high WBC concentration sample in different volumes which is a recommended option in CLSI EP6-A.

The method has been demonstrated to be linear from lower limit to upper limit and within measured allowable max $\%$ diff for each interval. The primary analyte (WBC) was analyzed in linearity as per CLSI EP06-A guidance. The CLSI recommended OLS regression of the linearity data is provided below:

Athelas One WBC vs True Concentration

# Interfering Substances

Interference studies were performed taking sample abnormalities, drugs, metabolites, sample additives and dietary substances into consideration. A list of substances were tested and found naturally occurring in patient samples, or were spiked in whole blood. This list is included below (with highest concentration or percentages tested). None of the substances were found to interfere with the measurements of the Athelas One device. This was evaluated through analysis of interferon impact on bias and precision performance. All interferon spiked samples continued to perform within the evaluation criteria.

Triglyceride Rich Lipoproteins Hemolysate   
● Protein   
● Levodopa Methyldopa Metronidazole Acetylsalicylic Acid Phenylbutazone Rifampicin Cyclosporine Acetaminophen Heparin   
● Ibuprofin   
● Bilirubin C   
● Bilirubin F   
● Reticulocytes   
● Platelet Aggregates   
● Nucleated Red Blood Cells   
● Giant Platelets   
● Myelodysplastic Syndrome Macrocytic Anemia Infectious Mononucleosis   
● Bacterial Infections   
● Chronic Myeloid Leukemia   
● Patients on Chemotherapy   
● Patients treated with GCSFs

Reference Intervals

Adult reference intervals for the Athelas One were verified across 120 healthy donors in comparison to pre-established reference intervals for the Sysmex XE-5000 utilizing whole blood samples.

# Limit of Blank (LoB) – Whole Blood

The LoB was obtained from 120 total repeated measurements of blank samples analyzed in the sampling modes for whole blood. The mean, SD and LoB were calculated for the analyzer. The LoB for whole blood parameters WBC is zero (0) ${ \mathsf { K } } / { \mu \mathsf { L } }$ .

Limit of Detection (LoD) – Whole Blood

As per Agency recommendation, Limit of Detection was conducted using run as follows:

● 2 test strip lots (60 strips each)   
● 2 instruments   
● 3 days

As shown in the Limit of Blank section, the LoB was found to be 0.

The LoD of Lot 1 was $0 . 0 5 5 \mathsf { K } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ while the LoD of Lot 2 was $0 . 0 7 9 \mathsf { K } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ . The maximum LoD of the two lots was established as the final LoD. Hence, the LoD was set to be $0 . 0 7 9 \mathsf { K } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ .

The LoD was found to be 0.079 K/µL which is well below the LoQ of 0.44 K WBC/µL.

# Limit of Quantification (LoQ) – Whole Blood

The Limit of Quantification study was designed to estimate the lowest measurement concentration that can be measured on the Athelas One and meet the predefined total error goals. The study was conducted over two test-strip lots, 1 instrument, 3 days, 3 replicates per sample, and 4 independent low-level whole blood samples. The samples were distinct whole blood samples acquired from patients in ${ \sf K } _ { 2 } \mathsf { E D T A }$ tubes. The original concentrations were obtained from the predicate analyzer (Sysmex XE-5000). These samples were then diluted to reach an approximate concentration of $0 . 4 5 \mathsf { K W B C / \mu L }$ . The original concentrations, the volume of diluent, and the final concentrations of the samples are shown in the table below.

The Limit of Quantification of the Athelas One was determined to be 0.44 K WBC/µL as per CLSI EP17-A2. This is below the lower limit of the Athelas One’s reporting range of 1.0K WBC/µL.

# Specimen Stability Studies

Whole blood stability - Room temperature vs Refrigerated temperature

Whole blood stability was evaluated on the Athelas One device by conducting a 48 hour stability study on nine different venous blood samples with low $( 0 . 5 - 3 \mathsf { K } / \mu \mathsf { L }$ , normal $( 4 { - } 1 0 \mathsf { K } / \mathsf { \mu L } )$ , and high $( > 1 0 ~ \mathsf { K / \mu L } )$ WBC levels. The study was designed in accordance with recommendations from CLSI EP25-A.

Based on results evaluating deviation from pre-defined bias and precision criteria, the stability duration for all samples can be set to 24 hours with observed degradation at 48 hours for both the WBC and Neutrophil $\%$ parameters. Overall, all samples tested within 24 hours of collection time were found to meet the pre-set acceptance criteria of $7 . 5 \%$ CV for WBC precision, $\pm 7 . 5 \%$ Bias for WBC, $5 \%$ SD OR $1 5 \%$ CV for Neutrophils (updated based on Sysmex XW-100 Neut% CV criteria), and $\pm 1 0 \%$ Bias across the whole study.

# Test Strip Stability over time

A 16 week test strip stability study was conducted to assess the shelf life stability of the Athelas test strips. The strips were tested weekly over 16 weeks to justify a 15 week expiration. The study was designed in accordance with recommendations from CLSI EP25-A.

In particular, the study was conducted over 16 weeks, across two test strip lots, 4 analyzers, two replicates, and one lot of quality control materials. Each week, we performed two replicates per two lots of strips across 3 levels of control fluid.

From the study it can be observed that none of the analyzed test strips manifested statistically significant degradation/drift over the 105-day study $( \mathsf { p } > 0 . 0 5 )$ as recommended by the CLSI EP25-A regression slope analysis. The stability duration for all samples can be set to 98 days with no observed degradation at 105 days, the last time point of the study.

# Clinical

# Method Comparison

Method comparison studies were performed to assess the performance of the Athelas One analyzer when compared to the predicate Sysmex XE-5000 analyzer on a total of 312 patient samples taken at 3 point of care sites in the US. All samples were run in the Automated Sampling Modes in singlet on the XE-5000.

Samples covered clinical medical decision levels, and included normal and abnormal samples. The full reportable measuring ranges of the Athelas One analyzer were tested in method comparison. All evaluation criteria (slope, r, bias at medical decision levels, overall bias, bland altman analysis, intercept) were met, and even more specifically: manufacture-defined criteria for equivalence between two predicate Sysmex XE-5000 devices was also met by the Athelas One.

The overall results across three sites are shown in the table below.

# Flagging Comparison

As per Agency recommendation, a Flagging Comparison study was conducted to determine the ability for the Athelas One to successfully flag abnormal samples for manual review. The study design of a Sysmex XN series analyzer (FDA 510k K112605) was used, and a similar evaluation criteria of $90 \%$ flagging accuracy.

# Morphological Flags

The results of the Athelas One morphological flagging compared to the XE-5000 flagging evaluation were divided into two categories: (1) No Flags, Negative Judgement (2) Patients with positive Morphology/Differential abnormalities - Flags present, Positive Judgement. The study was limited to WBC and DIFF related flags. The results obtained from the flagging comparison study met the specification of $\geq 9 0 \%$ .

# Matrix Comparison

Experiments were conducted to determine the comparability of venous and capillary whole blood on the Athelas One device across 59 patients. These were in addition to the method comparison trials that used a combination of venous and capillary blood tested against venous samples run on the predicate device.

Capillary finger-prick blood samples were placed onto Athelas test strips from subjects. Venous whole blood samples were collected in K2EDTA vacutainer tubes for the same patients. The capillary whole blood and the venous whole blood samples were analyzed on Athelas One devices. It was concluded that there is no statistical difference between the systems when analyzing venous and capillary samples.

The regression parameters and $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of bias at the medical decision levels were calculated as per recommendation of CLSI EP5-A3 and H26-A2 and met all evaluation criteria. The information is summarized on the tables below:

# At-Home Usability Analysis

During the first At-Home visits, study investigators were asked to conduct usability surveys to ensure at-home users had no difficulties in setting up and understanding how to run the test. The following questions were asked per user:

1. Was the user able to use the lancet correctly? Mark yes if the user was able to open the lancet, puncture the correct site on their finger, and dispose of the lancet correctly.   
2. Did the user fill up the test-strip fully? Mark yes if the user placed enough blood such that the blood reached the end of the channel on the test-strip.   
3. Did the user face any errors when running the test (not error codes)?   
4. Did the user correctly know how to run the test using the application?   
5. Was this test performed by the patient (yes) or caregiver (no)? (‘Yes’ if conducted by patient, ‘No’ if conducted by caregiver)

The results, shown below, indicate a large majority of patients found the Athelas Home easy to use and had very little difficulty running the test end to end.

Vibration testing was conducted by third party ISTA certified test lab Quanta Testing. The system successfully met evaluation criteria post vibration test.

# Conclusion

Through a range of CLSI recommended studies in clinical and bench settings, the Athelas Home has been shown to be safe and effective for at-home use and substantially equivalent to the POC Athelas One.

Humidity Flex Testing

# Objective

Humidity Flex Testing was part of the final list of flex tests decided by Athelas and the Agency as part of the Athelas Home Presubmission (Q190305 Attachment B). A study was conducted to verify the performance of the Athelas Home test-strips under extreme humidity conditions.

# Methodology

The study aimed to showcase functional performance of the Athelas Home Test-Strips after exposure of test-strips to the following humidity conditions:

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Condition</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Temperature (C)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Humidity (%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">X</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">38°</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">85</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td></td><td>Uncontrolled</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Each of eight test-strips were subject to the following test schedules based on the above conditions:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Test-Strip Number</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Schedules</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Condition X for 72 hrs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Condition X for 72 hrs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Condition X for 72 hrs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Condition X for 72 hrs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Condition X for 72 hrs followed by Y for 72hrs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Condition X for 72 hrs followed by Y for 72hrs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Condition X for 72 hrs followed by Y for 72hrs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Condition X for 72 hrs followed by Y for 72hrs</td></tr></table>

The conditions were implemented using humidity chambers at Quanta Laboratories, an ISTA certified environmental testing laboratory.

After exposure to the testing schedules, the following functional tests were conducted on the test-strips:

1. Change in Color

a. Verify qualitatively that no change in test-strip color is present. i. This was conducted by comparing a reference test-strip that hadn’t been placed into the testing conditions against the test-strip placed under the conditions.

2. Fill-Time

a. Measurement of time for 3.4 µL of a single vial of Ath-Check control fluid to flow to the end of the channel.   
b. A stopwatch was started when a single drop of the fluid was placed on the channel inlet and stopped when the fluid met the side edges of the T channel on the test-strip.

These tests were chosen due to risk analyses which found that humidity primarily affects the test-strips by increasing fill-time through decreasing capillary pressure in the channel, and changing the test-strip color due to presence of condensation affecting stain color.

As such, verification of flow-time and color change were found to be sufficient checks for no performance degradation of the test-strip.

# Results

# Discussion

Based on the results, it was concluded that the Athelas Home test-strips continued to function within specifications after exposure to extreme humidity conditions. In particular, no evidence was found of condensation in the test-strip which would be manifested in increased fill-time and changes in stain color.

All eight test-strips across all schedules were found to be within specifications for both fill time and color. This is due to specially designed packaging for the Athelas Home test-strips that ensure humidity resistance. The Athelas Home Test-Strip packaging includes three separate layers designed specifically to reduce humidity effects:

1. PET Layer   
2. Aluminum Layer   
3. Desiccant Layer

As such, the relative humidity within the package is consistently less than $10 \%$ in extreme conditions and ensures the test-strip is protected from humidity related effects.
