# IV Device/System Characteristics: A Device Description:

The microINR System is comprised of a portable measuring device (microINR Meter) and test strips (microINR Chips) in which the capillary blood sample flows through capillary action. The microINR Chip contains a reagent in dried form which consists of thromboplastin, and contains two symmetrical regions, the measuring channel and a control channel. The microINR Meter measures International Normalized Ratio (INR) based on a Prothrombin Time (PT) assay carried out in the microINR Chip based on microfluidic technology with machine vision detection.

The microINR System has a multi-level On-board Quality Control. Multiple key functions and elements of the system are checked and if deviations are detected, error messages are displayed and test results are not reported.

# B Principle of Operation:

The microINR System was previously cleared for professional use under premarket notification K180780. The test principle has not been modified:

The microINR System is a closed system, which is intended to be used exclusively with the microINR Chips manufactured by iLine Microsystems, S.L. The microINR System is a handheld in vitro diagnostic medical device that uses microfluidic technology with machine vision detection to measure the prothrombin time from a fresh capillary (fingerstick) whole blood

sample. The fresh capillary (fingerstick) whole blood sample is applied to the microINR Chips (test strips) for testing. The microINR Chip is inserted into the analyzer. Two microcapillary channels in the test strip are filled with the blood sample by capillary action. The microINR Chip contains a preparation of human recombinant tissue factor, synthetic phospholipids and stabilizers. The microINR Meter measures the International Normalized Ratio (INR) based on the Prothrombin Time (PT) assay carried out in the microINR Chip and displays the International Normalized Ratio (INR) on the screen.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: microINR System

2. Specimen Identification: Manual entering of patient identification

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The microINR Chip is intended for single-use only. Once the Chip is inserted into the device, a drop of fresh capillary whole blood sample collected by fingerstick is manually applied to the Chip and analyzed by the microINR Meter.

4. Calibration:

Each lot of microINR Chips is calibrated to a reference lot of human recombinant thromboplastin traced to International Reference Thromboplastin of the World Health Organization.

These calibration parameters (International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and Mean Normal Prothrombin Time (MNPT)) are encoded in the printed Datamatrix of each microINR Chip along with information related to expiration date. Therefore, every test is automatically and individually calibrated eliminating risk of human error.

5. Quality Control:

The microINR System provides both the Meter´s functional Quality Controls and On-Board Quality Controls.

First, Meter performance is automatically checked for electronic components, correct power battery level and environmental temperature conditions.

Then, On-Board Controls provide a quality control check for each individual microINR Chip used with the microINR Meter. The microINR System has been designed to detect errors prior to and during the test in order to prevent inaccurate INR results through a multi-level strategy.

A Home Use (self-testing) Study was performed at four point-of-care (POC) sites, where a total of 117 eligible subjects (patients stabilized on warfarin therapy and 18 years of age and older) were enrolled. The home use study was conducted with two microINR Meters per site and one lot of microINR Chips. Enrolled patients visited the POC site twice. At each visit, enrolled patients and the health care professionals alternately performed duplicate measurements. In addition, a venipuncture was performed at the second visit for INR determinations on the reference laboratory method (ACL TOP 500 with HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G) and the hematocrit assessment. The results obtained by trained users were compared with those obtained by health care professionals as well as the reference laboratory method. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed to assess the accuracy of the microINR measurements obtained by patients against results obtained by the health care professionals and the results from the reference laboratory method. All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

Self-testers enrolled in the study also participated in a questionnaire to survey the usability of the microINR System. On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is least favorable and 5 is most favorable, the mean score was 4.69.

# D Clinical Cut-Off:

Not applicable

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

Refer to K180780

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

The On-Board Quality Control (QC) System of the microINR System was validated for analyzing the effect of short sample application and different incorrect sample application methods including sample perturbation and intermittent applications. For each tested condition, clinical samples were collected to test the microINR System performance. A total of 55 fresh venous whole blood samples were obtained from 18 normal subjects and 37 patients under vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy with $\mathrm { I N R } \leq 4 . 5$ . Immediately after sample collection, the hematocrit level of patients was measured using the Mission Plus Hb Hemoglobin Testing System. The INR value was determined by the CoaguChek XS System to classify the samples in the required INR ranges.

To assess short sample detection, blood samples with different reduced volumes were measured on the microINR System.

A sample perturbation study was performed to assess the effect of potentially reducing the volume of the applied sample. The remnant of the drop was absorbed using a piece of paper once the measurement started.

An intermittent sampling study was conducted by applying a short sample volume to the microINR Chip, and once the INR measurement began, adding more sample volume before the

INR measurement was complete. It was performed by using different application modes simulating different real-life misuse situations.

All results for tested fault condition met the pre-defined acceptance criteria, demonstrating the adequate performance of the microINR System under different types of incorrect sample application, including short sample, sample perturbation and intermittent sampling application.
