# D Special Instrument Requirements:

None

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The HemoCue Hb 301 System provides a direct reading of the hemoglobin concentration in a sample using single-use microcuvettes and a photometer (analyzer). The HemoCue Hb 301 System consists of the following components:

• An analyzer supporting the following features: o Photometric determination of hemoglobin $\bigcirc$ Presentation of results on a display   
• Power supply by power adapter or batteries Single use microcuvettes made of polystyrene plastic which do not contain reagents or active ingredients

# B Principle of Operation:

The microcuvette serves both as a pipette and as a measuring cuvette. No dilution or other preparation of the blood sample is required before filling of the microcuvette. A whole blood sample of approximately $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ is drawn into the cavity in the microcuvette by capillary action.

The measurement takes place in the analyzer, which measures the absorbance of whole blood at an Hb/HbO2 isosbestic point. The analyzer measures at two wavelengths (506 and $8 8 0 \mathrm { n m } ,$ ) in order to compensate for turbidity. The measurement is performed directly on the whole blood through measurement of the transmitted and scattered light and using an algorithm for translation into the hemoglobin concentration of the sample.

The HemoCue Hb 301 System is traceable to the hemiglobincyanide (HiCN) method, the international reference method according to International Council for Standardization in Hematology (ICSH) for the determination of the hemoglobin concentration in blood.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: HemoCue® Hb 301 System

2. Specimen Identification:

There is no specimen identification function for the HemoCue Hb 301 system.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The HemoCue 301 microcuvette draws a small amount (approximately $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ) of venous or capillary blood by capillary effect. The filled microcuvette is inserted into the microcuvette holder in the HemoCue Hb 301 analyzer.

4. Calibration:

The HemoCue Hb 301 System is factory calibrated and needs no further calibration.

5. Quality Control:

The HemoCue Hb 301 Analyzer has an internal quality control, a self-test. Every time the analyzer is turned on, it will automatically verify the system performance. This test is performed at regular intervals if the analyzer remains switched on.

If an external quality control is required by local or other regulations, commercially available controls recommended by HemoCue should be used.
