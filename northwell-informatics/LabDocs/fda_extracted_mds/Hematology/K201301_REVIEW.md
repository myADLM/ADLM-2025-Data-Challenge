II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: Clearance of a new device

# B Type of Test:

White blood cell (WBC) differential, red blood cell (RBC) morphology evaluation and platelet estimation

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The X100 with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application is intended to locate and display images of white cells, red cells, and platelets acquired from fixed and stained peripheral blood smears and assists a qualified technologist in conducting a WBC differential, RBC morphology evaluation, and platelet estimate using those images. For in vitro diagnostic use only. For professional use only.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

X100 with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear (PBS) Application automatically locates and presents images of blood cells on peripheral smears. The user browses through the imaged smear to gain high-level general impression. The user reviews the suggested classification of each white cell according to type and may manually change the suggested classification of any cell. The user can also characterize red cell morphology on observed images. In addition, the system suggests the location of platelets. The user reviews each detected platelet and the suggested platelet estimation and may manually change the detections or the estimation. The Full Field PBS is intended to be used by skilled users, trained in the use of the device and in the identification of blood cells.

The Full Field PBS consists of two major components: 1) The X100 Microscope, an optic scanning unit where sample slides are inserted to the digital microscope for imaging, and 2) The X100 Scopiobox, an operating and analyzing computer which controls the X100 microscope and serves the Full Field PBS application.

To acquire a high-resolution image, the sample slide is moved by the X100 microscope positioning stage under its main optic tube, which has a microscope objective with a tube lens and high-resolution camera. The X100 microscope captures multiple images of the sample under a plurality of illumination conditions (different durations, different illumination angles, different illumination patterns, different wavelengths), without the need for immersion oil. Using a physical model and the captured images, the X100 Scopiobox reconstructs high-resolution images of the sample.

# B Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

X100 with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application

2. Specimen Identification:

The slide’s barcode is captured automatically and assigned to each case. The device also supports typing the barcode manually.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

A peripheral blood sample collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ or $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA tubes is mixed manually or automatically. A thin blood film is wedged on a clean dry glass slide (a blood smear) and stained with Romanowsky stain. After the staining process is completed, the slide is covered using any standard cover slipping method.

4. Calibration:

The Full Field PBS system requires initial calibration for its mechanical and optical performances. An initial calibration process is performed on a standard blood smear slide as part of the manufacturing process of the device. The calibration is verified after installation by a technician or a qualified operator. Calibration can also be performed if a problem arises in the daily QC testing.

# 5. Quality Control:

Quality Control (QC) testing is performed on a daily basis (“daily QC”). The daily QC involves testing a standard blood smear slide prepared on the same day. During the daily QC the user reviews the images received from the Full Field PBS and verifies that at least $9 5 \%$ of the WBCs in the scanned image were identified and located correctly by the system. The Full Field PBS application maintains a digital QC log, enabling the user to review and to track the history of QC testing performed by the Full Field PBS.

# Method Comparison

A Method Comparison study was conducted to compare the results achieved by trained examiners using the X100 with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application (the Test Method) to the results achieved by using a manual light microscope. The study was performed according to the CLSI H20-A2: Reference Leukocyte (WBC) Differential Count (Proportional) and Evaluation of Instrumental Methods; Approved Standard— Second Edition.

A total of 645 specimens were collected and analyzed at three sites. 335 specimens were from normal (healthy) subjects and 310 were from subjects with specific disease conditions. Slides were prepared from each specimen. The slides were randomly selected, blinded and evaluated by two examiners at each site.

# White Blood Cells

Following analysis at each site, a pooled analysis of the multi-center results was conducted. The following table summarizes the results of the Deming regression comparison method for the multi-center study. All $9 5 \%$ CI of slope and intercept and Pearson correlation coefficient met the acceptance criteria for accuracy measured by Deming regression for WBC differential.

Overall WBC differential efficiency (agreement), sensitivity and specificity were measured, as well as for distributional WBC (Band and Segmented Neutrophil, Monocyte, Lymphocyte and Eosinophil) and morphological WBC (Immature Granulocyte, Variant Forms Lymphocyte, Blast, NRBC and Plasma cell) between subject device and manual microscope.

Predicted bias analysis (Bland-Altman) of WBC differential is summarized below. The mean differences and $9 5 \%$ limits of agreements per cell type were measured.

# Red Blood Cells

Results of overall agreement for RBC morphology evaluation are shown below. Results passed pre-defined acceptance criteria.

# Method Comparison Study of 100 to 200 WBC Differential and 5 to 10 FOV Platelet Estimation

All slides from the Method Comparison study were also analyzed by Full Field PBS device using 100 WBC differential and 5 FOV platelet estimation. The results were compared to the 200 WBC differential and 10 FOV platelet estimation of the manual light microscope. Accuracy (Deming Regression), efficiency, sensitivity and specificity were measured.
