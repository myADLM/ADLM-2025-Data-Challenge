# B Indication(s) for Use:

The ROTEM sigma thromboelastometry system is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic system designed to monitor and analyze a patient’s coagulation status by measuring the viscoelastic properties of a $3 . 2 \%$ citrated venous or arterial whole blood sample. The ROTEM sigma system is indicated for use with adult patients 21 years and older where a semiquantitative evaluation of their blood coagulation properties is desired, in the point of care and laboratory settings. Coagulation evaluations on the ROTEM sigma instrument, together with the ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge, are used to assess peri-operative hemorrhage and/or thrombosis in cardiovascular surgery and liver transplantation.

The single use, multichannel cartridge ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep contains the following assays:

INTEM C is a semi-quantitative assay used to monitor coagulation via the intrinsic pathway in citrated whole blood samples.

EXTEM C is a semi-quantitative assay used to monitor coagulation via the extrinsic pathway in citrated whole blood samples.

FIBTEM C is a semi-quantitative assay used to monitor coagulation via the extrinsic pathway in citrated whole blood samples, after blocking platelet contribution to clot firmness.

HEPTEM C is a semi-quantitative assay used to monitor coagulation via the intrinsic pathway in citrated whole blood samples, after inactivating heparin.

Results from the ROTEM sigma should not be the sole basis for a patient diagnosis; ROTEM sigma results should be considered along with a clinical assessment of the patient’s condition and other laboratory tests.

For in vitro Diagnostic use. For professional use only.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The ROTEM sigma Thromboelastometry System is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) whole blood hemostasis system intended for use in the evaluation of coagulopathies in Point of Care (POC) or laboratory settings. It uses rotational thromboelastometry to provide semi-quantitative information about the coagulation state of a blood sample. The ROTEM sigma system records the kinetic changes in a $3 . 2 \%$ citrated whole blood sample during clot formation, as well as when the sample clot retracts and/or lyses. Several parameters, including clotting time, clot firmness, and clot lysis index, are measured and reported for this purpose. The graphical presentation, or reaction curve (TEMogram) created in real time and displayed along with numerical values of associated parameters, reflects the various physiological results, which describe the interaction between coagulation factors and inhibitors, fibrinogen, platelets, and the fibrinolysis system. Additionally, the test can detect the effect of anticoagulant heparin on hemostasis.

The ROTEM sigma Thromboelastometry System consists of:

• ROTEM sigma instrument   
• ROTEM sigma cartridges o ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep (with assays INTEM C, EXTEM C, FIBTEM C, HEPTEM C)   
• ROTEM sigma system QC (Quality Control) cartridge   
• ROTEM sigma controls o ROTEM sigma ROTROL N o ROTEM sigma ROTROL P

# B Principle of Operation:

The ROTEM sigma Thromboelastometry System technology uses rotational thromboelastometry that is based on a fixed cylindrical cup and an oscillating vertical axis. The axis is supported by a high precision ball bearing and oscillates through an angle. Oscillation of the axis is driven by a motor. For the measurement, the channel’s measurement axis engages the plastic pin in the cup of the disposable heated cartridge holding the blood sample. The oscillation is detected optically. If no clotting takes place, the pin movement is not restricted. As a clot forms and attaches itself between the pin and cup surfaces, the pin movement becomes increasingly restricted. As the clot becomes firmer, the oscillation amplitude of the axis is reduced.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: ROTEM sigma

2. Specimen Identification: The user can scan information from blood samples and ROTROL vials in the instrument using the barcode reader.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Blood samples are to be collected in accordance with CLSI GP41: Procedures for the Collection of Diagnostic Blood Specimen by Venipuncture; Approved Standard - Seventh Edition.

Samples should be stored at room temperature and not placed on ice. Do not shake or roll sample tubes. Sample pipetting is automated, and the instrument is capable of cap piercing.

4. Calibration: The ROTEM sigma instrument is factory calibrated.

5. Quality Control:

Different levels of quality control (QC) are implemented to ensure that the ROTEM sigma system functions as intended. This includes internal system QC with the ROTEM sigma system QC cartridge for system functionality testing, and external QC using ROTROL N / ROTROL P:

System QC: System QC checks the functional integrity of the instrument hardware and should be performed weekly or according to local regulations. The system QC cartridge is a cartridge like the assay cartridges, except without needle, reagents, and mixing ball and with more robust fluidic valves to withstand repeated testing. If the ROTEM sigma system QC cartridge is not available, any other unused test cartridge can be used for system QC. In order to ensure the ROTEM sigma is not damaged, it is important to use a new test cartridge when performing the system QC.

External QC (EQC) with ROTEM sigma ROTROL N and ROTROL P: Tests with standardized 2-level quality control (QC) materials (ROTEM sigma ROTROL N and ROTROL P) are performed to identify potential issues with the reagents in the ROTEM sigma cartridges. EQC is recommended to be performed on every new cartridge lot, every new cartridge delivery, and after system maintenance/repair.

\* ROTEM sigma does not utilize CFT or α angle. They are secondary parameters. Equivalent information is gained from early amplitude parameter A5. This is not a difference of the assay but of the instrument software. The functional parameters describing the clotting characteristics of the two assays are similar.

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability

To evaluate the precision performance of the new ROTEM sigma instrument and its assays with ROTROL controls, whole blood samples, and contrived whole blood samples, an internal repeatability study was performed on three lots of ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges. The control repeatability study involved three lots of each of the controls ROTEM sigma ROTROL N and ROTEM sigma ROTROL P. The whole blood repeatability study involved native donor normal whole blood samples and contrived hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable samples. The control study was run in duplicate, twice a day for 20 days, for a total of 80 replicates per control, using five instruments and four operators. The whole blood study was run in triplicate in one day on five instruments, for a total of 15 replicates per sample type. Due to the sample stability, the whole blood repeatability study was performed in one day and one run. For each assay type, except for FIBTEM C, the CT, A5, A10, A20, and MCF parameters were evaluated. CT is not a claimed parameter for FIBTEM C assay and was not evaluated in the repeatability study. The study mean, total SD and total $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for each precision parameter on each instrument were calculated for CT, A5, A10, A20, and A30 (controls) or MCF (whole blood).

# Repeatability Results Summary – CT, A5, A10, A20, and MCF

In the summary tables below, the highest $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for individual assay parameters from the repeatability studies using ROTROL N, ROTROL P and whole blood samples on three lots of cartridges are presented. Overall, the study results demonstrated performance repeatability of the ROTEM sigma system with respect to measuring CT, A5, A10, A20, and MCF parameters for control and whole blood samples.

# Lysis Precision Study – LI60 and ML

In an internal lysis precision study, the lysis parameters, LI60 and ML, were assessed for the INTEM C and EXTEM C assays of the ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge using normal donor whole blood and abnormal hyperfibrinolysis blood. This study was performed with three (3) lots of ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges. One donor per sample type and cartridge lot was tested on five instruments, with three replicates per instrument $\mathrm { N } = 5$ instruments $\textbf { X } 3$ replicates/instrument). Overall, the lysis precision study demonstrated the performance of the ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge and the associated assays in measuring the lysis parameters LI60 and ML. The highest SD and $\%$ CV of the three cartridge lots for the parameters LI60 and ML are summarized below.

# Lot-to-Lot Variability Study with Normal Donor Whole Blood.

To assess performance variability between lots of ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges, a precision study was conducted using donor whole blood. The study was for five days, with two runs per day, three replicates per run per cartridge lot. For each run, the same donor sample is used across all three cartridge lots. Ten different donor samples were used for the five-day study. Data was analyzed using a two-factor nested ANOVA with donor nested within lot. Overall, the data shows that similar results can be expected for different cartridge lots when running the same sample.

# Reproducibility

To assess the device’s performance reproducibility, reproducibility studies were performed at three (3) external point of care sites on one (1) lot of ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges using four (4) ROTEM sigma instruments per site and three (3) lots each of the controls ROTEM sigma ROTROL N and ROTEM sigma ROTROL P. The study was run in triplicate twice a day for five (5) days, for a total of thirty (30) replicates per control.

Estimates of reproducibility based on the aggregate data were obtained via a three-way nested ANOVA. The pooled data from three (3) external sites for each control lot are presented below. Overall, the performance across all three sites lies within the specified acceptance criteria.

# Interference – UF Heparin, LMW Heparin, Tranexamic acid, ε-Aminocaproic acid, Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin), Ticagrelor, and Lupus Anticoagulant

Interference studies were conducted to assess the interference of UF Heparin, LMW Heparin, Tranexamic acid, ε-Aminocaproic acid, Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin), Ticagrelor, and lupus anticoagulant on the ROTEM sigma with each of the sigma assays (INTEM C, EXTEM C, FIBTEM C, and HEPTEM C). Three interference levels were evaluated (baseline, claim and greater than claim) for each interference substance. For all interferent except lupus anticoagulant, normal donor whole blood and abnormal hypocoagulable whole blood were used. For each interferent and blood sample type, a single pool was prepared from whole blood from one donor. This pool was distributed evenly into baseline, claim, and above claim levels. Each level was spiked with the interferent to the desired concentration and evenly aliquoted. The results of each interferent level were compared to the results at baseline (normal) level. If the $\%$ difference from baseline exceeded the predetermined acceptance criteria, then interference has occurred.

Another interference study was performed using normal whole blood samples to determine the impact of lupus anticoagulant on the same assays. Eleven normal whole blood samples were used. Each donor sample was run on three instruments with one replicate per instrument. Three interferent levels were tested, including baseline, claim, and greater than claim as shown in the table below.

# Interference – Hematocrit

Whole blood samples with three different hematocrit $\mathrm { ( H c t ) }$ levels (low- $23 \%$ Hct, normal$40 \%$ Hct and high- $5 5 \%$ Hct) were evaluated. The results for low and high hematocrit samples were compared to the results for normal hematocrit sample. The study results showed that compared to normal hematocrit samples, low hematocrit samples showed little change or a shortening of CT and an increase in amplitude parameters (A5, A10, A20, MCF), while compared to normal hematocrit samples, high hematocrit samples showed a prolongation of CT and a decrease in amplitude parameters (A5, A10, A20, MCF).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

# Shelf-Life Stability

A study was conducted to evaluate the shelf-life stability of the ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge. The study tested three lots of cartridge using normal whole blood and contrived whole blood samples and two lots of normal control ROTROL N. The trended ROTROL N testing was performed to ensure that the base set of reagents in the extrinsic and intrinsic assays were stable over time independently of the inhibitors that are present in the other assays. The test cartridges were stored at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested at different time points. Overall, the shelf-life test results support a 24-month shelf-life claim for ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

# In-Use Stability

An in-use stability study was performed to support the claim that the ROTEM sigma cartridges are stable if they are used within 10 minutes of opening the sealed pouch. One lot of ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge was tested. Sample type included normal whole blood, abnormal hypocoagulable blood, and abnormal hypercoagulable blood. Opened sample cartridges were stored in a temperature and humidity-controlled chamber set to room temperature $( 2 1 . 6 { - } 2 3 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $5 5 . 3 \substack { - 5 9 . 6 \% }$ relative humidity. Cartridges were used at three time points. Overall, the study results support the cartridge in-use stability claim of 10 minutes at room temperature.

# Transport Stability

To assess transport stability for the reagents used in the ROTEM sigma cartridges, a study simulating the influence of elevated and freezing temperatures, which might occur during transport, by subjecting the cartridges to different stressing conditions including no precondition room temperature $( 1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , low temperature preconditioning $\leq - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for at least 24 hours) and high temperature preconditioning ( $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5 days), was conducted. The study evaluated one lot of ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge using normal whole blood samples, contrived whole blood samples and one lot of normal control (ROTROL N). Each test run consists of three cartridges, each having undergone a different preconditioning as described above. The results with temperature precondition were compared to the results without precondition. Overall, the transport stress testing for the ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge met the predefined criteria. The results demonstrate transport stability of ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge at temperatures $\leq - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours and $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5 days.

# Sample Stability

A sample stability study was performed to assess the stability of fresh citrated whole blood samples at room temperature used on the ROTEM sigma. Test samples included normal whole blood samples, abnormal hypocoagulable samples, and abnormal hypercoagulable samples. One lot of ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge was used. Samples were run at three time points. Overall, the results meet the predetermined acceptance criteria and support the sample stability claim of 4 hours for whole blood samples ran on the ROTEM sigma using the ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was conducted at four clinical sites, with a minimum of two trained POC operators at each site, to compare the performance of ROTEM sigma instrument and assays to that of the predicate ROTEM delta instrument and assays using venous or arterial whole blood patient samples from the intended use populations (cardiac surgery and liver transplantation) and contrived samples. Citrated whole blood samples, collected from 181 patients 21 years and older, were used in this method comparison study.

The evaluated ROTEM parameters included CT, A5, A10, A20, MCF, LI60 and ML for EXTEM C and INTEM C assays, A5, A10, A20 and MCF for FIBTEM C assay, and CT, A5, A10, A20, and MCF for HEPTEM C assay. Parameter results were obtained from tests run in singlicate. All evaluated parameters were analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman plots. Slopes and intercepts, along with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals, were calculated from the respective regression fit. Correlation coefficients were also computed. The bias (with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals) between ROTEM sigma results and the ROTEM delta predicate results was calculated from the regression fit at the extremes of the reference interval and is presented along with Bland-Altman difference plots over the entire reference interval. For the FIBTEM assay the parameter CT, LI60, and ML were not evaluated, since they are not claimed parameters for this assay. Also, LI60 and ML were not evaluated for HEPTEM C, as they are not claimed parameters for this assay.

The results for ROTEM sigma with ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridge versus the ROTEM delta are presented below.

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

A matrix comparison study using 74 matched venous and arterial citrated whole blood samples was performed at two external clinical sites to evaluate the difference in test results for venous and arterial blood on the EXTEM C, INTEM C, FIBTEM C, and HEPTEM C and assays. The study was performed using four ROTEM sigma instruments at each site. Seventy-four matched venous and arterial citrated whole blood samples were collected into evacuated collection tubes containing $3 . 2 \%$ sodium citrate and analyzed in singlicate on ROTEM sigma systems using ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges.

The pointwise biases of the paired differences were calculated. The pooled data summary results for the ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges are presented in the tables below. Overall, the results demonstrated that venous and arterial whole blood samples are equivalent on the ROTEM sigma system with the ROTEM sigma complete $^ +$ hep cartridges.
