Dear Niya Su:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

The cleared FACSLyric flow cytometer will be modified as follows:

Modification 1: Minor changes to FACSuite Clinical software, FACSLyric Cytometer Management System (CMS) firmware and FACS Universal Loader hardware to allow for the integration with FACSDuet instrument.   
Modification 2: The addition of FACSDuet instrument as an optional automated sample preparation accessory to FACSLyric Flow Cytometer.

The intended/indications for use, fundamental scientific technology, acquisition and analysis on FACSLyric flow cytometer system are the same as the predicate device.

FACSDuet instrument is an automated sample preparation instrument that is data integrated with FACSLyric flow cytometer, and may also be physically integrated. It is an optional accessory to the FACSLyric flow cytometer system. FACSDuet instrument will be used with BD Multitest reagents (which utilized the FDA’s draft guidance, Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices, issued on December 18, 2017) for use on FACSLyric flow cytometer.

# 5. Indications for Use

# 5.1 BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer, FACS Universal Loader, FACSuite Clinical Software, Multitest 6-Color and 4-Color Assay Modules, FACSFlow Sheath Fluid, and CS&T Beads

The same as the predicate device.

# 5.2 BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation System

The BD FACSLyric flow cytometer with the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation System is intended for use as an in vitro diagnostic device for immunophenotyping using up to six fluorescence detection channels and two light scatter channels using a blue (488-nm) and a red $( 6 4 0 – \mathrm { n m } )$ laser. It includes an automated sample preparation system used to prepare human peripheral whole blood samples for acquisition and analysis and is intended for use with in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays and software that are indicated for use with the instrument.

# 5.3 BD FC Beads 7-Color Kit

The same as the predicate device with minor correction in the statement.

The BD FC Beads 7-Color kit (BD FC Beads), in conjunction with BD FACSuite Clinical software and BD CS&T beads, is used to establish fluorescence compensation for the BD FACSLyric flow cytometer.

# 6. Multiple Functions Device

The following statement is provided, according to the FDA draft guidance, Multiple Function Device Products: Policy and Considerations, dated April 27, 2018.

The products have functions subject to FDA premarket review and functions that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, FDA assessed functions not subject to premarket review only insofar as they might adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.

# 7. Substantial Equivalence Comparison between Subject Devices and Predicate Device
