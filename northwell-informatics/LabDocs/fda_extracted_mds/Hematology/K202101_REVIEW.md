# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The GEM Hemochron 100 system is a battery-operated, point-of-care coagulation analyzer that represents the next generation platform of the predicate Hemochron™ Signature Elite microcoagulation system. Like the Hemochron Signature Elite instrument, the GEM Hemochron 100 is designed to be used with $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR cuvettes in vitro diagnostic tests designed to determine the Activated Clotting Time (ACT) of fresh whole blood samples at both low (ACTLR) and high $( \mathrm { A C T ^ { + } } )$ levels of heparin doses. The GEM Hemochron 100 employs the same fundamental opto-mechanical clot detection technology and the same analytical algorithms used by the predicate device for calculating test results. The single-use test cartridges for Activated Whole Blood Clotting Time Plus $( \mathrm { A C T ^ { + } } )$ or Low Range ACT (ACT-LR) assays are identical to the cartridges used by the predicate analyzer. Whole Blood Controls used on the GEM Hemochron 100 system are identical to those used on the Hemochron™ Signature Elite. The system is intended for use only in clinical settings requiring point-of-care testing. ACT results for patient blood samples or liquid control material are displayed as ACT Celite-equivalent values (CEV) in seconds, for both test types.

The analyzer contains a test chamber which warms a test cuvette to the required temperature, and it performs all operations to measure the clotting time of a whole blood sample after it is placed in the test cuvette and the test is started by the operator. The user interface includes a color touch screen that displays various action keys and an external barcode scanner for reading Operator

identification number (OID), Patient identification (PID) number and lot numbers and expiration dates of liquid quality controls (QC). The operator uses the touch screen to select a command, set software configurations or enter information.

The GEM Hemochron 100 system is POCT1-A2 compliant and has Wi-Fi and Ethernet networking capability. It has increased storage for 10,000 patient and QC records. $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR cartridge labels are modified to include a 2D barcode that identifies test type, lot number and expiry date, which is readable by the internal camera. Quality control features such as designation of QC levels, tagging of test results with date and time, and entry of OID and PID numbers are included and are similar to the predicate device.

The device contains an 802.11 interface which supports WPA2 encryption as well as EAP authentication framework. The device is able to connect to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) via $8 0 2 . 1 1 \ \mathrm { b / g / n }$ connections at 2.4 and 5 GHz. The communications interfaces supported by the device are utilized to configure or update the device software by supervisory staff before deployment to the intended use environment and in the reporting of test results to the Laboratory or Hospital Information Systems by the clinical operators at the point of care. Test results are used directly at the point of care in aiding medical decision making, and the device’s intended use is not reliant on the device’s ability to transmit the information to the LIS/HIS.

# directCHECK Whole Blood Controls Marketed with GEM Hemochron 100

The directCHECK Whole Blood Quality Controls are dried whole blood preparations which have been assayed and are intended to be used to perform quality control assays using the Hemochron test cartridges. Two levels of control are available for each type of activated clotting time test.

• directCHECK ACT $^ +$ Whole Blood Control (Normal) • directCHECK ACT $^ +$ Whole Blood Control (Abnormal) • directCHECK ACT-LR Whole Blood Control (Normal) • directCHECK ACT-LR Whole Blood Control (Abnormal)

# Description of Device Changes:

The design of the subject device upgrades the user interface, expands data storage capacity, adds

Wi-Fi networking, and adds new and/or enhanced functionality. Enhancements in the GEM Hemochron 100 system when compared to the predicate include:

• Color touchscreen • 2D barcoded cartridges labels providing assay type, lot number and expiry date • Camera to monitor clot detection and decode 2D barcodes on cartridge labels • Expanded storage for OID and PID numbers, and patient and QC records • Upgraded the OS from that of the predicate device to Android Nougat Improved communication interface with addition of Wi-Fi networking

# B Principle of Operation:

The GEM Hemochron 100 system measures whole blood ACT using single-use disposable cartridges. Each cartridge contains all of the reagents necessary for a specified test. The Operator inserts a cartridge into the instrument where the internal camera reads the information from a barcode. Once the cartridge is warmed to the specified temperature, the instrument prompts the Operator to add a blood sample into the cartridge sample well. Testing is initiated by pressing the Start Test icon on the touch screen. When the test begins, the instrument draws blood from the sample well into the test channel of the cartridge, where the blood is mixed with the reagent. The remaining blood sample, not needed for testing, is automatically drawn out of the sample well and into an enclosed waste channel in the cartridge.

The instrument mixes the sample and reagent by pumping the mixture back and forth at a predetermined rate within the test channel at a specified temperature. The optical system (internal camera system) monitors the motion of the sample and reagent in the test channel. As the blood begins to clot, the flow of the blood sample within the test channel is impeded, which reduces its rate of flow. Flow reduction below a predetermined value signals to the instrument that a fibrin clot has formed. An internal timer measures the elapsed time between the start of the test and the clot formation. During the test, the elapsed time is displayed as ACT Celiteequivalent values (CEV) in seconds. Upon completion of the test, the CEV is displayed and recorded by the instrument.

Test results (patient tests, EQC tests, and LQC tests) are saved in the instrument internal database. As many as 10,000 test results can be saved on the instrument. The results can also be sent to a computer (HIS/LIS) on the network via the GEMweb Plus 500 middleware.

GEMweb Plus 500 is middleware compatible to communicate with the GEM Hemochron 100 system. It allows networking of a group of analyzers and provides remote access for managing analytical devices and operator profiles. More specifically, the middleware is limited to sending data on operator credentials, liquid quality control lot information, and test cartridge lot information. In addition, the middleware can receive and relay test results from the GEM Hemochron 100 instrument. The GEMweb Plus 500 middleware does not support software upgrades, control of critical device settings and configurations, and initiation of alarms.

The GEM Hemochron 100 system includes Windows-based centralized configuration manager (CCM) software that is substantially equivalent to Hemochron Configuration Manager (HCM) software included with the predicate. HCM was originally cleared with the Hemochron™

Signature Plus Whole Blood Microcoagulation System (K020798), which is the predicate for the Elite.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: GEM Hemochron 100 System

2. Specimen Identification:

Entry and control of Operator identification (OID) and Patient identification (PID) via touch screen and/or barcode scanning.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Single-use disposable cartridges are used by the system. Each cartridge contains all of the reagents necessary for a specified test. The operator inserts a cartridge into the instrument where the internal camera reads the information from a barcode. Once the cartridge is warmed to the specified temperature, the instrument prompts the operator to add a blood sample into the cartridge sample well. Testing is initiated by pressing the Start Test icon on the touch screen. When the test begins, the instrument draws blood from the sample well into the test channel of the cartridge, where the blood is mixed with the reagent. The remaining blood sample, not needed for testing, is automatically drawn out of the sample well and into an enclosed waste channel in the cartridge.

4. Calibration: Not applicable

5. Quality Control:

The GEM Hemochron 100 instrument should have two levels of quality control performed every 8 hours of operation. This requirement can be accomplished by conducting internal Electronic Quality Control (EQC) and/or external Liquid Quality Control (LQC) testing. Performance of the GEM Hemochron 100 test cartridges should be validated with two levels of LQC using directCHECK Quality Control products.

# Lot-to-Lot Precision Study

A precision study using two lots of each cartridge (cuvette) type was performed to assess the lot-to-lot variability. The study design involved one site, 20 days, two runs per day, two replicates per run, across two lots of each cartridge type $\mathrm { ( A C T ^ { + } }$ and ACT-LR), with each lot run on four instruments by two operators. One lot of each directCHECK liquid quality control level (Level 1 and Level 2) was used. At each LQC level, estimates of within-run, between-run, between-day, between-instrument, between-operator, between-lot, and total (within-laboratory) precision were obtained. The results, which all met acceptance criteria, are summarized in the tables below. Overall, the study results demonstrated acceptable precision across different lots of assay cartridge.

# Whole Blood Precision

For the whole blood precision study, sample stability concerns warranted utilization of 10 instruments, two operators (each running five GEM Hemochron 100 instruments) each performing two replicates of each sample $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 0 )$ ). Five ACT levels were tested with $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and four ACT levels were tested with ACT-LR. The ACT levels were targeted such that they spanned the target measurement range of each assay. Each donor whole blood sample was tested at only one heparin level (i.e., one target clotting time). Intravenous blood was obtained and heparinized to the desired clotting time. $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ has a linear range of between 1.0 and 6.0 units/mL of heparin, and therefore samples other than baseline which contained less than 1.0 units/mL of heparin were not tested. ACT-LR has a linear range of between 0 and 2.5 units $ { / \mathrm { m L } }$ of heparin, and therefore only samples within this range were used. Estimates of whole blood precision within-instrument, between-instrument, between operator and within-laboratory were obtained and summary data for this study is provided in the tables below. Overall, whole blood precision of GEM Hemochron $1 0 0 \mathrm { A C T ^ { + } }$ and ACT-LR cartridges met the acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity:

A linearity study was conducted, per CLSI EP06-A, to validate the linear range claim. Three cartridge lots were evaluated with two donors for each cartridge lot, or a total of six donors were tested for $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR assay, respectively. Each donor’s blood sample responded to heparin independently and a conclusion was made based on six sets of linearity test data. Seven heparin concentration levels were tested for each donor with eight data points by use of eight GEM Hemochron 100 instruments (i.e., one run on each instrument). Correlation between readings from the GEM Hemochron 100 instrument and heparin levels was evaluated by use of both linear and polynomial regression to define best fitting. Overall, the $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ assay on the GEM Hemochron 100 instrument demonstrated linear correlation of activated clotting time reading to heparin concentrations from 1.0 to 6.0 units/mL, and the ACT-LR assay on the GEM Hemochron 100 instrument demonstrated linear correlation of activated clotting time reading to heparin concentrations from 0 to 2.5 units/mL.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

# a. Internal Method Comparison Study

An internal method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR assays on the GEM Hemochron 100 (GH100) platform versus the Hemochron Signature Elite (SE) platform, and to determine whether the results are statistically equivalent across the measurement range. The study utilized fresh whole blood samples from healthy donors which were spiked with different concentrations of heparin to cover the measurement range.

The study design involved samples from 40 individuals tested in duplicate for each assay type $\mathrm { ( A C T ^ { + } }$ and ACT-LR) and six instrument pairs (of GEM H100 and Signature Elite). One lot of each $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR cartridge type was used. For the $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ assays, samples were tested at baseline and spiked with UFH to final concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 units/mL. The results were compared and the bias was determined at medical decision levels of 400s and 500s. For the ACT-LR assays, samples were tested at baseline and spiked with UFH to final concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 units/mL. The results were compared and the bias was determined at medical decision levels of 225s and 300s.

Passing-Bablok regression was performed using the first replicate obtained from each assay. The results from the Passing-Bablok analysis for the first replicate are shown below for $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR assays. Slopes and intercepts, along with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals, were calculated from the respective regression fit. Correlation coefficients were also computed. Overall, the results demonstrated that, for the levels of UFH tested, the results of $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR assays ran on the GEM Hemochron 100 were comparable to the results of $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR assays ran on the Hemochron Signature Elite.

# b. External Method Comparison Study

In addition to the Internal Method Comparison study, an External Method Comparison study was conducted at seven clinical sites in the United States, which were chosen for their specific representation of different types of sites and conditions expected during commercial clinical use, with trained users representative of point-of-care (POC) professional operators.

The study compared the GEM Hemochron 100 System against the predicate device Hemochron Signature Elite using patient fresh whole blood samples destined for discard. $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ cartridges were used in the cardiovascular operating room on patients with cardiac disease undergoing various cardiac surgery procedures, as well as on patients necessitating cardiac ablation in the electrophysiology lab. ACT-LR cartridges were used in various settings on patients requiring extracorporeal life support (ECLS) due to underlying heart and/or lung disease, as well as on patients with cardiac disease undergoing cardiac catheterization. For each ACT subject sample tested, two GEM Hemochron 100 instruments and two Hemochron Signature Elite instruments were needed. Each sample was assayed on paired GEM Hemochron 100 and paired Hemochron Signature Elite instruments by at least three trained operators at each site representative of POC users at a minimum of three clinical sites per cartridge type $\mathrm { \ A C T ^ { + } }$ or ACT-LR).

Analysis methodology included linear regressions using Passing-Bablok analysis with the intercept and slope (along with the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval associated with each estimate), Bland-Altman plots of differences, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r), overall average bias and bias at predefined clinically important decision points. These values were calculated for first replicate, at ranges appropriate for the cuvette type. The bias (with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals) between GEM Hemochron 100 results and the Hemochron Signature Elite predicate results was calculated from the regression fit at the reference intervals (medical decision levels from Table 20). The results from the analysis using the first replicate are shown below for $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR assays.

A study was conducted, per CLSI EP28-A3c, to establish the reference intervals for $\mathrm { { A C T + } }$ and ACT-LR assays (000GACT $^ +$ and 000GACT-LR cartridges) on the GEM Hemochron 100 platform. The intervals were established for both healthy normal donors and for non-heparinized patients. The study included 120 donors for each subclass (normal donors and non-heparinized patients) and for each assay type. A nonparametric $9 5 \%$ reference interval was established for each subclass and $90 \%$ confidence interval limits were computed for each reference limit.
