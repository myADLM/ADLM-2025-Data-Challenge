# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

The purpose of the submission is to add a Slide Loader to the cleared X100 with Full Field PBS (K201301) that allows up to 30 slides to be analyzed.

# B Type of Test:

White blood cell (WBC) differential, red blood cell (RBC) morphology evaluation and platelet estimation

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

B Indication(s) for Use:

The X100HT with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application is intended to locate and display images of white cells, red cells, and platelets acquired from fixed and stained peripheral blood smears and assists a qualified technologist in conducting a WBC differential, RBC morphology evaluation, and platelet estimate using those images. For in vitro diagnostic use only. For professional use only.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The X100HT with Slide Loader and Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear automatically locates and presents images of blood cells on peripheral blood film smears. The user browses through the imaged smear to gain high-level general impression. The user reviews the suggested classification of each white cell according to type and may manually change the suggested classification of any cell. The user can evaluate red cell morphology on observed images. The user reviews each detected platelet and the suggested platelet estimation and may manually change the detections or the estimation. The X100HT with Full Field PBS is intended to be used by skilled users, trained in the use of the device and in the identification of blood cells.

The X100HT with Full Field PBS shares the same intended use as the previously 510(k)-cleared X100 Full Field PBS (K201301). Specifically, it is comprised of the identical X100 scanner and Full Field PBS application, but it is assembled with an external Slide Loader, and additional slide locks were added to the X100 tray. A minor software change to the ‘Scanning’ interface was also introduced to allow interaction with the Slide Loader. The Slide Loader was designed as an optional manufacturer assembly part to the cleared X100 scanner, to replace this preliminary need of a manual mounting media application and a coverslip placement. As with the predicate, the preparation of the stained blood smear and barcoding of the slide are identical for the X100HT and are still externally prepared by the user, either manually or by third party devices. The Slide Loader comes with three cassettes, each cassette may hold up to 10 slides. The user manually inserts non-cover slipped PBS-stained blood smear slides into the cassettes. In turn, the Slide Loader, upon the user’s request, adds mounting media, cover slips each slide and loads them sequentially into the X100 for processing.

# B Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: X100HT with Slide Loader with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application

2. Specimen Identification:

The slide’s barcode is captured automatically and assigned to each case. The device also supports typing the barcode manually.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

A peripheral blood sample collected in K2EDTA or K3EDTA tubes is mixed manually or automatically. A thin blood film is wedged on a clean dry glass slide (a blood smear) and stained with Romanowsky stain. The user manually places up to 30 slides into 3 extractable

cassettes and inserts them into the Slide Loader. The Slide Loader sequentially inserts the slides into the scanner. The instrument automatically coverslips and adds immersion oil to slide for scanning.

# 4. Calibration:

The Full Field PBS system requires initial calibration for its mechanical and optical performances. An initial calibration process is performed on a standard blood smear slide as part of the manufacturing process of the device. The calibration is verified after installation by a technician or a qualified operator. Calibration can also be performed if a problem arises in the daily QC testing.

# 5. Quality Control:

Quality Control (QC) testing is performed on a daily basis (“daily QC”). The daily QC involves testing a standard blood smear slide prepared on the same day. During the daily QC the user reviews the images received from the Full Field PBS and verifies that at least $9 5 \%$ of the WBCs in the scanned image were identified and located correctly by the system. The Full Field PBS application maintains a digital QC log, enabling the user to review and to track the history of QC testing performed by the Full Field PBS.
