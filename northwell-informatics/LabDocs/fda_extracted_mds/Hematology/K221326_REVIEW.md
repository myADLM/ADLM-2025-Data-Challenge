# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay is a fully automated assay for the determination of the percentage of HbA1c in capillary fingerstick whole blood and the calculation of estimated average glucose (eAG). The Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridge contains all reagents required for the determination of $\%$ HbA1c and includes an integrated capillary sample collection device.

The sample material is collected with the capillary sample device and the capillary device is inserted back into the test cartridge before the test cartridge is inserted into the Allegro Analyzer. The Test Cartridge has a barcode label with lot specific information. Estimated Average Glucose is the average glucose levels for the past 60 to 90 days calculated using the following NGSP1 recommended formula: eAG $( \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d l } ) = 2 8 . 7 \times \mathrm { A l C } - 4 6 . 7 .$ .

1 Harmonizing Hemoglobin A1c Testing, https://ngsp.org/A1ceAG.asp

The Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridge contains the following:

• Reagent 1 - Lysis solution containing a small concentration of detergent and Azide in water   
• Reagent 2 - Polystyrene latex particles in water   
• Reagent 3 - Mouse monoclonal antibody in a buffered solution containing salts and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)   
• Reagent 4 - Goat polyclonal antibody in a buffered solution containing salts and Bovine Albumin (BSA)

The Nova Allegro Analyzer is a compact multi-assay analyzer for point-of-care testing, designed to work with Nova Allegro Test Cartridges. The analyzer supports multiple wavelengths that are used to measure the assay of interest. The analyzer contains two analytical bays where the singleuse test cartridges are analyzed. Only the right cartridge bay of the Allegro Analyzer can be used with Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges. When the HbA1c test cartridge bar code is scanned for analysis, the right bay of the analyzer will open. To support the HbA1c Assay, the instrument has a control feature to ensure for the correct sample type and sample volume.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Nova Allegro HbA1c test cartridge measures the total glycated hemoglobin and the total hemoglobin concentration. The ratio between them is proportional to the $\%$ HbA1c of the sample. The analyzer calculates the ratio. A whole blood sample containing hemoglobin A1c and total hemoglobin are nonspecifically absorbed to latex particles. The anti-human mouse HbA1c antibody reacts to form a complex. Agglutination occurs when polyclonal antibody specifically reacts with the mouse antibody bound to the hemoglobin A1c on the surface of the latex particles. The amount of agglutination is measured as absorbance. The HbA1c value is obtained from a stored calibration curve and displayed on the Nova Allegro Analyzer.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Nova Allegro Analyzer

Specimen identification can be done by scanning a patient identification bar code or by manual entry.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

A single-use, disposable capillary sample collection device, which is part of the HbA1c Assay Test Cartridge, is used to obtain $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ fingerstick capillary whole blood to the test cartridge. The capillary sample collection device containing the blood is inserted into the HbA1c test cartridge, then the test cartridge is placed into the sample bay within 1 minute of sample collection and the start icon is pressed to start analysis.

4. Calibration:

The reagent test cartridge includes a scannable 2D barcode containing the stored calibration curve. The HbA1c value is obtained using the stored calibration curve and is displayed on the Nova Allegro Analyzer.

5. Quality Control:

External Quality Control (QC) material is used to monitor the performance of the analyzer and the test cartridges used with the analyzer and to verify the analyzer is performing to specifications. QC recommendations are found in the labeling.

FS -fingerstick; VWB- venous whole blood

2. Linearity:

A study was performed using 11 whole blood samples with HbA1c concentrations spanning $4 . 0 \%$ to $1 5 . 4 \%$ . The 11 samples were created by mixing varying aliquots of a low and a high concentration sample. Each sample was assayed in replicates of four on one Nova Allegro Analyzer using one lot of Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges and the mean of replicates was compared to results obtained on the Tosoh G8 analyzer. The results from linear regression results are shown below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range Tested (%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Levels</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HbA1c</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.0 - 15.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.016</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.14</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.999</td></tr></table>

All deviations from linearity were within $\pm 5 \%$ . The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim that the Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay on the Nova Allegro Analyzer is linear across the measuring range of $4 . 0 - 1 4 . 0 \%$ HbA1c. If a test result is outside the Allegro’s measuring range, the analyzer will not display a HbA1c result. The analyzer screen shows a red bar graph flag and ${ < } 4 . 0 \%$ or ${ > } 1 4 . 0 \%$ are displayed. The analyzer printout shows 3 down arrows or 3 up arrows and ${ < } 4 . 0 \%$ or ${ > } 1 4 . 0 \%$ are displayed on the printout. This function was validated and demonstrated to function as intended.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Studies were performed to evaluate the impact of common endogenous and exogenous substances in the intended use population on Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay results. Whole blood samples containing HbA1c at two levels ( $5 . 4 - 6 . 6 \%$ HbA1c and $8 . 6 - 1 0 . 3 \%$ HbA1c) were split into test samples containing potential interfering substances and control specimens without the interfering substance. Test samples were assayed in replicates of 10 and the mean concentration for each test sample was compared to the mean concentration of 10 replicates of the control sample. Two Nova Allegro Analyzers and one lot of Nova Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges were used. The highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference was observed (defined by the sponsor as less than $\pm 1 0 \%$ difference between the test and control samples) are presented in the following table:

# Hemoglobin Interference

A study was performed to test the impact of hemoglobin on the Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay using six (6) Allegro Analyzers and one (1) lot of reagents. Fifteen venous whole blood specimens with HbA1c concentrations from 5.0 to $1 1 . 0 \%$ and hemoglobin concentrations from 10.8 to $1 4 . 6 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ were prepared to contain hemoglobin at target levels of 5.5 and 20.5 $\mathrm { g / d L }$ . The average of three (3) replicates of each blood sample was compared to the average neat HbAlc sample result. The results demonstrated that no significant interference (defined by the sponsor as less than $\pm 1 0 \%$ interference between the test and control samples) was observed from total hemoglobin levels between 6 and $2 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ . The Allegro Analyzer will not generate HbA1c results with samples containing hemoglobin concentrations outside of 6.0 - $2 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and will display the error code “HbA1c Bad Sample”. This feature was validated and was shown to function as intended.

# Cross-Reactivity

Potential cross reactivity from HbA0, HbA1a and HbA1b was evaluated using 226 samples with HbA1c concentrations ranging from $4 . 9 \mathrm { - } 1 2 . 2 \%$ and containing HbA0 $( 8 3 . 8 \substack { - 9 3 . 5 \% } )$ , HbA1a $( 0 . 3 \mathrm { - } 1 . 6 \% )$ , HbA1b $( 0 . 4 \mathrm { - } 1 . 7 \% )$ . Samples were tested using the Allegro Analyzer and results compared to measurements obtained on the Tosoh G8 analyzer. Results are summarized below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PotentialInterferent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Highest Level Testedwith No SignificantInterference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HbA0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Up to 93.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HbA1a</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Up to 1.6%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HbA1b</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Up to 1.7%</td></tr></table>

# Hemoglobin Derivatives

Potential interference from hemoglobin derivatives with the Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay was evaluated. Two Nova Allegro Analyzers and one lot of Nova Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges were used to assess venous whole blood specimens at target levels of 5.5 and $8 . 0 \%$ HbA1c. Each blood sample was divided into a control sample and a test sample, and each was assessed in replicates of 10. Glycated albumin samples were derived with glycated human albumin. Acetylated hemoglobin was derived in the presence of acetylsalicyclic acid, carbamylated hemoglobin was derived in the presence of sodium cyanate, and labile A1c was derived in the presence of glucose. The sponsor defined no-significant interference as $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ difference between the test and control samples and concluded that the following do not interfere with the Nova Allegro HbA1c assay: $5 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ glycated albumin, $5 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ acetylated hemoglobin, $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ carbamylated hemoglobin, $2 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ labile hemoglobin.

# Hemoglobin variant interference

A study was performed to assess potential interference from hemoglobin variants (HbA2, HbC, HbD, HbE, HbS, and HbF) on the Nova HbA1c Assay using two Nova Allegro Analyzers and one lot of Nova Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges. One hundred and nineteen (119) venous whole blood samples were measured in this study, 20 samples for each HbC, HbD, HbE and HbF, 25 samples for HbS, and 14 samples for HbA2. Samples were measured on the Nova Allegro Analyzer and compared to results obtained by an FDA cleared comparator method that has been demonstrated to be free from the hemoglobin variant interference. The following tables summarize the samples and study results:

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):

The performance of the Nova Allegro HbAlc Assay on the Nova Allegro Analyzer was assessed in the hands of 15 operators who were representative of intended CLIA waived users, at four clinical sites (physician offices). HbA1c results obtained from capillary fingerstick samples from 533 patients were compared to HbA1c results obtained from matched K2EDTA venous whole blood samples on an FDA cleared comparator method run at a NGSP secondary reference laboratory. A total of eight Allegro Analyzers (2 per site) and three lots of Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges were used in the study. A Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed using 526 paired results. Seven results were out of the analytical measuring range and were excluded from the regression analysis. The PassingBablok regression results are shown below:

# D Clinical Cut-Off:

Not applicable.

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

The labeling states the following.

In 2023, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended a reasonable A1c goal for many non-pregnant adults is $< 7 \%$ $\mathrm { 5 3 ~ m m o l / m o l ) }$ without significant hypoglycemia. On the basis of health care professional judgment and patient preference, achievement of lower A1c levels than the goal of $7 \%$ may be acceptable and even beneficial if it can be achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Less stringent A1c goals (such as $- 8 \%$ $[ 6 4 \mathrm { m m o l } / \mathrm { m o l } ]$ ) may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy or where the harms of treatment are greater than the benefits. Health care professionals should consider deintensification of therapy if appropriate to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with inappropriate stringent A1c targets.
