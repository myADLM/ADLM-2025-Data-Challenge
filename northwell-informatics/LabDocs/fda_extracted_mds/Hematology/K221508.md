4. Classifications Product Code: KHG – Whole blood hemoglobin assays Regulation section: CFR 864.7500 Device Classification: Class II

5. Substantial Equivalence: HemoCue Hemoglobin $^ { 2 0 1 + }$ System (K032203) AnemiaPro Self Screener (K042379)

# 6. Device Description:

AnemoCheck Home is a home use with prescription anemia test that is semiquantitative, color based, single use test for hemoglobin level determination. See the simple diagram below for a summary of the steps (Figure 1). Simply, a user performs a finger stick, less than one drop of blood (5uL) is collected into a collection tube within the test cap, the test cap is mated with the test body and shaken. After 2 minutes of development time, the resulting color of the test solution correlates to a color on a color card. The color results correlate to total hemoglobin levels. As shown, the colors range from blue to red (blue and green indicating low hemoglobin levels, yellow indicating slightly decreased hemoglobin levels and orange and red indicating high levels of hemoglobin), with $1 . 0 \ : \mathfrak { g } / \mathfrak { d L }$ color block resolution. Users may assign values in between two color blocks for a resolution of $0 . 5 { \ : } 9 / { \mathrm { d L } }$ .

Figure 1. Summary of AnemoCheck Home test use.

AnemoCheck Home is rapid (2 minutes), simple to use, disposable, and is a stand-alone system that does not require electrical power, additional equipment, or training. The device is semi-quantitative and designed to use a specific test body, test cap, blood collection tube and chemical reagent solution. The blood collection tube serves as a pipette and measuring instrument. No dilution is required or measuring is required by the lay user.

AnemoCheck Home leverages the same chemistry and technology used in AnemoCheck (K163215). When blood is mixed with the pre-filled solution, an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction occurs between $^ { 3 , 3 ^ { \prime } , 5 , 5 ^ { \prime } - }$ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide, leading to stableoxidized TMB products. The products exhibit different colors based on the amount of total hemoglobin present in the sample. After 2 minutes, the resulting color of the solution then allows for visual interpretation with the naked eye using a color card for determination of hemoglobin $( { \mathfrak { g } } / { \mathfrak { d L } } )$ .

# 7. Indication for use:

AnemoCheck Home is intended for home use for the determination of hemoglobin level in whole blood from a finger stick by people over the age of 18. This device is intended for people with anemia caused by iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, folate deficiency anemia, or who have chronic anemia due to sickle cell disease or thalassemia. AnemoCheck Home tests are for in vitro diagnostic use only. Prescription Use Only.

8. Comparison of Technological Characteristics with the Predicate Device AnemoCheck Home leverages the same chemistry and technology used in AnemoCheck (K163215). When blood is mixed with the pre-filled solution, an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction occurs between $^ { 3 , 3 ^ { \prime } , 5 , 5 ^ { \prime } - }$ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide, leading to stable oxidized TMB products. The products exhibit different colors based on the amount of total hemoglobin present in the sample. After 2 minutes, the resulting color of the solution then allows for visual interpretation with the naked eye using a color card for determination of hemoglobin (g/dL).

This method is also similar to the oxidation-reduction color-based method used in the HemoCue system.

# 9. Summary of Non-clinical Testing:

Analytical testing of AnemoCheck Home versus the predicate device and comparator methods demonstrate substantial equivalence based on accuracy and precision. Flex study and interference study results indicate no significant effects on AnemoCheck Home test performance.

# 10. Assessment of Performance:

AnemoCheck Home is a convenient method for measuring total hemoglobin in whole blood. Test results in the hands of the intended user, an untrained lay user, are comparable to other test methods in clinical laboratory and point-of-care settings.

# 11. Conclusions:

The AnemoCheck Home is similar to other 510(k) cleared and commercially available products based on the intended use, technology, and performance characteristics. In accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 CFR Part 807, and based on the information provided in this premarket notification Sanguina, Inc. concludes that AnemoCheck Home is safe and effective and substantially equivalent to the predicate(s).
