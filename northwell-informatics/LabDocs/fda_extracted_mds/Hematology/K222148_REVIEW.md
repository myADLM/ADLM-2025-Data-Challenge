# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The HemoScreen is a point-of-care (POC), automated hematology analyzer that provides results for complete blood count (CBC) parameters and a 5-part leukocyte differential, in capillary and venous whole blood samples. The HemoScreen system is a tabletop device and is comprised of the following components: HemoScreen reader (analyzer plus software), cartridge with preloaded reagents, blood collection sampler, on-board internal quality control, and external liquid quality controls.

The cartridge module comprises reagent compartments, a microfluidic chip and a translucent measurement portion. The reagents in the cartridge enable viscoelastic focusing, lysis of RBC, and WBC staining. In addition to the cartridge, the system includes a disposable sampler, which is used to collect the blood sample and then transfer it to the cartridge.

The HemoScreen provides the following blood count parameters: red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular (erythrocyte) volume (MCV), mean cell (erythrocyte) hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell (erythrocyte) hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelets volume (MPV), neutrophils (NEUT; $\# / \%$ ), monocytes (MONO; $\# / \%$ ), lymphocytes (LYMP; $\# / \%$ ), eosinophils (EO; $\# / \% )$ and basophiles (BASO; $\# / \%$ ). Of these, RBC, WBC, PLT, MCH, MCV, RDW, MPV, NEUT%, $M O N O \%$ , $\mathrm { L Y M P \% }$ , $\mathrm { E O \% }$ , and BASO% are quantitated by direct measurement, and HCT, HGB, MCHC, NEUT#, MONO#, LYMPH#, EO#, and BASO# are calculated from the direct measurements.

# B Principle of Operation:

The HemoScreen analyzer includes several modules (optical, mechanical, and electrical modules), a processor and controller that work together to measure blood samples that have been prepared inside disposable cartridges. The blood sample is collected with an additional disposable unit called a sampler. Once filled, the sampler is inserted into the cartridge in a single action, whereupon the cartridge is inserted into the reader for automatic sample preparation/staining and measurement. The cartridge is supplied preloaded with all required reagents.

Once the cartridge is inserted into the reader, blood is expelled from the capillaries into the reagent compartments. The reader then mixes the blood sample with the reagents by alternately pressing compressible portions of the cartridge, eventually causing the suspension of cells to flow into the microfluidic chamber. Cells flowing in the microfluidic chamber focus into a single-cell plane due to viscoelastic focusing. The reader then captures images of the focused cells and analyzes them in real time using machine vision algorithms. The reader interfaces with the cartridge mechanically and optically, and has no direct contact with the fluid inside the cartridge. When analysis is complete, the results are displayed to the user on the reader's touch screen.

Leukocytes are classified based on their staining properties and morphology, whereas absolute counts are obtained by counting the cells contained in a chamber of predetermined volume. Test results are obtained within six minutes and the results are saved.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: HemoScreen Hematology Analyzer

2. Specimen Identification: Specimen identification is performed by manual keyboard entry or use of a barcode reader.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

HemoScreen can be used with either capillary or venous anticoagulated whole blood, collected in K2EDTA. Capillary blood sampling is performed by routine fingertip puncture using a standard lancet. The blood is collected in an K2EDTA microtube (indirect sampling) which is then taken into Sampler or directly from fingertip drawn into Sampler (direct sampling). Venous blood, thoroughly mixed and at room temperature, can be used as well.

# 4. Calibration:

Factory calibration. The calibration of HemoScreen is traceable to the reference methods described in CLSI H26-A2.

# 5. Quality Control:

The HemoScreen system includes both on-board internal and external quality controls. Internal quality control includes built-in self-tests, whereby the software verifies performance of the optics, reagent mixing, and instrument pneumatics. Every time the analyzer is turned on, and before each measurement, it automatically verifies conformance to the measurement specifications. Furthermore, internal self-testing occurs after the cartridge has been inserted, thus validating the integrity of the disposable unit. The intensity and spectrum of all illumination sources are tested using corresponding sensors, and the optical properties of each cartridge are inspected automatically prior to each test.

Liquid Quality Controls (PIX-CBC): PIX-CBC Hematology Controls, 3-level commercial liquid quality controls are used to cover all HemoScreen parameters. CBC-PIX is a reagent composed of human erythrocytes and mammalian leukocytes and platelets suspended in a plasma-like fluid with preservatives. PIX-CBC whole blood controls (Cat No. PIX002) are produced by R&D Systems, a Bio-Techne brand, Minneapolis, MN.

# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

1. Matrix Comparison Study:

This study was conducted to demonstrate comparability between direct blood sampling where blood was collected directly into Sampler and indirect sampling where blood collected into a K2EDTA microtube. A matrix comparison study was performed at one (1) site with clinical laboratory and POC operators on forty-two (42) subjects. Blood was drawn twice from each donor and same finger if possible. The microtube capillary samples were assayed in duplicate on two HemoScreen devices. The first reportable direct result was used, and

these results were compared to the mean of duplicate of the indirect results. The data were evaluated by Passing-Bablok regression and Pearson’s correlation for all 20 parameters. All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

# 2. Transportation Environmental Test:

To support the updated transport conditions for the HemoScreen Sampler and Cartridge modified from the original conditions cleared in K180020, additional testing was conducted to support the conditions using ASTM D4332 and D5276 standards. The

Temperature/Humidity Cycling study assessed different sequences for temperature $( - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and humidity $( \geq 9 0 \%$ , $\leq 3 0 \%$ ). The device package underwent temperature sequence at $2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $9 0 \% \mathrm { R h } )$ for 24 hours and then $- 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours. Within one (1) hour of the temperature testing, drop/disturbance testing was conducted from different angles of the package. The package underwent second cycle of temperature conditions at $2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 9 0 \% \mathrm { R h } )$ for 24 hours and then $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 3 0 \% \mathrm { R h } )$ for 24 hours. A second drop test was conducted within an hour of the temperature testing. The performance passed the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
