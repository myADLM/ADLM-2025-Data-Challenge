# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Premier Resolution System consists of a high-performance liquid chromatographic analyzer (Premier Resolution Analyzer), reagents, analytical column, and software. The system allows for the fractionation and quantitation of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), hemoglobin A (HbA), and hemoglobin A2 (Hb A2), and the qualitative detection of major variant hemoglobin S, C, D-Los Angeles and E in adult, adolescent, children, and infant populations. This is accomplished using the principles of ion-exchange (IEX) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The Analyzer consists of an integrated HPLC (Pumps, Injection, Valve and Detector), compact sample preparation system (Probe/Injection Port, Syringe Module and Sample Transport) and the workstation (CPU, Printer and Touch Screen Interface) with the Resolution Application Software.

The Premier Resolution Analyzer consists of four main components:

1. The HPLC system is comprised of a dual high pressure pump system, column, sample loop and fixed wavelength detector. 2. The autosampler, comprising of the Sample Probe, Syringe Module, and Injection Port, is paired with the Sample Transport system. Together these provide automated analysis for batches of up to 210 samples (plus additional STAT samples are allowed throughout the run) and support continuous sample loading. The sample transport barcode reader ensures correct patient sample identification.

3. The integrated central processing unit (CPU) module provides system control and data storage capabilities, in addition to supporting LIS integration.

4. The Windows-based Premier Resolution Analyzer software provides real-time chromatography and system condition monitoring.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Premier Resolution System employs the principles of ion exchange and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The instrument’s pumps transfer reagents through the analytical column. The analytical column contains an ion-exchange resin bound to a silica gel support.

Hemolyzed samples are automatically injected onto the column during the flow of a mix of Premier Mobile Phase 1 and Mobile Phase 2. Hemoglobin species migrate through the column at rates determined by their individual physical properties. The charged proteins in the hemoglobin chains bind to the polyaspartic acid coating on the silica gel. As the assay continues, the gradient is increased to a higher percentage of Mobile Phase 2 to increase the ionic strength. The stronger ionic strength displaces the stronger bonded proteins from the polyaspartic acid coating. The weakest to strongest bonded hemoglobin fractions elute in the following sequence as the ionic strength of the mobile phase increases: HbF, HbA, HbE, HbA2, HbD, HbS and finally HbC. Once the hemoglobin has been displaced, it passes through the spectrophotometric detector, where it is detected at $4 1 3 { \pm } 2 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The compositions of Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 & 2 Reagents are designed to exhibit virtually identical absorption in the $4 1 3 { \pm } 2 \mathrm { n m }$ range to ensure a stable baseline. The detector signal is also referenced by the split-beam technique.

In the final stage of the assay, the column is re-equilibrated with Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 as the primary reagent. All reagent selection occurs in a timed sequence designed to allow complete elution of hemoglobin fractions.

All functions are controlled by the computer. The computer processes the signal from the spectrophotometric detector and calculates the concentration of hemoglobin fractions as a percentage of the total detected. Integration is by peak area in Absorbance Units (AU)-seconds. The computer software also calculates the retention time.

As the sample is processed, the chromatogram is displayed at the top right of the main assay screen in real time. The computer produces printed reports with the sample identification information, date, and time, followed by the chromatogram with peaks either numbered or with retention times indicated at the apex of each peak. A peak summary report is printed after the chromatogram with the retention time, relative retention time, $\%$ area and comments for each peak in the chromatogram.

The software, specially designed for Variant analysis, controls the four basic analyzer operation functions of sample identification, analyzer operation, calculation of results, as well as printing and storing complete reports. Based on computer hard disc capacity, chromatograms and batch summary reports can be automatically archived.

# Between-Lot and Between-Instrument Precision

Between-Lot and Between-Instrument Precision studies were conducted to evaluate the variation characteristics of consumable reagent lots for the Premier Resolution System. These studies were conducted to complement the single-site and multisite precision studies to evaluate the imprecision of the consumable reagent lots. A 3x5x5 study design was performed at a single site with one run per day on three (3) different lots of consumable reagents (3 lots of Premier Resolution analytical columns, 3 lots of Mobile Phase 1, 3 lots of Mobile Phase 2, 3 lots of Diluent) or three (3) different instruments, over five (5) days, and with five (5) replicates per run. Five (5) whole blood samples with varying levels of hemoglobin A, A2, F, S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E were tested on the Premier Resolution using the Quick Scan and High-Resolution assay modes.

The following testing were performed each day over the course of five (5) days (not necessarily consecutive days):

• Three (3) different lots of Premier Resolution analytical columns were tested using only one (1) dedicated instrument, one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 1 and 2, and one (1) lot of Diluent to generate the column-to-column precision data. Three (3) different lots of Mobile Phase 1 were tested using only one (1) dedicated instrument, one (1) lot of analytical column, one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 2 and one (1) lot of Diluent to generate the Mobile Phase-to-Mobile Phase precision data.   
Three (3) different lots of Mobile Phase 2 were tested using only one (1) dedicated instrument, one (1) lot of analytical column, one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 1 and one (1) lot of Diluent to generate the Mobile Phase-to-Mobile Phase precision data.   
Three (3) different lots of Diluent were tested using only one (1) dedicated instrument, one (1) lot of analytical column, and one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 1 and 2 to generate the Diluent-to-Diluent precision data.   
Three (3) Premier Resolution systems were tested using only one (1) lot of analytical columns, one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 1 and 2, and one (1) lot of Diluent. The instrument-to-instrument data were collected from the first run of each day consumable lot studies.

Overall, the performance of the Premier Resolution System met the predetermined specifications. The results are summarized below.

# Multisite Precision (Reproducibility)

A multisite precision study was conducted using a $3 \mathrm { x } 5 \mathrm { x } 5$ study design across three (3) sites over five (5) days with five (5) replicates per day. Three (3) Premier Resolution Systems (one per site) and Mobile Phase 1, 2, and Diluent Reagents (one lot of each), analytical column, and precision samples for the study were provided to the sites. The study assessed instrument-to-instrument, operator-to-operator, and site-to-site precision. Seven (7) whole blood samples with varying levels of hemoglobin A, A2, F, S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E were tested on the Premier Resolution using the Quick Scan and High-Resolution assay modes.

The performance of the Premier Resolution System in the Multisite Precision Study of the Quick Scan and High Resolution Assay Repeatability and Reproducibility Precision study performed met the predetermined acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity:

A linearity study was conducted to establish the linear range of quantitative measurements of normal hemoglobin A, A2 and F and major variants S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E on the Premier Resolution. The study was performed at a single site. Linearity was determined for HbF, HbA, HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbD-LA, and HbE for both Quick Scan and High Resolution modes. Hemoglobin species of HbF, HbA, HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbD-LA, and HbE were each prepared with 13 equally spaced concentration levels with 4 replicates per level. Quick Scan and High Resolution data were evaluated separately for each hemoglobin A, A2, F, S, C, DLos Angeles, and E.

The linearity ranges for individual hemoglobin fractions are summarized below.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

An interference study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the Premier Resolution system to the following interfering substances: D-Glucose, acetaldehyde, lipemia (triglycerides), icterus (bilirubin), acetylsalicylic acid, sodium heparin, lithium heparin, K2EDTA, and K3EDTA. Human blood samples containing HbA, HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD-LA and HbE were tested with interfering substances. Each hemoglobin species was evaluated at two different levels. Spiked experimental samples and a control sample were prepared from the same source of blood for each interferent. From this testing, the maximum amount of the interferent that does not cause analytical interference was determined.

Each substance with the potential to cause interference was tested at a concentration level that is at least three times the highest expected concentration or at least five times the recommended additive concentration for anticoagulants and preservatives.

Overall, it was established that there is no interference with the quantitation of hemoglobin fractions HbF, HbA, HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbD-LA, and HbE from the following interferents up to the concentrations stated in the table below:

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

# Sample Stability

To establish the sample stability claim for patient whole blood samples on the Premier Resolution system, a study was conducted for the Premier Resolution system using samples of normal and abnormal hemoglobins. The stability of the samples when stored at room

temperature $( 2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , refrigerated $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , frozen (-18 to $- 2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and frozen $( - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ was evaluated. Also, after each time point of the study, the hemolysate samples were kept on board and evaluated 24 hours later for on-board stability.

The freeze-thaw effects on patient samples were also evaluated. The freeze-thaw stability testing requires fresh, never frozen samples to be tested initially. The sample then underwent 24 hours of storage in a -65 to $- 7 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ environment. The sample was taken out, thawed, and retested on the same instrument and consumables. This process was repeated for a total of 10 freeze-thaw data points. Each freezing event was required to be stored at -65 to $- 7 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for at least 24 hours before thawing. This study determined the number of freeze-thaw cycles a sample can go through before degrading.

Whole blood samples of normal, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD-Los Angeles and HbE were used. Human whole blood samples, free of known interferences, were used for this study. The samples were tested on the Premier Resolution using the Quick Scan and High-Resolution assay modes. Sample stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for each test sample.

Overall, the sample stability study data support the following claims:

The recommended storage stability for blood collected as samples in K2EDTA   
anticoagulant tubes is: $\bigcirc$ 48 hours at 20 to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (RT) $\bigcirc$ 7 days at 2 to $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ (Refrigerated) $\bigcirc$ 168 days at -75 to $- 6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Frozen)

• The on-board stability is 24 hours. The recommended number of allowable freeze-thaw cycles is one (1).

# Reagent Stability

The stability of the Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 $( 9 4 0 \mathrm { m L }$ ), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 (3.8L), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 2 $\left( 9 4 0 \mathrm { m L } \right)$ , Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 2 (3.8L), Premier Resolution Diluent (3.8L), Premier Resolution Wash, $( 9 4 0 \mathrm { m L } )$ , and Premier Resolution Piston Wash (940mL), which are reagents used with the Premier Resolution System, was evaluated. Three lots of these reagents were aged in standard packaging for performance testing at the following timepoints:

• Initial • 12 Month • 24 Month • 26 Month.

At each interval, the in-use (open container) stability claim of 60 day was performance validated as well, including at 30, 60, and 66 days to provide an additional safety margin.

Overall, the Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 $\scriptstyle ( 9 4 0 \mathrm { m L } )$ ), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 (3.8L), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 2 $( 9 4 0 \mathrm { m L } )$ ), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 2 (3.8L), Premier Resolution Diluent (3.8L), Premier Resolution Wash (940mL), and Premier

Resolution Piston Wash $\mathrm { ( 9 4 0 m L ) }$ ) are stable when stored at the specified temperature ranges of $2 { - } 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 3 6 { - } 8 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ for up to two years from the date of production based on successfully completed stability studies.

6. Detection Limit:

A study was conducted to determine the limit of quantitation (LoQ), limit of blank (LoB), and limits of detection (LoD), for hemoglobin A, A2, F, S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E on the Premier Resolution System. The LoB/LoD/LoQ study was performed using one (1) instrument, two (2) different reagent lots over the course of five (5) days with four (4) levels for each phenotype, three (3) replicates per day. Two instruments were allocated to the study to perform the Quick Scan and High-Resolution runs simultaneously. The Quick Scan and High-Resolution data statistics were calculated independent of one another.

For the LoB evaluation, Diluent Reagent, as used for onboard sample dilutions, was utilized as the blank sample determinations. Each run was QC verified with FASC and $\mathrm { A } 2 { + } \mathrm { F }$ controls bracketing for the 60 Limit of Blank data points generated over two days.

For the LoD and LoQ evaluation, human whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA tubes containing 4 different levels of HbA, HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD-Los Angeles and HbE were tested in the Quick Scan and High Resolution modes. One Premier Resolution instrument was used for Quick Scan, the second Premier Resolution instrument was used for High-Resolution.

8. Accuracy (Instrument): Not applicable

A study was conducted to evaluate the carryover effects for hemoglobins A, A2, and F on the Premier Resolution Quick Scan (QS) and High Resolution (HR) assay modes.

In the evaluation of HbA carryover, a variant trait sample (HbS) was used as the low-level concentration sample and normal patient blood was used as the high-level concentration sample. In the evaluation of HbA2 carryover, $\mathrm { A } 2 { + } \mathrm { F }$ Control level I were used as the lowlevel concentration sample and $\mathrm { A } 2 { + } \mathrm { F }$ Control Level II were used as the high-level concentration sample. In the evaluation of HbF carryover, a high $\mathrm { H b F } ( { > } 1 4 \% )$ patient sample was used as the high-level concentration sample and a normal patient sample was used as the low-level concentration sample.

Overall, the Premier Resolution Quick Scan and High Resolution assays for HbA, HbA2, and HbF passed the pre-defined acceptance criteria and therefore demonstrated no significant carryover in using the Quick Scan or the High Resolution assay mode for the quantitation of HbA, HbA2, and HbF.

# B Comparison Studies:

# 1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was conducted to compare the performance of the Premier Resolution system to that of the predicate, Bio-Rad Variant II system, to demonstrate substantial equivalence between the test method and the comparator method with respect to quantitation of Hb A, A2 and F, and detection of hemoglobins S, C, D and E in patient whole blood samples. The study was performed at three external sites. The test samples at each testing site included normal and abnormal samples.

Each site tested patient samples on the Premier Resolution using both the Quick Scan assay and the High Resolution Assay and on the Variant II instrument. All patient samples were tested on the Premier Resolution within two days of the comparative method or within sample storage stability, whichever was shorter.

Data was analyzed per site and was combined from all sites for analysis. Data analysis consisted of a linear comparison by Passing-Bablok method of Hb A, A2, F, S, C, D and E concentrations between the Premier Resolution and the Bio-Rad Variant II. The standard error of the regression slope and intercept was computed.

2. Matrix Comparison:

Whole Blood vs. Hemolysate

An evaluation of matrix effects was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP14-A2: Evaluation of Matrix Effects; Approved Guideline – Second Edition. Whole blood collected was used as the reference comparative method against prepared hemolysates. The instrument performed an automated dilution on whole blood samples, prepared hemolysate samples were used to test if there were matrix effects on manual preparation of the hemolysate against the reference, whole blood. Test venous whole blood samples consisted of each hemoglobin, HbA, HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD-Los Angeles, and HbE.

Bland-Altman analysis and Passing-Bablok regression analysis were performed on samples of each phenotype. All phenotypes were found to fall within the acceptable criteria.

An analysis was conducted to establish the reference range claim for HbA and HbA2 for the Premier Resolution system. This analysis excludes results with reported HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD-LA, HbE and/or an abnormal level of HbA2. Data from human whole blood patient samples collected at three external sites were grouped and analyzed to determine reference range for HbA and HbA2.

Trinity Biotech Premier Resolution assays measured hemoglobins A and A2 on the listed number (N) of apparently healthy females and males, aged 1 to 97. Using the nonparametric technique, the resulting mean with reference range includes the remaining $9 5 \%$ of samples (the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile), as shown in the tables below:
