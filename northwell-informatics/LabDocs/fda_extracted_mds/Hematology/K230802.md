Note: Anti-phospholipid (APA) and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)

Anti-phospholipid (APA) and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) positive patients may observe falsely prolonged INR values that do not reflect the exact degree of anti-coagulation on the Xprecia Prime™ Coagulation System. Where APA/LA is suspected to be present a PT/INR result should be confirmed on a laboratory-based APA/LA insensitive method.

# M.1.6 Hematocrit:

The hematocrit range was evaluated for the Xprecia Prime™ Coagulation Analyzer using capillary blood samples from 371 patients across four intended use sites. Capillary blood samples for INR determinations using the Xprecia Prime™ Coagulation System, citrated plasma samples for the central laboratory INR using the Siemens Sysmex® CS-2500, and the measured EDTA venous whole blood hematocrit for each test subject were used in the analysis. The %bias of the Xprecia Prime™ Coagulation System INR to the Sysmex® CS-2500 INR was calculated for each test subject and plotted against the hematocrit for that test subject. Data analysis demonstrated that hematocrit range between $2 5 - 5 5 \%$ does not significantly affect test results.

# M.3 Clinical Studies

M.3.1.1 Clinical Sensitivity Not applicable

M.3.1.2 Clinical Specificity Not applicable

M.3.1.3 Other Clinical supportive data Not applicable

M.4 Clinical Cut-Off Not applicable

# M.5 Expected Values/Reference range

Normal range testing was conducted on 120 patients who were not on oral anticoagulant therapy. Capillary samples were collected from each patient. Samples were tested on three lots of Xprecia Prime™ PT/INR Test Strips. Results demonstrated a normal range of 0.9 to 1.1 INR with more than $9 5 \%$ of all results falling within that range.

N. Instrument Name Xprecia PrimeTM Coagulation System

O. System Description

# O.1 System Identification

The Xprecia PrimeTM Coagulation System is a closed system, which is intended to be used exclusively with the Xprecia PrimeTM PT/INR Test Strips manufactured by Universal Biosensors.

# O.2 Specimen Sampling and Handling

Whole blood is manually applied to the target area of the test strip from top as a hanging drop of blood from the fingerstick (Capillary).

# P. Calibration

# P.1 Xprecia Prime™ PT/INR Test Strips:

Each lot of Xprecia Prime™ PT/INR Test Strips is factory calibrated to a reference lot of human recombinant thromboplastin traceable to the World Health Organization International Reference Preparation. An International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and Mean Normal Prothrombin Time (MNPT) values are assigned by calibration for each lot and embedded on the barcode label on the test strip vial along with the lot number and expiration date. Metrological traceability was achieved by following Annex 6 Guidelines for thromboplastins and plasma used to control oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists (replacement of WHO Technical Report Series 889 Annex 3)

# P.2 Xprecia Prime™ Coagulation Analyzer:

When the analyzer is first turned on, the instrument performs a series of electronics, signal, software and memory integrity checks, as well as ensuring there is sufficient battery voltage to operate the Xprecia Prime™ Coagulation Analyzer. The key tests during this phase are the Heater/Thermistor check along with the Strip Port Hardware check. These are part of the overall Electronics Integrity Check. Failure to pass any of these power-on tests will prevent further operation of the analyzer.

# Q. Software

The user interface of the Xprecia PrimeTM Coagulation Analyzer guides the user through the test procedure step by step. The user only needs to insert the strip and apply a blood sample. The Xprecia PrimeTM Coagulation Analyzer measures International Normalized Ratio (INR) based on a Prothrombin Time (PT) assay and displays the result as seconds and INR. After the test is completed, the meter automatically saves the test result.

# R. Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity evaluation and risk management documentation was prepared according to FDA Guidance Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices

(October 2, 2014) and ANSI UL 2900-2-1, Standard for Safety, Software Cybersecurity for NetworkConnectable Products, Part 2-1: Particular Requirements for Network Connectable Components of Healthcare and Wellness Systems.

# S. Proposed Labeling

The Labeling is prepared as per the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10, Labeling for in vitro diagnostic products.
