Dear Carol Marble:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

# Device Description

The ACL TOP Family 70 Series are fully automated coagulation analyzers that utilize the same intuitive software, the same consumables, reagents, calibrators and controls, and provide the same analytical methodology for routine and specialty assay result reporting as the predicate ACL TOP Family 50 Series.

The ACL TOP Family 70 Series instrument performs the following types of tests, using the same optical measuring wavelengths and test parameters as the predicate ACL TOP Family 50 Series:

Coagulometric (Turbidimetric) Measurements • Chromogenic (Absorbance) Measurements • Immunological Measurements

The ACL TOP Family 70 Series also offers the same pre‐analytical features available on the ACL TOP Family 50 Series. These features alert the instrument operator to a potential HIL (Hemoglobin, Icteric and Lipemia) interference situation specific to the assays requested for a sample, underfilled sample tubes or a detected clog.

# Intended Use / Indications for Use

The ACL TOP Family 70 Series (ACL TOP 370, ACL TOP 570 and ACL TOP 770 / 770s / 770 LAS) are bench top, fully automated, random access analyzers designed specifically for in vitro diagnostic clinical use by health care professionals in the hemostasis laboratory for coagulation and/or fibrinolysis testing in the assessment of thrombosis and/or hemostasis. The systems provide results for both direct hemostasis measurements and calculated parameters.

# Performance Summary

Analytical studies (specifically internal precision and method comparison) were performed on one lot of selected representative assays to establish that the updates introduced with the ACL TOP Family 70 Series do not impact the labeled performance data of the current menu of FDA-cleared assays claimed for the ACL TOP Family 50 Series. These studies followed recognized guidelines:

• CLSI EP05-A3 CLSI EP09c, 3rd Ed

All analytical studies were performed in accordance to established plans and protocols and design control procedures. Testing verified that all acceptance criteria were met and results equivalent to the predicate device.

# Precision

Precision studies were performed using one lot of the following selected representative assays tested on representative ACL TOP Family 70 Series models (ACL TOP 370, ACL TOP 570, and ACL TOP 770). These studies used samples and controls with each material run for 20 days at two runs per day, 2 replicates per run $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ).
