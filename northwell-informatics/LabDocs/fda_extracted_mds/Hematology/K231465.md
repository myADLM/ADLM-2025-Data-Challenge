# Substantial Equivalency

Qurasense’s Q-Pad Test System has technological characteristics that are substantially equivalent to the predicate device identified in the table below. Both the proposed device and the predicate device provide the patient a method to collect a sample at home, mail the sample to the clinical laboratory, and later receive a report showing the measured Hemoglobin A1c.

Among the components included with the Q-Pad Test System is the collection device, Q-Pad, a menstrual pad that contains filter paper. Once the Q-Pad is received in the clinical laboratory, the dried blood sample is punched, eluted, and tested using FDA-cleared laboratory reagent and analysis systems, specifically the Beckman Coulter AU480 clinical chemistry device. The technological characteristics and intended use are substantially equivalent to the predicate device as summarized in the following table:

# Methodology

The Q-Pad menstrual pad (also referred to as “Q-Pad”) is a modified menstrual pad which looks, feels, and is used like a normal menstrual pad. The Q-Pad has an embedded blood collection strip (Q-Strip) which can easily be removed and shipped for analysis at a laboratory. Instructions for use and results are presented in a HIPAA compliant mobile application.

# Performance Data

# Sample Matrix Equivalency

A CLSI EP35 based study was conducted to assess the sample matrix equivalency between venous blood and menstrual blood collected on the Q-Pad. Forty (40) paired (venous and menstrual blood) samples, that span the Analytical Measurement Range (AMR) of the assay, were tested. The regression analysis between venous and menstrual blood resulted in a slope of 0.969 $( 9 5 \% 0 0 . 9 4 4 - 0 . 9 9 4 )$ ), an intercept of 0.181 $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C l } - 0 . 0 1 7$ to 0.380) and a ${ \mathsf { R } } ^ { 2 }$ of 0.997. The systematic difference between specimens at the 6.5 %HbA1c predetermined medical decision point (MDP) was $0 . 3 \%$ (the absolute systemic difference between the specimens being 0.02) and the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval was 6.42 to 6.54 %HbA1c. The study results demonstrated that venous blood and menstrual DBS are equivalent sample types for measurement of HbA1c.

Precision using venous blood

A venous blood precision study was performed according to CLSI EP05-A3. Whole blood from four participants with known A1c levels of around $5 \%$ , $6 . 5 \%$ , $8 \%$ and $12 \%$ was obtained. A total of 320 samples were run. Each HbA1c level was tested in duplicate, twice a day for a total of 20 days $( N = 8 0$ per level). Overall, within-run, and within-day precision results were evaluated in the presence of multiple lots of reagents. Operator-to-operator precision was also assessed (Tables 1-3). Overall, the studies show an imprecision of no greater than $2 . 5 6 \%$ (acceptance criterion $\leq 4 \%$ ).

The lot-to-lot analysis in the method comparison, combined with the analysis from two controlled shelflife studies demonstrated negligible risk of imprecision due to different lots.

Intra- and Inter-Strip Precision Flex studies

Additional flex studies were performed to assess imprecision from various locations on a Q-Strip (intrastrip) and between two Q-Strips (inter-strip).

# Intra-strip Precision

The purpose of this study was to evaluate intra-strip (punch-to-punch) imprecision. Nine (9) participants were enrolled based on anticipated A1c levels. For each sample, three punches were selected by the operator and analyzed. Punches 2 and 3 were compared to the measured value of the first punch. Bias and $\% { \mathsf { C V } }$ were calculated. Acceptance criteria was ${ \tt< } 1 0 \%$ bias of punches 2 and 3 when compared to the first punch and an average imprecision of $< 3 . 9 \%$ between the punches.

A maximum bias of $4 . 9 0 \%$ was recorded with a maximum CV between punches of $2 . 9 2 \%$ (Table 7).

# Inter-strip Precision

Inter-strip precision was evaluated by comparing results from two Q-Pads, both used during the same collection event. Nine (9) participants were enrolled based on anticipated A1c levels. Each Q-Strips was punched once and the resulting values were compared. Acceptance criteria was $10 \%$ bias and an average imprecision of $< 3 . 9 \%$ between Q-Strip samples.

A maximum bias of $3 . 9 2 \%$ and a maximum $\% { \mathsf { C V } }$ of 2.72 was measured (Table 8).

# Linearity menstrual blood

A CLSI EP06-A based linearity study was performed on the Q-Pad Test System using known interval methodology. High and low %HbA1c menstrual DBS samples were extracted and then serially diluted to create a nine-member known interval menstrual blood panel that ranged from 4.47 to 14.5 %HbA1c. Data was analyzed using linear regression and polynomial fit analysis. A linear regression graph of the resulting data is presented in Figure 1, and results of a polynomial fit analysis are shown in Table 9.

Polynomial fit analysis verified linearity of the Q-Pad Test System. The 2nd and 3rd order polynomials were determined to be “statistically equivalent to zero” making the best fit polynomial a linear function. The linearity of the Q-Pad Test System has been established from 4.4 to 14.5 %HbA1c. This range along with the totality of device performance supports a claimed measuring range (AMR) of the Q-Pad Test System of 4.0 to $1 5 . 0 \%$ .

# Interfering Substances

Interference was assessed using methodologies described in CLSI EP07-Ed3. Studies were conducted to assess the Q-Pad Test System’s performance in the presence of common exogenous and endogenous substances known or suspected to interfere with HbA1c measurements. Forty (40) substances were evaluated, each tested at four HbA1c levels. CLSI EP37 and similar references were used to determine the test concentrations for exogenous and endogenous substances. Test concentrations for bodily fluids were determined empirically using the analyzer. Topical products were tested by simulating normal use.

Significant interference was defined as a ${ > } 1 0 \%$ bias between a spiked and an unspiked sample. The list of the substances tested is shown in Table 10, no incidence of interference was detected with any substance

# Hemoglobin variants

Interference from Hemoglobin Variants, sourced from a NGSP reference laboratory, was evaluated following CLSI EP07-Ed3. Hemoglobin C, -D, -E, -F, and -S were tested at three HbA1c levels each. Samples were dosed onto a $\mathsf { Q }$ -strip, dried and run according to standard laboratory procedures. Measured values were compared to reference %HbA1c values supplied by NGSP. Significant interference was defined as a bias of ${ > } 1 0 \%$ from the reference value.

No interference was detected for hemoglobin variants C, -D, -E, and -S. For Hemoglobin variant F, with variant concentration above $1 0 \%$ , interference was observed. The sponsor will include the following limitation in the product package insert, listed in the warnings and limitations section:

“This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those with known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.”.

# Traceability

The Q-Pad Test System is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org. The Q-Pad A1c Test is traceable to IFCC reference calibrators.

Specimen Stability with Simulated Shipping

A sample stability with simulated shipping study, based on CLSI EP-25A, was performed on Q-Pad Kit collected menstrual blood samples. Eight (8) participants with known A1c levels, spanning the range of the assay used the Q-Pad Kit. Samples were exposed to 13 days of simulated summer/spring and winter temperature profiles. A reference measurement was taken at T0 and then at the following time points: Day-6, Day-10, Day-14, Day-28, and Day-31. At each time point, samples were punched once and run in triplicate. The acceptance criteria for each time point was $10 \%$ deviation from T0.

All measured values were within this acceptable range. In addition, no significant drift was observed, meaning none of the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals of the regression lines crossed the TEa bounds. Based on these results, the Q-Pad Test System will have a claimed sample stability period of 28 days.

# Shelf-Life

An Accelerated Shelf-life study was performed to establish initial shelf stability for the Q-Pad Kit. Q-Pad Kits were stored at constant elevated temperature $( 5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } , 5 0 \% \mathsf { R H } )$ for up to 3 simulated years (120 days). After aging, the kits were subjected to 7 days in an environmental chamber (Desert, Tropical, Frozen, and Room Conditions). Performance was evaluated using four HbA1c levels of bio-banked blood samples. A set of Q-Pad Kits was run at the following time-points: 0 years, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, and 3 year $^ { + 1 }$ month, where a year corresponds to 40 days in the environmental chamber. HbA1c results from aged kits were compared to the reference value captured at the initiation of the study.

All measured values were within the acceptable range $1 \text{‰}$ bias from reference). Based on the initial accelerated study results, Q-Pad Kits will be labeled with a 3 year shelf life. The outer pouch will include symbology to represent acceptable storage conditions as room temperature $( 1 5 - 3 0 ^ { 0 } { \mathsf { C } } )$ . A real-time study is running concurrently to verify the results from the accelerated study.

An Open Pouch Shelf-Life study was performed to test the stability of a Q-Pad Kit after the main packaging is opened. Q-Pad kits were first subjected to 7 days in an environmental chamber (Desert, Tropical, Frozen, and Room Conditions). After stressing, the Q-Pad Kits were opened and then stored at room temperature for up to 67 days. Performance was evaluated using four HbA1c levels of bio-banked blood samples. A set of Q-Pad Kits was run at the following time-points: Day-0, Day-15, Day-30, Day-60, and Day-67. HbA1c results from aged kits were compared to the reference value captured at the initiation of the study.

All measured values were within the acceptable range ${ < } 1 0 \%$ bias from reference . The Open Pouch study adequately mitigates the risk that a kit opened but not used immediately would result in an inaccurate result.

Reference Interval

A reference interval study was performed according to CLSI EP28-A3c. Samples from 128 healthy participants were collected to establish a reference range for the Q-Pad Test System and to verify its equivalence to the The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) recommended HbA1c reference range of 4.0 to $6 . 0 \%$ HbA1c.

All participant results were inside the expected reference range. The samples had a mean of 5.17 %HbA1c and a central $9 5 \%$ interval of $4 . 5 4 \%$ to $5 . 7 7 \%$ . The standard deviation of the dataset was $0 . 3 3 \%$ , and the CV was $6 . 3 4 \%$ . These results verify that the calculated reference interval for Q-Pad collected menstrual DBS samples falls within the standardized range recommended by NACB. Therefore, it is claimed that the reference interval for samples collected from healthy individuals using the Q-Pad Test System have a reference interval of $4 . 0 \% - 6 . 0 \%$ , equivalent to the range accepted for whole blood.

# Clinical Studies

# Method Comparison

A clinical validation study was performed to test the performance of the Q-Pad Test System. The study design followed CLSI EP09-A2 and CLSI EP21-A guidelines. IRB approval was obtained for participant enrollment and 396 specimens from 198 participants were utilized in the study. Samples were collected using the Q-Pad kit according to the Instructions for Use (IFU) and were returned to the laboratory using USPS First-class Return Service. A venous blood draw was performed by a phlebotomist to provide the reference sample. Both samples were received and processed at Qvin Labs (CLIA certified clinical laboratory) using the Beckman Coulter Hemoglobin A1c Test on an AU480 chemistry analyzer.

The acceptance criteria for the comparative linear regression was a slope between 0.93 and 1.07 with a confidence interval that includes 1, an intercept between -0.7 and 0.7 whose confidence interval includes 0, and an ${ \mathsf { R } } ^ { 2 }$ of ${ > } 0 . 9 5$ .

Participant HbA1c values ranged from $4 . 6 \%$ to $1 4 . 2 \%$ . $9 9 \%$ of participants successfully collected a sample. Linear regression analysis was performed to compare the results from the Q-Pad to the venous blood reference method using Passing-Bablok analysis, see Table 11.

Table 11. Summary of the clinical validation data   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Method</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% Cl</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% CI</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Passing-Bablok</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.003</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.987 - 1.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.046</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.170 - 0.067</td></tr></table>

$9 9 \%$ of study subjects successfully collected and returned samples to the laboratory for analysis verifying the effectiveness of the Instructions for Use. The comparative methods exhibited strong correlation. No samples were outside of the stated total allowable error of $6 \%$ . The overall linear regression showed a slope of 1.003 $9 5 \%$ CI 0.987, 1.020), intercept of -0.0461 $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C l } - 0 . 1 7 0 , 0 . 0 6 6 9 )$ and ${ \mathsf { R } } ^ { 2 }$ of 0.99. The study met all acceptance criteria and demonstrated that the clinical performance of the Q-pad Test system is equivalent to the reference method using venous blood.

# Usability Study

A dedicated usability study was conducted following the FDA Human Factors guideline. 40 naïve participants, who were self-reported diabetics, received the Q-Pad kit. Users followed the provided Instructions for Use to collect their sample and returned it to Qvin Labs via USPS First-Class Return Service. Each participant provided answers to a questionnaire regarding the use of the Q-Pad kit, the Qvin app and the mock results provided to them. The usability study showed that all 40 women were able to follow the Instruction for Use for the Q-Pad Kit, with $9 7 . 5 \%$ successfully collecting a sample that led to a valid HbA1c result.

# Flex Studies

# Elution Stability

The purpose of this study was to verify the stability of eluted menstrual blood samples collected using the Q-Pad Kit for up to 4 hours after extraction. Samples from four (4) participants were used. Samples were extracted, aliquoted, and run immediately on the Beckman AU480. Additional aliquots were run at the following time points after extraction: 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hours. All samples were run in triplicate and the results from each timepoint were compared to the initial timepoint for each sample. Acceptance criteria was $10 \%$ bias between the measured time point and the initial measurement immediately after extraction.

For all time points and HbA1c levels, the maximum bias was $3 . 3 7 \%$ . The elution stability study verified the stability of the eluted sample for up to 4 hours.

# Conclusion Drawn

Based on the comparison of technological features and intended use, and as a result of the non-clinical and clinical performance testing completed on Qurasense’s Q-Pad Test System, the proposed device devices does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and supports the conclusion that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The results of the non-clinical and clinical testing demonstrate the device is as safe, as effective and performs as well as or better than the predicate device.
