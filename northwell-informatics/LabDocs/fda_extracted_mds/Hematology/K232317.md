# 5 Device Description

# 5.1 UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer

UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer is characterized by fully automated and simple operation. All you need to do is to set test strips and samples, press the START key, and the rest of operations are fully automated with UC-1800, which can measure samples continuously. For each measurement, the instrument automatically performs a series of operation: sample transmitting, sample aspirating, sample dropping, rinsing, strip sorting, strip feeding and color identifying, etc. The instrument is used in conjunction with a serial of URIT urine test strips for measuring 15 parameters. Measure results are printed through either built-in printer or external printer. The test principle of the device is described as below.

# $\pmb { a }$ Test strip measurement principle

Measurement of test strips is done by the reflectance photometry method.

Placing tube racks loaded with samples on the rack injection mechanism and clicking the START key, the instrument will automatically perform a series of operations, such as transmitting samples, selecting strips, reading barcode, aspirating samples, dropping samples, measuring samples and printing results, until all tube racks are done. During the measurement, the reacted pads on strip (calibration pad is not involved in reaction, just for reference) will change colors and absorb irradiated monochromatic light as a result of chemical reaction within 60 seconds. Then the optical mechanism will compare the reflective light amount of each reacted pad with the reflective light amount of the calibration pad. The concentrations of analyzes will be calculated by CPU and printed together with semi-quantitative symbols.

The measuring system consists of a light source (LED) and a light receptor. The light from the light source falls on the reacted pads and the calibration pad on the strip. The absorbent and reflective light amounts vary with the color of reagent pads. If the color is darker, more light is absorbed, and less light is reflected, vice versa. i.e., the degree of color development is proportional to the concentration of analyzes in urine. The reflectance is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\mathrm { R } ^ { 0 } / 0 = \frac { T _ { m } \cdot C _ { s } } { T _ { s } \cdot C _ { m } } \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

R: Reflectance

Tm: Reflective light amount at the reactive pad with the measurement wavelength

Ts: Reflective light amount at the reactive pad with the reference wavelength

Cm: Reflective light amount at the calibration pad with the measurement wavelength

Cs: Reflective light amount at the calibration pad with the reference wavelength

The reflected lights from reagent pads are transmitted in the optical unit and received by the light receptor, where the optical signals are transformed into electrical signals. Then the electrical signals are transformed through I/V converter, processed by CPU and finally printed out.

# b Specific gravity measurement principle

Specific gravity measurement method is refractometer, which using the correlation between light refractive index and total solids in the solution to determine.

Refractometer method, available at $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { \sim } 3 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ temperature range of use, before use can be calibrated by the temperature compensation device; available for use the known standard high specific gravity concentration solution and standard low specific gravity deionized water to calibrate; easy to standardization, less quantity of samples, especially suitable for patients with oliguria and pediatric patients. Refractometer method is recommended as reference method by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institution, CLSI and Chinese Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, CCCLS.

Specific gravity is based on the principle of different concentrations of urine sample which have different refractive indexes to measure, that is uses the same wavelength of monochromatic parallel light comes into the triple prism which contains urine sample, and then according to position of refracted ray in photoelectric technology detector（displacement sensor） to determine the specific gravity value. Specific gravity measurement principle functional block diagram is shown in Figure 1 below.

![](images/5884b5e2c320d9c9f4ee101419bfd6ed13e91a4c083ecb0a50f78545cf0044e3.jpg)  
Figure 1 Specific gravity measurement principle

Specific gravity results are calculated by the following formulas:

$$
S G _ { X } = \left( S G _ { H } - S G _ { L } \right) \cdot \frac { K _ { X } - K _ { L } } { K _ { H } - K _ { L } } + S G _ { L }
$$

can change to

$$
{ \frac { S G _ { X } - S G _ { L } } { S G _ { H } - S G _ { L } } } = { \frac { K _ { X } - K _ { L } } { K _ { H } - K _ { L } } }
$$

relationship between them is linear.

$S G _ { H }$ : The specific gravity of high concentration solution

$S G _ { L }$ : The specific gravity of low concentration solution

$S G _ { X }$ : The specific gravity of sample solution

$K _ { H }$ : High concentration solution position coefficient

$K _ { L }$ : Low concentration solution position coefficient

$K _ { X }$ : Sample solution position coefficient

Position coefficient: It is calculated by the detector output data, and has a linear relationship with the refractive index.

Refractive index change depends on the temperature of the sample solution, and the specific gravity value is using the following formula to correct.

$$
S G _ { t } = S G _ { X } + \left( T _ { S A M } - T _ { S T D } \right) \cdot C _ { t }
$$

$S G _ { t }$ : The specific gravity of high concentration solution

$S G _ { X }$ : The specific gravity of low concentration solution

$T _ { S A M }$ : The temperature of sample solution

$T _ { S T D }$ : The temperature of low concentration solution

$C _ { t }$ : Temperature coefficient ( $\mathrm { S G } 0 . 0 0 1 / 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ （temperature coefficient）

If the urine sample contains large amounts of glucose or protein, then the specific gravity will be affected, according to WS/T 229-229 “Physical, chemical and microscopic examination of urine” 5.4.1 requirements: $1 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ protein will increas e urine specific gravity $0 . 0 0 0 3 , 1 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ glucose will increase urine specific gravity 0.0004. So, the specific gravity results will be corrected through the glucose and protein level which was measured by the test strip.

$$
S G = S G _ { t } - C _ { G L U } - C _ { P R O }
$$

SG: Specific gravity value which after the temperature compensation

$S G _ { t }$ : Specific gravity value which gets from formula (4)

$C _ { G L U }$ : Glucose correction value

$C _ { P R O }$ : Protein correction value

# c Turbidity measurement principle

Turbidity module emits light, to make it go through the sample, and then detect how much light is scattered by the particles in the water from the direction at a 90-degree angle to the incident light (The most stable angle of scattered light, is at a right angle to the center line of the incident light, so measuring the scattered light from $9 0 ~ ^ { \circ }$ direction which can minimize the influence of particle size on scattering light intensity). This scattered light measurement method called scattering method. Turbidity measurement principle functional block diagram is shown in Figure 2 below.

![](images/a5c5678226d15734c29785769a304fa3ab2e19a5f55f65c4be89be714599c537.jpg)  
Figure 2 Turbidity measurement principle

Turbidity result is calculated by the following formula:

$$
T = ( S _ { S } / T _ { S } - S _ { W } / T _ { W } ) / K
$$

T: Turbidity level

S : Sample scattered light level TS: Sample transmission light level $\varsigma _ { w }$ : Flushing fluid scattered light level T : Flushing fluid transmission light level K: Coefficient factor

# d Color measurement principle

The color of often seen objects, are actually the objects surfaces absorb a part of chromatic light from the white light(sunlight) that fall on them, and then reflect the other part of chromatic light to human eyes’ response. Various frequencies of visible light are mixed together become white, that is to say, it contains all sorts of color of light, such as red(R), yellow(Y), green(G), blue(B), purple(P). According to the German physicist Helinholtz’s three primary colors theory, all sorts of color is made of different proportion of three primary colors (red, green, blue).

Primary colors are the “basic color” which cannot be gotten by other colors mixed. But mix the primary colors in different proportion will get other new colors. Three primary colors of light are RGB (Red, Green, and Blue). Equivalent red light +green light=yellow light, green light $^ +$ blue light $=$ cyan light. Equivalent red light $^ +$ blue light $=$ magenta light, equivalent red +green $^ +$ blue=white, and if the intensity of these three lights is zero, it is black (dark).

When the white light through colored solution, the non-solution colors light will be absorbed, so the color of the light through the solution can be expressed as the color of the solution, and then the solution color can be detected by the professional color recognition sensor (filter) which in the back-end of the solution.

# 5.2 URIT 11FA/12FA urine reagent strips

Urine Reagent Strips is used to determine the components to be measured in urine by dry chemistry method together with urine analyzer. Various components to be tested in the urine can result in changes to the colors of corresponding reagent blocks on the Urine Reagent Strips. The depth of reaction color is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding component to be tested in the urine. Qualitative and semi-quantitative detection can be conducted to the contents of the corresponding detected components. As a reagent for the determination of multiple components in human urine and the most basic test item for clinical urine analysis (urine routine test), it is suitable for the screening test or auxiliary diagnosis for clinical diagnosis, without the specificity for diseases or indications, and urine dry chemistry test is only used as a screening test and cannot be used as a single diagnostic method.

# $\pmb { a }$ Ascorbic Acid

Based on the principle of Tillman's Reagent, Ascorbic acid can reduce the dye from blue to red. The purpose of the determination of this project is to provide the user with the content of Ascorbic acid in the sample to determine its possible interference.

# b Nitrite

In this reaction, nitrate is reduced to nitrite by Gram-negative bacteria in the urine, the nitrite will react with arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound, and the diazonium compound will be combined with naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to show a pink color.

# c Microalbumin

The Reproducibility (Between-Run) Precision of the URIT UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer was evaluated by using negative urines and spiked urines of known concentrations for each analyte. Each sample was tested for 20days with 2 runs per day, in 1 time per run in 3 sites, each site with 1 instrument, totally the test performed across 3 instruments with the 3lots of URIT 11FA Urine Reagent Strips and 3lots of URIT 12FA Urine Reagent Strips in each instrument by 3 operators, each operator performing the test for 6-7 days, for a total of 120 measurements at each concentration were tested. All concentrations for all tests had 120 of 120 $\left( 1 0 0 \% \right)$ match at $\pm$ one color block. The results are summarized in Table 12 to Table 15

# b Linearity/assay reportable range

The assay reportable range was evaluated by measuring the samples containing known concentrations of all measurement blocks. Prepare the reference solutions according to the marked values of concentration for each item on the URIT 11FA and 12FA urine reagent strips, and conduct linear range/reportable range experiments on the instrument with the reference solutions. Test each reference solution on three UC-1800 machines with three batches of reagent strips. Repeat the test for each batch of test strip for 21 times on each instrument.

The results of assay reportable range of URIT 11FA Urine Reagent Strips and URIT 12FA Urine Reagent Strips are summarized as Table 16 to Table 18 show below. The Summary of Reportable Results of URIT 11FA Urine Reagent Strips and URIT 12FA Urine Reagent Strips are summarized as Table 19 show below.

# d.2 Effect of urine pH

Collect mixed negative urine samples and divide them into 5 parts. Adjust their pH values with 1M hydrochloric acid aqueous solution and 1M sodium hydroxide aqueous solution to prepare samples with pH value of 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, respectively. Each sample shall be tested for 5 times on 2 UC-1800 machines, two batch numbers of 11FA and 12FA test strips, respectively. For all test strip analytes, except leukocytes and specific gravity, For leukocytes, urine pH values lower than 5.5 may yield a false negative result. For specific gravity , No significant interference was observed for the urine pH ranges from 5.5 to 7.5 , Urine pH values lower than 5.5 may yield a false increased of Specific Gravity, and urine pH values higher than 7.5 may yield decreased of specific gravity. The results were summarized as Table 25 shows.

# d.3 Effect of urine color

ollect mixed negative urine samples and divide them into 3 parts. Use bovine hemoglobin, sunset yellow, lignin, Lemon yellow, Naphthol green, Bright blue and Crystal violet to repare the samples into the red, orange, brown, yellow, green, blue, purple samples. Each sample shall be tested for 5 times on two UC-1800 machines, two batch numbers of 11FA nd 12FA test strips, respectively. All the results demonstrated that all color showed no interference on each analyte. The results were summarized as Table 26 to Table 31 shows.

# f Carryover

Evaluate the carryover by alternately testing the high-concentration samples (UQ14 NO. II/III) and low-concentration samples (UQ14 NO. I), namely, conduct tests in the sequence of high, low, high, low, high, low, high, low, high and low. For all

analytes, all negative/normal samples are read to be negative/normal. UC-1800 automatic urine analyzer with 11FA, 12FA test strip test carryover verification meets the requirements (All low-value samples are negative.). The results of carryover presented in Table 34 below.

# 10 Stability Test Conclusion

# 10.1URIT 11FA Urine Reagent Strips

After a study on the stability of Urine Reagent Strips in the shelf life, the results show: various performance indexes of the Urine Reagent Strips within 25 months after being stored at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (extreme storage condition) all meet the relevant performance index requirements in the technical requirements for the product, which meets the requirement that the validity period of the Urine Reagent Strips is expected to be 24 months. Therefore, in consideration of design margin, we determine that the shelf life of Urine Reagent Strips is 24 months.

After a study on Open bottle stability, the results show: various performance indexes of the Urine Reagent Strips stored at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (extreme storage condition),humidity $\leq 8 0 \%$ for 14 weeks after opening all meet the performance index requirements in the technical requirements for the product, but various performance indexes at the 15th week do not meet these requirements. To be prudent, we determine that the validity period of Urine Reagent Strips after opening is 3 months (12 weeks) after opening at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (extreme storage condition),humidity $\leq 8 0 \%$ . The Urine Reagent Strips within the shelf life and the validity period after opening has reliable properties and can bring accurate and reliable test results as reference for clinical diagnosis.

After a study on stability during simulant transport, after the Urine Reagent Strips are stored respectively at the high temperature of $5 0 \%$ , at the low temperature of $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and at the high temperature of $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and a high humidity of no less than $8 0 \%$ for 30 days, they are stored at $2 \%$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a dry and dark place until the validity period expires, and compared with Urine Reagent Strips always stored on the conditions specified in the instructions, their performance indexes remain basically unchanged and meet the appearance and performance index requirements in the technical requirements for the product, which shows that the performance of the product is accurate and reliable during transport (within 30 days) even under extremely harsh transport conditions.

In addition, various performance indexes of the Urine Reagent Strips within 25 hours after being put in the reagent strip bin of Automatic Urine Analyzer on experimental conditions all meet the relevant performance index requirements in the technical requirements for the product. To be prudent, we determine that the On-board stability time of Urine Reagent Strips is 24 hours.
