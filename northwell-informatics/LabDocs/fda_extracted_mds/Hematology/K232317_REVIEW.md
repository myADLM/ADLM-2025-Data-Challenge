# B Principle of Operation:

Test strip measurement principle

The strips are used to determine the components to be measured in urine by dry chemistry methods together with the urine analyzer. Various components to be tested in urine can result in changes to the colors of corresponding reagent blocks on the Urine Reagent Strips. The depth of reaction color is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding component to be tested in the urine. Measurement of test strips is conducted by the analyzer using the reflective photoelectric colorimetry method using CIS (contact image sensor) image scanning analysis technology for detection.

# URIT 11FA and 12FA Urine Reagent Strips

Ascorbic Acid (URIT 11FA only): Based on the principle of Tillman’s Reagent, Ascorbic acid can reduce the dye from blue to red.

Nitrite: In this reaction, nitrate is reduced to nitrite by Gram-negative bacteria in the urine, the nitrite will react with arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound, and the diazonium compound will be combined with naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to show a pink color.

Microalbumin: Based on the dye-binding method, microalbumin can react with the dye to form a pink complex and produce a color change.

Leukocytes: Based on the esterase method, granulosa cytoplasm contains esterase, which can hydrolyze a 3-hydroxyindoxyl ester substrate, release phenol, and react with diazo reagent to generate purple-red compounds.

Creatinine: Based on the principle of displacement reaction, creatinine can displace the dye in the metal chloride-acid dye complex, and the color will change from green to yellow.

Ketone: Based on the principle of sodium nitro prussiate method, sodium nitroprusside can interact with ketone (acetoacetate) under alkaline conditions to become purple. Acetoacetate is particularly sensitive to this.

Urobilinogen: Based on the principle of the azo-binding method, urobilinogen is coupled with diazonium salt under strong acid conditions to form carmine pigment.

Bilirubin: Based on the principle of the azo-coupling method, 2,4-dichloroaniline diazonium salt can react specifically with bilirubin and produce different colors depending on the concentration of bilirubin.

Glucose: Based on the reaction principle of the glucose oxidase method, glucose oxidase can specifically oxidize $\beta$ -D-glucose to generate glucuronic acid and hydrogen peroxide that will oxidize the indicator under the action of peroxidase and show a purple-red color.

Protein: Based on the principle of protein error method of dye binding, the protein can combine with the dye to form a complex that produces a color change. The response to albumin is more sensitive than that of globulin, hemoglobin, Bence-Jones, protein, and mucin.

Blood: Based on the principle of hemoglobin contact activity method, the decomposition of peroxides can be catalyzed through the peroxidase-like action of hemoglobin, thus oxidizing and coloring tetramethylbenzidine.

Specific Gravity: The test uses the polyelectrolyte method based on the principle of ion exchange between electrolytes in urine and polyelectrolytes. In the presence of cations, the polymer hydrogen ions will be released through exchange, and the color of bromothymol blue indicator will change from blue to blue-green and finally to yellow.

pH: The pH value within the range from 5.0 to 9.0 is measured by a Ph indicator.

# UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer

Measurement of test strips is performed by the reflectance photometry method. During the measurement, the reacted pads on strip (the calibration pad is not involved in reaction, just for reference) will change colors and absorb irradiated monochromatic light as a result of chemical reaction within 60 seconds. Then the optical mechanism will compare the amount of reflective light from each reacted pad with the reflective light of the calibration pad. The concentrations of analytes will be calculated by CPU and printed together with semi-quantitative symbols. The measuring system consists of a light source (LED) and a light receptor. The light from the light source shines on the reacted pads and the calibration pad on the strip. The absorbed and reflected light amounts vary with the color of the reagent pads. If the color is darker, more light is absorbed, and less light is reflected, and vice versa. (i.e., the degree of color development is proportional to the concentration of analyzes in urine).

Turbidity measurement principle: The turbidity module emits light through the sample and then detects how much light is scattered by the particles in the water at a $9 0 ^ { \circ }$ angle to the incident light.

Color measurement principle: The urine color can be detected by the professional color recognition sensor (filter).

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer

2. Specimen Identification: Urine identification can be performed manually or with analyzer barcode reader.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer is characterized by fully automated operation. Samples can be labeled with a barcode, which is read with a barcode reader. The instrument automatically performs a series of operations: sample transmitting, sample aspirating, sample dropping, rinsing, strip sorting, strip feeding, color identifying, and measurement. Specimen handling recommendations are provided in the labeling.

4. Calibration:

It is recommended to use the URIT specific gravity, turbidity, and color calibration products to calibrate the physical module every 4 weeks. A white calibration strip is used to check the remittance outputs of the LEDs in the read head. Labeling recommends that the user perform calibration verification with the white strip after maintenance, with a new lot of strips, with a new bottle of strips, when changing operators, or when questioning results.

# 5. Quality Control:

Urinalysis controls are intended for the urine analyzer and matched urine reagent strips to   
monitor the quality of the urinalysis test. The following quality controls are recommended:   
Urinalysis Control NO.I: Negative control   
Urinalysis Control NO.II: Positive control   
Urinalysis Control NO.III: Positive control for Ascorbic Acid only   
Quality Control Solution TUR for turbidity

The Reproducibility (Between-Run) Precision of the candidate device was evaluated by using negative human urine samples and spiked urine samples for each analyte. Each sample was tested for 20 days with 2 runs per day, 1 replicate per run using 3 lots of URIT 11FA Urine Reagent Strips and 3 lots of URIT 12FA Urine Reagent Strips on 3 instruments (one lot of URIT 11FA and one lot of URIT 12FA test strips each instrument) in 3 sites (one instrument per site) for a total of 120 measurements at each concentration. The representative results are summarized in the tables below.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Exogenous and Endogenous Interference

Analytical specificity studies were conducted to evaluate interfering effects of exogenous and endogenous substances on the candidate device. Negative urine samples and low positive samples were spiked with potential interfering substances at various interferent concentrations. Each sample pair (test sample and control sample) was analyzed in replicates of 5 on two UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzers with two lots of URIT 11FA and 12FA reagent strips respectively (2 lots of each reagent strip on each analyzer). Results are summarized in the tables below.

To address the interference of levodopa on the test for blood, the following interference limitation is included in the labeling and will be reported in the test report: Levodopa can interfere with the detection of red blood cells leading to a false negative result.

Interference effect of urine pH

Studies were conducted to assess the effect of urine pH on the test results. For all test strip analytes, except leukocytes and specific gravity, there was no interference from $\mathsf { p H }$ across a range of 4.5 to 8.5. Interference effects of urine $\mathsf { p H }$ on leukocytes and specific gravity are summarized in the table below.

Interference effect of urine color

The candidate device includes a correction function for urine colors. The results of the studies demonstrated that the colors red, orange, brown, yellow, green, blue, and purple do not significantly impact the results for the analytes on the URIT 11FA and $1 2 \mathrm { F A }$ test strips since all results were within $+ / - 1$ color block when testing colored urine for these parameters on the URIT 11FA and 12FA Urine Reagent Strips.

Interference effect of urine Specific Gravity

Studies were conducted to assess the effect of urine specific gravity on the test results. A negative urine sample was prepared using sodium chloride to adjust the specific gravity to 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, 1.035, 1.040, 1.045, and 1.050, respectively. For all test strip analytes, except leukocytes, there was no interference from specific gravity across a range of 1.005 to 1.050. For leukocytes, false negative results were found at urine specific gravity values higher than 1.040.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability The sponsor provided information to support the traceability of the candidate device.

6. Detection Limit:

Analytical sensitivity The detection limit study defines the measurement results with analytical sensitivity of $90 \%$ as the positive minimum analyte concentration, i.e., the cutoff for switching from negative to positive. Each analyte was added to a negative urine sample to prepare five different concentrations. Each concentration was tested on three UC-1800 analyzers with three lots of test strips. Each lot of test strip was tested 20 times on each analyzer. The results are summarized below:

# Study 2 – Measurement block cut-off:

A cut-off study was conducted on the candidate device to determine the cut-off concentration between each semi-quantitative block of the reagent strip. The cut-off concentration is defined as the minimum sample concentration at which a test result of $2 5 5 \%$ relative to the transition from the block is considered positive. Each testing analyte was added to the negative urine sample to have five concentrations exceeding the expected cut-off concentration. Three lots of URIT 11FA and 12FA urine reagent strips were tested in 20 replicates at each concentration level on three UC-1800 urine analyzers.

The cut-off concentration between each measurement block is summarized in the tables below.

7. Assay Cut-Off:

Not applicable.

8. Accuracy (Instrument): See Method Comparison.

9. Carry-Over:

The carryover of the candidate device was evaluated by alternately testing high-concentration samples and low-concentration samples, in the sequence of high, low, high, low, high, low, high, low, high and low. For all analytes, all negative/normal samples read as negative/normal, therefore no significant carryover found in the study.
