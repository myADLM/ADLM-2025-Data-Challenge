# 5.5 Test Principle and Technology

The principle of operation of the AI-4510 System is based on image capture and the digital processing of images for particle analysis and recognition from a locked sorting algorithm for clustering and classification.

The instrument uses flow digital imaging technology with a flow cell and Complementary Metal- Oxide- Semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors. As the urine passes through the flow cell, it is illuminated by a strobe lamp. Color images are recorded from three different focal points by the CMOS image sensors. The software processes the recorded images, automatically identifying and classifying the formed elements based on the sorting algorithm. The images and the classification of the formed elements are also displayed on the device screen for the operator. The results of the measurements of formed elements for each sample can be centrally controlled by the computer. Images that could not be classified automatically can be classified manually.

# 5.6 Summary of Performance Data

Clinical and bench testing were conducted to verify the performance characteristics of this device. This testing showed acceptable device performance that is substantially equivalent to the performance of the predicate device.

# Precision

Precision for the AI-4510 System was evaluated to estimate repeatability, within-laboratory precision, and reproducibility for quantitative analytes: Red Blood Cell (RBC), White Blood Cell (WBC), and Squamous Epithelial Cells (SQEC), and repeatability for all semi-quantitative and qualitative elements: Bacteria (BACT), Crystals (CRYS), White blood cell clumps (WBCC), Nonsquamous epithelial cells (NSE), Hyaline casts (HYAL), non-hyaline casts (NHC), Yeast (YST), Mucus (MUCS) and Sperm (SPRM).

Precision studies were conducted in accordance with the general guidelines established in CLSI EP05-A3; (Third Edition)- Evaluation of Precision Devices; Approved Guideline

Precision studies were conducted to evaluate measurement imprecision using both controlled materials and clinical samples, with all results meeting the predefined acceptance criteria.

There were three major studies conducted to demonstrate the precision of the AI-4510 System:

Repeatability Study- (Quantitative, Semiquantitative, and Qualitative Elements) Results were collected with one (1) instrument, at one (1) site, with one (1) operator and 10 replicates, using clinical urine samples in the evaluation of repeatability for all twelve (12) elements from low to high concentrations.

Within-Laboratory Precision Study- (Quantitative Elements) Results collected over twenty (20) days with two (2) runs per day and two (2) replicates per run using ARKRAY control materials prepared using clinical samples.

Reproducibility Study- (Quantitative Elements) Results collected from three (3) sites, with one (1) analyzer per site, and testing conducted over five (5) days with two (2) runs per day and three (3) replicates per run using commercially available control materials and ARKRAY control materials prepared using clinical samples.

Results from the analysis conducted for each study is presented in Tables 3-6 below.

# Carryover

Carryover testing was performed for the AI-4510 System to confirm that there are no carryover contaminations for all twelve (12) elements. This testing was conducted using pre-prepared concentrations of high-level and low-level samples w h i c h were aliquoted into 5 tubes each and measured alternatively as shown in Table 9 for each tested element. Based on the predefined acceptance criteria, no carryover effect was detected.

# Interference

Interference testing was performed on the AI-4510 System to evaluate the influence of interfering substances on the measurement of twelve (12) particle elements using the AI-4510 System. A dose dependency evaluation was performed for those substances which were confirmed to have interference effects on the measurements to determine the highest concentration at which no interference effect is observed.

The results of this interference study are summarized in Tables 10-12 below.

# Sample Stability

Sample stability was evaluated on the AI-4510 System to confirm the sample stability of twelve (12) elements when measured with the AI-4510 System. Testing was performed on both positive and negative samples for all twelve (12) elements at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and under refrigeration $\left( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ . In conclusion, all samples tested for each element met the predefined acceptance criteria, therefore establishing the sample stability at room temperature $( 1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for up to 2 hours and under refrigeration $\left( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ for up to 6 hours for all twelve (12) elements measured by the AI-4510 System.

A method comparison study was conducted at three (3) CLIA-Moderate complexity laboratories to evaluate the agreement of urine sample test results between the candidate device, the AI-4510 System, and the FDA-cleared predicate device, the iQ200 System (K093861) and manual microscopy. Testing was done by CLIA-trained operators using de-identified urine samples collected fresh within two (2) hours or refrigerated up to six (6) hours post collection. The study was conducted to evaluate the following 12 analytes: Quantitative analysis of red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and squamous epithelial cells (SQEC); Semiquantitative analysis of bacteria (BACT), and crystals (CRYS); Qualitative analysis of hyaline casts (HYAL), non-hyaline casts (NHC), non-squamous epithelial cells (NSE), yeast (YST), white blood cell clumps (WBCC), mucus (MUCS) and sperm (SPRM). Tables 13-16 summarize the reference range analysis as well as the overall clinical performance data for all sites combined. In summary, Quantitative, Semiquantitative and Qualitative parameters met the acceptance criteria.
