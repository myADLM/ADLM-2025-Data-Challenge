# A Device Description:

1. Device Description:

The DxFLEX Flow Cytometer uses flow cytometric principles to determine qualitative measurements of biological and physical properties of cells and other particles when the cells pass through the laser beam(s) in single file.

The DxFlex Flow cytometer is being cleared for use with the ClearLLab 10C Reagent System which was cleared on the Navios EX Flow cytometer (K183592). The ClearLLab 10C Reagent System on the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer is comprised of the following:

• DxFLEX Flow Cytometer [3 laser/10 color configurations]   
• DxFLEX Daily QC Fluorospheres   
• ClearLLab 10C Panels [B, T, M1 and M2]   
• ClearLLab Compensation Kit   
• ClearLLab Compensation Beads ClearLLab Control Cells, normal and abnormal   
• IOTest 3 Fixative Solution [Existing] $\bullet$ IOTest 3 Lysing Solution Kaluza C Software

The DxFLEX Flow Cytometer includes ten fluorescent detection channels (FL1-FL10) and three laser configurations (blue, red and violet).

The ClearLLab 10C Reagent System on the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer includes the CytExpert for DxFLEX Software (i.e., acquisition software) and the Kaluza C Analysis Software (i.e., analysis software) (cleared in K183592 (version 1.1)).

As with the workflow on the predicate system (K183592), listmode (LMD) data analysis is performed manually using the Kaluza C Analysis Software. This Analysis Software package is supplied separately from the DxFLEX and is installed on an independent computer workstation for off-line analysis of listmode files generated on the flow cytometer with the associated reagents and cytometer system software package, including Control Cell Quality Control (QC) data and sample data analysis. The CytExpert for DxFLEX software is used to run the DxFLEX Daily QC Fluorospheres and Compensation products, Kaluza C Software is a software tool designed to work with \*.fcs and \*.lmd files generated from flow cytometers. Preset Kaluza C analysis templates for the ClearLLab 10C reagent system will be provided. The total WBC gate is defined in the histogram of SS vs. CD45-KO525-A by the inclusion of all $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ events with low, medium, and high Side Scatter after the exclusion of the cells that were compromised and/or aggregated. A subsequent histogram defines specific leukocyte subsets such as lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes. The low SS/bright $\mathrm { C D 4 5 + }$ population identifies lymphocytes. Applicable markers are then displayed in subsequent histograms gated on lymphocytes. This process is repeated for mid SS/medium $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ populations to identify monocytes and for high SS/medium $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ to identify granulocytes

As acquisition software, CytExpert.exe enables the user to acquire data from the DxFLEX flow cytometer and allows the user to analyze, display, print and export acquired data. The major features of the software are as follows:

System Startup Instrument Quality Control and Standardization Data Acquisition Sample Analysis   
• Compensation   
• Data Review   
• Report Generation Daily Clean

Kaluza C software is used for post-acquisition analysis and reporting.

2. Principles of Operation:

The DxFLEX flow cytometer aligns cells in suspension by hydrodynamic focusing and passes them through a laser beam, one cell at a time. The scattered and fluoresced light that emanates from these cells as they intersect the laser beam is collected by Avalanche Photodiode detectors and transduced to an electronic pulse and counted by the instrument’s computer. This test depends on the ability of a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody to bind to the surface of cells expressing discrete antigenic determinants. Specific cell staining is accomplished by incubating specimens prepared for staining with the appropriate antibody reagent. After sample preparation, the specimens are acquired on the QC controlled flow cytometer with manual gating.

# B Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: DxFLEX Flow Cytometer

2. Specimen Identification: Barcode reader or manual entry

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling: The automated sample loader for the instrument uses a carousel that holds thirty-two $1 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 7 5 .$ mm test tubes and includes a barcode reader.

4. Calibration:

Fluorescence intensity is calibrated and confirmed using the DxFLEX Daily QC Fluorospheres with lot specific target values.

5. Quality Control:

The DxFLEX QC process verifies important system functions. The system verifies or automatically adjusts the following parameters:

• Hardware configuration • Laser power of each individual laser • Laser delays parameters Gain settings

Beckman Coulter recommends performing QC on a daily basis.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were conducted according to the methodology presented in CLSI EP12‐Ed3 and CLSI EP05-A3.

a. Precision (repeatability):

The repeatability of normal and abnormal clinical specimens representing clinical matrices and anticoagulants was evaluated with the ClearLLab 10C Panels on the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer at three sites. Sixty-four specimens across the three specimen types, i.e., whole blood (WB), bone marrow (BM), and lymph node (LN), were evaluated, with two excluded (due to specimen age and operator error). Each site employed a different anticoagulant for specimens, according to their current clinical practice: K2EDTA, acid citrate dextrose (ACD), or heparin.

Unless otherwise specified, a minimum of two specimens per specimen type per panel for each anticoagulant (site) was included. For LN specimens, there was no minimum requirement for the T panel (due to the low incidence of T lineage abnormalities), nor for M1 and M2 (due to the development property of myeloid cells and the pathogenesis of Myeloid abnormalities). Each specimen per panel was analyzed twice each day. There were six sample preparations in the morning and six sample preparations in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 12 replicates per specimen per panel. From 768 initial total replicates, 24 were excluded for reasons of specimen quality or operator error. Both quantitative and qualitative assessment were applied to the precision assessment where the presence or absence of an abnormal phenotype was reported.

All results showed $100 \%$ qualitative agreement across all sites, panels, anticoagulants, specimen types, and phenotypes.

For repeatability evaluation, pre-defined hematopoietic lineage populations were defined as in the table below:

\* Sample is a whole blood specimen collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant that demonstrated $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of $1 7 . 9 6 \%$ for between-runs and $1 8 . 9 0 \%$ for within-sample for CD33 marked Monocytes, as the CD33 marked Monocytes recovery in this specimen was $2 . 1 1 \%$ of total $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ cells. The data analysis indicated that imprecision was

likely due to variations from morning preparation to afternoon preparation within the sample. The high imprecision for this sample has no clinical impact.

The data analysis indicated that imprecision was likely due to variations from morning preparation to afternoon preparation within the sample. The high imprecision for this sample has no clinical impact.

& Sample is a phenotypically normal BM specimen collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant that demonstrated $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of $2 0 . 6 3 \%$ for the $\mathrm { T C R g / d }$ cells, as the TCR $\mathrm { g / d }$ cells recovery in this specimen was extremely low with only an average of 73 events collected, representing only ${ \sim } 0 . 1 2 \%$ of total $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 +$ cells. The high imprecision for this sample has no clinical impact.

b. Operator-to-operator and instrument-to-instrument imprecision:

The imprecision of between-operator and between-instrument was evaluated by testing four normal and four abnormal clinical specimens with the ClearLLab 10C Panels at one site, with three operators analyzing three replicates on each of two DxFLEX instruments on each of two runs. Each operator performed separate sample preparations in triplicate in both the morning and afternoon. Samples were acquired on each of two instruments, the order of which was randomized. Following acquisition, each operator analyzed listmode datafiles (LMD), using Kaluza C software. A reviewer assessed each LMD analysis as normal or abnormal, and further described the immunophenotype of abnormal results. The study included 288 analyses (three operators/replicate x three replicates/run x two runs/instrument x two instruments $= 3 6$ replicates/sample x eight samples).

All results showed $100 \%$ qualitative agreement across Instruments and Operators.

The number of samples tested is depicted in the tables below.

# c. Site-to-Site Reproducibility with Control Material:

The reproducibility of the ClearLLab 10C Reagent System on DxFLEX Flow Cytometer was evaluated utilizing one lot each of control cell materials: ClearLLab Normal Control Cells and ClearLLab Abnormal Control Cells. These control materials express all surface markers comprising the ClearLLab 10C panels. For multi-site testing, control materials allow samples to be shared between sites in a manner not available for native samples. For each panel, the two controls were tested on three instruments, across three total sites using one ClearLLab 10C reagent lot. At Site 1, testing was performed for 20 days $\times$ two runs/day $\times$ two replicates/run $\times$ three sites $\times$ one instrument/site. At sites 2 and 3, testing was performed for five days $\times$ two runs/day $\times$ three replicates/run $\times$ three sites $\times$ one instrument/site. Across all three sites, a total of 1133 analyses were generated; 13 were excluded due to operator error. The results are summarized in the tables below.

$\ast \% \mathrm { C V }$ of reproductivity for the sample is ${ > } 1 5 \%$ . As the repeatability of individual CD measurements includes unique variability sources, sources of variability include the frequency of cells with a particular phenotype, the level of the marker expression on the specific population being tested (in relation to the expression on other populations that are present), as well as the fluorescence intensity of the fluorochrome (quantum efficiency) of the specific conjugate used for staining. These differences in cell number, target analyte level, distribution on non-target populations and fluorochrome intensity affect the ability of the instrument/cytometrist to distinguish specific populations. These additional sources of variability contribute to the increased imprecision in several of the phenotypes tested.

2. Linearity (Fluorescence Detection):

The study was performed to evaluate the linearity and dynamic range of the DxFLEX Flow Cytometers’ acquisition systems, from the single-photon detection APD transfer to the electronics, independent of the application and gating methodology using SpheroTECH Rainbow particles (RCP-30-5A) analyzed at six different gain settings covering the dynamic range of the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer. The study was conducted on three DxFLEX Flow Cytometers. The results indicated the constancy $( < 5 \%$ deviation) of the ratio of adjacent bead fluorescence, across a series of gain settings. Representative data from one DxFLEX Flow Cytometer is presented in the following table.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

a. Interfering Substances:

Not applicable. The test system requires washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before staining with reagents to remove residual plasma and interfering substances.

b. Carryover:

Specimen Carryover

Specimen carryover was evaluated by following the protocol from CLSI H26-A2 on three DxFLEX Flow Cytometers. Samples with high concentration (high target value; HTv)

and low concentration (low target value; LTv) were run in multiple replicates on the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer. CD34 marker analysis was performed using a $\mathrm { C D } 3 4 +$ clinical specimen. Three high concentration samples (HTv1-HTv2-HTv3) targeting to 20,000 cells $/ \mu \mathrm { L }$ white blood cells (WBC) were prepared from one specimen containing a high level of white blood cells Low concentration samples (LTv1-LTv2-LTv3) counts were prepared by staining a diluted (1:10,000) specimen with a blank Red Cell Pool (a red blood cell pool which has been depleted of white blood cells diluted 4:1 with buffer). This resulted in a specimen composition similar to whole blood regarding the red blood cell concentration with residual concentrations of WBCs. On each of three DxFLEX Flow Cytometers, three HTv samples (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3) were analyzed consecutively followed immediately by the three LTv samples (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3) using the four ClearLLab 10C Panels. A total of 54 specimen carryover runs were generated for each panel. The $\%$ carryover, which is calculated as $\%$ Carryover $=$ (LTV1-LTV3)/average (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3), demonstrated to be $< 1 \%$ , for each of the 37 phenotypes measured across the four ClearLLab 10C tubes.

# Reagent Carryover

Reagent carryover was evaluated by following the protocol from CLSI H26-A2 on three DxFLEX Flow Cytometers. Samples with high concentration (high target value; HTv) and low concentration (low target value; LTv) were run in multiple replicates on the DxFLEX flow cytometer. Clinical bone marrow specimens stained with all four ClearLLab 10C Panels were used as the high concentration samples. Low concentration samples (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3) were prepared from the same clinical bone marrow specimens as in the high concentration samples, that were processed in triplicate using antibody dilution buffer (RD1), in place of the ClearLLab 10C Panels, to produce an unstained sample. On each of three DxFLEX Flow Cytometers and three HTv samples (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3) were analyzed consecutively followed immediately by the three LTv samples (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3). A total of 54 specimen carryover runs were generated for each panel. The $\%$ carryover, which is calculated as $\%$ Carryover $=$ (LTV1- LTV3)/average (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3), demonstrated to be $< 1 \%$ , for each of the 37 phenotypes measured across the four ClearLLab 10C tubes.

4. Accuracy (Instrument):

Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed to demonstrate qualitative agreement for the presence of abnormal cells between ClearLLab 10C Reagent System on the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer vs Navios EX Flow Cytometer. The study was based on the data generated from a multi-site retrospective clinical study conducted at five sites in which the test results from the ClearLLab 10C Reagents used to detect the presence or absence of an abnormal phenotype were compared to the clinical outcome of “malignant” or “non-malignant” based on the clinical sites’ final patient diagnosis.

Testing was conducted on the DxFLEX and Navios EX flow cytometers utilizing deidentified residual specimens, covering both hematologically abnormal malignant patients and hematologically abnormal non-malignant patients in line with the intended use of the ClearLLab 10C panels. The study included specimens of whole blood (WB) and bone

marrow (BM) collected in anticoagulant K2EDTA, Acid Citrate Dextrose (ACD) or Heparin, as well as specimens of lymph node (LN), which overall reflect the three major specimen types distributed in leukemia and lymphoma (L&L) diseases and clinical indications encountered in the L&L population. Patients with abnormal B-cell, T-cell, Natural Killer (NK) cell, and myeloid cell populations were tested. Specimen types tested reflected the distribution of the diseases and/or clinical indications encountered in the population of patients that are routinely encountered in evaluations of patients suspected of having hematopoietic neoplasia by flow cytometry. The study design was purposive, and specimens were enrolled consecutively.

Samples were prepared with all four ClearLLab 10C Panels, except LN where only B and T tubes were required. The same prepared tube was randomized for acquisition once on the Navios EX and once on the DxFLEX flow cytometer. Immunophenotyping was performed with provided analysis protocols using Kaluza C software. The phenotype assessments of the data generated from DxFLEX-10C system and Navios EX-10C system were independently assessed from each other. If clinical diagnosis was provided in the subject’s case report form, the Principal Investigator at each site was blinded to such diagnosis to further assure the review was exclusively phenotype based. The assessment for presence or absence of an abnormal phenotype was based on Bethesda and WHO guidelines as follows:

A $3 \%$ (in total leukocytes) clinical cutoff will be applied to BM blast population which is normally undetected in peripheral WB $( < 1 \% )$ or LN $( < 1 \% )$   
• $1 \%$ (in total leukocytes) clinical cutoff will be applied to all the other abnormal populations detected in BM, WB, or LN specimens

Of the 550 samples enrolled, 38 were excluded due to failing the inclusion criteria, preanalytical requirements or quality control or due to instrument, process or operator errors. A total of 512 specimens were qualified and included in the final analysis for evaluating method agreement per CLSI EP12-Ed3. The distribution of specimens is presented in the following tables.

The clinical performance was also assessed with the predicate device. The results demonstrated $100 \%$ phenotypic agreement between the candidate and predicate devices. For both methods, when compared to clinical diagnostic outcome, there were a total of 107 discordant cases including 11 non-concordant to non-malignancy (false positive) and 96 nonconcordant to malignancy (false negative) cases. The false negative was categorized as being due to specimen type limitation, flow cytometry limitation, or ClearLLab reagents limitation. These limitations occur when the phenotypically abnormal population is not found in a particular specimen, the clinical condition is not typically detected through flow cytometry, or the reagents did not have all the antibodies required to detect a particular clinical condition, respectively. False positive cases were primarily due to increases in populations that could represent reactive responses to viral or bacterial infection or autoimmunity, where lymphoid proliferation is common.

# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

The detection capability of the DxFLEX flow cytometer with the ClearLLab 10C Reagent, was assessed for each reagent tube using one normal specimen (Blank) that was spiked with samples having abnormal populations (CLL, T-ALL, Myelomonocytic Leukemia and AML), to target $0 . 5 \%$ , $1 \%$ and $2 \%$ of the abnormal population, each in five replicates. The results demonstrated that $100 \%$ of the replicates showed the correct populations, down to a level of $0 . 5 \%$ and verified that the Limit of Detection of $1 \%$ was confirmed on the new instrument.
