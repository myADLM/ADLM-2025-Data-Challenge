Dear Nikita Malladi:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn

# Device Description

The ACL TOP 970 CL is an additional member of the ACL TOP Family 70 Series previously FDA cleared under K231031. This family member consists of two side-by-side test modules:

• Main Module (ACL TOP 550 CTS, K150877) the subject of this submission • Chemiluminescent (CL) Module previously FDA cleared under K221359

The Main Module to the ACL TOP 970 CL instrument performs the following types of tests, using the same optical measuring wavelengths and test parameters as the predicate (ACL TOP Family 50 Series):

Coagulometric (Turbidimetric) Measurements • Chromogenic (Absorbance) Measurements • Immunological Measurements

The ACL TOP 970 CL is an additional member of the ACL TOP Family 70 Series (K231031) and utilizes the same consumables, reagents, calibrators, and controls, and provides the same analytical methodology for routine and specialty assay result reporting as the predicate (ACL TOP Family 50 Series).

The ACL TOP 970 CL also offers the same pre‐analytical features available on the ACL TOP Family 50 Series. These features alert the instrument operator to a potential HIL (Hemoglobin, Icteric and Lipemia) interference situation specific to the assays requested for a sample, underfilled sample tubes or a detected clog.

# Intended Use / Indications for Use

The ACL TOP 970 CL is a bench top, fully automated, random access analyzer designed specifically for in vitro diagnostic use by health care professionals in a clinical laboratory for coagulation and/or fibrinolysis testing in the assessment of thrombosis and/or hemostasis.

The system provides results for both direct measurements and calculated parameters.

# Reason for Special 510(k) Submission

This Special 510(k) is submitted for the following reasons:

• To obtain FDA clearance for the Main Module (ACL TOP 550 CTS side) of the ACL TOP 970 CL instrument Following FDA clearance, to extend the current FDA cleared on-market hemostasis (non-chemiluminescent) assay menu for the ACL TOP Family 50 Series onto the ACL TOP 970 CL instrument through CLIA Categorization Requests

\*Note: Chemiluminescent measurement on the ACL TOP 970 CL previously FDA cleared under K221359.

# Performance Summary

Analytical studies (specifically internal precision and method comparison) were performed on one lot of selected representative assays to establish that the labeled performance data of the current menu of FDAcleared (non-chemiluminescent) assays claimed for the ACL TOP Family 50 Series are applicable to the Main Module ACL TOP 970 CL. These studies followed recognized guidelines:

• CLSI EP05-A3 CLSI EP09c, 3rd Ed

All analytical studies were performed in accordance to established plans and protocols and design control procedures. Testing verified that all acceptance criteria were met and results equivalent to the predicate device.

# Precision

Precision studies were performed using one lot of the following selected representative assays tested on an ACL TOP 970 CL instrument. These studies used samples and controls with each material run for 20 days at two runs per day, 2 replicates per run $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ).
