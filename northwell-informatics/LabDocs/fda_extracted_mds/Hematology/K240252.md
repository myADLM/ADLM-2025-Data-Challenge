# Principle of Operation:

The Coulter Principle is used to count and size cells by detecting and measuring changes in electrical resistance when a particle (such as a cell), in a conductive liquid, passes through a small aperture as shown in Figure 1.

![](images/bf08b9469927e1c7f3477f1a03cd2d0363e7385d91402f5265cd238b7ff270ea.jpg)

Each cell, suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent), acts as an insulator. As each cell goes through the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between two submerged electrodes on either side of the aperture. This causes a measurable electronic pulse. For counting, the vacuum used to pull the diluted suspension of cells through the aperture must be at a regulated volume. While the number of pulses indicates particle count, the size of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell volume.

The lytic reagent used for the WBC prepares the blood so the system can count leukocytes and measure the amount of hemoglobin. The lytic reagent rapidly and simultaneously destroys the erythrocytes and converts a substantial proportion of the hemoglobin to a stable pigment while it leaves leukocyte nuclei intact. The absorbance of the pigment is directly proportional to the hemoglobin concentration of the sample. Hemoglobin is measured photometrically at $5 2 5 \mathrm { n m }$ using the sample from the WBC analysis. Clean diluent is introduced into the cuvette during each operating cycle and is used as a blank in the calculation of the HGB.

The COULTER VCS technology is used to determine the white cell differential, nucleated red blood cell and reticulocyte parameters along with associated flags, messages, histograms and

data plots. As the particles pass through the sensing zone, a diode laser illuminates the particles.   
The flow cell measures volume, conductivity, multiple angles of light scatter, and axial light loss. For the WBC differential, sample preparation occurs at the Diff mix chamber where sample and reagents are added in the following order: Diff Lyse, blood, additional Diff Lyse followed by an air mix. Next, Diff preservative is added, followed by a second air mix, and an incubation period. The prepared sample is transferred to the module where cells are counted in an isometric sample stream. The algorithm analysis separates the WBC into five major populations.   
For NRBC, sample preparation occurs at the NRBC Diff mix chamber where sample and reagents are added in the following order: Diluent, blood, additional Diluent followed by an air mix. Next, DxH Cell Lyse is added, followed by a second air mix, and an   
incubation period. The prepared sample is transferred to the module where cells are counted in an isometric sample stream. The algorithm analysis separates NRBC from WBC.   
Reticulocytes are immature, non-nucleated erythrocytes retaining a small network of basophilic organelles, consisting of RNA and protoporphyrin. The enumeration of reticulocytes provides a simple, effective means to determine red cell production and regeneration. Reticulocyte immaturity is related to cell volume and light scatter. Since more immature reticulocytes are larger, contain more RNA and cause increased light scatter, the cell volume and light scatter will increase with immaturity of the cell.

The DxH Slidemaker Stainer II allows for adaptation of the smear appearance and stain methodology according to user preferences. Blood smears produced by the Slidemaker portion of the DxH Slidemaker Stainer II are moved to baskets for transfer to the Stainer portion by a robot. Microscopic examination of the stained blood smears can be used to help determine the hematologic status of a patient.

The aspiration probe aspirates the mixed sample, which is transported into the dispense probe. The probe moves to the drop placement position where blood is placed on the slide. A second slide is picked up and used to spread the drop on the first slide using the wedge technique. The prepared slide is transferred into the print shuttle where Information is thermally printed on the painted portion of the slide, and then into the basket elevator for drying. The dispense probe is cleaned in the dispense wash cup after drop placement on the slide.

For staining, the slide basket is dipped into each bath (1 to 5) for a staining time according to the active protocol. Each bath is configured to receive reagent from a predetermined supply source configured by the user. Slides are dried after staining.

# 807.92 (b): Non-Clinical and/or Clinical Test Summary

a) Specimen Sampling Positions Comparability was tested on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ (predicate) per EP09c, CLSI H26-A2, and CLSI H56 to establish equivalency for all sampling modes (Single tube open vial, Single tube closed vial, and Cassette presentations). Due to the similarities in the instrument hardware, data presented in K120771 continues to support the use of all specimen sampling positions as appropriate for the intended use of the device.

b) Whole blood and body fluid repeatability precision was tested on the DxH 900-3S workcell (instruments BC03127, BC03129, and BC03130) using the instrument’s repeatability mode using cassette presentation for whole blood and single-tube presentation sampling for body fluids. Testing was performed according to CLSI H26-A2 and CLSI EP05-A3 to demonstrate the precision of the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ using whole blood and body fluid specimens. The whole blood and body fluid precision data provided supports the precision claims in the instructions for use. Connection of instruments into a workcell configuration does not significantly impact the precision.

Within run Repeatability of the parameters was performed using ten (10) aspirations of normal whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA. Specimens were selected for testing based on parameter value within specific ranges per parameter (measurand) to cover across the analytical measuring interval (AMI). Within run Imprecision (repeatability) was tested by performing replicate analysis of the specimens selected using the Repeatability function. Targeted specimens were used for more than one measurand. The coverage of the other measurand’s measuring ranges was dependent on the spread of the samples collected to cover the measuring interval of the measurands. If normal and clinical specimens in the intended use populations were not found for estimation of precision profiles, contrived samples and control material were used.

Abnormal patient samples with low NRBC $( 1 . 0 0 - 2 . 0 0 , > 2 . 0 0 - 1 5 . 0 0 )$ , high NRBC $( > 1 5 . 0 0 )$ , and high Reticulocytes $( > 4 . 0 0 0 - 1 5 . 0 )$ were not available during the test period. Instead, control material was used to assess Repeatability for these parameter values. Also, low levels for WBC $0 . 5 0 0 - 2 . 0 0 0 \times 1 0 3 ~ \mathrm { c e l l s / \mu L }$ , Platelet $1 0 . 0 \cdot 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { x } 1 0 3 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ , Body fluid RBC $1 0 , 0 0 0 - 1 5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mathrm { m m } 3$ and TNC $\mathsf { 5 0 - 2 } , 0 0 0 \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mathrm { m m } 3$ were performed using altered whole blood samples due to no donor availability during the testing period as well.

d) Linearity: Whole Blood and Body Fluid Linearity was tested on the $\mathrm { D x H } 9 0 0 { - } 3 \mathrm { S }$ workcell per CLSI EP06-A, 2nd Ed to assess system linearity of whole blood count parameters (WBC, RBC, PLT and HGB) and Body Fluids parameters (BF-RBC and BF-TNC) across the analytical measuring interval (AMI). Fresh whole blood was obtained and concentrated to achieve a high starting value near the upper limit of the AMI for each measurand. If values near the upper limit were not achieved using whole blood, surrogate (analog) cells were used instead. Dilutions were prepared of each measurand to cover the AMI and tested in quadruplicate in random order. Each dilution series contained a minimum of seven (7) dilutions and testing was performed on three (3) instruments. For count measurands, given the wide measuring interval, additional dilutions at the low end of the range were required.

e) Carryover: Whole Blood and Body Fluid High to Low Carryover was conducted on the DxH 900-3S workcell per CLSI H26-A2. Three (3) test instruments were used for each of the WBC, RBC, Hgb, and PLT parameters. One (1) replicate from each of the three (3) High Target Value tubes followed by one (1) replicate from each of the three (3) Low Target Value tubes were analyzed. Each of the Low Target Value tubes was only aspirated once. This step was repeated three (3) times for each parameter. The WBC, RBC, $\mathrm { H g b }$ , and PLT parameters for Carryover were calculated using the formula $\%$ carryover $\mathbf { \Sigma } = [ ( \mathrm { L T V } \ 1 -$ LTV 3)/(HTV 3-LTV 3)] X100, where HTV $\dot { = }$ high target value, LTV=low target value. The data presented in the submission supports there is no detectable carryover for whole blood or body fluids as described in the Instructions for Use. The data supports that connection of instruments into a workcell configuration does not impact carryover.

f) Performance Detection Capability Limits: Limit of Blank (LoB), Lower Limit of Detection (LLoD) and Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ) was conducted on the DxH 900-3S workcell per CLSI EP17-A2 to evaluate the LoB, LLoD and LLoQ for WBC, PLT, BFRBC, and BF-TNC.

LoB was performed using DxH diluent as blank in the CBC, CDR, CD and CR test panel in cassette presentation, five (5) replicates of each panel were analyzed for a total of twenty (20) replicates in the AM and PM for three (3) days for a total of 120 whole blood cassette presentation cycles. Twenty (20) replicates of DxH diluent (blank) were analyzed in the single tube presentation as BF cycle in the AM and PM for three (3) days for a total of 120 single tube BF cycles. In both scenarios, two (2) lots of $\mathrm { D x H }$ diluent and DxH Cell Lyse reagents were used.

To test for LLoD and LLoQ, a dilution of a fresh whole blood sample was prepared to obtain a stock solution with a value in one of the following target ranges (WBC $6 0 – 7 0 \mathrm { x }$ $1 0 3 / \mu \mathrm { L }$ , PLT ${ \mathsf { 7 } } { \cdot } 9 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 3 / { \mu \mathrm { L } }$ , TNC 45-50 cells/mm3, and BF-RBC 2450- 2470 cells $/ \mathrm { m m } 3$ ). Four (4) samples per parameter were obtained for a total of sixteen (16) samples per instrument. Three (3) sets of eleven (11) dilutions of the stock solution were prepared in $10 \%$ increments from $0 \%$ to $100 \%$ . One (1) set of dilutions was analyzed on each of the test instruments. Five (5) replicates of each dilution level were analyzed on each test instrument in the CBC test panel for WBC and PLT and five (5) replicates of each were analyzed on each instrument in the BFC test panel for TNC and BF-RBC.

Bias was established by analyzing five (5) normal whole blood samples each day in duplicate on the test instruments and $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ comparator using the CBC test panel.

The limit of quantitation data provided supports the intended use of the device and the lower limit of the analytical measuring interval per the instructions for use. The data supports that connection of instruments into a workcell configuration does not significantly impact the analytical measuring range. For WBC, PLT, BF-TNC, and BF-RBC, LLoQ are aligned with the background limit and the lower limit of the measuring range.

g) Reference Ranges: Studies to assess the Adult Reference Interval (Whole Blood) were conducted on the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ per CLSI EP28-A3c to verify the reference intervals for male and female adults on the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 / D x H 6 9 0 T }$ Analyzer are the same as the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ Analyzer (predicate). The data verifies the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ references ranges presented in the IFU are transferable to the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 / D x H 6 9 0 T }$ . The data supports that connected workcells have the same reference ranges as a stand-alone instrument.

h) Whole Blood Method Comparison was tested according to $\mathrm { E P 0 9 c }$ & CLSI H26-A2 to support substantial equivalency by comparison of the CBC, NRBC, DIFF and RETIC values obtained on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ Analyzer (predicate) to the values obtained on the DxH 900 Analyzer . This included adult and pediatric samples. The data provided for whole blood method comparison is comprehensive, covering the analytical measurement interval (AMI). Data was collected from multiple sites on both stand-alone and connected workcell instrument configurations using both legacy and ECO reagents. Data were analyzed pooled and by site to support the substantial equivalence of the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ to the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ for CBC, NRBC, DIFF and RETIC parameters. This data supports the intended use of the DxH 900 in stand-alone and connected workcell configurations and supports the use of ECO reagents.

i) Body Fluid Method Comparison was tested according to $\mathrm { E P 0 9 c }$ , CLSI H26-A2 and CLSI H56 to establish equivalency of the Body Fluid obtained on the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ Analyzer (Predicate) to the values obtained on the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ Analyzer (subject). The data for body fluid method comparison is comprehensive data covering the AMI, from multiple sites including stand-alone and connected workcell instrument configurations using both legacy and ECO reagents. Data were analyzed pooled and by site to support the substantial equivalence of the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ to the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ for BF-TNC and BF-RBC parameters. This data supports the intended use of the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ in stand-alone and connected workcell configuration and supports the use of ECO reagents.

j) Flagging analysis was conducted to evaluate the flagging capabilities of the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ using the flagging results obtained from the samples used in the method comparison study, from three (3) clinical sites, based on CLSI H20-A2 guidelines. A total of 735 residual normal (no flags, marked as negative) and abnormal (contained flags, marked as positive) whole blood samples were tested and compared to the predicate.

The results were classified according to the following categories:

• TN (True negative): DxH 900 result and predicate result are both negative (normal sample).   
• TP (True positive): DxH 900 result and predicate result are both positive (abnormal sample). FN (False Negative): $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ gives a negative result (normal sample) whereas predicate gives a positive result (abnormal sample). FP (False Positive): $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ gives a positive result (abnormal sample) whereas predicate gives a negative result (normal sample).

The NPA, PPA and OPA were calculated for each pathology and abnormality, using the following calculations:

Negative Percent Agreement (NPA): TN / (TN+FP) Positive Percent Agreement (PPA): TP / (TP+FN) Overall Percent Agreement (OPA): (TP+TN) / (TP+FN+FP+TN)

A summary of the results is presented in the table below. All of the distributional cases described in CLSI H20 are important medical decision levels and showed good clinical negative and positive percent agreement between the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ and $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ . The morphological agreement was based on $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ (predicate) flagging for immature granulocytes, variant lymphocytes and left shift. Morphological results showed good clinical negative and positive percent agreement between the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ and $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ .

k) DxH 690T - The only differences between the UniCel $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ Coulter Cellular Analysis System and UniCel DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System are the designed inability to connect as part of a workcell and the lack of the base cabinet with the quad diluent feature (ability to load 4 diluent boxes). All other hardware and software are identical on the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ and DxH 690T instruments. In order to show that analytical and clinical study data collected on a $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ would also be representative of the $\mathrm { D x H } 6 9 0 \mathrm { T }$ , performance verification testing was completed. Testing was performed on one (1) $\mathrm { D x H } 6 9 0 \mathrm { T }$ along with one (1) $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ and for accuracy, one (1) $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ . Test cases included Daily Checks, Daily Shutdown, Calibration and Initial Control Recover, Daily Control Recovery, Repeatability, Linearity using LIN-X Linearity Control, Comparability- whole blood

accuracy, and Carryover. All test cases met the predetermined acceptance criteria. Results of each test case are summarized here:

o Daily Checks - The Daily Checks cycle was performed on days when testing was performed before analysis of control material or blood specimens. Daily Checks results were within the instrument limits and background limits shown each day before the analysis of control material or blood specimens.

O Daily Shutdown - A shutdown cycle was performed each day prior to Daily Checks according to the IFU. The shutdown cycle was performed successfully each day following completion of the testing or in the morning prior to the Daily Checks cycle. The Shutdown cycle put cleaner into the system and removed cleaner and left the instrument ready for the Daily Checks cycle.

o Calibration and Initial Control Recovery - Initial calibration was performed on the test instruments using the COULTER S-Cal Calibrator. Calibration was verified by analyzing each level of COULTER 6C Plus Cell Control. Calibration was initially performed using S-Cal lot 113161240, expiration 5/4/19. The HGB and MCV were adjusted on Instrument SN BC09305, and the RBC parameter was adjusted on Instrument SN BA51011. For verification, all three levels of 6C Plus Cell Control recovered within the expected ranges set for each level on all test instruments.

o Daily Control Recovery - A minimum of one replicate of COULTER Latron CPX was analyzed each day after the Daily Checks cycle. A minimum of one replicate of each level of COULTER 6C Plus Cell Control, and COULTER ReticX Cell Control was analyzed each day during the evaluation period. The controls were analyzed each day that testing was performed on an instrument. In the event of a flag, partial aspiration or non-numeric result on a control run, the control was repeated. In each case, a control result was recovered within the assigned ranges and without flags. For all test instruments, results for all controls were within the expected assay ranges prior to data collection each day data collection was performed.

o Repeatability - Within Run Repeatability for the CBC, Differential, NRBC and Reticulocyte parameters was performed using ten aspirations $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 )$ ) in the automatic CDR test panel. The customer “Repeatability” application in the software was used to capture the results. Repeatability testing was performed using a combination of normal whole blood samples, abnormal samples, manipulated samples, and COULTER 6C Plus Cell Control Level 2 and Level 3 to obtain the ranges for each parameter required. Testing was performed across three (3) days. The test instruments met the repeatability specifications for all parameters. The COULTER 6C Plus Cell Control Level 2 was used to obtain NRBC $> 2 \ – 5$ and COULTER 6C Plus Cell Control Level 3 was used to obtain $\mathrm { N R B C } > 1 5 .$ Results are listed in the tables below.

O Linearity using COULTER LIN-X Linearity Controls - Linearity was performed in the CBC test panel for WBC, RBC, Hgb and PLT using LIN-X Linearity Control. Linearity with the COULTER LIN-X Linearity Control was performed on the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ and DxH 690T test instruments. LIN-X Linearity Control passed for all data points on both test instruments.

o Accuracy - A total of 382 whole blood specimens (60 normal, 322 abnormal) were collected. Accuracy testing was performed in the automatic mode using the CDR test panel by analyzing each blood sample once through the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ and $\mathrm { D x H } 6 9 0 \mathrm { T }$ instruments and the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ (predicate). COULTER S-Cal Calibrator was analyzed on the test and comparator instruments each day of accuracy testing if zero calibration was required. Results for CBC, Differential, NRBC, RET, IRF, and MRV parameters were compared using the specifications of the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ . Weighted Deming analysis was performed for WBC, RBC, and PLT, and Deming analysis was performed for the WBC Differential, RETIC, IRF, and MRV parameters, and the remaining CBC parameters. The average bias and upper and lower limits of bias for the complete data set, 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles, and medical decision points were compared to the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ accuracy specifications for each parameter. Although the COULTER S-Cal Calibrator was analyzed every day of testing, no adjustments were required. Regression analysis was performed for NRBC to obtain the coefficient of variation to compare to the DxH 800 specification. Parameters results with “R” flags, had non-numeric, or partial aspiration were excluded from the analysis.

The CBC, WBC Differential, MRV, RET, IRF, and NRBC results for accuracy met the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ accuracy specifications for the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ and $\mathrm { D x H } 6 9 0 \mathrm { T }$ instruments. Mean difference and average lower and upper bias statistics for the CBC, WBC differential, MRV and IRF parameter comparisons follow. The acceptance limit was calculated from the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ accuracy specification. Results for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles and medical decision levels are not shown, but all recovered within the accuracy specification.

o Carryover - Within mode carryover was performed in the automatic CDR mode using the customer “Carryover” application in the software. Normal whole blood, clinical samples, and blood altered by concentration, or the addition of analogs were used to achieve the following levels for testing:

 $\mathrm { W B C } > 9 0 . 0$  $\mathrm { W B C } > 3 0 0$  $\mathrm { R B C } > 6 . 2 0$  Hgb > 22.0  PLT > 900

Carryover was performed on the $\mathrm { D x H } 6 9 0 \mathrm { T }$ and DxH 900. Carryover results for both test instruments recovered within the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ carryover limits.
