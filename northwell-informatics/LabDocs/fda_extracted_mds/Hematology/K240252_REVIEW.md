# DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System

The DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System consists of a stand-alone tabletop DxH 690T instrument with same detection capabilities, technology, software and analytes as the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ instrument. The DxH 690T cannot be configured as a workcell.

# B Principle of Operation:

The UniCel DxH 900/DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System is based on the Coulter Principle. The Coulter Principle accurately counts and sizes cells by detecting and measuring changes in electrical resistance when a particle (such as a cell) in a conductive liquid passes through a small aperture. Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an insulator. As each cell goes through the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between the submerged electrodes on either side of the aperture. This causes a measurable electronic pulse. For counting, the vacuum used to pull the diluted suspension of cells through the aperture must be at a regulated volume. While the number of pulses indicates particle count, the size of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell volume. All pulses generated by the apertures are collected and sent to the Signal Conditioner Analyzer Card for analog to digital conversion. The process provides the following raw counts and digital measurements to the System Manager for processing by the algorithms where the reported parameter values, flags and histograms are generated.

The complete blood count (CBC) is the fundamental analytical test that evaluates the three main cellular components: white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Sample preparation and data collection occur in the Sample Aspiration Module (SAM) and Complete Blood Count (CBC) modules on the UniCel DxH 900/DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System.

The lytic reagent for WBC is used to prepare the blood so the system can count leukocytes and measure the amount of hemoglobin. The lytic reagent rapidly and simultaneously destroys the erythrocytes and converts a substantial proportion of the hemoglobin to a stable pigment while it leaves leukocyte nuclei intact. The absorbance of the pigment is directly proportional to the hemoglobin concentration of the sample. Hemoglobin (HGB) is measured photometrically at 525 nm using the sample from the WBC analysis. A blank is introduced into the cuvette during each operating cycle. The HGB blank provides a reference to which the sample signal is compared.

The COULTER VCSn technology is used to determine the white cell differential, nucleated red blood cell and reticulocyte parameters along with associated flags, messages, histograms and data plots. As the particles pass through the sensing zone, a diode laser illuminates the particles. The flow cell measures volume, conductivity, multiple angles of light scatter, and axial light loss.

For the WBC differential, sample preparation occurs at the Diff mix chamber where sample and reagents are added in the following order: Diff Lyse, blood, additional Diff Lyse followed by an air mix. Next, Diff preservative is added, followed by a second air mix, and an incubation period. The prepared sample is transferred to the module where cells are counted in an isometric sample stream. The algorithm separates the WBC into five major populations.

For NRBC, sample preparation occurs at the NRBC Diff mix chamber where sample and reagents are added in the following order: Diluent, blood, additional Diluent followed by an air mix. Next, DxH Cell Lyse is added, followed by a second air mix, and an incubation period. The prepared sample is transferred to the module where cells are counted in an isometric sample stream. The algorithm separates NRBC from WBC.

Reticulocytes are immature, non-nucleated erythrocytes retaining a small network of basophilic organelles, consisting of RNA and protoporphyrin. The enumeration of reticulocytes provides a simple, effective means to determine red cell production and regeneration. Reticulocyte immaturity is related to cell volume and light scatter. Since more immature reticulocytes are larger, contain more RNA and cause increased light scatter, the cell volume and light scatter will increase with immaturity of the cell.

The data collected during each of the analytical processes is transferred to the System Manager where the digital raw values are processed by the algorithm using mathematical approaches designed for finding optimal separation between clusters of data. The identified clusters are used to calculate the frequency of cells within each population, generate parameter values, flags, histograms and data plots.

The DxH Slidemaker Stainer II allows for adaptation of the smear appearance and stain methodology. Blood smears produced by the Slidemaker portion of the DxH Slidemaker Stainer II are moved to baskets for transfer to the Stainer portion by a robot for microscopic examination of the stained blood smears.

Repeatability −Whole Blood

Repeatability studies were performed at one testing site on the DxH 900−3S work cell composed of three $\mathrm { D x H } 9 0 0$ and one SMS II under repeatability mode using cassette presentation and closed-vial sampling mode. Within run repeatability studies were performed by using ten whole blood samples covering the analytical measuring interval (AMI) collected in K2EDTA. Testing was performed randomly on one of the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ instrument of DxH 900−3S work cell. Within run imprecision (repeatability) was performed using ten aspirations (replicates) of whole blood samples and replicate analysis of the specimens was performed by using the Repeatability function. Control material was used for assaying precision of NRBC parameter.

The mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and $9 5 \%$ CI were calculated for each parameter.

# Repeatability Body Fluid

Repeatability studies were performed at one testing site on the DxH 900−3S work cell composed of three $\mathrm { D x H } 9 0 0$ and one SMS II under repeatability mode using manual singletube and open-vial sampling mode. Study was conducted using leftover body fluid samples (4 peritoneal, 2 pleural and 1 synovial) tested within four hours of draw collected from a total of seven subjects. A total of three samples in the BF-RBC range and seven samples in the BF-TNC range were included. The $C V \%$ , SD and $9 5 \%$ CI were calculated for each analyte for each sample with at least nine aspirations (replicates). All samples were evaluated against all applicable acceptance criteria and met all acceptance criteria requirements. The results are summarized below.

# Reproducibility – Whole Blood

Reproducibility studies were performed at one testing site on one DxH 900−3S work cell composed of three $\mathrm { D x H } 9 0 0$ and one SMS II to evaluate the within-run, between-run, between-day, between-instrument, and total reproducibility of the $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ . Testing was performed using three levels of each whole blood control material (COULTER 6C Plus Cell Control and COULTER Retic-X Cell Control). Each level was run in triplicates twice per day per instrument with two hours apart for five days using a single lot of controls and reagents across the three DxH 900−3S work cell. The mean, SD and $C V \%$ were reported for each parameter and all parameters met the acceptance criteria. Results are summarized below.

# C Clinical Studies:

# 1. Clinical Sensitivity:

Sensitivity study was conducted to evaluate the flagging capabilities of the UniCel DxH 900 Coulter Cellular Analysis System and compare with that of UniCel $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ Coulter Cellular Analysis System. The analysis was conducted using the flagging results from the method comparison studies performed at three clinical sites, in accordance with CLSI H20- A2 guideline. A total of 735 residual normal (no flags, marked as negative) and abnormal (contained flags, marked as positive) whole blood samples were tested and compared to the predicate. All the distributional cases described in CLSI H20-A2 including important medical decision levels were analyzed for agreement analysis. The morphological agreement was based on $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ (predicate) flagging for immature granulocytes, variant lymphocytes and left shift. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA), Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) and Overall Percent Agreement (OPA) with the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals were calculated for all three sites combined.

# D Clinical Cut-Off:

Not applicable.

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

Adult Whole Blood Reference Range Studies to assess the adult reference range for whole blood samples were conducted on UniCel $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ Coulter Cellular Analysis System per CLSI EP28-A3c to verify the reference intervals for male and female adults at one site. Forty whole-blood samples (male ${ } = 2 0 \ $ ; female ${ } = 2 0$ ) were collected in K2EDTA from normal donors and tested in one replicate on two standalone UniCel $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ Coulter Cellular Analysis Systems $\mathrm { ( D x H 9 0 0 }$ instrument). The lower and upper limits of the $9 5 \%$ reference intervals were determined based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of all valid measurements for each sex group, respectively. $90 \%$ of the normal samples were within the established reference ranges on the predicate device $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ . The data supports that the

reference ranges established for the predicate device $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ are applicable for the candidate device $\mathrm { D x H 9 0 0 }$ . The reference intervals are summarized in table below:
