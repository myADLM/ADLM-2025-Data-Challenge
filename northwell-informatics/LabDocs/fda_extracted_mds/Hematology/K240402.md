# IV Device Description Summary

The Cito CBC system is an automated hematology analyzer that is intended to analyze human whole blood, and report results of 16 hematology parameters. The system consists of a tabletop analyzer, the Cito CBC Analyzer, and a disposable test cartridge, the Cito CBC Cartridge. The analyzer includes software with Graphic User Interface to guide users to complete test procedure. To perform a test, the test cartridges and other test consumables are provided as a test kit. The current version of the test cartridge is designed for testing whole blood anticoagulated with K2EDTA. The current version of the test kit is designed for testing venous whole blood collected in a vacutainer tube.

The Cito CBC analyzer utilizes the principle of fluorescent flow cytometry for cell count and cell classification. A laser is used as the light source, and fluorescence and light scattering signals are detected for the measurements. For fluorescent labeling, blood cells are treated with a fluorescent dye that has high affinity binding to nucleic acid.

Additionally, the analyzer utilizes the principle of two-wavelength photometry for the measurement of hemoglobin. Blood cells are lysed to release hemoglobin. Meanwhile, the light scattering signal measured from the flow cytometry and the light absorption signals measured from the photometry are both used to quantify the hematocrit and the mean corpuscular volume.

The Cito CBC cartridge is self-contained with all reagents to perform a test. The blood sample is applied to the test cartridge, and the test cartridge is inserted into the analyzer to complete the test. The analyzer has a pneumatic module which provides pressure to the cartridge and drives the applied sample to mix with reagents to form multiple sample mixtures. The cartridge has transparent flow cells to support the measurements of sample mixtures by fluorescent flow cytometry and photometry. The sample mixtures and the measurement wastes are all self-contained inside the cartridge for safe disposal after the test.

# V Intended Use/Indications for Use

The Cito CBC system is a quantitative automated hematology analyzer intended for invitro diagnostic use to determine the following parameters with whole blood anticoagulated with K2EDTA (Venous):

- CBC parameters: white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), platelet count (PLT), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV);

- 5-Part WBC Differential (WBC Diff): neutrophil count and percentage (NEUT and $\mathrm { N E U T \% }$ ), lymphocyte count and percentage (LYMPH and $\mathrm { L Y M P H \% }$ ), monocyte count and percentage (MONO and $\mathrm { M O N O \% }$ ), eosinophil count and percentage (EO and $\mathrm { E O \% }$ ), basophil count and percentage (BASO and $\mathrm { B A S O \% }$ ).

It is not indicated for use in diagnosing or monitoring of oncology patients, critically ill patients, or children under the age of 2 years.

# VI Indication for Use Comparison

The Cito CBC System has similar indications for use when compared to the predicate device Sysmex XN-Series (XN10/20). Both devices are quantitative, multi-parameter, automated in vitro diagnostic hematology analyzers intended for classifying and enumerating CBC parameters.

# VII Technological Comparison

The Cito CBC System has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device. Both devices use flow cytometry for cell counting and differential. Both devices use photometry for HGB measurement.

Furthermore, as described in the performance testing summary below, the verification and validation (bench and clinical) testing successfully demonstrated substantial equivalence for the Cito CBC System to the predicate device per 21 CFR § 807.92(b)(3).

# VIII Non-Clinical and/or Clinical Tests Summary

# Non-Clinical Study Summary

1. Precision-Repeatability Study with Whole Blood at Clinical Sites (CLSI EP05-A3) Precision performance was evaluated by testing fresh whole blood at CLIA-waived sites by untrained operators. Venous whole blood (K2EDTA anticoagulated) was used to evaluate the precision of reported CBC parameters. Three CLIA-waived sites participated in this study, and each site used one analyzer and at least two untrained operators. For the three sites in total, 45 blood samples were selected and tested to cover the three intervals (low, normal, high) for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT and MCV. 10 consecutive tests were performed for each sample. The study calculates the StDev (standard deviation) and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ (coefficient of variation) for each reported parameter of each sample. The study results pool the StDev and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ together across the three sites into three intervals (low, normal, high), following the protocol of CLIS EP05-A3. The pooled StDev and pooled $\% \mathrm { C V }$ met the acceptance criteria for all reported parameters in the three intervals (low, normal, high) and at the medical decision levels.

# 2. Reproducibility Study with QC material at Clinical Sites (CLSI EP05-A3)

The reproducibility performance was evaluated by testing QC material at CLIA-waived Sites by untrained operators. Three CLIA-waived sites participated in this study, and each site used one analyzer and at least two untrained operators. At each site, the study was performed for 5 days. In each day, 2 test runs were performed with 3 replicates per run.

One lot of the QC material (three levels: low, normal, and high) was used and a total of 90 tests were performed for each control level over the study (3 sites $\times 5$ days $_ { | \times 2 }$ test runs $\times 3$ replicates per run). In total, 270 tests were performed for all three control levels (low, normal, and high). ANOVA analysis was performed according to CLSI EP05-A3 to calculate the within-run %CV/StDev, between-run/between operator $\% C \mathrm { V / S t D e v }$ , between-day %CV/StDev, between-site $\% C \mathrm { V / S t D e v }$ , and total $\mathrm { \Delta \% C V / S t D e v }$ for each control level. The total %CV/StDev of reported parameters for each of the three levels all met the acceptance criteria.

# 3. Linearity Study (CLSI EP06 Ed2)

The linearity interval of the WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT and MCV were evaluated using fresh whole blood (venous blood anticoagulated with K2EDTA). A 9-concentration sample panel was tested for each parameter and each sample was tested twice on the Study Device and twice on the predicate device (Sysmex XN Hematology Analyzer). Linear Regression was performed for data analysis and percentage bias thresholds were defined for each parameter to quantify the linear range. The study results established the linearity intervals of the reported parameters.

4. Detection Limit Study - Limit of Quantification (LoQ) (CLSI EP17-A2)

Four venous whole blood samples were diluted with homologous plasma to make lowlevel samples and were used in this study to evaluate LoQ of WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT and MCV. For each sample, 9 replicate tests were performed with each cartridge lot, and two cartridge lots were used to capture the reagent variability (in total 18 tests for each sample). For the four samples, a total of 72 tests were performed, with 36 tests for each cartridge lot. The LoQ was determined individually for two cartridge lots, and the greater LoQ between the two cartridge lots was taken as the LoQ for each parameter.

5. Assay Measuring Range Study (CLSI H26-A2)

The Assay Measuring Ranges for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT and MCV are determined from the Linearity and the LoQ study results. The lower limit of the measuring range is determined by the higher one of the following two: A) lower limit of the linearity interval; and B) LoQ. The upper limit of the measuring range is determined by the upper limit of the linearity interval.

After establishing the Measuring Ranges, the reportable ranges are chosen to be equal to or narrower than the Measuring Ranges, by applying a set of suppression levels for CLIA Waived setting. After applying the suppression levels to the Measuring Ranges, the Reportable Ranges (with Suppression) are established. The analyzer only reports numeric results within the Reportable Ranges (with Suppression), while numeric results outside these ranges are suppressed.

# 6. Interference Study (CLSI EP07 Ed3)

A study was conducted to determine the interference level for the following interfering substances: conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, K2EDTA, chyle, intralipid, and hemolytic hemoglobin. The interference levels were evaluated by testing fresh whole blood (venous blood anticoagulated with K2EDTA) spiked with the interferents at target concentration levels. For each interferent, blood samples were spiked with the interferent, and five replicate tests were performed with both control group (no spiking) and test group (with spiking) for comparison. A total of three blood samples were tested for each interferent.

The results of the interference study demonstrated that:

There was no significant conjugated bilirubin interference up to a concentration of 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.

There was no significant unconjugated bilirubin interference up to a concentration of 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.

There was no significant K2EDTA interference up to a concentration of $8 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.

There was no significant Chyle interference up to a concentration of 2,524 FTU for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.

There was no significant intralipid interference up to a concentration of $2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for WBC, PLT, and HGB, and up to a concentration of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for RBC, HCT, and MCV. Samples with intralipid higher than $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ trigger a fail-alert mechanism and the impacted results (RBC, HCT and MCV) are automatically suppressed.

There was no significant hemolytic hemoglobin interference up to a concentration of 1.0 $\mathrm { g / d L }$ for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, and MCV, and up to a concentration of $0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ for HCT.

# 7. Metrological Traceability Study (CLSI EP32-R)

The traceability of the Device was established by using the predicate device (Sysmex XN Hematology Analyzer, K112605) as the reference method following CLSI EP32-R guideline. The predicate device has established traceability by the commercial calibrators (XN CAL/XN CAL PF, K141962/K120747) to internationally recognized reference methods:

- WBC and RBC: Reference method for the enumeration of erythrocytes and leucocytes, ICSH Expert Panel on Cytometry, Clin Lab Haematol. 1994; 16, 131-138; - HGB: Recommendation for reference method for haemoglobinometry in human blood (ICSH standard 1995) and specification for international haemiglobincyanide standard (4th edition), ICSH Expert Panel on Haemoglobinometry, J Clin Pathol 1996; 49: 271-274; - HCT: Recommendations for Reference Method for the Packed Cell Volume (ICSH Standard 2001), ICSH Expert Panel on Cytometry, Clin Lab Hematol. 2001; 7:148-170; - PLT: ICSH Expert Panel on Cytometry, Platelet Counting by the RBC/Platelet Ratio Method-Mar. 2001, American Journal of Clinical Pathology.

# 8. Specimen Stability Study

Specimen stability of venous whole blood (K2EDTA anticoagulated) was evaluated for specimens stored at the following conditions, room temperature condition $( 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ or refrigerated temperature condition $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . For each of the two conditions, 6 normal samples and 4 abnormal samples were tested respectively. At time zero (0 hour), the samples were tested in triplicates to establish the baseline. These samples were tested again in duplicate at the following time points: 4.5 hours, 6.5 hours, and 8.5 hours. For each time point, the results were compared to the baseline results, and the mean percentage difference was calculated. The results of all tested time points met the acceptance criteria, supporting the claim of an 8-hour blood sample stability duration.

9. Cartridge Lot-to-Lot Variability Study (CLSI EP05-A3)

A study was performed to evaluate the lot-to-lot variability of the test cartridge. Three consecutive cartridge lots were used for the study, and venous whole blood (K2EDTA anticoagulated) was tested to assess the within-lot, between-lot and total variability. A total of 19 samples covering normal and abnormal ranges were tested in this study. For each sample, 5 replicate tests were performed for each cartridge lot (15 tests per sample for the three cartridge lots). ANOVA analysis was performed according to CLSI EP05-A3 to calculate the within-lot $\% C \mathrm { V / S t D e v }$ , between-lot %CV/StDev, and total %CV/StDev, which all met the acceptance criteria.

10. QC Material – Lot-to-Lot reproducibility (CLSI EP05-A3)

This study was to evaluate the lot-to-lot reproducibility of the QC kit. Three lots of QC materials were selected for testing. From each lot, one QC kit was selected which included three levels (low, normal and high levels). Each level of the QC material was tested for 5 days $\times 2$ runs $\times 3$ replicates. In total, 270 tests were performed. For each lot, ANOVA analysis was performed according to CLSI EP05-A3 to calculate the within-lot $\mathrm { \% C V / S t D e v } .$ , between-lot %CV/StDev, and total %CV/StDev. For each QC parameter of each level, the pooled total CV/StDev of the three lots were determined, and the results met the acceptance criteria.

# Clinical Study Summary

1. Method Comparison (CLSI H26-A2, CLSI H20-A2, CLSI EP09-A3)

Method comparison studies were performed across three CLIA-waived testing sites (with nine untrained operators in total) to evaluate the performance of the Study Device compared to the Comparative Method, Sysmex XN Automated Hematology Analyzer. A total of 481 venous whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA vacutainer tube were tested. The samples fully covered the reportable ranges of the device and a wide variety of clinical conditions, including Anemia, Chronic Inflammation, Bacterial Infection, Viral Infection, Respiratory Disease, Cardiovascular Disease, Liver Disease, Kidney Disease, Metabolic Disease, Autoimmune/Rheumatological Disease,

Hemoglobinopathies/Hereditary RBC disease (including Iron deficiency, Hb variant), Leukemia (including Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia), Lymphoma, Benign Leukopenia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Solid Tumor, Cancer and other oncological conditions, etc.

Statistical analysis for the method comparison was performed based on correlation plots with Deming regression and Bland-Altman plot for bias. For each reported parameter, the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient from the Deming fittings, and the mean bias between the Cito CBC Analyzer and the Comparative Method were analyzed, and the results fully met the acceptance criteria.

# 2. Flagging Comparison (CLSI H20-A2)

Flagging comparison studies were performed across five CLIA-waived testing sites and one point-of-care site to evaluate the flagging agreement between the Study Device and the Comparative Method, Sysmex XN Automated Hematology Analyzer.

A total of 1,082 venous whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA vacutainer tube were tested, which covered a wide variety of abnormalities including distribution abnormalities, morphological abnormalities, and other abnormal conditions (e.g. warm/cold agglutinins, in vivo hemolysis).

Based on the reported flags, each sample was categorized as either Negative (no sample abnormalities) or Positive (with sample abnormalities). The Positive Percent Agreement, Negative Percent Agreement and Overall Agreement were calculated. The results of the flagging agreement (Positive Agreement $9 1 . 9 \%$ , Negative Agreement $9 5 . 3 \%$ , and Overall Agreement $9 3 . 7 \%$ ) fully met the acceptance criteria.

# 3. Reference Interval (CLSI EP28-A3c)

A referent interval study was performed to determine the reference intervals of adults and pediatrics on the Study Device. Healthy subjects were enrolled at CLIA-waived sites for the study, including 253 adults over 21 years old (127 male, 126 female), 46 adolescents between 12-21 years old (21 male, 25 female), and 41 children between 2-12 years old (20 male, 21 female). Venous samples of whole blood anticoagulated with K2EDTA were collected from each subject and tested on the Study Device. For the adult group (over 21 years old), reference intervals are established by non-parametric method following CLSI EP28-A3c. For the adolescent group (12-21 years old) and the children group (2-12 years old), the reference intervals published in literature were verified on the Study Device.

# IX Non-Clinical and/or Clinical Tests Conclusions

The performance data in nonclinical and clinical tests demonstrated substantial equivalence with the predicate device.
