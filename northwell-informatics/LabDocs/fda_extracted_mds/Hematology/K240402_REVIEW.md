# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The CytoChip Cito CBC System is an automated hematology analyzer that is intended to analyze $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA venous human whole blood, and report results of 16 hematology parameters (WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, MCV, LYMPH #/%, NEUT $\# / \%$ , MONO $\# / \%$ , EO $\# / \%$ , and BASO #/%). The system is comprised of an automated benchtop reader instrument (Cito CBC Analyzer), accessories, and disposable Cito CBC test kits. Each test kit includes 25 individually packaged test cartridges, alcohol wipes, a sample dispensing tips, one sealing card and package insert.

The Cito CBC Analyzer contains the essential hardware and software to perform a test with a disposable cartridge. It consists of 1) pneumatic module to actuate fluid transfer in the cartridge, 2) optical module to detect signals from the cartridge, 3) heating module to accelerate the

chemistry reaction in the cartridge, 4) control and signal board; 5) on-board computer for results computation and user interface. All reagents, sample and bio-waste are self-contained in the cartridge and has no physical contact with the analyzer.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Cito CBC system uses two detection modules in the reader instrument for measurement of a test run: fluorescent flow cytometry and photometry. The Cito CBC system utilizes the principle of fluorescent flow cytometry for cell count and cell classification. A laser is used as the light source, and fluorescence and light scattering signals are detected for the measurements. For fluorescent labeling, blood cells are treated with a fluorescent dye that has high affinity binding to nucleic acid. Additionally, the analyzer utilizes the principle of two-wavelength photometry for the measurement of the hemoglobin. Blood cells are lysed to release hemoglobin. Meanwhile, the light scattering signal measured from the flow cytometry and the light absorption signals measured from the photometry are both used to quantify the hematocrit and the mean cell volume.

The Cito CBC Cartridge contains all the reagents needed for performing the test, including:

A first reagent. It consists of a salt-based buffer solution to dilute a blood sample, which is used for downstream analysis and HGB/HCT testing.   
A second reagent. It consists of surfactants to lyse RBCs and release hemoglobin. It also contains a fluorescent dye to label the nucleic acids in the cells. This reagent mixes with a portion of the diluted blood to form a sample mixture for WBC, WBC Diff, and   
HGB/HCT testing.   
A third reagent. It consists of a salt-based buffer solution to further dilute the blood. It also contains a dye to label the nucleic acids in the cells. This reagent mixes with a portion of the diluted blood to form a sample mixture for RBC and PLT testing.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Cito CBC Analyzer

2. Specimen Identification: Barcode scanner or manual entry

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Venous whole blood is collected in vacutainer tube with $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulant as test specimen. The tube is inverted at least ten times to mix the sample before testing. A dispenser tip is inserted into the tube cap, and pressed against the inlet port of the test cartridge to dispense blood. The dispensed blood is drawn into the test cartridge by capillary force. Blood residue on the inlet port is wiped away with an alcohol pad, and the cartridge inlet seal is manually closed. The test cartridge is then inserted to the analyzer to complete the automatic measurement, and the result will be reported.

The Cito CBC System is factory calibrated. No user calibration is required.

5. Quality Control:

The system performance is evaluated using a commercial QC kit, Cito CBC Control. The QC materials are a tri-level (low, normal, high) whole blood control that contains human cells, mammalian cells and microspheres suspended in a plasma-like fluid with preservatives. The system guides users to test each level of the QC material in sequence, and determine automatically whether the QC test is passed or failed. If QC fails, the system software will deactivate the user access to perform a sample test. QC test is recommended: 1) when using the Cito CBC Analyzer for the first time; 2) with each new shipment of test kits; 2) when new operator to perform testing; 3) anytime an unexpected issue is encountered; 4) at least every 30 days.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

a) Repeatability with whole blood samples

Venous whole blood $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulated) was used to evaluate the precision of reported CBC parameters, including 5-part differential. Three CLIA-waived sites participated in this study, and each site used one analyzer and three untrained operators, totaling three analyzers and nine untrained operators overall. For the three sites, in total 45 blood samples were tested to cover the three sub-ranges (low, medium, high), including MDLs, for WBC,

RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT and MCV. Ten (10) consecutive tests were performed for each sample. The study calculates the SD (standard deviation) and $\% C V$ (coefficient of variation) for each reported parameter. The study results pool the SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ together across the three sites, following the protocol of CLSI document EP05-A3. The pooled SD and pooled $\% \mathrm { C V }$ meet the acceptance criteria for all reported parameters in the three sub-ranges (low, medium, high), as shown below.

# b) Cartridge lot-to-lot Precision

A study was performed to evaluate the lot-to-lot variability of the test cartridge. Three cartridge lots were used in the study, and venous whole blood $( \mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulated) was tested to assess the between-lot component. A total of 19 samples were tested in this study. For each sample, 5 replicate tests were performed for each cartridge lot (15 tests for three lots). ANOVA analysis was performed according to CLSI EP05-A3 to calculate the betweenlot $\% C V$ and total $\% C V$ , which meet the acceptance criteria, as shown below.

# c) Reproducibility

The reproducibility performance was evaluated by testing QC materials. Three CLIA-waived sites participated in this study, and each site used one analyzer and at least two untrained operators. At each site, the study was performed for 5 days. In each day, 2 test runs were performed with 3 replicates per run. One lot of the QC materials (three levels: low, normal, and high) was used and a total of 90 replicates were performed for each control level over the study duration (3 sites $\times 5$ days $_ { \cdot \times 2 }$ test runs $\mathbf { \nabla } \times 3$ replicates per run). ANOVA analysis was performed according to CLSI EP05-A3 to calculate the SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for within-run (repeatability), between-run, between-day, between-site, and total precision for each control level. The total $\% C V$ of all parameters met the acceptance criteria, as shown below.

2. Linearity:

The linearity interval of the WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, and HCT were evaluated using fresh whole blood (venous blood anticoagulated with $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } E D T A }$ ). A 9-concentration sample panel was tested for each parameter. Linear regression was performed for data analysis, and all parameters met the allowable deviation from linearity within $\pm 1 0 \%$ for the established ranges below.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

A study was conducted to determine the interference level for the following interfering substances: conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, intralipid, chyle, $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ , and hemolytic hemoglobin. The interference levels were evaluated by testing fresh whole blood (venous blood anticoagulated with $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA) spiked with the interferent at study concentration levels. For each interferent, blood samples were spiked with the interferent, and five replicate tests were performed with both control group (no spiking) and test group (with spiking) for comparison. A total of three blood samples were tested for each interferent. The non-significant $\%$ Interferences were defined as $\%$ Interferences within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . The results of the interference study demonstrated that:

o There was no significant conjugated bilirubin interference up to a concentration of 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.   
$\bigcirc$ There was no significant unconjugated bilirubin interference up to a concentration of $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.   
$\bigcirc$ There was no significant intralipid interference up to a concentration of $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for WBC, PLT, and HGB, and up to a concentration of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for RBC, HCT, and MCV. Samples with intralipid $> 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ are alerted by fail-alert mechanism and the impacted results (RBC, HCT, and MCV) are automatically suppressed.   
o There was no significant chyle interference up to a concentration of 2524 FTU for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.   
o There was no significant hemolytic hemoglobin interference up to a concentration of $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, and MCV; and up to a concentration of 0.5 $\mathrm { g / d L }$ for HCT. There was no significant K2EDTA interference up to a concentration of $8 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.

# 4. Reportable Range:

The measuring ranges for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT and MCV are determined from the Linearity and the LoQ study results. After establishing the measuring ranges, the reportable ranges are chosen to be equal to or narrower than the measuring ranges, by applying a set of suppression levels for CLIA waived setting. After applying the suppression levels to the measuring ranges, the reportable ranges (with suppression) are established. Refer to submission CW240006 for detailed reportable range values for each parameter of this device.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

a) Sample Stability

Sample stability of venous whole blood $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ anticoagulated) was determined with 6 normal samples and 4 abnormal samples. The blood samples were stored at room temperature $( 1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . At time zero (0 hour), the samples were tested in triplicates to establish the baseline. These samples were tested again in duplicate at the following time points: 4.5 hours, 6.5 hours, and 8.5 hours. For each time point, the results were compared to the baseline results, and the mean percentage difference was calculated to meet the predefined acceptance criteria. The results support an 8-hour blood sample stability duration.

# b) Cartridge Stability

A real-time stability study was conducted to establish shelf-life stability for the Cito CBC system cartridge when stored at the recommended storage conditions. Three lots of cartridges were tested. Each cartridge lot was stored at room temperature and tested at defined time points, and then evaluated using venous whole blood samples. Based on the results of this study, the Cito CBC cartridge shelf-life stability is 294 days at room temperature $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

# 6. Detection Limit:

Four venous whole blood samples were diluted with homologous plasma to make low-level samples and were used in this study to evaluate LoQ of WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, and HCT. One sample was tested on each day, and the LoQ study was conducted for four consecutive days. For each sample, 9 replicate tests were performed with each cartridge lot, and two cartridge lots were used to capture the reagent variability (in total 18 tests for each sample). For the four samples, a total of 72 tests were performed, with 36 tests for each cartridge lot. The LoQ was determined individually for two cartridge lots, and the greater LoQ between the two cartridge lots was taken as the LoQ for each parameter.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed across three CLIA-waived testing sites (with nine untrained operators in total) to evaluate the performance of the Cito CBC System compared to the comparative method, Sysmex XN Automated Hematology Analyzer. A total of 481 subjects were included in the study (117 enrolled at the CW sites and 346 residual clinical samples). Of the 481 subjects, there were 197 female $( 4 1 \% )$ and 284 male $( 5 9 \% )$ . One $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA venous whole blood sample was collected from each subject. Statistical analyses for the method comparison were performed based on correlation plots with Deming regression and difference plots for bias. For each reported parameter, the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient from the Deming fittings, are shown in the table below.

3. Flagging Study:

A flagging study was performed across five CLIA-waived testing sites and one point-of-care site to evaluate the flagging agreement between Cito CBC System and the comparative method, Sysmex XN Automated Hematology Analyzer. Five hundred five (505) subjects were included in the study (247 male and 258 female), which consists of 74 children ${ \geq } 2$ to $^ { < 1 2 }$ years old), 77 adolescents $( \ge 1 2$ to $< 2 1$ years old), and 354 adults $( \ge 2 1$ years old). One K2EDTA venous whole blood sample was collected from each subject. Additionally, 577 leftover samples ( $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA venous whole blood) were selected from a clinical lab and included in this study for increased coverage of abnormal samples. In total, 1082 samples were tested for the flagging comparison. Based on the reported flags, each sample was categorized as either Negative (no sample abnormalities) or Positive (with sample abnormalities). The positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement and overall agreement were calculated, and the results successfully met the acceptance criteria, as shown below.

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

A reference interval study was performed to determine the reference intervals of adults and pediatrics on the Cito CBC System. Healthy subjects were enrolled at four CLIA-waived sites for the study, including 253 adults over 21 years old (127 male, 126 female), 46 adolescents between 12–21 years old (21 male, 25 female), and 41 children between 2–12 years old (20 male, 21 female). One K2EDTA venous whole blood sample was collected from each subject and tested. For the adult group (over 21 years old), reference intervals are established by nonparametric method following CLSI EP28-A3c. For the adolescent group (12–21 years old) and the children group (2–12 years old), the reference intervals published in Pediatric Reference Intervals, AACC Press, Soldin, Brugnara and Wong, 8th edition 2021, were verified on the Cito CBC System.
