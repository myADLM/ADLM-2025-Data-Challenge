# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The HemoScreen is a point-of-care (POC), automated hematology analyzer that provides results for complete blood count (CBC) parameters and a 5-part leukocyte differential, in capillary and venous whole blood samples. The HemoScreen system is a tabletop device and is comprised of the following components: HemoScreen reader (analyzer plus software), cartridge with preloaded reagents, blood collection sampler, on-board internal quality control, and external liquid quality controls.

The cartridge module comprises reagent compartments, a microfluidic chip and a translucent measurement portion. The reagents in the cartridge enable viscoelastic focusing, lysis of RBC, and WBC staining. In addition to the cartridge, the system includes a disposable sampler, which is used to collect the blood sample and then transfer it to the cartridge.

The HemoScreen provides the following blood count parameters: red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular (erythrocyte) volume (MCV), mean cell (erythrocyte) hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell (erythrocyte) hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelets volume (MPV), neutrophils (NEUT; $\# / \%$ ), monocytes (MONO; $\# / \%$ ), lymphocytes (LYMP; $\# / \%$ ), eosinophils (EO; #/%) and basophiles (BASO; $\# / \%$ ). Of these, RBC, WBC, PLT, MCH, MCV, RDW, MPV, NEUT%, $M O N O \%$ , $\mathrm { L Y M P \% }$ , $\mathrm { E O \% }$ , and $B A S O \%$ are quantitated by direct measurement, and HCT, HGB, MCHC, NEUT#, MONO#, LYMPH#, EO#, and BASO# are calculated from the direct measurements.

# B Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: HemoScreen Hematology Analyzer 2. Specimen Identification:

Specimen identification is performed by manual keyboard entry or use of a barcode reader.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

HemoScreen can be used with either capillary or venous anticoagulated whole blood, collected in K2EDTA. Capillary blood sampling is performed by routine fingertip puncture using a standard lancet. The blood is collected in an K2EDTA microtube (indirect sampling) which is then taken into Sampler or directly from fingertip drawn into Sampler (direct sampling). Venous blood, thoroughly mixed and at room temperature, can be used as well.

4. Calibration:

Factory calibration. The calibration of HemoScreen is traceable to the reference methods described in CLSI H26-A2.

5. Quality Control:

The HemoScreen system includes both on-board internal and external quality controls. Internal quality control includes built-in self-tests, whereby the software verifies performance of the optics, reagent mixing, and instrument pneumatics. Every time the analyzer is turned on, and before each measurement, it automatically verifies conformance to the measurement specifications. Furthermore, internal self-testing occurs after the cartridge has been inserted, thus validating the integrity of the disposable unit. The intensity and spectrum of all illumination sources are tested using corresponding sensors, and the optical properties of each cartridge are inspected automatically prior to each test.

Liquid Quality Controls (PIX-CBC): PIX-CBC Hematology Controls, 3-level commercial liquid quality controls are used to cover all HemoScreen parameters. CBC-PIX is a reagent composed of human erythrocytes and mammalian leukocytes and platelets suspended in a plasma-like fluid with preservatives. PIX-CBC whole blood controls (Cat No. PIX002) are produced by R&D Systems, a Bio-Techne brand, Minneapolis, MN.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: Please refer to K222148 and K180020.

2. Linearity:

The study was performed based on the recommendations of CLSI EP06, $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Edition. Linearity was defined for WBC and PLT by using serial dilutions prepared from the commercial linearity controls (PIX-LINE). Samples with ten levels were measured in seven replicates on a single HemoScreen analyzer. Results were examined for outliers and other potential problematic values. Linearity analysis was based on expected values at each sample level. WBC and PLT parameters were confirmed to be linear across all tested points across the measuring ranges. The new ranges are presented in the table below.

4. Accuracy (Instrument):

A method comparison study was conducted at one site to assess the performance of the HemoScreen compared to Sysmex XN-Series (XN-10, XN-20) Automated Hematology Analyzers (K112605) with the extended PLT and WBC ranges. A total of 232 residual whole blood venous samples that span the HemoScreen extended linear ranges and medical decision points were selected. The data were evaluated by Passing-Bablok regression and Pearson’s correlation for all 20 parameters. For the regression analysis, the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) and predicted bias/difference for each parameter were determined and the summarized data are provided below. All results were within the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

Limits of Detection, Blank, and Quantitation (LoD, LoB, and LoQ)

Five residual normal venous blood samples (from both morphological and cell distribution aspects) were centrifuged to deplete the plasma supernatant of RBCs, WBCs and PLTs. Each of the five plasma samples was assayed six times on two HemoScreen devices for a total of 60 measurements per parameter, using three cartridge and sampler lots. The limit of blank was determined by the 95th percentile of the distribution of the study variable.

To determine the LoD and LoQ for WBC and PLT, five low level samples were derived from native whole blood. Each of the five plasma samples was assayed six times on two HemoScreen devices for a total of 60 measurements per parameter, using three cartridge and sampler lots. The results for WBC and PLT were collected and used further for statistical analysis. The LoDs and LoQs were calculated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 using the parametric option.
