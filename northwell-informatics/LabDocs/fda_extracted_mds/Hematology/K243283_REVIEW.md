# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Alinity h-series System is a multimodule system that consists of different combinations of one or more of the following modules: a quantitative multi-parameter automated hematology analyzer (Alinity hq) and an automated slide maker stainer (Alinity hs).

The Alinity hq is a quantitative, multi-parameter, automated hematology analyzer designed for in vitro diagnostic use in counting and characterizing blood cells using a multi-angle polarized

scattered separation (MAPSS) method to detect and count red blood cells (RBC), platelets (PLT), and white blood cells (WBC), and to perform WBC differentials (DIFF) in whole blood.

There is also an option to choose whether to detect reticulocytes at the same time. The options of the selections are:

CBC $^ { + }$ DIFF: Complete blood count with differential CBC $+$ DIFF $+$ RETIC: Complete blood count with differential and reticulocyte

The Alinity h‑series of instruments has a scalable design to provide full integration of multiple automated hematology analyzers that can include the integration of an automated blood film preparation and staining module, all of which are controlled by one user interface. The modules are designed to fit together. Each module has an internal conveyor that enables racks of specimen tubes to be transported between modules. The system can move racks between modules to perform different tests on a given specimen (e.g., make slide smears on the Alinity hs).

An Alinity h-series system can be configured as follows:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \dot { \mathrm { ~ C o n f i g u r a t i o n ~ 1 : ~ 1 ~ ( A l i n i t y ~ h q ) } } \dot { + } 0 \left( \mathrm { A l i n i t y ~ h s } \right) = 1 + 0 } \\ { \mathrm { ~ C o n f i g u r a t i o n 2 : ~ 1 ~ ( A l i n i t y ~ h q ) } + 1 \ ( \mathrm { A l i n i t y ~ h s } ) = 1 + 1 } \\ { \mathrm { ~ C o n f i g u r a t i o n } 3 : 2 \ ( \mathrm { A l i n i t y ~ h q } ) + 0 \ ( \mathrm { A l i n i t y ~ h s } ) = 2 + 0 } \\ { \mathrm { ~ C o n f i g u r a t i o n } 4 : 2 \ ( \mathrm { A l i n i t y ~ h q } ) + 1 \ ( \mathrm { A l i n i t y ~ h s } ) = 2 + 1 } \end{array}
$$

The Laboratory Automation System (LAS) is an optional automated track system that connects to the Alinity h-series through an interface module. The LAS, also known as the Total Lab Automation (cleared under K121012) is a third-party system used by high-volume laboratories to manage specimen tubes. It is an externally-manufactured system designed to interface with the Alinity h-series system.

The following configurations are configurable with the Laboratory Automation System (LAS) module:

Configura $\begin{array} { r } { \mathrm { t i o n ~ 1 : ~ 1 ~ ( A l i n i t y ~ h q ) } + 0 ~ \mathrm { ( A l i n i t y ~ h s ) } = 1 + 0 } \\ { \mathrm { t i o n ~ 4 : ~ 2 ~ ( A l i n i t y ~ h q ) } + 1 ~ \mathrm { ( A l i n i t y ~ h s ) } = 2 + 1 } \end{array}$ • Configura

The LAS system consists of a command center (coordinates what tests need to run on which instrument for a sample), track (transports specimen tubes from one instrument to another as needed), and an interface module (IM).

# B Principle of Operation:

The Alinity hq module uses optical and fluorescence flow cytometry, hydrodynamic focusing, and absorption spectrophotometry technologies to measure, count, and calculate hematological parameters in samples.

Optical and fluorescence flow cytometry is a process used to count and measure the properties of cells or particles as they are carried by fluid through a sensing zone. The physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles are measured via light scatter, polarization, and/or fluorescence response from a laser. • The Alinity hq uses hydrodynamic focusing to align cells into a single-file passage through the sensing zone. A cell-free liquid sheath surrounds the diluted sample and

moves with it in a laminar flow. The laminar flow prevents any mixing between the liquid sheath and the diluted sample.

Absorption spectrophotometry is based on the linear relationship between the amount of light that a well-mixed, nonflowing sample absorbs at a particular absorption band and the concentration of an absorbing entity in the sample (Beer's Law). To perform absorption spectrophotometry, the system uses the hemoglobin dilution as the sample and a hemoglobin complex as the light-absorbing entity.

Flow cytometry technologies are used to analyze whole blood samples for WBC, RBC, NRBC, RETIC, and PLT. Absorption spectrophotometry is used to measure the HGB concentration.

The Alinity hs module creates and stains smears from whole blood samples in addition to staining externally prepared smears for morphologic review. The operator selects and may configure staining protocols as needed by the laboratory. The Alinity hs module is configured with the May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain or the Wright-Giemsa stain.

# Modification

The Alinity h-series System software algorithm (Software Version 5.8) was modified to reduce overestimation of basophil counts due to potential misclassification of lymphocytes to basophils that may occur for some whole blood samples (hereafter, referred to as “affected samples”) tested on the Alinity hq of the Alinity h-series System (K220031). This modification reduces falsely increased basophil measurements (i.e., BASO and $\%$ BASO) and the potential of incorrect results for these affected samples. The modification only impacts how the algorithm evaluates whole blood samples and does not affect how quality control (QC) materials are evaluated. The modification does not impact other modules or interfaces of the Alinity h-series System.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

Alinity h-series System

2. Specimen Identification:

The system supports the use of a bar-coded Sample Identification (SID) on a specimen tube to provide specimen identification. Specimens are also identified alphanumerically by rack and tube position number. A bar code reader on the sample handler robot reads the rack ID bar code to identify the rack number. The rack ID bar code also provides information to identify the tube position on the rack.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Two methods are used to introduce a specimen to the Alinity hq module. These are closedtube processing and open-tube processing.

In the closed-tube processing mode, capped specimen tubes are introduced to the Alinity hq module from 10-tube closed-tube racks that are inserted in the loading area. The module automatically mixes the specimens and moves the tubes to the aspiration position.

In the open-tube processing mode, the operator pre-mixes a specimen tube and removes the cap. The tube is placed in an open-tube sample rack and is inserted in the loading area. The sample handler robot within the Alinity hq module moves the opentube rack that contains the specimen to the open-tube sampling position.

4. Calibration:

Calibration is performed using materials with assigned values that are traceable to standard reference methods. It is recommended that the laboratory calibrate using Alinity h‑series HemCal, which is a commercial whole blood calibrator.

5. Quality Control:

The Alinity h‑series requires a commercial whole blood control (Alinity h-series Control 29P) and patient controls to monitor system performance.

# A Analytical Performance:

In this 510(k) submission, raw signal data files from 510(k) submission K220031 were analyzed using the modified algorithm for the subject device.

1. Precision:

a) 20-Day Within-Laboratory Precision Please refer to K220031. b) Repeatability (Normal samples):

Samples were collected from 20 healthy donors in K2EDTA and tested using both CBC+Diff and CBC+Diff+Retic test selections. Three Alinity h-series system instruments of $1 + 0$ configuration and two Alinity h-series system instruments of $2 { + } 1$ configurations were used. Four (4) samples were tested on each of the three (3) instruments in the $1 + 0$ configuration and two (2) samples on each of the two instruments in the $2 { + } 1$ configuration using both CBC+Diff and CBC $\cdot +$ Diff+Retic test selections. Each sample was tested in one (1) run with at least 32 replicates using 1 reagent lot and 1 control lot. The mean value, SD, $\% \mathrm { C V }$ , minimum and maximum values, and the twosided $9 5 \%$ Confidence Intervals (CI) around the SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated for each measurand and test selection (CBC+Diff and CBC+Diff+Retic). The maximum $\% \mathrm { C V }$ or SD values across donors by range was reported. The SD or $\% \mathrm { C V }$ point estimates were evaluated against the evaluation criteria.

The maximum $\mathrm { S D / \% C V }$ reflects the worst or largest imprecision across all the samples for each measurand tested for short-term imprecision with whole blood. If the maximum SD or $\% \mathrm { C V }$ meets the acceptance criteria for a given measurand, then all the samples tested for short-term imprecision had $\mathrm { S D s } / \% \mathrm { C V s }$ that also meet the acceptance criteria for that measurand. All samples were evaluated against all applicable acceptance criteria and met all acceptance criteria requirements.

# B Comparison Studies:

A method comparison study was conducted to assess the performance of the Alinity hq with software version 5.8 compared to the predicate device, Sysmex XN-10 (K112605). A total of 2,194 unique venous and/or capillary specimens collected in K2EDTA from pediatric $( \leq 2 1$ years) and adult subjects including a wide variety of disease states (clinical conditions) were tested across 7 clinical sites.

Venous and/or capillary whole blood leftover specimens were collected in K2EDTA tubes from a wide range of demographics (age and sex) and disease states (clinical conditions). In total, there were 1,528 specimens collected from subjects with one or more medical conditions while there were 244 specimens without any medical conditions. Study sites aimed to cover the target assay reportable range for the measurands. A maximum of $10 \%$ samples per measurand were permitted to be contrived to cover the entire target assay reportable range.

Each specimen was tested within 8 hours from the time of collection in one replicate using either the Closed or Open tube processing mode in the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection on the Alinity h-series System and one replicate on the Sysmex XN-10 System. Specimens were tested on the Alinity hq and the Sysmex XN-10 within 2 hours of each other. At five of the seven sites, the Alinity hq configuration was $1 + 0$ (five stand-alone Alinity hq analyzers), at one site the configuration was $2 { + } 1$ (2 Alinity hq modules that are configured as part of the Alinity h-series System), and at one site both $1 + 0$ and $2 { + } 1$ configurations were tested.

Alinity hq testing was performed using a minimum of 1 reagent lot, 1 control lot at each site and a minimum of 1 lot of the Alinity h-series HemCal commercial calibrator. The Sysmex XN-10/20 was calibrated using its recommended commercial calibrators at each site. A Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed but Deming regression analysis was used in place of Passing-Bablok analysis where there are very low numeric values. All results were within the predefined acceptance criteria and found to be acceptable.

# C Clinical Studies:

1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

Sensitivity and specificity performance with the Alinity h-series System were assessed for accuracy of identifying distributional abnormalities and morphological flags (PLT Clumps, RBC Fragments) by comparing to a 400-cell differential derived from two independent 200- cell microscopic reviews of a blood smear (reference method) from negative (normal) and positive (abnormal) specimens. A subset of 674 venous and capillary specimens collected in K2EDTA for the method comparison study were included in this study. Testing was

performed at six clinical sites. One (1) replicate of each specimen was analyzed using the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection in the Open or Closed tube processing mode on the Alinity hq. Three blood films were prepared for each sample.

The final WBC differential and WBC, RBC, and PLT morphology results were based on the 400-cell WBC differential counts derived from the average of 2 concurring 200-cell differential counts and concordant RBC and PLT morphology results with the exception of PLT clumps.

Sensitivity and specificity analysis were performed to compare the Alinity hq morphological flags, WBC 6-part differential, and NR/W against the results from microscopy analysis. Agreement between 2 readers was determined for %BASO, $\% \mathrm { E O S }$ , $\% \mathrm { M O N O }$ , $\%$ NEU, %LYM, $\% \mathrm { I G }$ , and NR/W for the assessment of distributional abnormalities, as well as for blasts, variant lymphocytes, band neutrophils, RBC fragments, and PLT clumps for the assessment of morphological abnormalities.

Results from all specimens tested in this study were evaluated against the respective reference ranges for each differential cell type. Results within the lower and upper limits of the reference ranges were considered normal (negative). Results not within the lower and upper limits of the respective reference ranges for Microscopy or Alinity hq were considered abnormal (positive). Specimens were classified as morphologically abnormal (morphological positive) based on predefined criteria for blast, left shift, variant lymphocytes, PLT clumps, RBC fragments/schistocytes. Distributional classification and morphological flagging were categorized as True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and True Negative (TN) per the following contingency table based on agreement between Alinity hq and Microscopic results.
