# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The microINR System is comprised of a portable measuring device (microINR Expert Meter) and test strips (microINR Chips) in which the capillary blood sample flows through capillary action. The microINR Chip contains a reagent in dried form which consists of thromboplastin, and contains two symmetrical regions, the measuring channel and a control channel. The microINR Expert Meter measures INR based on a prothrombin time (PT) assay carried out in the microINR Chip based on microfluidic technology with machine vision detection.

The microINR System has a multi-level on-board quality control. The microINR Control contains lyophilized human citrated plasma from healthy donors modified by means of a process to simulate an abnormal coagulation sample and a calcium chloride solution. The lyophilized plasma must be reconstituted with the calcium chloride solution before use.

The changes to the microINR Expert Meter include the incorporation of optional functions such as connectivity functions (Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity on top of the Bluetooth connectivity of the microINR Link), as well as other configurable settings (such as the option of including operator and patient identification), a touchscreen, a barcode scanner, a new QC (quality control)

mode. The modifications have no impact on fundamental scientific technology and its performance.

# B Principle of Operation:

The microINR System is a handheld in vitro diagnostic medical device that uses microfluidic technology with machine vision detection to measure the prothrombin time from a fresh capillary (fingerstick) whole blood sample. The fresh capillary (fingerstick) whole blood sample is applied to the microINR Chip (test strip) for testing. The microINR Chip is inserted into the analyzer. Inside the test strip, the applied blood sample is separated into two channels and mixed with the reagents contained in each micro-reactor. The coagulation cascade is triggered instantly after mixing with the reagents (start time of the Prothrombin Time assay). When the blood coagulates its viscosity increases due to fibrin clot formation, which generates a sharp change in blood flow behavior. The Prothrombin Time measures how long it takes to form the fibrin clot after tissue thromboplastin has been added to the sample. The microINR Meter measures the International Normalized Ratio (INR) based on the Prothrombin Time (PT) assay carried out in the microINR Chip and displays the International Normalized Ratio (INR) on the screen.

Usability study

A usability study was conducted to demonstrate that the new functionalities of the microINR Expert System can be used safely and effectively by potential intended users after reading the labeling. Fifteen participants were enrolled in the study and performed the tasks after reading the labeling. All participants were able to successfully perform all the tasks (conduct a test, administrator identification, change meter settings and data consulting). The participants also participated in a questionnaire to survey the usability of the microINR System. On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is least favorable and 5 is most favorable, the mean score was 4.81, indicating that microINR Expert Meter system was easy to use.

Additional testing on the modified device was conducted as follows: software verification and validation; testing for radiofrequency, electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety; cybersecurity analysis and testing. All testing results met the pre-determined acceptance criteria. Based on the testing, the microINR System including the microINR

Expert Meter performs as intended, with no new questions of safety or effectiveness identified during testing.

The risk analysis of the implemented changes concluded that the microINR System including the microINR Expert Meter has no significant detectable risks compared to the predicate device and all residual risks have been deemed acceptable.
