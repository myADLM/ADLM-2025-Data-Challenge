Dear Sruti Krishna:

We have reviewed your section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Additional information about changes that may require a new premarket notification are provided in the FDA guidance documents entitled "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99812/download) and "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99785/download).

# 1. Device Description

Xpert FII & FV is an automated genotyping test for detecting Factor II and Factor V normal and mutant alleles directly from sodium citrate or EDTA anticoagulated whole blood specimens. Blood specimens are drawn into either sodium citrate or EDTA anticoagulant tubes. Following brief mixing of the sample, $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the blood sample is transferred to the bottom wall of the Sample opening of the Xpert FII & FV test cartridge. The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System.

The Xpert FII & FV test includes reagents for the detection of Factor II and Factor V normal and mutant alleles. The primers and probes in the Xpert FII & FV test determine the genotype of the Factor II gene (at position 20210) and/or the Factor V gene (at position 1691). The test includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) to confirm adequate processing and to monitor the presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems family is comprised of GeneXpert Dx System, GeneXpert Infinity System, and GeneXpert System with Touchscreen. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate and integrate sample processing, nucleic acid amplification and detection of the target sequences in simple or complex samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The systems consist of an instrument, computer or touchscreen, and preloaded software for running the tests and viewing the results. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems require the use of singleuse disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems have 1 to 80 modules (depending upon the instrument) that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.

The Xpert FII & FV test performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems provides results in approximately 30 minutes.

# 2. Device Intended Use

The Xpert® FII & FV test is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic genotyping test for the detection of Factor II and Factor V alleles from sodium citrate or EDTA anticoagulated whole blood. The test is performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems. This test is intended to provide results for Factor II (G20210A) and Factor V Leiden (G1691A) mutations as an aid in the diagnosis in individuals with suspected thrombophilia.

# 3. Technical Characteristics

The Xpert FII & FV test has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device.

# 4. Substantial Equivalence

The purpose of this Special 510(k) submission is to support the removal of the following erroneous limitation statement from the Instructions for Use of an on-market device (Xpert FII & FV): “The performance of the Xpert Factor II & Factor V test has not been evaluated with samples from pediatric patients.” Two additional modifications to the test are: (i) an update from “Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems” to “GeneXpert® Instrument Systems” in the Intended Use Statement, from a branding simplification perspective, and (ii) the creation of a new catalog number (GXFIIFV-US-10) for the modified device that is the subject of this Special 510(k) submission.

The following tables shows the similartities and differences between the Xpert FII& FV test and the predicate device. The differences between Xpert FII & FV and the predicate device do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.

# 5. Summary of Performance Data

No new performance data were provided in this submission. Removal of the erroneous limitation statement – which states that the performance of the test has not been evaluated with samples from pediatric patients - from the Instructions for Use is supported by clinical validation data that was submitted and reviewed as part of the original device clearance (K082118). The change from “Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems” to “GeneXpert® Instrument Systems” in the intended use statement, and from GXFIIFV-10 to GXFIIFV-US-10 for the catalog number, have no impact on device performance, safety or effectiveness.

# 6. Conclusion

The intended use of the modified Xpert FII & FV test and the legally marketed predicate device (Xpert FII & FV; K223046) are identical other than a minor update from a branding simplification perspective. The technological characteristics of the modified Xpert FII & FV test are identical to those of the predicate device. The performance of the modified Xpert FII & FV test is acceptable for its intended use and substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
