# Intended Use

The CardioMPO Test is an enzyme immunoassay intended for the quantitative determination of myeloperoxidase in human plasma, to be used in conjunction with clinical history, ECG and cardiac biomarkers to evaluate patients presenting with chest pain that are at risk for major adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, need for revascularization, or death.

# Device Description

The CardioMPO Test is a sandwich enzyme immunoassay that uses two highly specific antibodies, one monoclonal and one polyclonal, and an enzyme labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody for the measurement of MPO concentration in human plasma. The CardioMPO Test is comprised of the CardioMPO Reagent Kit, the CardioMPO Calibrator Kit, and the CardioMPO Control Kit.

The CardioMPO Reagent Kit contains the following: a microtiter plate coated with a monocional anti-MPO antibody; a solution of primary polyclonal rabbit anti-MPO antibody; a solution of secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase solution; TMB substrate solution; Stop Solution; Wash Buffer Concentrate; Assay Buffer; and plate sealers.

The CardioMPO Calibrator Kit contains six Calibrators comprised of human MPO in a phosphatebuffered matrix containing proteins, detergents, and stabilizers. Calibrators are intended to establish a calibration curve that is used to determine MPO concentration. Calibrator values are provided on individual Calibrator labels. Calibrators are provided ready-to-use.

The CardioMPO Control Kit contains three Controls comprised of human MPO in a human plasma matrix. Controls are intended to monitor and evaluate the precision and accuracy of the CardioMPO Test. Ranges are provided on individual Control labels. Controls are treated in the same manner as patient samples.

Calibrators are added directly to the appropriate wells of the Microtiter Plate. Assay Buffer is added to all wells that are intended for Control or sample analysis.Aliquots of Controls or samples are added to the appropriate wells and the plate is incubated for 60 minutes at $2 0 - 2 6 ^ { \circ } C$ .The wells are then washed with Wash Buffer to remove antigens not specifically bound to the immobilized antibody.

A yellow primary polyclonal rabbit anti-MPO antibody is added to each well and incubated for 60 minutes at $2 0 - 2 6 ^ { \circ } C$ This antibody binds to the MPO captured on the plate. The plate is again washed with Wash Buffer to remove unbound primary antibody.

A blue secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, labeled with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP), is then added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $2 0 { - } 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ This antibody binds to the primary antibody, and the MPO in the sample is "sandwiched" between the monoclonal antibody on the solid phase and a complex of the rabbit anti-MPO and the HRP-goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The wells are washed with Wash Buffer to remove unbound HRP-labeled antibody.

The substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), is then added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes at $2 0 { - } 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ resulting in the development of a blue color. Color development is stopped with the addition of Stop Solution, changing the color to yellow.

The enzymatic turnover of the substrate is determined spectrophotometrically at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ , preferably with correction at 630 nm, and is directly proportional to the concentration of MPO. The absorbances of the Calibrators are used to plot a standard curve of absorbance versus MPO concentration from which the MPO concentration in the Controls or samples can be determined.

# Performance Characteristics

# Sensitivity

The minimum detection limit, as calculated by interpolation of the mean plus two standard deviations of 24 replicates of the 0 pM MPO Calibrator (F), is 13 pM MPO.

# Assay Precision

Total and within-run precision were determined by testing four Matrix Controls, containing human MPO in Calibrator matrix, and five Plasma Controls, containing human MPO in human lithium heparin plasma, with MPO concentrations distributed throughout the calibration range of the assay, according to NCCLS guidelines EP5-A. The nine samples were assayed in duplicate, using a single lot of reagents and Calibrators, on two separate plates per day, for twenty days. A new calibration curve was run in duplicate on each plate. Total precision in plasma samples was $8 . 2 \%$ and within-run precision was $5 . 5 \%$ .

# Linearity

Lithium heparin plasma samples spiked to high MPO levels were intermixed with neat plasma samples with low MPO levels to create nine MPO concentrations across and exceeding the anticipated linear range. Linearity of the MPO levels measured in the mixtures was assessed using the polynomial evaluation of linearity as recommended in NCCLS guidelines EP6-A. The CardioMPO Test was linear from 13 pM to 5223 pM MPO, within 60 pM or $9 \%$ in this interval.

# Interfering Substances

The following substances, when tested in plasma containing 3000 pM and 1000 pM MPO, according to NCCLS guidelines EP7-A, were found not to interfere up to the concentrations indicated. Bias of $10 \%$ or less was not considered interference.

High level of interfering substance per NCCLS EP7-A Hemoglobin levels of $5 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ produced a bias of $> 1 0 \%$ . A doseresponse series showed a bias of $< 1 0 \%$ at $< 1 5 0 0 \ m g / L$ hemoglobin within a $9 5 \%$ prediction interval.

# Interfering Antibodies

Twenty-one plasma samples known to have elevated levels of heterophilic or other potentially interfering antibodies, such as HAMA, RF, anti-MPO p-ANCA, etc., were analyzed for interference in the CardioMPO Test. The mean recovery of MPO from samples containing heterophilic antibodies was $108 \%$ with individual recoveries ranging from 89 to $1 1 8 \%$ . Therefore, no evidence of significant interference was observed due to the heterophilic antibodies tested in the CardioMPO Test.

# Cross-reactivity

The following potential cross-reactants, tested in both a plasma pool containing MPO and Assay Buffer according to NCCLS guidelines EP7-A, showed no significant cross-reaction in the assay up to the concentrations indicated.

# Spiking recovery

Fourteen lithium heparin plasma samples were spiked with 509.9, 1016, and 1500 pM MPO and analyzed for recovery. The percent recovery was calculated by dividing the mean measured MPO concentration of the spiked sample by the expected MPO concentration, where the expected MPO concentration was the sum of the measured MPO concentration in the neat plasma sample and the concentration of the MPO spike. The overall recovery of spiked MPO ranged from $89 \%$ to $105 \%$ with a mean of $9 7 \%$ .

# Dilution recovery

Thirteen lithium heparin plasma samples were spiked with 1500 pM MPO and diluted 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16 with Assay Buffer. The percent recovery was calculated by dividing the mean MPO concentration of the pre-diluted sample multiplied by the dilution factor by the mean MPO concentration of the sample with no pre-dilution. The mean recovery of a 1:2 dilution was $1 1 6 \%$ , with recoveries ranging from $102 \%$ to $131 \%$ . The mean recovery at dilutions of 1:4 through 1:16 rose from $132 \%$ to $145 \%$ due to decreased plasma matrix effects. The PrognostiX CardioMPO Test is formulated to account for matrix effects associated with a 5 µL human plasma sample. PrognostiX does not recommend further dilution of samples. Samples with MPO levels exceeding the value of the highest Calibrator should be reported as greater than that level, e.g. $> 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p M }$ .

# Hook Effect

There is no evidence of hook effect in the CardioMPO Test up to 800,000 pM MPO, roughly 150 times greater than the upper end of the reportable range and 500 times greater than the median level of patients in the clinical study.

# Reference Interval

Plasma samples from a population of apparently healthy blood donors, were evaluated with the CardioMPO Test. A two-stage outlier detection scheme, a Box-Cox transformation followed by a robust outlier detection method, was used to eliminate six outliers. Since there was no significant difference in MPO levels between males $( n = 1 4 5 )$ and females $( n = 1 4 9 )$ after adjustment for outliers, the reference range was estimated from the adjusted normal subject population.

The median MPO level for subjects in the adjusted normal subject population was 193 pM and the range of results was 48 to $9 2 4 ~ \mathsf { p } \mathsf { M }$ The non-parametric distribution of myeloperoxidase levels in this normal population yields a two-tailed central $9 5 \%$ reference interval, corrected for the influence of outlier rejection, of $7 8 - 7 0 8 \ \mathsf { p M }$ However, in this application the more appropriate single-tailed lower $9 5 \%$ reference interval, again corrected for the influence of the outlier rejection method, is $< 5 3 9 ~ \mathsf { p M }$ .

# Summary of Clinical Study

To determine the efficacy of the PrognostiX CardioMPO Test as a predictor of risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE), MPO levels were measured in 560 banked plasma samples from a prior study of patients presenting to the Emergency Department within 24 hours of the onset of chest pain (Brennan, et al, N Engl J Med 2003; 349:1595-1604). Patients were followed for the development of myocardial infarction, need for revascularization, or death over the next 30-day and 6 month interval. Samples assayed with the PrognostiX CardioMPO Kits were from patients aged 23 to 96 years. Median age was 64. The incidence of MACE was assessed by follow up phone calls at 30 days and 6 months.

Multivariate logistic-regression models (SAS version 8.0, SAS Institute) were developed to calculate odds ratios and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals. The adjusted covariates were age, gender, race, Troponin T $S = 0 . 0 3 \ n g / m L$ VS. $> 0 . 0 3$ ng/mL) (McErlean et al. Am J Cardiol 2000;85:421-426), C-reactive Protein $( < 1 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ , $1 - 3 \bmod { L }$ . ${ \tt > } 3 \ m g / L ,$ (Brennan et al, N Engl J Med 2003;349:17,1595- 1604), CK-MB $( \leq 8 . 8 \ n g / \mathrm { m L }$ vS. $> 8 . 8 \ n g / m L )$ (McErlean et al. Am J Cardiol 2000;85:421-426), history of smoking, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, and history of high cholesterol. Missing covariate information on some subjects reduced the study population. The risk of MACE in all patients in the ensuing 30-day period increased with increasing quartiles of myeloperoxidase levels. Adjusted odds ratios and the percentage of patients within an MPO quartile with and without MACE at 30 days are shown in the following graph and table.

It should be noted that different cut-off points may be appropriate for different clinical populations.

# Conclusions

The PrognostiX CardioMPO Test is acceptably precise, inear, accurate, and is not subject to appreciable cross-reactivity or interference. The detection limit of 13 pM is acceptable for the intended use of this test.The test is reproducible across several reagent lots, several instruments and multiple operators and should provide reliable and reproducible results when used by professional clinical laboratories.

The clinical evaluation of the CardioMPO Test involved re-analysis of 560 banked lithium heparin plasma samples from an earlier study of patients with chest pain. The results of this study demonstrate that plasma levels of MPO are associated with risk of myocardial infarction, revascularization, and death. The performance testing and clinical data support the safety and effectiveness of the CardioMPO Test as an aid in evaluating patients presenting with chest pain that are at risk for major adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, need for revascularization, or death.
