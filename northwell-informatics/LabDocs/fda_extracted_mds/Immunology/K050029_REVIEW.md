1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was conducted based on NCCLS EP5-A. Four matrix controls and five plasma controls were run in duplicates, twice a day for 20 days $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ). Matrix controls were comprised of human MPO derived from cell culture in a phosphate-buffered matrix. Plasma controls were comprised of human MPO derived from cell culture in human lithium heparin plasma. For matrix control 1 and 3 and plasma control 1, $\Nu { = } 7 6$ (19 days) due to outliers caused by pipetting errors and control concentrations. The results are summarized below.

The average total $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for the matrix controls and plasma controls were $7 . 8 \%$ and $8 . 2 \%$ respectively. The average within-run $\%$ CV for the matrix controls and plasma controls were $6 . 1 \%$ and $5 . 5 \%$ respectively.

Precision was conducted to determine the variability of the Prognostic CardioMPO Test using different lots of the reagent kit. Three lots of the CardioMPO reagent kits were analyzed with nine patient samples, four matrix controls and five plasma controls. Between-lot variability was analyzed by comparing the mean MPO concentration of each sample measured using one reagent kit lot against the overall MPO concentration of each sample across all three reagent kit lots using Passing and Bablok regression. The linear equations for the three lots were $\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 0 2 3 \mathrm { X } { - } 5 0 . 1 7 1$ , $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 9 7 1 \mathrm { X } + 2 2 . 7 5 9$ and $\mathrm { Y = 1 } . 0 2 4 9 \mathrm { X } + 1 4 . 1 6 8$ respectively. The sponsor concludes that no significant difference in MPO measurement related to different CardioMPO reagent kit lots.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was conducted according to NCCLS EP6-A. Five high MPO plasma samples were prepared by spiking 5 plasma samples to reach a MPO concentration above the expected linear range. Four low MPO plasma samples were created by mixing the previously prepared high MPO samples with neat plasma samples. Five test samples were analyzed in triplicates with Prognostix CardioMPO reagent kit. Linearity was assessed using the polynomial evaluation of linearity, whereas the high and low level concentrations at which all three non-linear coefficients were found not to be significant (within a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval) were considered the linear range for that sample. A linear regression was completed and the percent difference between the apparent MPO concentration at each test level and the MPO concentration predicted from the linear regression was calculated. The five sample results were compiled and the greatest MPO concentration that remained within the linear range was $5 2 2 3 \mathrm { p M }$ and the lowest was $1 0 \mathrm { \ p M }$ . Please see the chart below.

The linear equations for the 5 samples were

Sample 1 Y= 665.03X-398.18,

Sample 2 Y= 997.9X-520.36,

Sample 3 Y=592.11X-234.3,

Sample 4 Y=631.73X-522.84 and

Sample 5 Y=566.15X-515.08.

The sponsor states that samples at the low end of the linear range were somewhat imprecise when compared to the rest of the range and that the imprecision was within $6 0 \ \mathsf { p M }$ . The sponsor also stated that $6 0 \ \mathsf { p M }$ is not clinically relevant at low MPO concentrations. The remaining samples revealed less than $9 \%$ deviation from the linear regression result. The CardioMPO test is linear from 13 to $5 2 2 3 \mathrm { p M }$ MPO, within $6 0 \mathrm { \ p M }$ or $9 \%$ in this interval.

The hook effect was studied to determine if plasma samples containing excessively high levels of MPO can cause a hook in the absorbance that would result in reportable MPO reading when no absorbance reading should be available. Purified MPO was diluted in calibrator matrix concentrations up to $8 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ MPO, which is approximately 150 times greater that the upper end of the reportable range and 500 times greater that the median levels of patients in the clinical study. All the samples were reported as having concentrations greater than the reportable range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The CardioMPO controls and calibrators are prepared from commercially available concentrated human MPO stock. MPO from the lysed cells is purified. An intermediate stock solution is prepared gravimetrically from the MPO stock solution and calibrator matrix. A working MPO stock solution is prepared by further diluting the intermediate stock solution in calibrator matrix. Calibrators $\mathbf A - \mathbf E$ are prepared gravimetrically adding working stock solutions to calibrator matrix. Calibrator F is comprised of calibrator matrix only. Controls 1-3 are prepared by gravimetrically adding the working MPO stock solution to human lithium heparin plasma.

Values are assigned to new calibrators through the use of a set of six gold standard calibrators. Gold standard calibrators were created from a single lot of MPO. New working calibrator lots are analyzed against the gold standard calibrators in the CardioMPO test in duplicate for five days at two runs per day. The mean MPO concentrations calculated from the twenty replicates are verified for precision and concentrations are assigned to the new working calibrators. Concentrations values and ranges are assigned for new controls lots though the same assignment process as for the calibrators, although the new controls may be analyzed against working calibrators.

Stability

Two accelerated stability studies were conducted with the CardioMPO Control kit- Opened/thawed and Unopened/frozen. Plasma controls with MPO concentrations spanning the calibration range (one neat plasma sample and two or three plasma samples spiked with MPO) were used to simulate stability of both controls and plasma samples and stored at $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ , $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ , room temperature and $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , removed and assayed periodically. The sponsor suggests storing plasma samples and controls for no more than 8 hours at room temperature $( 2 0 – 2 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and 14 days at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The results from the accelerated stability studies at elevated temperatures claim the controls/plasma samples will be stable for greater than one year at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

To evaluate freeze thaw stability conditions, the same plasma controls were stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ and $- 8 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , thawed, assayed and returned to frozen storage. No degradation of MPO was observed over 2 freeze/thaw cycles for 18 days at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 7 freeze/that cycles for 21 days at ${ } _ { - 8 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

To evaluate unopened/frozen controls, the plasma controls discussed in the open/thaw study above were stored at ${ - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Periodically a set of controls were removed, thawed and assayed with the CardioMPO test. No MPO degradation was observed in unopened, frozen controls at 41 days.

Real-time controls/plasma sample stability studies are ongoing; the control kit will be labeled as stable for 6 months.

Two accelerated stability studies were conducted with the CardioMPO Calibrator kit- Opened/thawed and Unopened/frozen. Calibrators were stored at $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ , $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and were periodically removed from storage, assayed and returned. At $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , the calibrators lost ${ \sim } 3 7 \%$ and ${ \sim } 2 3 \%$ after one day respectively. When stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { : }$ , the calibrators maintained $9 9 \%$ of their initial MPO concentration after 14 days and $8 6 \%$ after 43 days. The sponsor recommends storing calibrators for no more than 14 days at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { c }$ .

To evaluate unopened/frozen calibrators, several set of calibrators were aliquotted and stored at ${ \bf - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Periodically, a set of calibrators was removed, thawed and assayed in the CardioMPO test. No MPO degradation was observed in unopened, frozen calibrators after 41 days. The sponsor states that unopened vials will be labeled as stable for 6 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The zero calibrator material (F) was assayed 24 times. The mean plus two standard deviation value was calculated by interpolation as $1 3 \mathrm { p M }$ myeloperoxidase.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Three studies were conducted to assess analytical specificity- cross reactivity, interfering substances and interfering antibodies and were assessed according to NCCLS EP7-A.

Cross reactivity was conducted on eleven potentially cross-reactive proteins at 3 difference concentrations in human plasma and assay buffer. Cross reactivity was calculated by the following equation:

All controls were run (excluding the PBS blank) twice in duplicate and the cross reactivity samples were run in triplicate. All proteins showed less than $0 . 0 5 \%$ cross reactivity at the highest test concentration and less than $1 . 8 \%$ cross reactivity at the lowest test concentration when added to a plasma pool.

When added to the assay buffer, the proteins showed less than $0 . 0 9 \%$ cross reactivity at the highest test concentration and less than $0 . 2 \%$ at the lowest concentration. Elastase produced some slight cross reactivity but the sponsor determined it to be clinically insignificant. The results are shown in the table below.

An interfering substances study was conducted to determine if substances likely to be in patient samples would interfere with the CardioMPO test.

Interference testing was conducted according to NCCLS EP7-A. 26 samples were spiked with MPO values of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ and $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ . 16 drugs and dietary substances, 8 endogenous (which included triglycerides, hemoglobin and bilirubin) and 2 anticoagulants/preservatives were run in 8 replicates. An interference screen was conducted on 22/26 samples. A dose response study was conducted of hemoglobin, conjugated bilirubin (2) and triglycerides. 5 test pools were created by diluting the $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ MPO plasma pool with high concentrations of interferent with a $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ MPO plasma pool containing a low concentration of interferents. Percent interference was calculated by

The sponsor’s acceptance criterion of bias was interference greater than $10 \%$ . All substances listed, excluding hemoglobin and conjugated bilirubin did not cause interference with the CardioMPO test. The results of the plasma interference are listed in the chart below.

Hemoglobin, conjugated bilirubin and triglycerides were studied further in a dose response study. No interference was detected for triglycerides levels up to $5 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and for conjugated bilirubin levels up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The linear regression for triglycerides and conjugated bilirubin were $\mathrm { Y } { = } { - } 0 . 0 1 1 9 \mathrm { X } + 2 7 6 0$ $( \mathrm { R } 2 { = } 0 . 1 2 3 1 $ ) and $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 0 0 1 7 \mathrm { X } + 2 7 1 0 . 4$ $( \mathrm { R } 2 \mathrm { = } 0 . 0 0 3 8 )$ ), respectively. Hemoglobin revealed slight interference when tested at concentrations greater than $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and none at values less than $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Hemoglobin revealed a linear regression equation of $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 0 7 2 3 \mathrm { X } + 2 8 3 4 . 5$ .

Heterophilic antibodies which included anti MPO $\mathfrak { p }$ -anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), HAMA, and RF were tested for interference with the Prognostix CardioMPO test. 3 groups of samples were analyzed.

Group 1 contained eight samples known to have elevated levels of HAMA or RF antibodies. Group 2 contained eight samples known to have elevated levels of heterophilic antibodies other than HAMA and RF (i.e. anti-goat & anti-rabbit). Group 3 contained five samples with elevated levels of p-ANCA specific to MPO (anti-MPO pANCA positive) were analyzed. Each plasma sample was diluted 1:1 in normal donor plasma and the heterophilic antibody sample and was analyzed for linearity. Interference for heterophilic antibodies was determined to be $\%$ recovery of greater than $20 \%$ . The percent recovery was calculated by dividing the measured MPO concentration by the expected MPO concentration. The HAMA/RF positive, HAMA/RF negative and antiMPO pANCA positive results showed a mean recovery of $1 1 1 \%$ (101- 118), $1 0 7 \%$ (89-118) and $1 0 7 \%$ (101-114) respectively.

A spiking recovery study was conducted on 14 spiked plasma samples to determine the CardioMPO test ability to recover 3 levels of MPO $( 5 1 6 \mathrm { p M }$ , $1 0 1 6 \mathrm { p M }$ and $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p M } )$ . The samples were analyzed in duplicates and the $\%$ recovery was calculated. The percent recovery equation was calculated by dividing the sum of the mean measured MPO concentration of the spiked sample by the sum of the mean measured MPO concentration of the neat plasma sample plus the MPO concentration of the spike. The average recovery for the $5 1 0 \mathrm { p M }$ spike was $9 5 . 3 \%$ (range from $8 4 . 7 \%$ to $1 0 3 . 4 \%$ . The average recovery for the $1 0 1 6 \mathrm { p M }$ was $9 9 . 1 \%$ (range from $80 \%$ to $1 2 2 . 4 \%$ . The average recovery for the $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ pike was $9 5 . 4 \%$ (range from $8 1 . 2 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 3 \%$ ).

A dilution recovery study was conducted to determine the test ability to measure MPO in pre-diluted plasma samples (with assay buffer). 13 plasma samples were spiked with $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ MPO and diluted to 4 levels (1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16) with assay buffer and analyzed for recovery by the CardioMPO test. The $\%$ recovery was calculated by dividing the mean measured MPO concentration of the pre-diluted sample multiplied by the dilution factor by the mean MPO concentration of the sample with pre-dilution. The average recovery of a 1:2 dilution was $1 1 6 \%$ (range from $102 \%$ to $1 3 1 \%$ ), 1:4 dilution was $1 3 2 \%$ (range from $1 1 7 \%$ to $1 6 9 \%$ ), 1:8 dilution was $140 \%$ (range from 113 to $1 7 5 \%$ ) and 1:16 dilution was $144 \%$ (range from $1 1 5 \%$ to $1 6 7 \%$ ). The sponsor states the test kit is formulated to account for matrix effects associated with a $5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ human plasma sample. The sponsor does not recommend performing a sample dilution and that if a dilution is required; a 1:2 dilution is recommended with the knowledge that the MPO concentration obtained will be ${ \sim } 1 6 \%$ greater than the actual value.

3. Clinical studies:

Two clinical studies were performed using the CardioMPO test; one myeloperoxidase in normal subjects that is presented in the expected values section of this template below and the second study was a re-analysis of myeloperoxidase in patients presented to an emergency room complaining of chest pain. The sponsor conducted a re-analysis of samples from a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study examined the prognostic value of MPO levels in subjects with chest pain by using “research use only” MPO test reagents.

The MPO levels in 560 banked lithium heparin plasma samples from the study were measured to determine the efficacy of the test as a predictor of risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE). MPO levels in patients, 23 to 96 years of age, were measured using the CardioMPO test, calibrators and controls. The patients’ had enrolled in an earlier study of the diagnosis of myocardial infarction with necrotic biomarkers. Some patients were excluded statistically if one of the following variables were missing regarding the patient- age, Troponin T level, gender, race, history of smoking, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, Creactive protein level, history of high cholesterol and CK-MB level. After exclusion, the number of patient samples dropped to 523.

These samples were measured for MPO levels, Troponin T levels, C-reactive protein levels, and CK-MB mass levels.

Patients were followed for the development of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) over the next 6 months. Myocardial infarction was defined by Troponin T levels of at least $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The need for revascularization was defined as coronary-artery bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention or catheterization with stenosis in at least two major coronary vessels of more than $70 \%$ . The incidence of MACE was assessed by follow up phone calls at 30 days and 6 months.

Differences between groups in the outcome and associations among categorical variables were assessed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Trends for unadjusted analyses were evaluated with the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Correlations among continuous variables were assessed with the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient. Multivariate logistic-regression models (SAS version 8.0, SAS Institute) were developed to calculate odds ratios and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals.

Plasma levels of MPO in patients presented with chest pain ranged from 181 to $1 0 2 9 0 \mathrm { p M }$ with a median of $1 8 5 4 \mathrm { p M }$ $2 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $7 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of 1082 and 2990 respectively). These levels differ significantly when compared to normal blood donors with plasma MPO levels with a median of 193 ( $2 5 ^ { \mathrm { { ^ { t h } } } }$ and $7 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of 138 and $2 8 8 \mathrm { p M }$ respectively). MPO levels in these patients weakly correlated with peak troponin T levels $( \mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 2 2 )$ and C-reactive protein levels $( \mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 0 1 5 )$ ) but not with age $( \mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 0 6 8 )$ or sex $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { r = } 0 . 0 8 1 )$ ). MPO levels were significantly higher in current smokers, patients with a history of smoking, hyperlipidemia and revascularization in patients that had a MI within 16 hours after presentation.

The risk of MACE at 30 days increased with increasing MPO levels. An odds ratio analysis by the sponsor for MACE at 30 days by quartile of MPO level and revealed that increased levels of plasma MPO was a significant predictor of risk for MACE (3-fold increase for MPO in the $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ quartile).

The sponsor also conducted a similar analysis for the patients that were persistently negative for Troponin T which also revealed a significantly higher risk of MACE for patients with higher MPO levels. See table and graph below.

The odds ratio for MACE at 30 days in patients without evidence of myonecrosis rises $\sim 6 . 9$ fold for those with MPO levels in the $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ quartile relative to those with MPO levels in the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ quartile.

The sponsor claims that more patients who experienced MACE over the following six months were identified by the combination of either an elevated Troponin or MPO level.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

300 samples from apparently healthy subjects (150 of each sex) in the age range 22 to 60 (median age of 46) were evaluated. The sponsor states that there is no evidence of a correlation between MPO levels and age in the patients presenting with chest pain and felt it appropriate to analyze a population of “normal” subjects over an age range typical to patients with chest pain (40 years of age or more). The samples were analyzed in duplicates with the kit, controls and calibrators. A Box-Cox transformation was applied to all the data to fit a normal distribution and limits were set based on the $2 \dot { 5 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $7 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile range of the transformed data.

The sponsor found no significant difference in MPO levels between sexes. The median MPO level for subjects in the adjusted normal subject population was 193 pM, the overall range of result was 48 to $9 2 4 \mathrm { p M }$ and the interquartile range was 138 to $2 8 8 \mathrm { p M }$ . The distribution is shown below. The sponsor states that $9 5 \%$ of the CardioMPO test results on a healthy normal population are expected to fall below $5 3 9 \mathrm { p M }$ .
