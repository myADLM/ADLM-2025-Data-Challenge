Re: kO5Oll3 Trademevice Name: Tina-Quant IgG Gen.2 Regulation Number: 2 1 CFR 866.55 10 Regulation Name: Immunoglobulins A, G, M, D, E Immunological Test Regulatory Class: Class I1 Product Code: DEW Dated: January 14,2005 Received: January 18,2005

Dear Dr. Ambrose:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of February 8,2005 regarding the Tina-Quant IgG Gen.2 in which the dates for submission and receipt were incorrectly entered as January 4 and January 6,2005 respectively.

We have reviewed your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent [(for the indications for use stated in the enclosure)] to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I1 (Special Controls) or class I11 (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other

Page 2

requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (sections 53 1-542 of the Act); 2 1 CFR 1000-1 050.

This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf k )$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (2 1 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (2 1 CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.qov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain.html

Sincerely yours,

# Device Name

Proprietary name: Tina-Quan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ IgG Gen.2

Common name: immunoglobulin G (IgG) Test

Classification name: $\mathrm { I g G }$ (gamma chain specific) antigen, antiserum, controls

# Device Description

The Tina-Quant $\Theta \mathrm { I g G G e n } . 2$ is an immunoturbidimetric assay for the quantitative in vitro determination of IgG in human serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Anti-IgG antibodies react with antigen in the sample to form an antigedantibody complex which is measured turbidimetrically. The assay contains a standard application for measurement of $\mathrm { I g G }$ in human serum and plasma and a sensitive application for measurement of $\mathrm { I g G }$ in CSF.

# Intended use

Immunoturbidimetric assay for the quantitative in vitro determination of lgG in human serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

Note: Serum and plasma cleared under K040434,

# Indications for Use

Measurement of $\mathrm { I g G }$ aids in the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body's lack of ability to resist infectious agents.

# 510(k) Summary, Continued

The Tina-Quanta IgG Gen.2 test systemis substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in the United States. We claim equivalence to in Dade Behring N Antisera to Human Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) IgG assay on the BN I1 cleared under K943997. Both products are intended for use in the quantitative determination of $\mathbf { I g } \mathbf { G }$ in human CSF.

The following table compares the Tina-Quanta IgG Gen.2 test system with the predicate device.
