3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements: The CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ AutoPrep system and the CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer II. The CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer II is a semi-automated fluorescence microscope intended to enumerate fluorescently labeled cells that are immunomagnetically selected and distributed over a viewing surface

# I. Device Description:

The CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit contains a ferrofluid-based capture reagent and immunofluorescent reagents. The ferrofluid reagent consists of nanoparticles with a magnetic core surrounded by a polymeric layer coated with antibodies targeting the EpCAM antigen for capturing CTC. After immunomagnetic capture and enrichment, fluorescent reagents are added for identification and enumeration of CTC. The fluorescent reagents include the following: anti-CKPhycoerythrin (PE) specific for the intracellular protein cytokeratin (characteristic of epithelial cells), DAPI which stains the cell nucleus, and anti-CD45-Allophycocyanin (APC) specific for leukocytes

The reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ AutoPrep System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ cell presentation device. The strong magnetic field of the MagNest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ device attracts the magnetically labeled epithelial cells to the surface of the cartridge. The CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer II or CellSpotter $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Analyzer automatically scans the entire surface of the cartridge, acquires images and displays any event to the user where CK-PE and DAPI fluorescence are co-located. Images are presented to the user in a gallery format for final classification. An event is classified as a tumor cell when its morphological features are consistent with that of a tumor cell and it exhibits the phenotype $\mathrm { E p C A M ^ { + } }$ , $\mathrm { C K + }$ , DAPI+ and CD45-

All requirements for these standards were met. EP9-A testing was performed using donor spiked samples rather than actual cancer patient samples.

# L. Test Principle:

Epithelial cells are immunomagnetically labeled by targeting the Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) antigen. Anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibodies conjugated to ferrofluid particles are colloidal and, when mixed with a sample containing the target epithelial cells, bind to the EpCAM antigen associated with the epithelial cells. After immunomagnetic selection of epithelial cells from $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of blood, fluorescent reagents are added at this time to discriminate between the immunomagnetically selected cells. Anti-Cytokeratin – Phycoerythrin (CK-PE) stains the intracellular cytoskeleton cytokeratin proteins expressed in cells of epithelial origin, anti-CD45-Allophycocyan (CD45-APC) stains leukocytes and DAPI stains DNA present in the cell nucleus.

The processed reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ AutoPrep System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ cell presentation device. The strong magnetic field of the MagNest $^ \mathrm { { \textregistered } }$ device causes the magnetically-labeled target cells to move to the surface of the cartridge. The cartridge is then placed on the CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer II for data acquisition and analysis. The CellTracks Analyzer II scans the entire surface of the cartridge with a series of fluorescence filters that are defined for a given assay and acquires images of PE, APC and DAPI fluorescence staining of the entire viewing surface.

After data acquisition is completed, the images are analyzed for any event where cytokeratin-PE and DAPI are within a specified space in the cartridge, i.e. indicating the possible presence of a cell with a nucleus that expresses cytokeratin. Images from each fluorescent color as well as a composite image of the cytokeratin staining (green) and the nuclear staining (purple) are presented to the user in a gallery for final cell classification. A cell is classified as a tumor cell when it its $\mathrm { E p C A M ^ { + } }$ (i.e., it is captured), $\mathrm { C K ^ { + } }$ , $\mathrm { D A P I + }$ and CD45-. A check mark placed by the operator next to the composite images classifies the event as a Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) and the software tallies all the checked boxes to obtain the CTC count.

The sponsor’s data demonstrate that metastatic breast cancer patients with 5 or more CTC/per $7 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood have a significantly greater probability for shorter progression free and overall survival than patients who have fewer than 5 CTC per $7 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood.

This test methodology is new. It is hoped that further clinical studies reported in the scientific literature will corroborate the clinical study performed by the sponsor for submission to the FDA for the predicate device.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

(1) System Reproducibility with CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Control Three separate CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Control samples were prepared and processed each day for over 30 days, per the long run method of NCCLS guideline EP5-A2. Each single-use sample bottle contains a low and a high concentration of cells from a fixed cell line that have been pre-stained with two different fluorochromes. Summary statistics for the high and low control cells is presented below.

(2) System Reproducibility with Patient Samples

A total of 163 duplicate samples were collected from 47 patients over the course of the clinical study. These samples were processed at multiple sites to determine the reproducibility of CTC measurements. The regression equation for the comparison of these 163 duplicate samples was $\mathrm { Y = 0 } . 9 8 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 6 7$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9$ . Table 2 shows the summary of the data for replicates where the average of the two CTC results was ${ < } 5$ compared to those where the average (avg.) was ${ \ge } 5$ .

Accuracy/Recovery:

Blood samples from a single healthy donor were pooled and five of six 7.5 mL aliquots were spiked with 5, 20, 81, 325 and 1300 cultured breast cancer cells (SK-Br-3). The sixth tube was unspiked pooled blood and served as a zero point. These samples were processed on the CellTracksâ AutoPrep System with the CellSearchÔ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit and CTC counts were determined on the CellTracksâ Analyzer II. The experiment was repeated for four additional donors. The observed cell counts were plotted against the results of the expected cell count. The results are summarized in Table 3.

To determine the overall, or least squares fit, for the comparison of the observed and expected cell counts across all the data, linear regression analysis was performed. The regression equation for these 30 samples was $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 3 \mathrm { x } + 3 . 8 7$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9$ . The results of this study indicate that on average over the tested CTC range the recovery, as derived from regression analysis, is $9 3 \%$ .

Given the linear response of the tumor cell counts, one would expect the slope of the observed versus expected plot to be 1.0. However, the slope was 0.93. This is because the CellTracksâ AutoPrep System with CellSearchÔ CTC Kit involves the capture and fluorescent labeling of cells followed by their

detection and enumeration by the CellTracksâ Analyzer II. The loss of cells could therefore be attributed to one of the following possibilities; 1) the recovery of only $9 3 \%$ of the tumor cells spiked into $7 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood by the CellTracksâ AutoPrep System, 2) the detection of only $9 3 \%$ of the tumor cells present in the sample chamber by the CellTracksâ Analyzer II or 3) a combination of both of these sources of error.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Another way to examine the previous data is to analyze it as a dilution series to evaluate test linearity. We removed the confounding variable of percent recovery by using the observed value of the original sample divided by the dilution factors to determine the expected values for the dilution series for each patient sample. Regression of all of these numbers of observed tumor cells versus the numbers of expected tumor cells yielded a slope of 1.007, an intercept of 3.0, an $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ and $\mathrm { \Delta r } = 0 . 9 9 5$ . Therefore, once the percent recovery (cell loss) was factored out of the CTC values of each of the original samples, this analysis of the data demonstrated that the detection of CTC was linear over the reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): No recognized reference material or method.

d. Detection limit:

One CTC per $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ can be detected by the CellTracks® Analyzer II resulting in a limit of detection of 1 CTC in a cartridge. Linear regression shows that on average, $9 3 \%$ of CTC present in a $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ blood sample are recovered using the CellTracks $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AutoPrep System (see Recovery section). The loss of approximately $7 \%$ of the CTC in the sample is not sufficient to reduce the limit of detection of 1 CTC.

e. Analytical specificity:

The CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit contains a ferrofluid-based capture reagent and immunofluorescent reagents. The ferrofluid reagent consists of nanoparticles with a magnetic core surrounded by a polymeric layer coated with antibodies targeting the EpCAM antigen for capturing CTC. After immunomagnetic capture and enrichment, fluorescent reagents are added for identification and enumeration of CTC. The fluorescent reagents include the following: anti-CK-Phycoerythrin (PE) specific for the intracellular protein cytokeratin (characteristic of epithelial cells), DAPI which stains the cell nucleus, and anti-CD45-Allophycocyanin (APC) specific for leukocytes

Interfering Substances:

SK-BR-3 cells spiked into blood samples were exposed to potential interfering substances and compared to untreated controls. Toxic levels (5 times therapeutic index) of the following cancer drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and other exogenous substances were tested: cyclophosphamide, Mitomycin $\mathbf { C } \boldsymbol { \textcircled { \mathrm { R } } }$ , Procrit $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , biotin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen citrate, paclitaxel, Arimidex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, dextromethorphan, Aredia $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) type 1, HAMA type 2, Herceptin $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , and ibuprofen. No significant differences in SK-BR-3 cell

numbers were detected, indicating that these substances do not interfere with the CellSearch™ kit.

Samples spiked with toxic levels of doxorubicin resulted in aberrant staining of leukocytes as cytokeratin and CD45 dual positive cells, due to the doxorubicin being a fluorescent compound that is incorporated into nucleated cells. If seen, the staining pattern of all cells being CD45 positive and cytokeratin positive is obvious and easily identified by the operator as a known interference staining profile. If blood is drawn after the recommended 7-day washout period, following doxorubicin infusion, this interference is unlikely to be observed in clinical practice given controlled therapeutic levels and rapid drug clearance.

Potential interference from lipemia was studied by adding Intralipid to samples to a concentration of $2 . 6 \%$ , which corresponds to greater than $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ triglyceride. Samples were lysed to simulate total hemolysis.

Bilirubin at $7 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , HAMA 1/HAMA 2 and hematocrit from $1 8 \mathrm { - } 6 0 \%$ were studied. Lipemia, hemolysis, icterus and a broad range of hematocrit values do not interfere with the CellSearch™ test. HAMA 1 and HAMA 2 also do not interfere, indicating that individuals receiving mouse Ig by parenteral routes can be tested successfully with the CellSearchTM test.

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

Results are reported as the number of $\mathrm { C T C } / 7 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood. A CTC count of 5 or more per $7 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood is predictive of shorter progression free survival and overall survival. This cut-off was established in the 510(k) of the previous version of this assay, the predicate device, K031588.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

To demonstrate comparable performance between the new assay and the predicate system, a study was performed using duplicate samples split between both the predicate device, CellSearch™ Epithelial Cell System (K031588), and the new device, CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell System (K050245). The study consisted of spiking normal donor whole blood samples with three different tissue culture lines (SKBr-3, PC3-9 and MCF-7) at three different levels $( \sim 5 , \sim 5 0$ , and $\mathord { \sim } 1 0 0 0$ ) for 5 days. The three cell lines (SK-Br-3, MCF-7, or PC3-9) were chosen to cover a broad range of EpCAM and Cytokeratin antigen density representing the capture and detection portions of the assay respectively. Three spike levels of each cell line were chosen to cover a range of potential clinical values. Of the three cell lines tested, the PC3-9 cell line has the lowest Cytokeratin antigen density. SK-Br3 cells demonstrate an uneven bimodal population consisting primarily of moderate level Cytokeratin antigen density cells and a smaller population of higher expressing cells. MCF-7 cells demonstrate the highest level of consistent Cytokeratin expression. The Cytokeratin antigen is the target of the detection reagent for tumor cells in the CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell kits. The design and execution of this study is consistent with the NCCLS guideline EP9-A. A total of 45 samples were analyzed on each of the two platforms

For MCF-7 cells the slope of the regression line $= 1 . 0 3$ , an intercept of 1.5 and an $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 4$ . For SKBr-3 cells, the slope of the regression line $= 1 . 0 1$ with an intercept of 2.9 and an $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 4$ . For PC3-9 cells, the slope of the regression line $= 1 . 1 9$ with an intercept of 10.5 and an $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . { \dot { 9 } } 6 3$ . Analysis of data from all 3 tumor cell lines combined shows a slope of the regression line $= 1 . 0 9$ with an intercept of 1.5 and an $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 6 6$ .

The slope of 1.19 for PC3-9 cells may be due to an improved dynamic range of the AutoPrep / CellTracks Analyzer II system resulting in a flattening out of the response curve at higher cell numbers. In other words, the recovery of CTC by the AutoPrep / CellTracks Analyzer II platform at high numbers of cells may be somewhat more sensitive than recovery by the CellPrep / CellSpotter platform, particularly with lower EpCAM antigen density cells as is the case with PC3-9 cells (Figure 1). This difference could also be attributable to increased reliability and/or stability of the AutoPrep as compared to the CellPrep for sample preparation. Regardless of this potential difference however, there appears to be no difference between the AutoPrep / CellTracks Analyzer II platform and the CellPrep / CellSpotter platform at the medical decision level of 5-50 CTC’s.

$b$ . Matrix comparison: Since whole blood is the only matrix for this test., no matrix comparison studies were performed.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

All of the above new analytical studies with the CellSearch™ Circulating Cell Kit/ AutoPrep/CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer II system demonstrate that the detection of tumor cells by the CellSearch™ Circulating Cell Kit/ AutoPrep/CellTracks $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Analyzer II system is substantially equivalent to the predicate system. Therefore, the following clinical data generated using the predicate system (K035188) is applicable to the new device (K050245).

# Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients

A multi-center prospective, longitudinal clinical trial was conducted. Results were used to determine whether the number of CTC predict disease progression and survival. Patients with measurable disease and who were starting a new line of therapy were enrolled $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 1 7 7$ ). Clinical data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Baseline CTC count was determined prior to initiation of a new line of therapy. A first follow-up CTC count was determined after the initiation of therapy. For the baseline analyses, Progression Free Survival (PFS) was measured from the time of the baseline blood draw to the diagnosis of progression by CT scans and/or clinical signs and symptoms, and Overall Survival (OS) was measured from the time of baseline blood draw to the time of death. For the first follow-up analyses, PFS was measured from the time of $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ follow-up blood draw (mean $4 . 5 \pm 2 . 4$ weeks following enrollment) to diagnosis of progression or death, and OS was measured from the time of $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ follow-up blood draw to the time of death.

# Progression Free Survival (PFS) Analysis

PFS Using Baseline CTC Results

All 177 patients had a baseline CTC test performed. For Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at baseline:

· The Favorable group $( \mathrm { N } { = } 9 0 )$ ), represented in green, consisted of patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC.   
· The Unfavorable group $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 7$ ), represented in red, consisted of patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC.   
Median PFS was 30.3 weeks ${ \sim } 7 . 0$ months) for the Favorable group and 11.7 weeks $( \sim 2 . 7$ months) for the Unfavorable group. The difference in PFS between the two groups is highly significant (Log-rank $\mathrm { p } { = } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ , Cox Hazards Ratio=1.9547, chi-square ${ \mathrm { - } } 1 5 . 3 3$ , p $= 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ). These results are illustrated in Figure 1.
