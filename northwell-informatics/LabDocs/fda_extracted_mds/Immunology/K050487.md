Summary Prepared: February 15, 2005

Name of the device: Quantia Lp(a)

# Classification name(s):

866.5600 DFC

Class II

Low-density lipoprotein immunological test system lipoprotein, low-density, antigen, antiserum, control

Identification of predicate device(s): K013128 N-latex Lp(a)(Dade Behring)

# Description of the device/intended use(s):

The Quantia Lp(a) is intended as a latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay for the in vitro quantitative determination of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentration in human serum or plasma (EDTA, Heparin, Citrate) on the Clinical Chemistry Systems. The measurement of Lp(a) is useful in evaluating lipid metabolism disorders and assessing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in specific populations, when used in conjunction with clinical evaluation.

Quantia Lp(a) Control is intended for use in monitoring the quality control of results obtained with the Quantia Lp(a) reagents by turbidimetry.

Quantia Lp(a) Standard is intended for use in establishing the calibration curve for the Quantia Lp(a) reagents by turbidimetry.

Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

Quantia Lp(a) is substantially equivalent to the commercially available predicate device, N-latex Lp(a) (Dade Behring), in performance and intended use.

# Summary of Performance Data:

In a method comparison study evaluating 104 samples with Lp(a) levels ranging from 2.4 to 188 mg/dL on the Abbott AEROSET® instrument, the slope was 1.121 and the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.9754 for Quantia Lp(a) versus the predicate device.

Within run precision was assessed over multiple runs using three different levels of control: (Quantia Lp(a) controls I and Il and a mixture of control I and control Il) on an Abbott AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . The precision assessed gave a CV of $2 . 3 \%$ (at a mean of $1 6 . 1 \mathrm { \ m g / d L } )$ and $0 . 9 \%$ (at a mean of $5 7 . 9 \mathrm { \ m g / d L } )$ . The third control (control I $^ +$ control II) gave a CV of $1 . 5 \%$ (at a mean of 38.1 mg/dL).

Dear Ms. Guixer:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in ccordance with the provisions o the Federal FoodDrug and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
