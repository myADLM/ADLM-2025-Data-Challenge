# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI Document EP5-A, EP6-A, EP7-A, and EP9-A2

# L. Test Principle:

The Quantia Lp(a) Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of uniform size coated with rabbit IgG anti-human Lp(a). When a sample containing Lp(a) is mixed with the Latex Reagent and the reaction buffer included in the kit, a clear agglutination occurs. The degree of agglutination is directly proportional to the concentration of Lp(a) in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of transmitted light caused by the aggregates.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study was performed on a AEROSET System using the Quantia Lp(a) Control I and II (low and high) run in duplicate twice a dayover twenty days $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 8 0 )$ ). The within run, between run and total CV were calculated according to CLIS EP5-Aand summarized in following table.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was assessed according to CLSI EP6-A guideline. 1.28 to $9 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (2.0 to $2 0 4 \mathrm { n m o l } / \mathrm { L }$ ) without the automatic rerun capability 1.28 to $3 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (2.0 to $8 1 6 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ ) with the automatic rerun capability. If after the automatic rerun the concentration of the sample exceeds the linearity range, dilute the sample 1:10 with saline solution, re-assay and multiply the result by the dilution factor of 10.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The Quantia Lp(a) Control (level I and II) are prepared from human sera containing Lp(a), and sodium azide $( < 0 . 1 \% )$ . Refer to control value sheet for assigned values. Verify that the lot number listed on each bottle of the control agrees with the lot number printed on the value sheet. Reconstituted stability testing was performed to support the Quantia Lp(a) Control (low and high) of 15 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ after reconstitution.

The calibrator is prepared from human sera containing Lp(a) and sodium azide $< 0 . 1 \%$ . Calibration stability testing was performed using the Abbot Clinical Chemistry System AEROSET to support that calibration is stable for at least 30 days. Reconstituted stability testing was performed to support the Quantia Lp(a) Standard of 15 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ after reconstitution.

c. Detection limit:

The detection limit was calculated by running thirty replicates of physiologic saline on an AEROSET System. The mean and standard deviation were calculated. The detection limit is defined as the mean reported value for the physiologic saline plus two standard deviations. The detection limit of this assay is $0 . 3 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

d. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed on an AEROSET System by spiking a sample containing Lipoprotein (a). For each interfering substance the sample was split in two aliquots, one being spiked with the concentrated interfering substance and the other with the control buffer (the buffer in which the interfering substance is dissolved). For this study , CLSI EP7-A was followed with the following results that no significant interference by:

Hemoglobin up to $4 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Bilirubin up to $1 9 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
Triglycerides up to $1 3 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$
