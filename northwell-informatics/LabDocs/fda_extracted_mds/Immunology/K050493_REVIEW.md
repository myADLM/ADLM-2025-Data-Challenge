3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.   
4. Special instrument requirements: For use in the Aeroset $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system (k980367).

# I. Device Description:

Quantia IgE consists of IgE R1 buffer and IgE R2 reagents (latex particle coated with mouse anti-human IgE, and sodium azide).

The Quantia Ferritin/Myoglobin/IgE lyophilized controls I and II are prepared from human sera containing human ferritin, myoglobin and IgE, and sodium azide. [These controls were FDA cleared for use with Quantex Ferritin (k040879) and for Quantex Myoglobin (k042982)].

The Quantia IgE standards are ready to use calibrators prepared with human IgE at 5 different levels in a Hepes-glycine buffer. The concentrations in $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ are indicated on the standard data sheet.

The controls and standards are sold separately.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The Quantia IgE Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene particles of uniform size coated with mouse anti-human IgE monoclonal antibody. When a sample containing IgE is mixed with the latex reagent and the reaction buffer included in the kit, a clear agglutination occurs. The degree of agglutination is directly proportional to the concentration of IgE in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of transmitted light caused by the aggregates. Results are expressed in $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ of IgE.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The precision study was performed using three samples (Quantia Ferritin/Myoglobin/IgE low and high controls and a mixture of the two controls), run in duplicate twice a day over 20 days on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ). This experiment was performed by one operator on one site with one lot of reagent.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System using a serum sample containing $1 3 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ of IgE diluted in physiologic saline at 7 different dilutions $( 5 \% , 1 0 \%$ , $20 \% { , } 3 0 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $7 5 \%$ ). Each dilution was analyzed in quadruplicate. Testing was done without automatic rerun capability. The reported means were calculated from the pooled results. Regression analysis yielded $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 6 \mathrm { x } - 3 . 6$ and a correlation coefficient $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { r } } ^ { 2 } )$ of 0.9996. Results showed the assay range is linear for IgE concentrations ranging from 25 to $1 0 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

The AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System can automatically rerun samples with results above the upper limit of the assay range $( 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ at 1:10 sample dilutions and then automatically recalculates the new sample result. Two studies using two sample pools were done to assess the extended linearity range. One sample pool containing $6 7 1 9 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ IgE was analyzed 4 times the normal sample volume (equivalent to 26,887 $\mathrm { I U / m L \mathrm { I g } E } )$ , was diluted 4 times $( 6 . 2 5 \%$ , $12 . 5 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , and $50 \%$ ) with physiological saline . The other sample pool containing $3 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ IgE was analyzed the same way (equivalent to $7 8 1 2 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ), was diluted 6 times $( 5 \%$ , $10 \%$ , $1 5 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , and $50 \%$ ). Each dilution was analyzed in quadruplicate. The reported means were calculated from the pooled results. Regression analysis yielded $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 4$ and correlation coefficient $( \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } ) = 0 . 9 8 8 0$ . Results showed that extended assay rangewith automatic rerun capability is linear for IgE concentrations ranging from 25 to $2 6 0 0 0 \mathrm { \Pi U / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The reference material is the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ WHO International Reference Preparation Human Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE), NIBSC code 75/502.Value assignments were determined in multiple runs using specific lots of reagents. A detailed description of the assignment of the Quantia IgE calibrators and control values is provided.

Calibration Stability – The data indicated that the calibration is stable for at least 30 days.

Reconstituted Control Stability – The data indicated that the controls I and II are stable for at least 15 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after reconstitution.

The shelf-life stability for the standards was 18 months and the controls 24 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Detection limit was calculated by running 30 replicates of physiologic saline on an AEROSET $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System. The mean and the standard deviation (SD) were calculated. The detection limit is defined as the mean reported value for the physiologic saline plus 2 SD. The Detection Limit was found to be $6 . 9 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

Limit of quantification is the smallest concentration of unknown that can be reliably be quantified by the assay and was determined using 6 dilutions of the $1 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ( $10 \%$ , $1 5 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $33 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $7 5 \%$ ) Quantia IgE Standard in physiologic saline on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System. Each dilution was run in quadruplicate. The data support the claim for a limit of quantification of $2 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System by spiking a sample containing IgE. For each interfering substance, the sample was split into two aliquots, one spiked with a concentrated interfering substance and the other with the control buffer. Each aliquot was analyzed 10 times with a single lot of Quantia IgE reagent. The acceptance criteria are as follows:

If the recovery of the spiked sample is within $9 5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 5 \%$ of the unspiked sample result $( \mathrm { w i t h i n } \pm 5 \% )$ no further studies are needed. If not, several concentrations of the interfering substances were studied and the concentration causing $5 \%$ , $10 \%$ and $1 5 \%$ interference were assessed.

No significant interference was observed for:

Hemoglobin up to $4 8 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ · Bilirubin up to $2 0 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Triglycerides up to $1 3 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Turbidity of sample up to $2 . 3 8 \mathrm { \ A U / c m }$ at $6 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Rheumatoid Factor interference is below $10 \%$ up to $1 3 8 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

Since the interference for RF exceeded $5 \%$ , a dose response study was performed by mixing in different proportions of the two aliquots. From the fitted interferogram curve, the RF concentrations causing interference was extrapolated with the following results:

$5 \%$ : 69 IU/mL 10%: 138 IU/mL 15%: 207 IU/mL

No cross-reactivity studies have been conducted with heterophile antibodies and this information is included in the Limitations section of the package insert.

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The reported expected range for IgE is from a literature: In clinically healthy subjects the serum IgE levels exhibit a wide distribution range and do not follow a normal distribution. Age related concentrations must be taken into account when interpreting IgE values in children. IgE does not cross the placental barrier so IgE is not detectable in newborn. The IgE concentration increases during the first years of life, reaching a peak at 10-15 years and dropping subsequently to adult values1. As the limit of quantification of Quantia IgE is $2 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , it is not recommended to use this test with children below the age of 12 months.
