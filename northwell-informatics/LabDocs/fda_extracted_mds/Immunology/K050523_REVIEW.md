# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The diaDexus PLAC™ Test is a sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay that uses two anti-Lp- $\mathrm { \bf { P L A } } _ { 2 }$ monoclonal antibodies. One antibody is immobilized on the bottom of microtiter wells. Sample and buffer are incubated in the wells and the unbound fractions are washed off. The second antibody (labeled with horseradish peroxidase) is added and incubated to bind with the $\mathrm { L } { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { - P } } \mathrm { L A } _ { 2 }$ bound to the surface of the well. The excess is washed away, and a colorimetric substrate is added and allowed to react with the peroxidase to form a blue color. A stop solution converts the resulting color from blue to yellow which is measure spectrophotometrically at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The measured absorbance is directly proportional to the amount of $\mathrm { L } { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { - P } } \mathrm { L A } _ { 2 }$ in the sample.

A study was conducted by the manufacturer using 956 samples from patients who were part of a large multi-center epidemiologic study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Patients, 47 to 69 years of age, were free from coronary heart disease or stroke at the start of the study and followed for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke for ${ \sim } 9$ years. This was a case-cohort study where samples from all the ischemic stroke cases associated with atherosclerosis (194) were tested together with 762 appropriately matched participants without CHD or stroke (controls).

Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association of Lp-PLA2 and ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis, using a univariate analysis (Model 1), a univariate analysis adjusted for demographics (Model 2), and a multivariate model adjusted for demographics and other prognostic factors (Model 3). The same cutpoints of Lp-PLA2 as were used in the original CHD risk indication were investigated in this study (420 and $3 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , the $6 7 ^ { \mathrm { { t h } } }$ and $3 3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ percentiles, respectively) to divide study participants into tertiles. The hazard ratios of the Cox regression analyses demonstrated that Lp-PLA2 may be used as a predictor of risk for ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis for the highest tertile when compared to the lowest tertile of Lp-PLA2. See tables below for additional information.

\*the lowest tertile with $\mathrm { L } { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { - P } } \mathrm { L A } _ { 2 }$ values $< 3 1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ is used as a reference group Model 1: univariate analysis Model 2: adjusted for age, race, and gender Model 3: adjusted for age, race, gender, diabetes, LDL, HDL, blood pressure, smoking, BMI, and CRP

Further analyses were performed to determine if $\mathrm { L } { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { - P } } \mathrm { L A } _ { 2 }$ was predictive of ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis across the complete range of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the population, and to determine whether blood pressure and $\mathrm { L } { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { - P } } \mathrm { L A } _ { 2 }$ were additive in assessing risk for ischemic stroke. Systolic blood pressure tertile cutpoints were assigned by the $3 3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ and $6 7 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles of the population (113 and 130 $\mathrm { m m H g }$ , respectively). The study population was divided into the low, mid, and high range $( 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } } , 2 ^ { \mathrm { \bar { n } d } }$ , and $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ tertile) of SBP and the low, mid, and high range of Lp-PLA2. The relative risk of each group was compared to the risk of events associated with the group in the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ tertile of the two variables.

CHD was a strong predictor of ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis in all three models (see Tables below). However, the third tertile of Lp-PLA2 remained a predictor even when CHD was incorporated in all three models with risk ratios decreasing by less than 0.2 units in all cases.
