Good Biotech Corp. Microalbumin TIA is a ready to use reagent for the quantitative determination of low level albumin in human urine by turbidimetric immunoassay (TlA). When microalbumin of the urine sample encounters with duck anti-albumin antibody, the agglutination based on the antigen-antibody reaction increases the turbidity of the sample. The value of the absorbance change at 340 nm is proportional to the albumin concentration of the sample and is recorded by a general chemistry autoanalyzer. Then, the actual microalbumin concentration of the urine sample is determined by interpolation of the calibration curve obtained by standard samples with known albumin concentrations.

# Intended Use

# Reagent:

Good Biotech Corp. (GBC) Microalbumin TIA system is intended to be used for the quantitative determination of low level albumin in human urine by turbidimetric immunoassay (TIA). Measurement of albumin aids in the diagnosis of kidney disease.

# Calibrator:

GBC mAlb Calibrator Set 200 is intended to be used with GBC Microalbumin TIA for the quantitative determination of microalbumin in urine samples.

# Control:

GBC Microalbumin Controls are intended to be used as the assayed quality control material for the urinary albumin analysis.

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

# Substantial Equivalence

Comparative performance studies conducted on 50 urine samples yielded high correlation coefficients upon comparison of the GBC Microalbumin TIA system and the predicate devices, Randox Microalbumin Test kit and Wako Micro-Albumin B. The results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Intercept (mg/L)</td><td>Correlation Coefficient</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>Comparative Method Randox</td><td>Slope</td><td>-0.56</td><td>0.997</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Microalbumin Test kit</td><td>1.20</td><td></td><td>0.998</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Wako Micro-Albumin B</td><td>1.20</td><td>-2.17</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

# Conclusion

Good Biotech Corp. Microalbumin TIA system, calibrator set and controls are substantially equivalent to the predicate devices based on their intended purposes, design and the comparison performance results.

Dear Mr.Chiou:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA mav publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
