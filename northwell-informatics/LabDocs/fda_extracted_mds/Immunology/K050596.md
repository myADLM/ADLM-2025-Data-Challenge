Summary Prepared: February 24, 2005

# Name of the device:

Quantia A1-AT

Classification name(s):

866.5130 Alpha-1-antitrypsin immunological test system DEM Alpha-1-Antitrypsin, Antigen, Antiserum, Control

Identification of predicate device(s):

K860894 N Antisera to Human alpha-1-Antitrypsin (Dade Behring)

Description of the device/intended use(s):

The Quantia A1-AT is intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of alpha-1-antitrypsin concentration in human serum or plasma (heparin with or without gel separator, EDTA) on the AEROsET® system as an aid in the diagnosis of juvenile and adult cirrhosis of the liver and pulmonary emphysema.

Quantia PROTEINS Control is intended for use in monitoring the quality control of results obtained with the Quantia A1-AT reagents by turbidimetry. (NOTE: This control has been also FDA 510(k) submitted for use with Quantia Beta-2 Microglobulin). For in vitro diagnostic use.

Quantia PROTEINS standard is intended for use in establishing the calibration curve for the Quantia A1-AT reagents by turbidimetry. For in vitro diagnostic use.

Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device: Quantia A1-AT is substantially equivalent to the commercially available predicate device, N Antisera to Human alpha-1-Antitrypsin, in performance and intended use.

# Summary of Performance Data:

In a method comparison study evaluating 111 samples with alpha-1-antitrypsin levels ranging from 42.0 to 442.5 mg/dL on the Abbott AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ instrument, the slope was 1.002 and the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.9890 for Quantia A1-AT versus the predicate device.

The studies performed on the Abbott AEROSET $\otimes$ system with Quantia A1-AT reagents support the following precision claims:

Dear Ms. Guixer:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please   
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0131. Also, please note the regulation entitled,   
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other   
general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small   
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
