# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The Quantia A1-AT reagent is a goat serum anti-human alpha 1 – antitrypsin which reacts specifically with the alpha 1 – antitrypsin of the sample to yield an insoluble aggregate which can be measured by turbidimetry. Results are expressed in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $\mathrm { g / L }$ based on the International Reference Material CRM 470.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was performed on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System using the Quantia Proteins Control (low and High) and a mixture of both, run in duplicate twice a day over 20 days $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } - 8 0 )$ ). This experiment was performed by one operator on one site with one lot of reagent.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System using a serum sample containing $2 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of A1-AT diluted in physiologic saline at 10 different dilutions. Each dilution was analyzed in quintuplicate. Testing was done with the automatic and without automatic rerun capability. The reported means were calculated from the pooled results. Data showed a regression equation $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 0 1 \mathrm { X } - 0 . 3 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 }$ of 0.9995 for the “without the automatic rerun capability.” Linearity was set at 25 to $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

The AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System can automatically rerun samples with results above the upper limit of the valid range $( 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ at 1:5 sample dilutions. . The instrument then automatically recalculates the new sample result. To assess the extended linearity range, a serum spiked with partially purified Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (Sigma) was prepared. Ten dilutions in physiologic saline were done and analyzed in quintuplicate. The regression equation for the automatic rerun capability showed $\mathrm { Y } =$ $0 . 9 9 4 { \bar { X } } + 5$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = \dot { 0 } . 9 9 8 4$ . Linearity was set at 25 to $1 2 6 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The graphs showed the curves are linear on both settings.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The reference material is the BCR Reference Material Proteins, CRM 470. The calibrator is supplied by Strategic BioSolutions. Values are assigned based on CRM 470 CAP/IFCC Lot 91/0619. The concentration of A1-AT of each new lot of product is tested and reviewed by the Quality Control Department of Biokit, using the Quantia A1-AT reagents. Once this lyophilized material is reconstituted, it is aliquoted and stored frozen at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Two lots of Quantia A1-AT are used to test the concentration of each new lot of calibrators. The concentration value of each new lot of Quantia Proteins Standard obtained has to be within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the initial value stated by Strategic solutions.

The controls are bulk manufactured by BioRad which has been cleared (k851202/A1) under the trade name Lypochek Immunology Plus Control. Target values and acceptance ranges are assigned to each level of Quantia Proteins Control by the Quality Control Department of Biokit. Two different lots of Reagent and one lot of calibrator are used. Upon calibration, each level of the new lot of Quantia Proteins Control to be assigned is tested 10 times with each lot of reagent. The acceptance value is the target value $\pm 2 0 \%$ for both controls (low and high levels).

Stability studies were performed and the following conclusions were obtained:

• On-Board Instrument Stability – The reagents Quantia A1-AT

Buffer (R1) and Quantia A1-AT Reagent (R2) are stable on – board the instrument for 5 weeks at $1 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ .   
Calibration Stability – The data and the graph indicate that the calibration is stable for at least 30 days.   
Reconstituted Control Stability – The data indicate that Quantia Proteins Control I and II is stable for at least 15 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after reconstitution.   
Reagent Shelf-Life Stability – Shelf life stability of the reagents was conducted up to 18 months with three different lots.   
Recovery showed minimal change from baseline and the final shelf-life stability was 12 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

Detection limit was calculated by running 30 replicates of physiologic saline on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System. The mean and the standard deviation were calculated. The detection limit is defined as the mean reported value for the physiologic saline plus 2 SD. The Detection Limit was found to be $0 . 3 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Limit of quantification was also performed on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System using 5 dilutions of the $3 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Quantia Proteins Standard in physiologic saline. Each dilution was run in quintuplicate. The data support the claim for a limit of quantification of $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A limit of quantification is the smallest concentration of unknown that can be reliably be quantified by the instrumental method.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Interference testing was performed on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System by spiking a sample containing A1-AT. For each interfering substance, the sample was split in two aliquots, one spiked with a concentrated interfering substance and the other with the control buffer. Each aliquot was analyzed 10 times with a single lot of Quantia A1-AT reagent. No significant interference was observed in:

Hemoglobin up to $4 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Bilirubin up to $1 9 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Triglycerides up to $1 3 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Turbidity of sample up to $2 . 3 3 \mathrm { \ A U / c m }$ at $6 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Rheumatoid Factor interference is below $10 \%$ up to $8 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

No cross-reactivity studies have been conducted with heterophile antibodies.
