# L. Test Principle:

The Quantia Beta-2-microglobulin reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of uniform size coated with the IgG fraction of an anti-human $\beta _ { 2 }$ -M specific serum. When a sample containing $\beta _ { 2 }$ -M is mixed with the reagent, a clear agglutination occurs which can be measured by turbidimetry. Absorbance readings are taken at wavelengths of $5 7 2 \mathrm { n m }$ . $\beta _ { 2 } \mathrm { - M }$ results are reported in $\mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

i. Precision: Precision was performed on an AEROSET $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system using three samples. The samples were Quantia Proteins Control I (low control, 0.7 – 1.3 $\mathrm { m g / L ) }$ ), Control II (high control, $5 . 0 - 7 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ and a negative serum sample spiked with pure $\beta _ { 2 } \mathrm { - M }$ at $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 1 5 \ m g / L }$ . The samples were run in duplicate twice a day over twenty days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ) following the NCCLS EP5- A guidelines. The precision study met the acceptance criteria for all three samples which were $< 5 \%$ for “Within Run CV” and $< 6 \%$ for “Total $\mathrm { C V } ^ { \mathrm { \scriptsize { > } } }$ .

The mean values given above are absorbance values. A high SD was seen for the highest level of calibrator ( $1 6 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ and high CV was seen for the lowest level of calibrator $( 0 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / L ) }$ . The sponsor pointed out that the quadruplicate runs performed for the linearity study gave a standard deviation of 0.017 for the $1 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ sample; and a CV of $2 \%$ for the 0.25 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ sample.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed on an AEROSET $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system using a serum sample containing around $2 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ of $\beta _ { 2 } \mathrm { - M }$ diluted in physiologic saline at different $\%$ dilutions $80 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $1 5 \%$ , $8 \%$ and $4 \%$ ). Each dilution was analyzed in quadruplicate. The AEROSET $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ automatically reruns samples above $1 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ using a 1:6 dilution of the sample volume and for samples below $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ by adding 10 times more sample than the regular test. Without rerun, the linearity studies together with the limit of quantification test demonstrated acceptable CVs and inaccuracies within the interval concentrations $0 . 2 5 - 2 2 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / L }$ . In order to prevent prozone problems, the claim for the upper limit of the test range has been decreased to $1 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Within this range, $0 . 2 5 { \cdot } 1 6 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , the test has a slope of 1.00, an intercept of $0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and a correlation coefficient $( \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } )$ 0.9995. With the automatic re-run, the linearity claims were extended from $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Stability: The reference standard for $\beta _ { 2 } \mathrm { - M }$ is the WHO international standard for $\beta _ { 2 } \mathrm { - M }$ ( $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ international standard preparation).

Controls: The bulk product for the Control material is manufactured by BioRad and the product has been 510(K) cleared (k851202/A1) under the name LYPHOCHEK IMMUNOLOGY PLUS CONTROL. The lyophilized vials are purchased unlabeled from BioRad. The vials are labeled and packaged at Biokit. The target values and acceptance ranges to each level of controls are assigned at the Quality Control Department of Biokit with an AEROSET

Instrument using one lot of calibrator and two different lots of reagents.

Calibrator: The calibrator is manufactured from commercially purified and concentrated $\beta _ { 2 } \mathrm { - M }$ using the Quantia Beta-2 Reagents on an ILab 600 System (k980757). The purified and concentrated $\beta _ { 2 } \mathrm { - M }$ is diluted in a buffer to a concentration of $4 \ : \mathrm { m g / L } \pm 5 \%$ by comparison with a house standard. The house standard is traceable to the reference standard, the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ WHO international standard preparation. Value assignment procedure was provided. System uses a five-point calibration curve. The analyzer automatically prepares the 5 different concentrations of calibrator from the single calibrator level vial provided at $4 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

Stability: On-board instrument stability was performed on reagents which showed 5 weeks stability for both reagents (R1 and R2). The reagent shelflife stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was also performed and the reagents were found to be stable for 19 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The calibration was shown to be stable for 30 days. The reconstituted controls were shown to be stable for 15 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ }$ .

d. Detection limit:

The detection limit was determined by running 30 replicates of physiological saline on an AEROSET $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system. The detection limit is defined as the mean reported value for the physiologic saline plus 2 standard deviations. The detection limit is claimed as $0 . 0 4 6 \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was preformed by spiking a serum sample containing $\beta _ { 2 } .$ - M with the various interfering substances and assayed on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system. The acceptance criteria for the percent of recovery $\beta _ { 2 } \mathrm { - M }$ in the spiked sample are within $9 5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 5 \%$ of the unspiked sample. Based on the acceptance criteria, no significant interference was found with hemoglobin up to 482 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , bilirubin up to $2 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , trigylcerides up to $1 3 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and turbidity of the sample up to $2 . 1 8 \mathrm { \ A U / c m }$ at $6 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Interference by rheumatoid factor (RF) is below $10 \%$ for RF concentration up to $2 8 8 \mathrm { \ : I U / m l }$ .

No cross-reactivity studies were performed with heterophile antibodies and have updated the package insert with the disclaimer statement “no crossreactivity studies have been conducted with heterophile antibodies”.

$f .$ Assay cut-off: No assay cut off was provided.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The Method Comparison study was performed with 105 patient serum samples covering all the clinical range (1.01 to $1 0 1 . 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ of $\beta _ { 2 } { \mathrm { - M } } ,$ ) on the new device and the predicate device, IL Test Beta-2 Microglobulin, (k943686) on an ILab 900 instrument which was cleared in k932467. The samples were obtained from two hospitals in Spain. The required specifications were: slope $1 . 0 \pm 0 . 2 0$ ; r (correlation coefficient) $\ge 0 . 9 5 0$ . Linear regression analysis

showed a slope of 0.876 $9 5 \%$ CI: 0.868 to 0.886) and an intercept of 0.59 (95%CI: 0.385 to 0.772). The correlation coefficient was 0.9986.

b. Matrix comparison:

The plasma to serum correlation data was generated with 30 paired samples on an AEROSET $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system. The recovery met the acceptance criteria which is $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the serum sample result. The correlation coefficient was 0.996, the intercept was -0.091 ( $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I }$ : -0.154 to -0.029) and the slope was 0.977 $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ : 0.942 to 1.012).

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not provided   
b. Clinical specificity: Not provided   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not provided
