Varelisa® ReCombi ANA Profile - New Device 510(k) Submission Section 9. Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

# Intended Use Statement of the New Device

Intended use/Indication for use

The Varelisa ReCombi ANA Profile EIA kit is designed for the qualitative determination of eight antinuclear antibodies in human serum or plasma to aid in the diagnosis of SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis and CREST syndrome), MCTD (mixed connective tissue disease), SS (Sjögren's syndrome) and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. The Varelisa ReCombi ANA Profile individually detects antibodies against dsDNA, U1 RNP (RNP 70 kDa,A,C), SmD, SS-A/Ro( $5 2 \mathrm { k D a }$ , $6 0 \mathrm { \ k D a }$ ), SS-B/La, Scl-70, CENP-B and Jo-1.

Special condition for use statement The device is for prescription use only. Special instrument requirements

A microplate reader capable of measuring OD at $4 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and $6 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ is required.

# General Description of the New Device

The new device is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using microtiter plates as the solid phase. Plate wells each coated with 1 of 8 different ANA antigens are included to allow corresponding antibodies in the patient samples react with the immobilized antigens. The conjugate is rabbit anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which uses 3, 3'5, $5 '$ tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (TMB) as substrate. The kit contains a calibrator and a negative control. The kit also contains sample diluent, wash buffer concentrate and stop solution.

# Test Principle of the New Device

Varelisa ReCombi ANA Profile is an indirect noncompetitive enzyme immunoassay for the individual qualitative determination of dsDNA, U1 RNP (RNP $7 0 ~ \mathrm { k D a }$ , A, C), Sm (D), SS-A/Ro( $5 2 \ \mathrm { k D A }$ , $6 0 ~ \mathrm { k D A }$ ), SS-B/La, Scl-70, CENP-B and Jo-1 antibodies in serum or plasma. The wells of a microplate are coated with human recombinant antigens, synthetic peptides or plasmid DNA. Antibodies specific for the nuclear antigens present in a patient sample bind to these nuclear antigens.

In a second step the enzyme labeled second antibody (conjugate) binds to the antigen-antibody complex which leads to the formation of an enzyme labeled conjugate-antibody-antigen complex. The enzyme labeled antigen-antibody complex converts the added substrate to form a colored solution.

The rate of color formation from the chromogen is a function of the amount of conjugate complexed with the bound antibody and thus is proportional to the initial concentration of the respective antibodies in the patient sample.

# Device Comparison

# Varelisa ReCombi ANA Profile (Art No 12996) vs (Art No 18496)

The new device is developed as successor of the predicate device Varelisa ReCombi ANA Profile (Art No 12996). Both assays are indirect noncompetitive

# Varelisa $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ReCombi ANA Profile - New Device $\bf 5 1 0 ( k )$ Submission Section 9. Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

enzyme immunoassays for the qualitative determination of IgG antibodies against seven antinuclear proteins and dsDNA in serum and plasma. Both assays recommend the same sample dilutions and use identical reagents (including the conjugate). In accordance to the relevant scientific literature both assays state in the Intended Use, that the measuring of antinuclear antibodies provides aid in the diagnosis of SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis and CREST syndrome), MCTD (mixed connective tissue disease), SS (Sjögren's syndrome) and polymyositis/ dermatomyositis.

The difference between the assays is the use of a synthetic peptide derived from the human $\mathrm { S m D }$ protein instead of internally produced native $\mathrm { S m }$ antigen (complex consisting of $\mathrm { S m B B ^ { \prime } }$ and $\mathbb { S } \mathrm { m D } )$ purified from calf thymus. Further information on the synthetic $\operatorname { s m D }$ peptide is given in the submission of the quantitative assay Varelisa Sm Abs (K042629). For additional information of the customer an "Included Information Sheet" will be performed (see Chapter 4.5). Minor differences pertain to different volumes of the reagents.

# Varelisa Sm Abs (Art No 18296) vs ReCombi ANA Profile (Art No 18496)

The new device and the predicate device Varelisa Sm Abs, both are indirect noncompetitive enzyme immunoassays for the qualitative determination of $\mathrm { I g G }$ antibodies against $\mathrm { S m D }$ antigens. Both assays recommend the same sample dilutions and use identical reagents (including the conjugate). The solid phase strip used in the new devise is identical to the solid phase used in the predicate device. In accordance to the relevant scientific literature both assays state in the Intended Use, that the measuring of $\mathrm { S m D }$ antibodies in serum or plasma aids in the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

# Laboratory equivalence

The comparability of predicate devices and new device is supported by a data set including

results obtained within a comparison study analyzing positive, equivocal and negative sera.   
• results obtained for international reference sera.   
•results obtained for samples from apparently healthy subjects (normal population).

In summary, all available data support that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device and that the new device performs according to state-of-the-art expectations.

Dear Dr. Klugbauer:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
