# Description

Duet hs-CRP LIT kit is the ready-to-use reagent suitable for quantification of C-reactive protein by latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetry (LIT). Duck anti-CRP $\mathrm { I g Y } \left( \Delta \mathrm { F c } \right)$ is

coupled to polystyrene microparticles, which greatly increased the analytical sensitivity. When CRP of the sample encounters with the latex microparticles sensitized with duck anti-CRP IgY (∆Fc), agglutination among the latex microparticles occurs based on the antigen-antibody reaction. The agglutination increases the turbidity of the sample and the degree of agglutination is detected by the absorbance change at 570 nm. The value of the absorbance change is proportional to the CRP concentration of the sample and is recorded by a general chemistry autoanalyzer. Then, the actual CRP concentration of the sample is determined by interpolation of the calibration curve obtained by standard samples with known CRP concentrations.

Dear Mr. Chiou:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
