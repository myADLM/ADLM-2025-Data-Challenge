4. Special instrument Requirements: Roche Diagnostic Hitachi 911 Analyzer

# I. Device Description:

The Good Biotech Corp. Duet hs-CRP reagent consists of two wet reagents. Reagent 1 is a buffering solution and reagent 2 contains latex particles coated with anti-CRP duck monoclonal antibodies. Duck anti-CRP $\mathrm { I g Y }$ is purified from duck yolk. The host ducks selected for immunization are domestic stock and have been inoculated to prevent avian-associated diseases.

The Good Biotech Duet hs-CRP is a six level calibrator kit that is composed of stabilized human serum to which human C-reactive protein, preservatives and stabilizers have been added. The calibrator sets are prepared from human sera which were tested by FDA acceptable methods and found to be negative for HBsAg, antiHIV 1 and 2 antibodies, and anti-HCV antibody. The calibrator set is a combination of 2 previously cleared calibrator sets - k021882 and k021757. The controls used in this submission were previously cleared under k022725.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

# L. Test Principle:

When CRP in a sample encounters the latex microparticles sensitized with duck antiCRP $\mathrm { I g Y }$ , agglutination among the latex microparticles occurs based on the antigenantibody reaction. Agglutination increases and is detected by the absorbance change at $5 7 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The absorbance change is proportional to the CRP concentration of the sample and is recorded by an autoanalyzer. The actual CRP concentration of the sample is determined by the interpolation of the calibration curve obtained by standard samples with known CRP concentrations.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was conducted using three quality control materials (low, medium and high). Within-run precision was conducted by nalyzing each of the three controls in replicates of 20. Day-to-day recision was conducted for each of the three controls in triplicate for 10 days. The precision testing gave CV’s within $10 \%$ and the results are shown in the chart below.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was conducted with dilutions of a CRP standard that ranged from 1 to $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The assays were run in triplicate. The sponsors acceptance criteria is a $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ value greater than 0.95. The results showed that the Duet hs-CRP LIT assay was linear from 0- $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and revealed an equation   
$\mathrm { Y } { = } 2 0 0 . 4 7 \mathrm { X } + 1 . 2 3 0 8$ with a $\operatorname { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 7$ .

The sponsor also conducted a prozone hook effect study with the Duet hs-CRP LIT assay using serum samples with CRP concentrations (dilutions of a CRP standard) that ranged from 0 to $8 3 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . There was no prozone phenomenon observed up to 800 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ .

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

The calibrators that are used with the Duet hs-CRP LIT assay and are included with this submission are a merge of 2 previously cleared calibrators, K021882 (CRPex HS CRP Calibrator Set) and K021757 (CRPex BR CRP Calibrator Set). The Duet hs-CRP calibrator set is a six-level liquid calibrator set. Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Duet hsCRP Calibrator Set are actually 1, 4, 5 and 6 of the CRPex HS CRP calibrator set. Levels 5 and 6 of the of the Duet hs-CRP Calibrator Set are actually 4 and 5 of the CRPex BR CRP calibrator set.

d. Detection limit:

The detection limit was determined using the zero calibrator. The zero calibrator was run in replicates of 20 with the Duet hs-CRP LIT assay. The detection limit of $0 . 0 4 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP was calculated as 2 standard deviations above the mean response of the zero calibrator.

Ten serum samples containing low concentrations of CRP ranging in concentration from 0.1 to $0 . 5 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ were tested in replicates of ten. The percent CV was plotted as a function of analyte concentration and the CRP concentration $( 0 . 3 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ for which the CV was $20 \%$ was defined as the functional sensitivity.

e. Analytical specificity:

Hemoglobin (up to $8 0 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), bilirubin C and F (up to $4 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and lipemia (up to $1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ Liposyn) were found not to interfere with the assay. Interference was defined by the sponsor as recovery of more than $+ / - 5 \%$ of the initial measured value.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor conducted a method comparison study with the predicate device [(K-Assay CRP (3) assay)] with a total of 93 non traceable serum samples (64 of which fell in the high sensitivity range of 1 to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ . The samples ranged from 1 to $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

analysis:

Duet hs-CRP LIT Assay $\iota = 0 . 9 5 5 X + 0 . 9 3 8$ with a correlation coefficient of 0.998, where X is the predicate device for the entire 93 samples of CRP concentration ranging from $\mathrm { 1 - 2 0 0 m g / L }$ .

Duet hc-CRP LIT Assay $= 1 . 0 8 X + 0 . 2 2 6$ with a correlation coefficient of 0.996, where X is the predicate device for the 64 samples of CRP concentration ranging from $\mathrm { 0 { - } 1 0 \ m g / L }$ .

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable because this assay is to be used with serum samples only and should be collected in red top tubes without serum separator.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity: Not Applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable)

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor uses the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference material CRM 470 that states the reference range for CRP in serum of less than $5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The sponsor also states that the reference interval varies with populations studies and calibrators used and that individual laboratories should establish their own reference interval.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
