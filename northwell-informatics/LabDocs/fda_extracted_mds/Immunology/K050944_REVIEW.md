# L. Test Principle:

The $\mathbf { K - } \mathbf { \mathit { A S S } } \mathbf { \bar { A } } \mathbf { \mathit { Y } } ^ { \otimes }$ Ferritin (2) assay is a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. When a sample containing ferritin is mixed with the reagent 2 which is a suspension of latex particles sensitized with rabbit anti-human ferritin antibody, a clear agglutination occurs. This agglutination is measured by turbidimetry and is detected as an absorbance change, with the magnitude of the change being proportional to the quantity of ferritin in the sample. The actual concentration of ferritin is then determined by interpolation from a calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known ferritin concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

i. Precision:

Precision was performed on Hitachi 917 using three samples. The samples were low, medium and high controls (Immuno Q sera II from Denka Seiken, Japan). For calculating within-run precision, the samples were assayed twenty one times on the same day. For calculating betweenday precision, samples were assayed in duplicate over twenty different days. The precision study met the acceptance criteria for all three samples which was $< 7 \%$ CV.

The acceptance criteria for $\scriptstyle 1 0 - 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $5 1 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ are $\% C \mathrm { V } \leq 1 5 \%$ and $\leq 1 0 \%$ respectively.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed using serially diluted in-house controls made from spiked serum pool (Denka Seiken, Japan) with ferritin in low, medium and high range. The acceptance criteria for linearity $\mathrm { i s } \pm 1 0 \%$ of theoretical value and $\mathrm { R \geq } 0 . 9 9$

To calculate the ‘low range’ linearity, a sample with $9 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ferritin was diluted down to zero. The theoretical measurements of the different levels of dilutions were 88.2, 78.4, 68.6, 58.8, 49, 39.2, 29.4, 19.6, 9.8 and $0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The regression equation for this measurement is $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 8 5 8 \mathrm { x } { - } 0 . 0 5 9 1$ with an $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R = } 0 . 9 9 9 7$ .

To calculate the ‘medium range’ linearity, a sample with $6 3 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ferritin was diluted down to zero. The theoretical measurements of the different levels of dilutions were 567, 504, 441, 378, 315, 252, 189, 126, 63 and $0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . For this measurement, $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 8 8 8 \mathrm { x } + 3 . 1 8 1 8$ with an $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R = } 0 . 9 9 9 8$ .

To calculate the ‘high range’ linearity, a sample with $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ferritin was diluted down to zero. The theoretical measurements of the different levels of dilutions were 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 and $0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . For this measurement, $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 5 1 3 \mathrm { x } + 1 8 . 3 7 7$ with an $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R = } 0 . 9 9 9 3$ .

The linear assay range is from $2 – 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The reference standard for Ferritin calibrator is the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ WHO International reference Preparation Human Ferritin, established in 1984 (BIBSC code 80/602).

Calibrator: Secondary calibrators (In-house master standards) are produced from commercially available human ferritin prepared from human liver and value assigned to the WHO reference standard. The secondary calibrators are used to assign values to the product calibrators. The unopened calibrators are stable for one year from the date of manufacturing and Opened reagents are found to be stable for 2 months if tightly capped and stored at $2 { \cdot } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stability of the calibration curve is found to be at least 4 weeks.

d. Detection limit:

The lower limit of detection was determined by assaying the absorbance of serial dilutions of diluted Ferritin Calibrator A $\mathrm { 1 0 ~ n g / m L }$ Ferritin) with saline. The lower detection limit is claimed as $2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . This was found to be the lowest level of ferritin that had an absorbance range (mean $^ { + 2 }$ standard deviation (SD)) above the absorbance range (mean $+ 2$ SD) of saline. The 2 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ sample has a within run precision $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 )$ of $C \mathrm { V } = 2 . 9 \%$ . Using a clinical acceptance criteria of $C V \leq 2 0 \%$ at the lower limit of detection, the 2 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ lower limit of detection meets the clinical acceptance criteria.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was preformed by adding the interfering substances at highest concentration to the base serum. These preparations were diluted serially with saline. Ferritin was measured in these diluted samples and the percent recovery calculated based on ferritin concentration of the serum diluent. The acceptance criterion for the percent recovery is within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of serum diluent. Based on the acceptance criterion, no significant interference was found with hemoglobin up to $\mathrm { 1 0 4 0 ~ m g / d L }$ , bilirubin F up to $6 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , bilirubin C up to $6 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , intra-fat (which contains $10 \%$ soybean oil) up to $3 \%$ and intra-lipid (which contains $10 \%$ soybean oil, different manufacturer) up to $5 \%$ . No interference with rheumatoid factor (RF) up to $5 2 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . $f .$ Assay cut-off: No assay cut off was provided.

The required specification was R value $\geq 0 . 9 5$ . Linear regression analysis showed a slope of 0.89 ( $9 5 \%$ CI: 0.872 to 0.907) and an intercept of -9.4 $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ : -15.846 to - 2.96). The correlation coefficient was 0.9969.

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

Matrix comparison was generated for serum, EDTA and sodium heparin, with 20 samples. The samples covered a range from 7.5 to $1 6 1 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The required specification was R value $\geq 0 . 9 9$ . Linear regression analysis (serum vs. Na EDTA plasma) showed a slope of 0.989 and an intercept of 0.21 and the correlation coefficient was 0.997.
