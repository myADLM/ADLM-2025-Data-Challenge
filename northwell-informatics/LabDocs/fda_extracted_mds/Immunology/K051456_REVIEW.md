# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The determination of ceruloplasmin is based on the specific immunoturbidimetric reaction which occurs between the anti-ceruloplasmin polyclonal antiserum and its corresponding antigen under optimal pH conditions and in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The turbidity of the immune complex is proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision on the AEROSET system (within-run, between-run and total), was determined by analyzing three control levels in duplicate twice a day, over a period of 10 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 4 0 )$ using one reagent/calibrator lot and one operator. Precision on the ARCHITECT c8000 system (within-run, between-run and total), was determined by analyzing three control levels in 4 replicates twice a day, over a period of 5 days $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 4 0 )$ ) using one reagent/calibrator lot and one operator.

The following results are obtained:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed on an AEROSET $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System using a serum sample containing $1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of Ceruloplasmin diluted in physiologic saline at 6 different dilutions $( 1 0 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $80 \%$ , and $100 \%$ ). Each dilution was analyzed in quadruplicate. Data generated indicate acceptable linearity up to $1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , with a regression equation $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 2 0 4 1 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 7 7 8 6$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 \dot { 9 } 5$ . The claim for this assay is 2 to $1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

An additional linearity study was done on the ARCHITECT c8000 per the reviewer’s request but due to the lack of a highly concentrated sample, a serum sample with a concentration of $8 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was used. The spline calibration method was used which would linearize the response in absorbance of the reactive against the actual concentration. The serum sample was diluted in physiologic saline at10 different dilutions $( 5 \%$ , $10 \%$ , $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $60 \%$ , $70 \%$ , $80 \%$ , $90 \%$ , and $100 \%$ ). Each dilution was analyzed in triplicate. Median of the result was compared with the expected calculated value. $\%$ recovery of the median result found against the expected value must be within $10 \%$ $( 9 0 - 1 1 0 \% )$ ). The following results were obtained.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The traceability of the method is verified using CRM 470 (Certified Reference Material) from BCR (EC Community Bureau of Reference) corresponding to RPPHS (Reference Preparation for Protein in Human Serum) lot numbers 91/06 19. Once this lyophilized material is reconstituted, it is aliquoted and stored frozen at ${ } ^ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \mathrm { ~ \tiny ~ { ~ C ~ } ~ } }$ (master lot). The Sentinel Plasmaproteins Cal 3x value assignment is assessed by testing a new lot of calibrator with a master lot. In the assignment testing, five replicates per 3 runs are assessed for ceruloplasmin assay. The assigned value is calculated as the average of all replicates for the assay. Quality control materials are used to verify the assay performance at every step of the test.

d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity was determined on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 from 6 serial dilutions $( 2 . 5 \%$ , $5 \%$ , $10 \%$ , $1 5 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , and $50 \%$ ) of a sample containing $2 6 . 4 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ceruloplasmin with normal saline. Each dilution was tested over 20 replicates for the AEROSET and 10 replicates for the ARCHITECT $\mathbf { c 8 0 0 0 }$ . For immunoturbidimetric methods, the sensitivity represents the lowest measurable concentration of analyte that can be distinguished from the zero standard. Results showed sensitivity to be less than $1 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for both instruments. The claim for this assay is $2 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity: Interfering substances Interference testing was performed by spiking a sample containing ceruloplasmin. For each interfering substance, the sample was split in two aliquots, one spiked with a concentrated interfering substance and the other with normal saline. Each dilution was assayed in triplicate. %Recovery of spiked samples vs. non-spiked was calculated. An acceptance criterion is 100 $\pm 1 0 \%$ . No significant interference was observed in:

• Bilirubin up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Triglycerides up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Rheumatoid Factor up to $7 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$
