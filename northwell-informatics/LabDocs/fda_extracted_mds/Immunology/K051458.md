II. Description of Device: The Capture-PR3-ANCA test kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection and semi-quantitation of IgG antibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3) in human sera. The assay is used to detect antibodies in a single serum specimen. The results of the assay are to be used as an aid to the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. The assay is intended for use in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with WG. It is not intended for screening a healthy population.The analysis should be performed by trained laboratory professionals.

The wells of the microtiter strips are coated with monoclonal antibody to proteinase 3 and subsequently proteinase 3. During the first incubation, specific antibodies in diluted serum, will bind to the antigen coating.

The wells are then washed to remove unbound antibodies and other components. A conjugate of alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibodies to human $\mathbf { I g G }$ binds to the antibodies in the wells in this second incubation.

After a further washing step, detection of specific antibodies is obtained by incubation with substrate solution. The amount of bound antibodies correlates to the color intensity and is measured in terms of absorbance (optical density (OD)). The absorbance is then calculated against a calibrator curve and the results are given in arbitrary units.

III. Predicate Device The Capture PR-3 ANCA test is substantially equivalent to the PR-3 ANCA ELISA Kit.   
Equivalence is demonstrated by the following comparative results:

Table 1. Clinical sensitivity and specificity. A total of 295 frozen retrospective sera with clinical characterisation were assayed. The following table summarises the results

Dear Mr. Boteler:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
