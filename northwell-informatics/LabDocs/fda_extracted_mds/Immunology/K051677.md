Device Description

a.The OPTIGEN $\textcircled{8}$ Allergen-Specific IgE Assay is a solid phase in vitro test used for the semi quantitative determination of circulating allergen-specific IgE antibodies to multiple allergens simultaneously in human serum.

Intended Use

The OPTIGEN assay is an in vitro test, which provides a semi quantitative measurement of circulating allergen specific IgE antibodies in human serum. The OPTIGEN assay is intended to assist in the clinical diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergic disorders. This device is designed for use in clinical laboratories.

Summary of Testing

The OPTIGEN Allergen-Specific IgE assay is a modification of the CLA Allergen-Specific assay. The new device is comprised of three molded parts with a polystyrene solid phase, a serum volume requirement of $<$ 500 micro liters for up to 36 results, reduced number of reagents, a stability of 24 months and a single day assay.

The product modifications consist of:

1Several design changes not affecting the indications for use or the fundamental scientific technology.   
Several labeling changes, not affecting the indications for use, have been added for label clarity, to enhance the product use and to reflect the design modifications.   
3The product name has been changed from the CLA AllergenSpecific IgE Assay System to the OPTIGEN Allergen-Specific IgE Assay System.   
4Addition of new control sera to be used by customers in verifying allergen performance.   
5.The expiration dating has been extended to 24 months.

Three-performance comparison studies were done in France, Germany and the USA with the OPTIGEN Universal Panel 20, using the OPTIGEN Allergen-Specific IgE Assay System, tested in parallel with Pharmacia CAP system Specific IgE Assay, a commercially available assay. The three studies included a total of 1753 determination points for the 20 allergens in the panel. The comparison data shows that determination of specific IgE to 20 allergens with the OPTIGE Allergen-Specific IgE Assay is substantially equivalent to Pharmacia CAP Specific IgE Assay, the legally marketed predicate device.

Dear Dr. Zychlinsky:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
