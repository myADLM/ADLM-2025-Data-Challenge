# L. Test Principle:

This is an in vitro, prescription device to measure the amount of thyroid peroxidase antibodies in human serum. It is an electrochemiluminescence competitive assay. Patient samples and controls are incubated with anti-TPO antibodies labeled with a ruthenium complex. After addition of biotinylated TPO and streptavidin-coated microparticles, the anti-TPO antibodies in the sample compete with the ruthenium conjugated anti-TPO-Ab for the biotinylated TPO antigen. The immunocomplexes produced become bound to the solid phase via biotin-streptavidin interaction. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell buffer. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. The results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically generated by 2- point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent bar code.
