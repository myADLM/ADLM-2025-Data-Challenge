# Intended Use

The TECHLAB® ASCA-CHEK test is an ELISA for the qualitative detection of human anti-S. cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) in feces. The test result is used as an aid in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease in combination with clinical and other laboratory findings. FOR IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC USE.

# Device Description

The TECHLAB® ASCA-CHEK test is an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the measurement of human anti-S. cerevisiae antibodies in feces as an aid in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. The assay utilizes antigens of S. cerevisiae for capture and a polyvalent anti-human immunoglobulin conjugate. When human ASCA is present in the fecal specimen, the specific immunoglobulins bind to the S. cerevisiae antigens that are immobilized in the test well. Following this binding step, the polyvalent anti-human horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate binds to the ASCA and reacts with the substrate to produce a positive result. The measurement of fecal ASCA is an aid in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease within the setting of differentiating Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis. This noninvasive diagnostic method is simple to perform and requires only a fecal specimen for the analysis.

Based on these findings, we believe the ASCA-CHEK test is substantially equivalent to other diagnostic tests now used to evaluate patients suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease. Further, our results demonstrate that the ASCA-CHEK test is suitable as an in vitro diagnostic aid to help identify patients with Crohn's disease when assessing patients with chronic intestinal illnesses.
