# Name of Device

Trade/Proprietary Name: ARCHITECT® CA 19-9™M xR Assay

Common/Usual Name: CA 19-9 Assay

Classification Name:

System, Test, Carbohydrate Antigen (CA19-9), For Monitoring And Management Of Pancreatic Cancer

# Predicate Device

Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 RIA

# Device Description

The ARCHITECT CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 _ { X R }$ assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants in human serum or plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ .

In the first step, sample and 1116-NS-19-9 coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants present in the sample bind to the 1116-NS19-9 coated microparticles. After washing, 1116-NS-19-9 acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pretrigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT / System optics.

For additional information on system and assay technology, refer to the ARCHITECT System Operations Manual, Section 3.

# Intended Use

# Reagent Kit

The ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants in human serum or plasma on the ARCHITECT / System. The ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR assay is to be used as an aid in the management of pancreatic cancer patients in conjunction with other clinical methods.

Patients known to be genotypically negative for the Lewis blood group antigen will be unable to produce the CA 19-9 antigen even in the presence of malignant tissue. Phenotyping for the presence of the Lewis antigen may be insufficient to detect true Lewis antigen negative individuals. Even patients who are genotypically positive for the Lewis antigen may produce varving levels of CA 19-9 based on gene dosage effect.

# Calibrator Kit

The ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR Calibrators are for the calibration of the ARCHITECT / System when used for the quantitative determination of 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants in human serum or plasma. Refer to the ARCHITECT CA 19-9xr reagent package insert for additional information.

# Control Kit

The ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR Controls are for the estimation of test precision and the detection of systematic analytical deviations of the ARCHITECT i System (reagents, calibrators, and instrument), when used for the quantitative measurement of 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants in human serum or plasma. Refer to the ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR reagent package insert for additional information.

# Statement of Substantial Equivalence

The ARCHITECT CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 _ { X R }$ assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants in human serum or plasma on the ARCHITECT / System. The ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR assay is to be used as an aid in the management of pancreatic cancer patients in conjunction with other clinical methods.

Patients known to be genotypically negative for the Lewis blood group antigen wil be unable to produce the CA 19-9 antigen even in the presence of malignant tissue. Phenotyping for the presence of the Lewis antigen may be insufficient to detect true Lewis antigen negative individuals. Even patients who are genotypically positive for the Lewis antigen may produce varying levels of CA 19-9 based on gene dosage effect.

ARCHITECT CA 19-9 Assay kit is substantially equivalent to the Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 RIA. Both of the devices are IVD products and are indicated for the quantitative determination of CA 19-9 assay values (1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants) and used in conjunction with other clinical methods in the management of pancreatic cancer patients.

A comparison of the features of the ARCHITECT CA 19-9xr assay device and the Fujirebio Diaqnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 RIA follows.

# Summary of Performance characteristics

# Reproducibility:

Precision was determined as described in the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) Protocol EP5-A2. Six samples were tested consisting of two panels of pooled serum (panels 1 and 2), one panel of serum to which 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants were added (panel 3), and the ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR Controls, using two lots of reagents, in replicates of two, at two separate times per day, for 20 nonconsecutive days on two instruments. Each reagent lot used a single calibration curve throughout the study. The total precision was determined by calculating the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ values for each sample.

The total precision %CV of the ARCHITECT CA 19-9xr assay was determined to be less than or equal to $10 \%$ .

# Comparison Study

A total of 259 serum specimens were tested using the ARCHITECT CA 19-9xr assay and the Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 RIA. Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis was performed on all specimens (2.0 - 9115.7 U/mL for the ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR assay and $1 . 1 7 - 1 0 . 7 8 2 \ : \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ for the Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 RIA).

Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis comparing the ARCHITECT CA 19-9xR assay to the Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 RIA yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.96, a slope of 1.2 (99% confidence interval of 1.08, 1.37), and Y-axis intercept of -5.1 U/mL (99% confidence interval of -7.4, -3.4).

# Pancreatic Cancer Serial Specimens

This analysis is based on 74 patients. There were a total of 261 evaluable observations.   
The average number of observations per patient is 3.5.

The average age of the subjects at time of diagnosis was 61.8 years (Exact 95% Cl: 59.5 years to 64.1 years) with a range of 41 to 85 years. Fifty-five percent (55% or 41/74) of the 74 patients were men and the remaining forty-five percent (45% or 33/74) were women. Staging was available from the chart for 73 of the 74 patients. The majority of the patients were stage Ill and IV (41.9% and 40.5% respectively) while 4.1% and 6.8% were stage | and li respectively.

# Association between Change in Marker Value and Change in Disease State

A 2x2 table was constructed to show the association between a positive change in a patient's CA 19-9 value and progression of the disease from one observation to the next. A positive change in CA 19-9 is defined as an increase in the value that is at least 2.5 times greater than the total %CV of the test. For the test assay this value is 14.0%. The following Table (entitled "Distribution of W by V") presents the results for the 187 observation pairs in this study.

Three estimates of Concordance are given for the following Table.

Total Concordance: C = (16+98) / 187 = 114/187 = 61.0% Positive Concordance: $C _ { + } = 1 6 / 3 3 = 4 8 . 5 \%$ Negative Concordance: $C _ { \scriptscriptstyle - } = 9 8 / 1 5 4 = 6 3 . 6 \%$
