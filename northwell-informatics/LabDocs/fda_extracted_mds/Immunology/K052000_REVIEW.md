# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Special guidance “Guidance Document for the Submission of Tumor Associated Antigen premarket Notifications $( 5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } ) \mathrm { s } )$ to FDA”. CLSI guidelines include EP5-A (Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices), EP7-A (Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry Devices), EP9-A2 (Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples), EP6-P2 (Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods – Proposed Guideline), C28-A2 (How to Define and Determine reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory) and EP14-A (Evaluation of Matrix Effects).

# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT® CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } X R$ assay is a two-step immunoassay to determine the presence of 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants in human serum or plasma, using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ . In the first step of the assay, sample and anti-CA 19-9 coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. CA 19-9 reactive determinants present in the sample bind to the antiCA 19-9 coated microparticles. After washing, anti-CA 19-9 acridinium-labeled conjugate is added in the second step. After another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the quantity of CA 19-9 reactive determinants in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i$ optical system.

Study 2 – Four representative human serum pools spiked with various concentrations of CA 19-9 (50.06, 288.16, 719.38 and $6 7 7 . 2 6 \mathrm { U / m L }$ ) were tested in replicates of four, two runs per day for 13 nonconsecutive days on two instruments with two lots of reagents. The total $\% \mathrm { C V }$ ranged from $3 . 7 \%$ to $6 . 2 \%$ .

ii. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated according to CLIS EP6-P2. Aliquots of 10 human serum samples were spiked with CA 19-9 to concentrations within the assay dynamic range. Each sample was automatically diluted by the ARCHITECT instrument with wash buffer. The undiluted and diluted samples were assayed in duplicate and the percent recoveries determined. The expected value was obtained by dividing the undiluted observed value by a dilution factor. The average percent recovery of each sample ranged from $9 8 \%$ to $1 1 7 \%$ with a mean average of $10 5 \%$ . Acceptance criterion for mean recovery was $10 0 { \pm } 1 5 \%$ .

Auto-dilution verification was assessed by assaying aliquots of 10 human serum samples spiked with CA 19-9 to concentrations within the assay dynamic range and manually diluted 1:10 with the wash buffer. The undiluted and diluted samples were tested in replicates of two. The undiluted samples were also tested in replicates of two using the 1:10 auto-dilution protocol of the assay. The percent recoveries of the manual and auto-diluted samples were calculated and compared. The average recovery of the auto-dilution protocol to manual dilution was $93 \%$ .

Spike recovery – Aliquots of 10 normal human serum specimens with known endogenous CA 19-9 levels were spiked with various concentrations of CA 19-9 (124.2, 175.7, 629.9 and $8 8 4 . 7 \mathrm { U / m L }$ ) and assayed in duplicate. The percent recovery was calculated. The percent recoveries ranged from $94 \%$ to $12 8 \%$ and the mean recovery was $10 5 \%$ .

The assay measuring range is from $0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ to $1 2 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

iii. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

There is no known reference standard for CA 19-9. The ARCHITECT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } X R$ Calibrators were standardized against the Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 reference preparation. The ARCHITECT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } X R$ primary calibrators are manufactured gravimetrically by diluting the CA 19-9 antigen stock in Calibrator Standard Matrix and assayed

using the Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. CA $1 9  – 9 \mathbf { T M }$ RIA assay. The values were validated by a panel of patient serum samples on two lots of ARCHITECT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } \chi _ { R }$ reagent kit and three ARCHITECT instrument systems. The same panel was also tested on three lots of the Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. CA $1 9  – 9 ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ RIA kit.

# iv. Detection limit (functional sensitivity):

The minimal detectable dose (MDD) was determined by testing the ARCHITECT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } \chi _ { R }$ Calibrator A $\mathrm { ( 0 \ U / m L ) }$ in replicates of 10 followed by two replicates of ARCHITECT $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } X R$ Calibrator B $( 3 0 \mathrm { U / m L } )$ , on three instruments using two lots of calibrators and two lots of ARCHITECT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } X R$ reagents. The mean values and the standard deviations (SD) of the 18 sets of Calibrator A and the mean values of the 18 sets of Calibrator B were used to calculate the MDD for each run. $\mathrm { M D D } = [ ( 2 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { C a l A } } ) \mathrm { x } \mathrm { C o n c } _ { \mathrm { C a l B } } ] /$ (Mean RLUCalB – Mean $\mathrm { R L U } _ { \mathrm { C a l A } } )$ . Limit of detection (LOD) is defined as the lowest measurable CA 19-9 concentration that can be distinguish from zero and equal to $( \mathrm { M D D } + 2 \mathrm { S D } )$ . The mean LDL claim is $\leq 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

v. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous substances - Interference was determined by spiking a known amount of an interfering substance into serum samples supplemented with CA 19-9. Interfering substances tested included hemoglobin $( 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , bilirubin $( 2 2 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ ), triglycerides ${ 5 1 0 0 } \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ and total protein (10 $\mathrm { { g } / \mathrm { { d L } ) } }$ . Five samples were used for bilirubin, hemoglobin and triglycerides and four samples for total protein. Spiked and non-spiked samples were tested in duplicate and percent recoveries were calculated. Percent mean recoveries ranged from $91 \%$ for total protein to $102 \%$ for hemoglobin at the levels tested.

Pharmaceutical compounds – Interference was determined by spiking the following pharmaceutical compounds into serum samples and assayed: Leucovorin $1 1 . 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , Gemzar/Gemcitabine HCl $( 3 8 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , Streptozotocin/Zanosar $( 2 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , Doxorubicin $( 4 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Cyclophosphamide/Cytoxan $( 3 7 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), Cisplatin $( 5 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), 5- Flourouracil/Adrucil $\left( 3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } \right)$ ), Methotrexate/Amethopterin-Hydrate (91 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ , Tamoxifen $( 2 . 2 8 \ \mu \mathrm { g / d L } )$ ), Cytarabine $( 3 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ and Paclitaxel/Taxol $( 6 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . Spiked and non-spiked samples were tested in replicates and percent recoveries were calculated. At the concentrations tested, the percent mean recoveries ranged from $9 7 \%$ to $104 \%$ .

Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) - To assess interference due to HAMA, five HAMA positive samples and one normal sample were studied. Each sample was split into three aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with CA 19-9 antigen to achieve $3 5 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ while the second aliquot was spiked with the same volume of antigen to achieve $2 5 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ . The third aliquot was spiked with an equivalent volume of antigen free matrix and served as the control. All aliquots were run in duplicate in the same run. Percent recoveries were calculated and for the HAMA samples with $3 5 \mathrm { ~ U } / \mathrm { m L }$ CA 19-9, the $\%$ recovery ranged from $84 \%$ to $9 5 \%$ (mean $=$ $91 \%$ ) and for samples with $2 5 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ CA 19-9, the $\%$ recovery ranged from $74 \%$ to $104 \%$ (mean $= 9 4 \%$ ).

Rheumatoid factor (RF) - To assess interference due to RF, five RF positive samples and one normal sample were tested. Each sample was split into three aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with CA 19-9 antigen to achieve $3 5 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ while the second aliquot was spiked with the same volume of antigen to achieve $2 5 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ . The third aliquot was spiked with an equivalent volume of antigen free matrix and served the control. All aliquots were run in duplicate in the same run. Percent recoveries were calculated and recoveries for samples with $3 5 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ CA 19-9 ranged from $82 \%$ to $9 5 \%$ (mean $= 8 8 \%$ ) and for samples with $2 5 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ CA 19- $9 , \%$ recovery ranged from $74 \%$ to $104 \%$ (mean $= 9 9 \%$ ).

2. Comparison studies:

i. Method comparison with predicate device: Two hundred fifty nine serum samples were tested on the ARCHITECT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } X R$ assay and the Fujirebio CA 19-9™ RIA Assay. All samples with values outside the dynamic range of either assay were diluted per package inserts. Excluded from analysis were 41 samples with values below the limit of detection $( < 2 . 0 \mathrm { U / m L } )$ ) and 23 samples with values above the dynamic range even after auto dilution $\left( > 1 2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L } \right)$ ) of the ARCHITECT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CA $1 9 \mathrm { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } } X R$ assay. In addition, one sample with discrepant results on both assays and one with an invalid CV in the Fujirebio assay were excluded. The remaining 193 samples were analyzed by Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis. The CA 19-9 concentrations of the specimen as determined by the Fujirebio CA $1 9  – 9 ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ RIA ranged from 1.17 to $1 0 { , } 7 8 2 \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 61.8 years ranging from 41 to 85 years. Fifty-five percent were males and forty-five percent females. Majority of the patients $( 8 0 \% )$ were Caucasians, the remaining $20 \%$ consisted of African-Americans $( 1 1 \% )$ , Hispanics $( 8 \% )$ and Asians $( 1 \% )$ . Only $9 \%$ of the patients were current smokers, $51 \%$ were past smokers and $3 8 \%$ nonsmokers (smoking status of one patient was unknown). At the time of diagnosis, $30 \%$ of the patients had diabetes and $2 7 \%$ had other medical conditions. Of the diabetic patient subset, $64 \%$ were males.

Sixty-nine of the 74 patients had disease stage information: $4 . 3 4 \%$ were Stage I, $7 . 2 5 \%$ Stage II, $4 4 . 9 \%$ Stage III, and $4 3 . 5 \%$ stage IV. Ninety-five percent of the pancreatic tumors were adenocarcinomas with $65 \%$ involving the head of the pancreas. In addition, histology stratification showed that $1 3 . 5 1 \%$ were as well differentiated, $2 2 . 9 7 \%$ moderately differentiated, $5 . 4 1 \%$ poor to moderately differentiated, $1 2 . 1 6 \%$ poorly differentiated and $4 5 . 9 5 \%$ as other.

Changes in CA 19-9 concentrations and changes in disease state were analyzed on a per-visit basis. A significant change in CA 19-9 was defined as greater than $14 \%$ (2.5 times the total precision $\% C V$ ). The following tables show the association between CA 19-9 concentrations and disease status for the 187 evaluable observation pairs. The $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for the concordance statistics were based on General Estimable Equations and calculated using the GENMOD procedure of SAS.
