Identification of Predicate Device: Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies Assay (K983992) Nichols Advantage Chemiluminescence Tri-Level Controls (K972070;

# Intended Use of the Device:

ARCHITECT® Anti-Tg is a Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of the IgG class of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (anti-Tg) in human serum and plasma on the ARCHITECT i System.The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of thyroid disease.

The ARCHITECT® Anti-Tg Calibrators are for the calibration of the ARCHITECT® i System when used for the quantitative determination of IgG class of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (anti-Tg) in human serum and plasma.

The ARCHITECT® Anti-Tg Controls are for the estimation of test precision and the detection of systematic analytical deviations of the ARCHITECT® i System (reagents, calibrators and instrument) when used for the quantitative determination of the IgG class of thyroglobuln autoantibodies (anti-Tg) in human serum and plasma.

# Description of the Device:

The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of the IgG class of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (anti-Tg) in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex®.

In the first step, sample, assay diluent and Tg coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined and incubated.Anti-Tg present in the sample binds to the Tg coated microparticles.After washing. anti

# Confidential

human IgG acridinium labeled conjugate is added in the second step.Following another incubation and wash, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent recton ismeasured as relative light units (RLU).A direct relationship exists between he mount oiTg in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT / system optics.

# 8.4 Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The ARCHITECT® Anti-Tg and the Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies assays use a microparticle immunoassay method for the quantitative determination of Anti-Tg in human serum or plasma. Anti-microbial agent is used as a preservative for all reagent components (microparticles and conjugate) of the Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies assay as well as the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg.Both assays have magnetic microparticles as the solid support.The ARCHITECT® Anti-T and the Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies assays both use acridinium labeled conjugates to generate the chemiluminescent in the assay.

# 8.5 Summary of Non-Clinical Performance:

The ARCHITECT® Anti-Tg assay is substantially equivalent to the Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autntiodis assay inerms precision, lnearity, inteerences, and stability s demstrated in - clinical performance data in this $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ submission.

# 8.6 Summary Clinical Performance

The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay demonstrated substantially equivalent to the Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies Assay. The sample stability study evaluated ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay using Lithium Heparin and Serum Separator collection tubes.There was no systematic gain or loss o the delectability of Anti-Tg in serum or plasma samples under any of the storage conditions evaluated in this study. A method concordance using the NCCLS Standard (EP-12A) was also conducted with the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg and the Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies assays, and as a result, the two systems demonstrated substantial equivalence as indicated by clinical data in this 510(k) submission.

Dear Ms. Cameron:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.

Sincerely yours,
