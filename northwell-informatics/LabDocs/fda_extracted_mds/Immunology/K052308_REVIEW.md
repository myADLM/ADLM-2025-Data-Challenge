# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of the IgG class of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (anti-Tg) in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ . In the first step, sample, assay diluent and Tg coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined and incubated. Anti-Tg present in the sample binds to the Tg coated microparticles. After washing, anti-human IgG acridinium labeled conjugate is added in the second step. Following another incubation and wash, pretrigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of anti-Tg in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i ^ { * }$ system optics.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay was design to have an assay precision of $\leq$ $10 \%$ CV for samples $\geq 4 . 0$ IU/ml. ARCHITECT Anti-Tg positive control and four human panels (covering the analytical range) were assayed using three lots of reagents in replicates of two at two separate times per day for 20 days in 3 instruments $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ . Each reagent lot used a single calibration curve throughout the study. Samples concentrations are described below: Control $= \sim 1 5 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m l }$ Panel $1 = \sim 4 ~ \mathrm { { I U / m l } }$ Panel $2 = \sim 1 7 \mathrm { { I U } / \mathrm { { m l } } }$ Panel $5 = \sim 4 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m l }$ Panel $6 = \sim 7 5 0 \mathrm { \ : { I U } / \mathrm { { m l } } }$ The replicate measurements statistically determine the product’s precision of reproducibility and repeatability: total and within-run precision statistics for the assays label claim. The values for within-run $\%$ CV were $2 \% { - } 6 \%$ and for the Total $\%$ CV values were $2 . 8 \% 6 . 1 \%$ . The results indicated that all three reagent lots on each instrument performed within the acceptance criteria on assay precision of $\leq 1 0 \%$ CV.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Three high sample pools (1000, 300, and $3 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) were each combined with a low pool (ARCHITECT Anti-Tg Calibrator A) to prepare nine sets of test dilutions extending to 1/10th the starting concentration. All of these dilutions were analyzed with the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay using a single reagent lot. Based on this study, the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is linear between 3.0 and $1 0 0 0 . 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The ARCHITECT Anti-TG Calibrators are standardized to the NIBSC 65/093 reference preparation. The ARCHITECT Anti-TG Primary Reference Calibrator was produced by gravimetric dilutions of NIBSC 65/093. The Anti-Tg Stock Concentrate with an assigned NIBSC value is used to produce the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg Master Calibrator.

d. Detection limit:

The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is designed to have an analytical sensitivity of $\leq 1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The analytical sensitivity of the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay, defined as the concentration at two standard deviations above the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg Calibrator A $\mathrm { 0 . 0 \ I U / m L ) }$ was calculated to be 0.07 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ at the $9 5 \%$ level of confidence $\mathrm { n } { = } 4 8$ runs, 10 replicates of Calibrator A and 4 replicates of Calibrator B per run).

e. Analytical specificity: Interference Interference from elevated levels of bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglycerides, and total protein in the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is designed to be $\leq 1 5 \%$ at the levels indicated. Specimens with anti-Tg levels between 53.41 and $3 2 0 . 2 5 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ were supplemented with the potentially interfering compounds described below. The average amount of interference observed during the study ranged from $3 . 8 \%$ to $+ 1 . 7 \%$ .

\* Representative data; results in individual laboratories may vary from these data.

Potential interference from autoimmune disease specimens and high titer IgG samples in the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is designed to be $\leq 2 0 \%$ . In a study, the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay was evaluated by testing specimens with known autoimmune diseases and elevated IgG. Specimens were evaluated with anti-Tg levels spiked between 175.58 and $2 3 5 . 8 6 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . Mean absolute $\%$ interference is summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td>Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA)</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</td><td>2.1</td></tr><tr><td>Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM)</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Crohn&#x27;s Disease</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Multiple Sclerosis</td><td>3.6</td></tr><tr><td>Ulcerative Colitis</td><td>2.6</td></tr><tr><td>Hyperglobulinemia (high IgG)</td><td>4.5</td></tr></table>

\* Representative data; results in individual laboratories may vary from these data.

f. Assay cut-off:

A cut-off value of 4.11 was observed for ARCHITECT as established in the Normal Range Study.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: This specimen data $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 2 0 4 )$ ) along with data from 30 specimens above 1000 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ are the basis for the Concordance table summarized in the proposed Package Insert. The agreement between the new device and the predicate is $9 7 . 0 \%$ . The Concordance Table conveys the relationship between the ARCHITECT anti-Tg and the Nichols.

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

The new device and the predicate were compared using serum as the matrix.   
However, the new device can also use plasma.

Plasma samples were collected in different anticoagulants in either glass or plastic collection tubes (glass and plastic) and compared to matched serum samples from the same donor. Twenty-Two donors were evaluated in each of the nine listed tube types:

EDTA Glass Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube EDTA Plastic Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube Lithium Heparin Glass Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube Lithium Heparin Plastic Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube   
• Plasma Separator Lithium Heparin Glass Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube   
• Plasma Separator Lithium Heparin Plastic Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube Sodium Heparin Glass Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube Sodium Heparin Plastic Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube.

The mean percentage interference was less than $10 \%$ for all anticoagulant collection tube types when compared to glass serum tubes. The average absolute interference of the individual specimens across all anticoagulants ranged from 1.1 to $1 . 9 \%$ for all twenty-one-donor specimens within the assay range. One donor produced values that exceeded the upper end of the assay range $( > 1 0 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L ) }$ and was eliminated from further analysis. The actual interference with anticoagulants ranged from $- 5 . 1 \%$ to $4 . 0 \%$ for all 21 donor specimens within the assay range.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity: Two hundred and thirty four serum samples from individuals with Grave’s disease $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 5 )$ ) and Hashimoto’s disease $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 6 8 } )$ ), including 81 serum samples from apparently normal individuals were tested with both the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay and the Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies Assay. Using a cutoff of $4 . 1 1 \ \mathrm { I U / m l }$ for the ARCHITECT and $1 \ \mathrm { I U / m l }$ for the Nicholas Advantage, the following clinical sensitivities and specificities were found:

To determine the Clinical Specificity 81 serum samples from normal individuals were tested in the ARCHITECT. The results indicated that the Clinical Specificity of the ARCHITECT Anti- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathrm { T g }$ assay is $9 7 . 5 \%$ .

$b$ . Other clinical supportive data (when a. and $b$ . are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Same as assay cut-off.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Human serum specimens were collected from a population of 234 apparently healthy individuals. All specimens delivered TSH values within the normal reference range. Of this study population, 6 specimens delivered positive results on a commercially available anti-Tg assay device and were excluded from further analysis. The 97.5 percentile concentration of the remaining population was 4.11 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ . On the basis of this study population, the expected normal range is ${ < } 4 . 1 1$ $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ . A total of $9 7 . 8 \%$ (223/228) of the population gave values within this expected normal range. This normal range is suggested as a guideline and each laboratory should establish a normal range appropriate to their patient populations, giving due consideration to age, gender, geographical location and their clinical practice.
