# I. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

NCCLS Guideline EP9-A - Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples   
NCCLS Guideline EP5-A - Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices   
NCCLS Guideline EP6-A - Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods   
NCCLS Guideline EP7-A - Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry

# J. Test Principle:

Sample is mixed with the buffer solution and the anti-CRP antibody-coated beads. CRP in the sample binds the antibody-coated beads and agglutinates. The light scattering caused by an increase in particle size is measured. The amount of light scattering is proportional to the concentration of CRP in the sample.

# K. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Device imprecision was evaluated according to NCCLS EP5-A. Spiked serum samples were run in triplicate daily for 20 days (units $= { \mathfrak { m g } } / \mathrm { L } ,$

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The useable range of this device is $0 . 1 0 - 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ (the Limit of Quantification to the upper end of the linear range).

Linearity was assessed using a sample with CRP values of $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ . Using a serum pool free of CRP dilutions were prepared to create samples with theoretical concentrations from 40 to 400 mg/L in increments of 40 mg/L. A sample from a serum pool free from CRP was included for a zero concentration. These samples were run in duplicate and the actual mean values were compared to the theoretical values. The % recovery from 0 to $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ ranged from 97.5 to $1 0 2 . 7 \%$ .Results are summarized below (units $= { \mathfrak { m g } } / \mathrm { L }$

The acceptable criteria was $10 0 \% \pm 5 \%$

The results above indicate that the assay is linear across the measuring range of the assay

# c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

The device is calibrated by a set of 5 calibrators (sold separately) with targeted CRP concentrations of 3, 6, 30, 180 and $3 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ The calibrator is traceable to CRM470. A master calibrator is prepared and value assigned by multiple measurements of multiple lots using the device. The calibrators are traceable to this master calibrator and are value assigned using the device. Stability testing is described.

# d. Detection limit:

Analytical sensitivity, defined as the lowest concentration at which the assay performs with $^ { + 2 }$ SD as assessed by diluting a serum sample with a concentration of $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ to $0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and measuring the mAbs in replicates of 10. By this method, the functional sensitivity of this assay is said to be $0 . 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ (derived by extrapolation of plot of theoretical concentration vs. recovered concentration.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference of endogenous substances was evaluated by testing for the effect of hemoglobin (up to ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), ascorbic acid (up to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ , free bilirubin (up to 50 ${ \mathfrak { m g } } / { \mathrm { d L } } )$ , conjugated bilirubin (up to ${ \mathfrak { s o m g } } / \mathrm { d l } ,$ , lipid emulsion (up to 5000 turbidity), Rheumatoid factor (up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { \Pi } \mathbf { \pi } / \mathbf { m } \mathbf { L }$ ), and ascorbic acid (up to $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ on serum samples containing a nominal concentration of $3 . 7 \ : \mathrm { m g / L }$ . No interference was noted on any of the above. Interference was defined as a result $+ 1 . 5 \%$ of the control. This information is in the package insert.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable

# 2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Serum samples $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } ^ { = 9 8 } )$ ranging from 0.0 to $2 9 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ were measured using the Nanopia method and comparing those measurement to those made with the predicate method. Results are summarized below.

Serum Samples: Nanopi $\mathbf { \tau } _ { 1 } = 1 . 0 1 5 ( \mathrm { P r e d i c a t e } ) \cdot 0 . 0 3 4 9 ; \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 2$

b. Matrix comparison:

Paired samples of serum and EDTA plasma were collected concurrently from 50 individuals and measured using the Nanopia method. Results are summarized below:

$$
\mathbf { P } \mathbf { l } a \mathbf { s } \mathbf { m } a = 0 . 9 9 4 ( \mathrm { S e r u m } ) + 0 . 0 3 ; \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9
$$

Additional serum pools were spiked with $1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ of sodium citrate, $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m M } }$ sodium oxalate, $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EDTA, and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ of sodium heparin and assayed. There were no significant differences observed between sample types.

# 3. Clinical studies:

aClinical sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
C. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable): Not applicable   
4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable   
5. Expected values/Reference range: Less than $3 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# L. Conclusion:

Clinical Data concludes that the Nanopia Wide Range CRP assay has a similar intended use, a similar technological principle, and clinically acceptable performance comparable to similar devices currently in commercial distribution and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
