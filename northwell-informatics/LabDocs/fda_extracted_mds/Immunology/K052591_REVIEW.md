# L. Test Principle:

CRP present in serum reacts with anti-human CRP (mouse) monoclonal antibody-coated latex particles. The antigen-antibody reaction results in agglutination of the latex particles and is detected as an absorbance change at $5 7 8 \mathrm { n m }$ . The change in absorbance is proportional to the concentration of CRP in the sample when compared to a standard curve generated by the analysis of known CRP standards.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Serum pools were prepared and run in triplicate over 20 days to determine within run and run-to run precision using CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A protocol

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The usable range of this reagent is from 0.1 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Samples that exceed 400 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ should be diluted with saline and the analysis repeated with correction of the results for the dilution factor.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Calibrator value assignment to IFCC CRM470 and stability testing is described. Calibrators are of human source material, tested and found to be negative for Hepatitis B surface antigens, anti-Hepatitis C virus antibodies, and anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies with FDA approved assays.

d. Detection limit:

Limit of blank, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation was determined using CLSI/NCCLS EP-174. The limit of quantitation was $0 . 0 2 4 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The limit of blank and limit of detection were found to be 0.015 and $0 . 0 3 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , respectively.

e. Analytical specificity: Serum pools spiked with Bilirubin up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ lipid up to 2000 formazin turbidity units, ascorbic acid up to $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and rheumatoid factor up to $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ do not change from the unspiked serum by more than $3 \%$ . No hook effect was observed with concentrations up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Human anti-mouse antibody testing (HAMA) was not performed.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Wide Range Correlation Comparison of 98 serum samples analyzed using the Nanopia CRP on the Hitachi 917 with a commercially available assay using least squares regression analysis. These studies showed a full range $( 0 - 3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ) correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9992 with a regression equation $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 1 5 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 3 5$ where x was the predicate method and y was the Nanopia CRP.

Low Range Correlation   
Additional correlation with patient samples with CRP concentrations below 10 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ was compiled from 71 paired samples. At this low range recovery of the Nanopia CRP compared to the predicate demonstrated a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9981 and a regression equation of $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 5 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 4$ where x was the predicate method and y was the Nanopia CRP.
