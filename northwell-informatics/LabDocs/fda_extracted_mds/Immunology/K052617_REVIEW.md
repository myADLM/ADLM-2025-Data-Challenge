# L. Test Principle:

The GBF Ferritin LIT assay is a latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay to quantify ferritin in human serum. When ferritin in the sample is mixed with the latex microparticles sensitized with duck anti-ferritin IgY (ΔFc), agglutination among the latex microparticles occurs based on the antigen-antibody reaction. The agglutination increases the turbidity of the sample and the degree of agglutination is detected by the absorbance change at $5 7 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The value of the absorbance change is proportional to the ferritin concentration of the sample and is recorded by a general chemistry autoanalyzer. Then, the actual ferritin concentration of the sample is determined by interpolation of the calibration curve obtained by standard samples with known ferritin concentrations.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Total Precision and Within-run Precision: A precision study was performed on a Hitachi 717 using GBT kit. Test samples with the following ranges (Level I: $3 0 0 { - } 3 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Level II: 50-60 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and Level III: $1 5 { - } 3 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) were prepared by pooling different patient samples.

Total precision performance was assayed in all 3 pools in duplicates twice a day for 10 different days $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 6 0 )$ ). The acceptance criterion for precision was CV: $\leq 1 0 \%$ . The results are summarized in the table below.

Within-run precision performance was measured 15 times on the 3 level pools. The acceptance criterion for precision was CV: $\leq 1 0 \%$ . The results are summarized in the table below.

Additional precision testing was performed at the low end of the assay range using a pooled serum sample. The mean was $1 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , with a within-run $\%$ CV of $1 7 . 8 9 \%$ and a total $\%$ CV of $12 . 3 \%$ . The within run, between run and total $\%$ CV were calculated according to NCCLS protocol.

Inter-lot variability:

The consistency and reproducibility between 5 production lots was tested with three pools of patient samples with different ferritin concentrations (Low: 125 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Medium: $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and High: $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) were serially diluted (dilution fold of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1). All results fall within the acceptance criterion of $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { > } 0 . 9 9$ .

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was performed by diluting six high ferritin patient samples with ferritin concentration of about $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ using normal saline as diluent (dilution folds of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) to cover the assay range. GBC Ferritin LIT Assay was linear from 0 to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ with a slope $= 1 0 5 3 . 1$ , intercept $= - 2 9 . 5 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { v a l u e } = 0 . 9 9 7 \overline { { 9 } }$ .

The analytical range of Ferritin LIT Assay is $\mathsf { 5 - 1 0 0 0 \ n g / m L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The Ferritin Calibrator Set is standardized to the WHO Third International Standard 94/572.

Stability studies were performed and the shelf-life of the reagents was found to be stable for six months at $2 { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

The definition of the detection limit is the lowest value differentiated from zero. The concentration corresponding to a signal 2 SD above the mean for zero ferritin calibrator is $5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

i. Interference Interference is defined as when recovery is more than $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the initial value measured. No significant interference was found up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin C and bilirubin F. In addition, no significant hemolysis was found up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin and for lipemia (chyle), no significant interference was present up to 2940 turbidity.
