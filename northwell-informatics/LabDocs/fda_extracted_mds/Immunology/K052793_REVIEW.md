# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The gliadin antigen is covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP and reacts with specific antibodies in the patients diluted serum sample. After washing away non specific antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against IgA are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgA is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The response value is proportional to the amount of specific IgA present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the response for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Three samples with various concentration levels were assayed in 4 replicates with 3 lots of conjugate at 6 different times. The percents coefficient variations $( \% C V )$ within assay and between assays are summarized below:

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The assay reportable range is $\mathrm { 1 - 1 0 0 ~ m g / L }$

# Dilution Studies

The goal of the study was to test if sample concentrations are correctly measured after dilution in UniCAP Specific IgA when using UniCAP Specific IgA Conjugate containing monoclonal antibodies. Three samples were diluted $1 / 1 0 0$ and then further diluted 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16. Fifteen samples were diluted 1/100 and then further diluted 1:5.5. IgA/IgG diluent was used for the dilution. All dilutions were tested in 3 runs, in 3 replicates/run in UniCAP 100. Calibrators were run in 2 replicates/run. The $\mathrm { O / E }$ (obtained sample concentration/expected sample concentration) results were within the specification $( \leq 2 0 \% )$ . For dilutions 1:2 and 1:4 all three samples were within specifications. Seventy-four percent $( 7 4 \% )$ of the different dilutions, including the 1:5.5 dilutions, were within specifications $( 2 0 \% )$ . Values outside target value were obtained in the low concentration range. Since it is necessary to dilute samples with high titers only, the results are considered to be acceptable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The calibrators are traceable to the International Reference Preparation 67/86 for Human Serum Immunoglobulin A, G, and M from WHO.

d. Detection limit:

Three verification lots of UniCAP Specific IgA Conjugate and new monoclonal mouse anti-human IgA conjugate were tested. Each verification lot was tested with new conjugate in the same run. Calibrator $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and ImmunoCAP IgA/IgG calibrators were tested in 12 replicates with each conjugate. The detection limit was determined using the discriminatory ability (D). D was determined according to the formula:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \mathrm { \underline { { C a l i b r a t o r 0 . 0 1 - D i l u e n t } } = D } } \\ & { \mathrm { \sqrt { S ^ { 2 } _ { C a l i b r a t o r 0 . 0 1 } + S _ { \mathrm { \underline { { ~ D i l u e n t } } } } ^ { 2 } } } } \end{array}
$$

If D is ${ \ge } 2$ , the test is capable of discriminating $\mathrm { I g A / I g G }$ sample diluent from the calibrator $( 0 . 0 1 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ . Based on the test results the discrimination was significant between sample diluent and calibrator $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for all three lots. The detection limit for UniCAP Specific IgA is $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity: There was no detectable cross-reactivity with human serum immunoglobulins IgG, IgM or IgE at normal physiological levels.

$f .$ Assay cut-off: In a study with 100 healthy individuals, $90 \%$ had results ${ < } 1 . 6 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $9 5 \%$ had results ${ < } 2 . 2 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: One hundred eighty-two samples (90 celiac disease patients, 48 non celiac disease and 44 non atopic healthy blood donors) were tested with the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the polyclonal antibody (pAb) conjugates.

The anti-Gliadin antibody concentrations ranged from $\mathrm { 1 - 1 0 0 m g / L }$ . Sample concentrations of the two conjugates were compared and the linear regression analysis yielded results $( \mathrm { m A b } ) = 0 . 8 5 ( \mathrm { p A b } ) \cdot 0 . 3 7$ and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 5$ (see figure below)

![](images/e45f8880902975b7dd2edaa0f8a05ddf5b749980a120f859aa02dfc3df956342.jpg)

Since on average, the Gliadin specific IgA antibody results using the mAb conjugate were $30 \%$ lower than the present pAb conjugate the assay cut-off has to be adjusted to $2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ to be comparable to the predicate device. The comparison table below shows the results for samples tested with mAb specific IgA conjugate and the pAb conjugate in the predicate device using a cut-off of $3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for the predicate device and $2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for the modified assay. The $2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ is the specified cut-off for anti-Gliadin IgA in the ImmunoCAPTM/UniCAP Gliadin $\mathrm { I g A / I g G }$ and ImmunoCAPTM/UniCAP Specific IgA Package Inserts. The total agreement between the new mAb conjugate and the pAb was $9 1 . 2 \%$ .

Overall percent agreement is (166/182) $\mathrm { x } 1 0 0 = 9 1 . 2 \%$ Positive percent agreement is $( 7 1 / 7 8 ) \times 1 0 0 = 9 1 . 0 \%$ Negative percent agreement is (95/104) $\textrm { x } 1 0 0 = 9 1 . 3 \%$
