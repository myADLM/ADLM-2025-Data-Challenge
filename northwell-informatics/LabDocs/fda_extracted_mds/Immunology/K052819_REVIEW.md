# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The VITROS AAT Reagent is a dual chambered package containing ready to use liquids. Samples, calibrators, and controls are automatically diluted in saline from VITROS FS Diluent Pack 2 and mixed with Reagent 1 containing a polymer. Addition of antisera specific for human alpha 1-antitrypsin (Reagent 2) produces an immunochemical reaction yielding antigen/antibody complexes. The light scattering properties of the antigen/antibody complexes increase solution turbidity proportional to AAT concentration in the sample. The turbidity is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Once a calibration has been performed for each reagent lot, the AAT concentration in each unknown sample can be determined using the sorted calibration curve and the measured absorbance obtained in the assay of the sample

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Within-Day precision was determined using two runs per day with 2 replicates per run. Runs within-day were separated by at least two hours. Within-Lab precision was determined using a single lot of reagents with

one analyzer and four calibrators.

Additional testing around the low end of the analytical range was performed with 6 replicates per run for 3 days.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed by comparison of the measured with calculated analyte concentration of mixed pools, prepared at concentrations covering the entire assay range. The low pool had an estimated concentration of $2 5 . 8 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The high pool had an estimated concentration of $4 9 9 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Fifteen levels spanning the assay reportable range were created. Four determinations of each level and each of the three AAT Performance Verifiers were made. Results are shown below. Linearity was set at 30 to $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Reagent Lot 94-2051   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The values assigned to the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 99 for AAT are traceable to BAM-IRMM-LGC (Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und-prüfung/Institute for Reference Methods and Materials/Laboratory of the Gov’t Chemist) ERM-DA 470 Reference Material. A five level set of calibrators are prepared and are used to calibrate the Master Lot which is used to assign values to new product lots of the VITROS Chemistry Products AAT Reagent and VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 99.

Control values are assigned by running five VITROS Chemistry Systems in five different laboratories. Data was collected over 10 days, 2 runs/day and 2 replicates per run for each performance verifier.

Calibrator Kit Stability – Unopened kit are stable for six months when stored refrigerated at $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Opened vials are stable at ${ \le } 3$ days when stored capped between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Performance Verifiers Stability – Unopened kit are stable for six months when stored refrigerated at $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stability of opened vials stored capped between $2 ^ { \circ } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is up to 4 weeks.

d. Detection limit:

Detection limit was calculated by running 3 AAT samples with concentrations of 13.1, 15.0, and $1 6 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . LOD was determined for three reagent lots, run twice per day with 5 replicates per run over 3 days on two VITROS Chemistry systems for a total of 60 replicates. The mean and the standard deviation were calculated. The Detection Limit was found to be $1 7 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The lower end of the linear range was used to determine Limit of quantitation since the limit of detection was determined to be less than the low end of the linear range for all three lots. A limit of quantification is the smallest concentration of unknown that can be reliably be quantified by the instrumental method. The limit of quantitation is established at $3 0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .
