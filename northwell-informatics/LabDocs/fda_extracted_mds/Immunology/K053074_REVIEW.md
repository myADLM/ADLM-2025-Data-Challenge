K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None

# L. Test Principle:

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam o flight passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: No change.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: No change.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): No change.   
d. Detection limit:

No change.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference by endogenous substances:

Ceruloplasmin: Normal serum samples $( 0 . 1 7 5  – 0 . 4 3 \ \mathrm { g / L ) }$ were spiked with increasing concentrations of bilirubin, hemoglobin, and triglycerides. The percent recovery was determined for each sample relative to a reference sample $( \pm 2 0 \% )$ . No interference was seen up to: $0 . 6 \mathrm { g / L }$ bilirubin, $1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ hemoglobin, and $2 . 4 \ : \mathrm { g / L }$ triglycerides. Normal serum samples (0.258-0.466 $\mathbf { g } / \mathrm { L } )$ were compared to sera spiked with $5 \%$ of lithium, sodium, or ammonium heparin to determine potential interference by heparin anticoagulants for plasma samples. No interference was seen. Percent deviation $( \pm 7 \% )$ between the mean recoveries of the heparin types was (-)0.305 to $( + ) 0 . 3 8 6 \%$ .

Hemopexin: No data was provided for interference from bilirubin, hemoglobin, or triglycerides. Normal serum samples $( 0 . 8 2 \mathrm { - } 1 . 2 2 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ were compared to sera spiked with $5 \%$ of lithium, sodium, or ammonium heparin to determine potential interference by heparin anticoagulants for plasma samples. No interference was seen. Percent deviation $( \pm 7 \% )$ between the mean recoveries of the heparin types was (-)2.301 to $( - ) 0 . 9 0 7 \%$ .

$f .$ Assay cut-off: No change.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison:

Matrix comparison: Fresh and frozen serum and heparinized plasma samples covering the reportable range (1:20 dilutions, Ceruloplasmin: $0 . 0 7 { - } 2 . 2 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ ; Hemopexin: $0 . 2 \substack { - 6 . 4 \ \mathrm { g / L } }$ ) were compared to determine if any significant bias between matrices. The heparin samples were a mixture of heparin types, however since the percent deviation between the heparin types (see Interference studies above) was low, this was deemed acceptable.
