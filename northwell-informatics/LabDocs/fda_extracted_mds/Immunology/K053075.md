Identification of the Legally Marketed Device:

N Antisera to Human Transferrin— K972840

# 4. Device Description:

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard o known concentration.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

In vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative determination of transferrin in human serum, heparinized and EDTA plasma as well as transferrin in human urine by means of immunonephelometry on the BN Tm Systems.

# 6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The modified N Antisera to Human Transferrin assay is substantially equivalent to the N Antisera to Human Transferrin currently marketed (K972840). The modified N Antisera to Human Transferrin assay, like the current N Antisera to Human Transferrin assay, is intended for the quantitative determination of transferrin by means of immunonephelometry on the BN ™M Systems.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

To demonstrate equivalence in measurement between serum and heparinized or EDTA plasma, method comparisons were performed. The studies demonstrate equivalent performance with correlation coefficients between 0.96 and 0.98

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalcnce determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 -

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.

# Indications Statement

Device Name: N Antisera to Human Transferrin Assay

# Indications for Use:

In vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative determination of transferrin in human serum, heparinized and EDTA plasma, as well as transferrin in human urine by means of immunonephelometery on the BN Tm Systems. Measurement of transferrin levels aids in the diagnosis of malnutrition, acute inflammation, infection, and red blood cell disorders, such as iron deficiency anemia.
