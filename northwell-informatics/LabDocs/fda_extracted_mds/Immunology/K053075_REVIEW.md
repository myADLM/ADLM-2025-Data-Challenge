# H. Intended Use:

In vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative determination of transferrin and haptoglobin in human serum, heparinized and EDTA plasma, as well as transferrin in human urine by means of immunonephelometry on the BN™ systems.

In vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative determination of transferrin in human serum, heparinized and EDTA plasma, as well as transferrin in human urine by means of immunonephelometry on the $\mathbf { B N ^ { \mathrm { T M } } }$ Systems. Measurement of transferrin levels aids in the diagnosis of malnutrition, acute inflammation, infection, and red blood cell disorders, such as iron deficiency anemia.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements: For use on the Dade Behring BNII, BN 100, and BN Prospec analyzers,

previously cleared under k860894.

I. Device Description:

The device consists of one vial containing $2 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of N antiserum to human transferrin.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): N Antisera to Human Transferrin

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k972840

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None

# L. Test Principle:

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam o flight passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: No change. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: No change.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): No change.

d. Detection limit:

No change.

e. Analytical specificity: Interference by endogenous substances

Transferrin: Normal serum samples $( 2 . 1 4 \mathrm { - } 3 . 1 7 \mathrm { ~ g } / \mathrm { L } )$ were spiked with increasing concentrations of bilirubin, hemoglobin, and triglycerides. The percent recovery was determined for each sample relative to a reference sample $( \pm 2 0 \% )$ . No interference was seen up to: $0 . 6 \mathrm { g / L }$ bilirubin, $8 . 2 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ triglycerides and $1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ hemoglobin. Normal serum samples $( 2 . 1 7 { - } 2 . 9 4 ~ \mathrm { g / L } )$ were compared to sera spiked with $5 \%$ of lithium, sodium, or ammonium heparin to determine potential interference by heparin anticoagulants for plasma samples. No interference was seen. Percent deviation $( \pm 7 \% )$ between the mean recoveries of the heparin types was (-)1.06 to $( + ) 0 . 5 2 8 \%$ .

Haptoglobin: No data was provided for interference from bilirubin, hemoglobin, or triglycerides. Normal serum samples $( 0 . 6 { - } 2 . 1 1 ~ \mathrm { g / L } )$ were compared to sera spiked with $5 \%$ of lithium, sodium, or ammonium heparin to determine potential interference by heparin anticoagulants for plasma samples. No interference was seen. Percent deviation $( \pm 7 \% )$ between the mean recoveries of the heparin types was (-)1.59 to $( + ) 0 . 4 0 3 \%$ .

f. Assay cut-off: No change.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

Fresh and/or frozen serum and plasma samples, covering the reportable range (1:20 dilutions, Transferrin: $0 . 3 5 { - } 5 . 6 \mathrm { g / L }$ ; Haptoglobin: $0 . 2 6 { \cdot } 8 . 3 ~ \mathrm { g / L } $ ) were compared to determine if any significant bias existed between matrices. The heparin samples were a mixture of heparin types, however since the percent deviation between the heparin types (see Interference studies above) was low, this was deemed acceptable.
