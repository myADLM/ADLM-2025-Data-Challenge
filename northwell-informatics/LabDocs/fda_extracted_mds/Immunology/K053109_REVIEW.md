# L. Test Principle:

The CCRP method is a one step enzyme immunoassay based on the “sandwich” principle. Sample is incubated with chromium dioxide particles and a ß-galactosidase conjugate reagent; each coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the C-reactive protein molecule. A chrome particle/C-reactive protein/conjugate sandwich forms during the incubation period. Unbound conjugate is removed by magnetic separation and washing. After separation and washing, the particle/ C-reactive protein /conjugate sandwich is transferred to the cuvette where the sandwich bound ß-galactosidase is combined with the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG). ß-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ONPG to o-nitrophenol (ONP).

The change in absorbance due to the formation of ONP is directly proportional to the concentration of C-reactive protein present in the patient sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS (EP5- A2) Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices. Commercial controls and human serum and plasma pools were analyzed in duplicate, once a day, for 20 days. The within-run (repeatability) and total (within-lab) standard deviations were calculated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. Commercially available Bio-Rad Liquichek $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Lipid Controls were used. Human serum and plasma pools prepared and aliquoted by Dade Behring Inc. were used.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing mixtures of a high and low sample. Observed CRP values were plotted vs expected CRP values. A linear regression analysis was performed on the data and plotted. The observed linearity across the reportable range has a correlation coefficient of 0.997, slope of 0.989 and an intercept of -0.686. The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CCRP assay is linear across the claimed assay range claim of $0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ to $1 5 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$

To test recovery, an experiment was performed using the following protocol. Known amounts of CRP were added to human serum and plasma samples. CCRP concentrations on these samples were then measured and the calculated percent recovery ranged from $101 \%$ to $10 5 \%$ .

CRP results greater than $1 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ will generate an “Above Assay Range” test result message. According to the CCRP Instructions for Use, readings in excess of $1 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ may be repeated after diluting the sample with Purified Water to produce a sample concentration within the assay range. The resulting readout will then be multiplied by the dilution factor entered into the system to give the concentration of the undiluted sample. The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$

instrument also has the capability to “auto dilute” samples above the assay range by re-sampling with a reduced sample volume $( 2 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ resulting in a 1:6 dilution of the sample.

A parallelism experiment was performed to demonstrate the ability of the method to show a consistent linear dilution profile between its calibrator and test specimens.

The possibility of hook effect occurring when using the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CCRP assay was evaluated with samples above the assay range that ranged from 400 to $2 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . See the attached document entitled "Hook Effect".

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended reference material for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CCRP method is the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CCRP Calibrator (Cat. No. RC434). The assigned values of this product are standardized to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) International Reference Preparation for Plasma Proteins, the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The basis of this international standardization is the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference preparation for 14 human serum proteins (Lot No. 91/0619 $| = |$ CRM470 $\vDash$ RPPHS 91/0619) (lot V).

Subject of k053104

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity of the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CCRP method is $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The analytical sensitivity is defined as the mean value $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 0 )$ ) plus two standard deviations of the low level $1 ( 0 \mathrm { m g / L ) C C R P }$ Calibrator. The Lower Limit of Quantification (LoQ) or functional sensitivity of the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CCRP method is $0 . 1 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The functional sensitivity represents the lowest concentration with an observed $10 \%$ coefficient of variation.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed according to the CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP-7A. A summary of the substances that do not interfere with the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CCRP method when present in serum at the concentrations indicated can be found in the package insert. Inaccuracies (biases) due to these substances are less than $10 \%$ at a CRP level equivalent to $3 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L / m L }$ .

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CardioPhase $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (CCRP) assay has similar imprecision, known interferences, comparable calibrators, and similar intended uses to the predicate device, the CardioPhase $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CRP Reagent for the $\mathrm { B N @ }$ systems. The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CardioPhase $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (CCRP) Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge has the following statements regarding reference intervals in the package insert.

Expected values for healthy individuals as noted in the literature are typically ${ \le } 3$ $\mathrm { m g / L }$ . As CRP is a nonspecific indicator for a wide range of disease processes, and as the reference intervals are affected by many factors that may differ for each population studied, each laboratory should determine its own reference interval for CCRP as performed on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry system.
