# Device Name

Proprietary name: C-Reactive Protein (Latex) High Sensitive test system for COBAS Integra instruments [CRP (latex) HS]

Common name: hsCRP test system

Classification name: Cardiac C-reactive Protein, Antigen, Antiserum, and Control

# Predicate devices

The CRP (latex) HS Test System for COBAS Integra instruments is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Roche Tina-quant® CRP (latex) HS Test System cleared under K042485. For purposes of cardiac risk assessment, the CRP (latex) HS system is also equivalent to the Dade Behring N High Sensitivity CRP (K033908)

Device Description

The CRP (latex) HS Test System is a latex particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric test for the quantitative measurement of C-reactive protein in human serum or plasma. Human CRP agglutinates with latex particles coated with monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. The precipitate is determined turbidimetrically. The calibrator is the Calibrator for automated systems (C.f.a.s). Proteins; and the recommended control materials are CRP T Control N and Precinorm Protein.

# Intended use

The CRP (Latex) High Sensitive Immmunoturbidimetric assay is for the in vitrc quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human serum and plasma on Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Measurement of CRP is of use for the detection and evaluation of inflammatory disorders and associated diseases, infection and tissue injury. Highly sensitive measurement of CRP may also be used as an aid in the assessment of the risk of future coronary heart disease. When used as an adjunct to other laboratory evaluation methods of acute coronary syndromes, it may also be an additional independent indicator of recurrent event prognosis in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndrome.

Dear Ms. Ambrose:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
