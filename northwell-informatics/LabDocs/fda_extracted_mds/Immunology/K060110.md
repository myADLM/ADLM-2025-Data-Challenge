# Submitter's name, address, contact

The submitter of this premarket notification is Immunicon Corporation, 3401 Masons Mill Road, Suite 100, Huntingdon Valley, PA 19006. The official correspondent is Peter J Scott, Vice President of Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs (215-346-8251, fax 215-830-0751).

# Identification of the Device and Predicate

The subject of this summary of Safety and Effectiveness is the Immunicon CellTracks® Analyzer II. The predicate device is the Immunicon CellTracks Analyzer I K050145.The subject device, CellTracks Analyzer II, is intended for use in traditional Clinical laboratories and Research Institutions. The common and classification name for this instrument is an Immunomagnetic Circulating Cancer Cell Selection and Enumeration System.

# Intended Use

The Immunicon CellTracks Analyzer IIis a semi-automated fluorescence microscope used to enumerate fluorescently labeled cells that are immuno-magnetically selected and aligned. The system is for in vitro diagnostic use when used in tandem with specimen preparation equipment and reagents that are legally marketed for in vitro diagnostic use with this device.

# Device description

The CellTracks® Analyzer II is a semi-automated fluorescence microscope. The product consists of the CellTracks® Analyzer II, a dedicated computer loaded with CellTracks® software, monitor, keyboard and mouse.

The CellTracks Analyzer I is or analysi of rare cell that are iolate from biological fluids including whole blood. It is used in conjunction with the CellTracks® AutoPrep System, which automates, standardizes and optimizes the sample preparation with specific reagent kits.

The CellTracks Analyzer II is used in conjunction with the CellTracks AutoPrep System and in vitro diagnosticreagent kits that contain a feroflui-based capturereagent and moluorecent reagents r the detection and characterization of the captured cels.The ferrofluid reagent consists of nano-particles wh a magnetic core surrounded by a polymeric layer coated with antibodies targeting the cells of interest.Ae Immuomagneticcapture and enrichment, fluorescent reagents are added for identification and enumeration the target cells.

The processed reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks AutoPrep System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device. The strong magnetic field of the MagNest causes the maically-abe target cel tmoveothe srfce the artrigeThe CelTracks Analyzer I scans the en urfathe cartre wi s  fueen itershat e defie or he asayel from the filter are compiled and presented in a gallery format for final cell classification by the user.

# Technical Characteristics Summary

The changes to the CellTracks Analyzer II software architecture reside in the operating system (OS). The current CellTracks Analyzer II utilizing MS Windows XP has been changed to Mandrake Linux. The Operating system performs basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard, sending output to the display screen, keeping track of files and directories on the disk, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

This new operating system (Linux) is not compatible with the current Graphical User Interface (GUI). Therefore, we have developed a new Graphical User Interface (GUI). The Graphical User Interface is a program interface that uses a computer's graphics capabilities to make the program easier to use. Graphical interfces use a pointing device to select objects, including icons, menus, text boxes, etc. A GUI includes standard formats for representing text and graphics.This allows users to compile defined data in a manner moreusable t the eratorI ds not allow them t alter he basi el definitn, count  ge qul.

What has not changed with the OS replacement are: All the algorithms associated with image acquisition, analysi, cel selection, review, reporting and archiving; the logic and interace to the PC remain the same.

These modifiations of the CellTracks Analyzer I o not raise any new issues of safety orefectiveness.Th intended use of the device is the same.

# Discussion of testing

The sotware testing methodology for validating CellTracks Analyzer I (Linux) was developed and executed using GAMP 4 Guide for Validation of Automated Systems approach. Test scripts were developed using the sotware requirements specification (SRS) and the design documents (software and database) to ensure that the software addresses all system requirements and the design elements have satisfied the software requirements. In addition to testing against the requirement and design documents, fault testing was performedon the instrument to ensure the sotware responds to power interruptions in different areas  the hardware. A Trace Matrix was developed to trace requirements thru design and testing.

# Conclusion

The conclusion drawn from these studies is that the CellTracks Analyzer I is as safe and effective as the predicate device. No new issues of safety or effectiveness have been raised.

Dear Mr. Scott:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the devicc referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affcting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
