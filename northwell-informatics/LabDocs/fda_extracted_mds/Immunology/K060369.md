3. Identification of the Legally Marketed Device: Dade Behring CardioPhase hsCRP— K033908

# Dade Behring Inc. Stratus® CS Acute Care ™ CardioPhase® hsCRP 510(k) Notification

# Device Description:

The Stratus® CS Acute Care ™ CardioPhase® hsCRP method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

# Stratus® CS Acute Care ™ CardioPhase® hsCRP TestPak:

The Stratus® CS Acute Care ™ CardioPhase® hsCRP assay is an in vitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in lithium and sodium heparin plasma.In acute phase response, increased levels of a number o plasa proteins, including C-reactive protein, is observed.Measurement of CRP is useful feteionnevalation neininjuy aoy iore associated diseases. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements may be used as an independent risk marker for the identification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease Measurements of hsCRP, when used in conjunction with traditional cliical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events, in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.

Stratus® CS Acute Care™ CardioPhase® hsCRP CalPak:

The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ CardioPhase high sensitivity CRP Calibrator, is an in vitro diagnostic product intended to be used for calibration of the Acute Care ™ CardioPhase@ method on the Stratus® CS analyzer.

Stratus® CS Acute Care™ CardioPhase® hsCRP DilPak:

The Stratus S Acute are™ CardioPhase high sensitivity RP Dilution ak, is an in vidignostic product intended to beused in conjunction with the Acute r CardioPhase@ TestPak, for the measurement of samples with elevated levels of Creactive protein.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Stratus® CS Acute Care ™ CardioPhase® hsCRP assay is substantially equivalent to the Dade Behring CardioPhase® hsCRP assay (K033908). The Stratus® CS Acute Care ™ CardioPhase® hsCRP assay, like the Dade Behring CardioPhase® hsCRP assay is an in vitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP).

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The Stratus® CS Acute Care ™ CardioPhase® hsCRP assay was compared to the Dade Behring CardioPhase® hsCRP assay by evaluating 154 plasma samples with concentrations ranging from 0.20 to 48.05 mg/L. Regression analysis of the results yielded the following equations:

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device s classified see above) into either class ⅡI (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all theAct's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
