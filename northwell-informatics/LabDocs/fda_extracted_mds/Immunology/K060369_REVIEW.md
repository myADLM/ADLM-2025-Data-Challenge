2. Indication(s) for use:

# The Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP TestPak:

The Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP assay is an in vitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in lithium and sodium heparin plasma. In acute phase response, increased levels of a number of plasma proteins, including C-reactive protein, is observed. Measurement of CRP is useful for the detection and evaluation of infection, tissue injury, inflammatory disorders and associated diseases. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements may be used as an independent risk marker for the identification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease. Measurements of hsCRP, when used in conjunction with traditional laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events, in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.

# The Status CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP CalPak:

The Status CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product intended to be used for the calibration of the Acute Care CardioPhase method on the Stratus CS analyzer.

# The Status CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP DilPak:

The Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP Dilution Pak is an in vitro diagnostic product intended to be used in conjunction with the Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP Test Pack for measurement of samples with elevated levels of C-reactive protein.

# L. Test Principle:

The Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. In this procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the CCRP TestPak. This antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the CRP molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against the same antigenic site is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound CRP, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of CRP in the sample. The reaction rate can then be measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was performed using a protocol similar to CLSI EP5-A2 and included commercial controls, human sera with elevated CRP and a patient pool spiked with CRP. Specimens at each concentration (1.16, 2.28, 3.32, 16.59, and $3 9 . 3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ) were analyzed twice a day for 20 days. Repeatability ranged from $2 . 3 4 - 3 . 2 4 \%$ CV and within lab imprecision ranged from $3 . 0 1 { - } 4 . 7 5 \%$ CV.

Limit of Quantitation (Functional Sensitivity) was evaluated by determining the total imprecision of samples with very low concentrations of analyte. Three samples were tested in duplicate once per day for 20 days with one lot of reagents on two Stratus CS analyzers. The limit of quantitation corresponds to a coefficient of variation (CV) of $10 \%$ at a CRP concentration $\leq 0 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The assay range is 0.1 to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . An error code “High Fluorescence Error” will be displayed for samples exceeding the upper end of the reportable range. Linearity was evaluated by comparing the observed versus expected values obtained with the Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP method across the range of the assay. Three samples were tested in all. Two plasma samples with elevated concentrations of CRP (10 and $2 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ) were mixed with normal plasma with low CRP in different proportions. A third sample with CRP concentration $4 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ was mixed with saline buffer using a similar protocol. The observed results were within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected results for the samples tested.

High dose hook effect was evaluated by testing normal human plasma spiked with CRP at high concentrations exceeding the upper range of the assay (50 $\mathrm { { m g / L } ) }$ . No hook effect was seen with samples with CRP concentration up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

Accurate dilution was demonstrated for samples greater than $5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ using the Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP DilPak and the 1:5 automated dilution feature. Users are advised to manually dilute samples 1:10 with normal saline if the concentration still exceeds the upper range using the 1:5 automated dilution (samples greater than $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability and Value Assignment:

The Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP CalPak is traceable to reference material CRM 470 in the following value assignment scheme. First a six-level heparin plasma anchor pool is established using patient samples at CRP levels across the assay range. The anchor pool samples are assayed using the predicate device (CardioPhase hsCRP on the BN II system) which was standardized to the CRM 470. A “master pool” consisting of one calibration point with CRP concentration of ${ \sim } 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ is prepared from native CRP patient serum, standardized using the anchor pool. The Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP CalPak also has a concentration ${ \sim } 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ and is compared to the master pool to ensure lot to lot consistency. Additionally the CRM 470 reference material is assayed using the Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP method and is monitored over time to ensure recovery within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the target.

# Stability:

The sponsor provided real-time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria. Real time studies to support the shelf-life of the Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP TestPak, CalPak, and DilPak are ongoing. The labeling states that the Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP TestPak, CalPak, and DilPak are stable until the expiration date printed on

each box label when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . TestPaks, CalPaks and DilPaks are designed to be used only once.

d. Detection limit:

The Analytical Sensitivity was defined as the concentration that corresponds to two standard deviations above the mean of a sample containing no CRP. Twenty replicates of a protein-matrix calibrator $( 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ) were evaluated with the assay and resulted in an analytical sensitivity of ${ \sim } 0 . 0 5 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The product labeling claims an analytical sensitivity of $\leq 0 . 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

The potential for interference from endogenous and exogenous substances on the assay was evaluated by spiking plasma containing approximately $3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP with the appropriate concentration of the test substance and comparing the recovery of the test sample to that of a control sample. A difference in recovery between the test sample and control sample exceeding was $10 \%$ was considered interference by the sponsor.

Hemoglobin (up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin (up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), lipid (up to $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), cholesterol (up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), and IgM $( 9 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } )$ did not interfere with the test. Results for a panel of other substances tested, including over-the-counter and prescription drugs, can be found in the package insert.
