# Intended use of the device

The FiDiS'™ dsDNA kit is a semi-quantitative homogeneous fluorescent-based microparticles immunoaxsays using flow cytometry readings. lt is designed for the detection of antibodies directed against double stranded DNA (UsDNA).

The presence of those antibodies can be used to aid in the diagnosis of SLE.

# Description of the Device

The assay kits consisi of

- a vial of color-coded microspheres coupled with dsDNA - a ready to use anti-human IgG coupled to phycoerythrin. - a ready to use calibrator rittered for the specificity.   
- a positive conrol lgG to be diluted,   
- a negative control to be diluled,   
- a 10X concemtrated PBS-Tween.

RkCalibrators, positive and negative controls are diluled human ser

# 6.Summary of the technological characteristics of the device compared to the predicate device

The FiDIS™" System is a fully integrated and automated system for inumunodiagnostic resting.   
FIDIS™ System comprised of FIDIS flow cylometer. XYP platform for automatic sampling into the analyser, the analyzer itself, a SD pump, some assay products and a sof ware MLX-BOOSTER.

The FIDIS™H dsDNA kit resembles traditional ElA and alows the detection and identification of antibodies against dsDNA

I. IDiluted paticnt sera and microsphere suspension are thoroughly mixed in the 96 well microtiter plalc. dsDNA specific antibodies in the paticnt sera, if present, bind to the immobilised antigen on the bcads. Any unbound material is removed by performing a wash step.

2. Phycoerythrin-conjugated goal anti-human IgG is added to the plate and a further incubation performed. The conjugated anti-human IgGi binds to the dsDNA specific antibodies immobilised on the microsphere surtace to form an antigen/antibody complex

3. The bead suspcnsion is then analysed by the FiIDis'm Instrument and reactions are direuly calculated in biological units using specific data software (MLXBOOSTER)

The FlDls" Instrument is able to distinct the specific code-colored of the microsphere and it could associated the microsphere type with the individual tested antigen. The FiDis"" lostrument could quantify the fluorescence of the antibody captured by each microsphere. Measurement of the fluorescent signal from the inal reaction complex allows the quantification of the presence or absence of autoantibudies.

It's a simple (just two steps) and quick (2 x 30 minutes for the hvo incubations)

# 7.Testing

The comparability of predicate devices and new devices is supponted by a data ser including

results obtaincd within a comparison study analysing positive. cquivocal and negative sera   
results obtaincd for samples from apparently healtihy subject (normal population) resuls oblained for samples from samples with potcntial biological cross reactivity

# Conclusions

in conclusion, all available data support that the new devices, FiDIS" dsDNA kit is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Re: k060380 Trade/Device Name: FIDISTM dsDNA Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.5100 Regulation Name: Antinuclear antibody immunological test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: LSW Dated: January 30, 2006 Received: February 22, 2006

Dear Ms. Courivaud:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial cquivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ EPY premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
