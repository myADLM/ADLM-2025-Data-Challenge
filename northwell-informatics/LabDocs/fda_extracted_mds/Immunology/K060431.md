# 1. Identification of the Device:

Proprietary-Trade Name: Anti RNA Polymerase III ELISA Kit Classification Name/Product Codes: LJM Common/Usual Name: ELISA In-Vitro Diagnostic Kit

2. Equivalent legally marketed devices: K040200 MESACUP-2 TEST CENP-B, MBL International (formerly Rhigene), and K972145, HEP-2000 FLUORESCENT ANA-RO TEST SYSTEM, Immuno Concepts.

3. Indications for Use (intended use) $:$ The anti-RNA Polymerase III ELISA Kit is a semiquantitative, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti-RNA Polymerase III antibodies in human serum. The test result is used as an aid in the diagnosis of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) in conjunction with the clinical and other laboratory findings. The anti-RNA Polymerase III ELISA Kit is intended for in-vitro diagnostic use.

Description of the Device: This device is an aid to the diagnosis of SSc. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by microvascular damage and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. RNA polymerase(RNAP) I, II and III are major targets of autoantibody responses in SSc patients. Each RNAP catalyzes transcription of unique sets of genes: RNAP I transcribes ribosomal RNA genes, RNAP II transcribes all protein coding genes and several small nuclear RNA genes, and RNAP III transcribes genes that produce small stable RNAs including 5S and transfer RNAs. Anti-RNAP I and anti-RNAP III antibodies are almost always present together (anti-RNAP I/II), and some sera contain anti-RNAP II antibody as well. AntiRNAP I/III antibodies are the most common SSc related antibodies in white North American patients with SSc and is associated with diffuse cutaneous involvement, a high frequency of "renal crisis", and high mortality. In addition, it has been shown that some SSc sera contain autoantibodies recognizing RNAP II but not RNAP I or II. Antibodies to RNAP II are also present in sera from some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or overlap syndrome. PRINCIPLE: The anti-RNA Polymerase III ELISA Kit measures anti-RNAP III antibodies present in the serum by ELISA. Diluted Calibrators and patient serum are added to microwell coated with RNAP III antigens, allowing anti-RNAP III antibodies to react with the immobilized antigen (Sample incubation). After washing to remove any unbound serum proteins, horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti human IgG is added and incubated (Conjugate incubation). Following another washing step, the peroxidase substrate is added and incubated for an additional period of time (Substrate incubation). Acid solution is then added to each well to terminate the enzyme reaction and to stabilize the color development. The assay can be quantified by measuring the reaction photometrically and plotting the results.

5Safety and Effectiveness, comparison to predicate device. The results of clinical and nonclinical testing indicates that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate devices and methods.

# . Conclusion

After analyzing clinical and non-clinical testing data, it is the conclusion of MBL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION that the Anti RNA Polymerase III ELISA Kit is as safe and effective as the predicate devices, thus rendering it substantially equivalent to the predicate device. Performance characteristics were established in a clinical trial via comparison with a research method, Immunoprecipitation, AND K972145, HEP-2000 FLUORESCENT ANA-RO TEST SYSTEM.

Re: k060431 Trade/Device Name: MBL Anti-RNA Polymerase III ELISA Kit Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.5100 Regulation Name: Antinuclear antibody immunological system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: NYO Dated: February 16, 2006 Received: February 27, 2006

Dear Mr. Kamm:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
