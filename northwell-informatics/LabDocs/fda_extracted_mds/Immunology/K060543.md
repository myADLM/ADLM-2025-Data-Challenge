# Intended Use of the Device

The eSensor® Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Detection (CFCD) System is a device for the detection of carrier status for cystic fibrosis for all adult couples contemplating pregnancy, regardless of ethnicity. It is a qualitative genotyping assay that simultaneously detects mutations currently recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACMG/ACOG). The eSensor® CFCD System is not indicated for prenatal screening or for diagnostic purposes, and is for Rx only professional use within the confines of a licensed laboratory, as defined by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988.

# Device Description

The eSensor® Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Detection System is an in vitro diagnostic test for the detection and genotyping of a selected panel of 24 cystic fibrosis mutations from DNA isolated from human whole blood.

The CFCD System is a clinical multiplex genetic test system which includes reagents for polymerase chain reaction amplification, exonuclease digestion and hybridization of target DNA, instrumentation and software. The CFCD System uses electrochemical detection to determine the carrier status of patient blood specimens for the ACOG/ACMG recommended panel of 24 cystic fibrosis mutations. Sample preparation for genotyping involves converting each blood specimen into purified genomic DNA (gDNA); then using multiplex PCR amplification followed by exonuclease digestion to convert the gDNA into a set of single-stranded targets. The genotyping reaction is set up with the combination of the single-stranded targets with appropriate buffers containing allele-specific signal probes differentially labeled with electrochemical signaling molecules, called ferrocenes. This mixture is then loaded into cartridges that contain single-stranded capture probes bound to an array of electrodes, with each electrode containing capture probes specific for a single mutation. Cartridges are inserted into the eSensor\* 4800 Instrument where the single-stranded targets hybridize to the complementary sequences of the capture probes and signal probes. Detection of the target/probe complexes is achieved using alternating current voltammetry that generates specific electrical signals from the hybridized signal probes. The eSensor® DNA Detection System Application Software then classifies the signals from each mutation and generates a report for each specimen that describes the carrier or non-carrier status of each of the cystic fibrosis panel mutations.

# 6Performance Characteristics:

# Input DNA Requirements:

Samples containing $1 0 \Im \mathbf { g }$ gDNA were tested in the CFCD System. Out of the total of 96 tests, $9 9 . 0 \%$ gave complete and accurate results, with a lower one-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence bound of $9 5 . 1 \%$ Samples containing up to 1,200 ng DNA were tested in method comparison studies and gave accurate results in the CFCD System as compared to DNA sequencing.

# Method Comparison:

Per sample: In Clinical Trial Method Comparison studies, 486 samples of freshly collected and banked samples were analyzed using the CFCD System and DNA sequencing. The overall agreement of the CFCD System compared to sequencing was 98.8% (479/486). Omitting samples which failed to give a valid call, agreement between the CFCD System and DNA sequencing was $9 9 . 6 \%$ (479/481).

Per mutation: Sequencing results were not obtained for 5/7/9T in one sample (an R117H non-carrier). Therefore, using the same data compiled for the per sample calculation above, 11,663 $( 4 8 6 \times 2 4 \cdot 1 )$ iniualmutatis were analyzeThe overall agreement of the CFCD System compared to DNA sequencing was 98.9% (11,540/11,663). Omitting samples which failed to give a valid result, agreement between the CFCD System and DNA sequencing was 99.97% (11,540/1 1,543).

# Interfering Substances:

The following interfering substances were added separately to whole blood at the concentrations indicated, and no effect was observed on yield of extracted DNA, multiplex amplification of CFTR gene sequences, or genotyping of mutations in the CF carrier panel: triglycerides (3,000 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (70 mg/dL), cholesterol (250 mg/dL), bile salts (a mixture of cholate and deoxycholate; 6.4 μg/mL), human albumin (3 g/dL), human immunoglobulin G (3 g/dL), acetaminophen (30 μg/mL), ascorbic acid (30 μg/mL), diphenylhydantoin (phenytoin; 20 μg/mL), gentamicin (12 µg/mL), N-acetylsalicylic acid (200 μg/mL), nicotine (100 μg/mL), theophylline (20 μg/mL), valproic acid (100 ug/mL), vancomycin (100 μg/mL), NaCl (150 mM), KCl (5 mM), CaCl2 (1.08 mM), FeCl3 (9.25 μM).

# Interfering Mutations:

ΔF508 reflex tests: DNA samples containing the non-disease causing polymorphisms I506V, I507V, and F508C, recommended for testing by the ACMG and ACOG in the event of unexpected homozygosity of ΔF508, have been tested internally with the CFCD System and found to genotype as non-carriers for both ΔF508 and ΔI507. The presence of the F508C polymorphism and the AF508 mutation in the same sample did not affect the identification of this sample as a ΔF508 carrier.

Samples heterozygous for the non-panel mutation 2183AA>G are genotyped as carriers for the panel mutation 2184delA. Samples heterozygous for the non-panel mutation R117L will give a "no-call" result for panel mutation R117H.

# Reproducibility:

Reproducibility of the CFCD System was determined by testing genomic DNA samples from one non-carrier cell line and 20 carrier cell lines which together expressed all 23 panel mutations. Testing was performed at three sites with three lots of CFCD Assay Kits. Each panel of 21 cell line DNA samples was tested on separate days (5 days per kit lot per site). After re-testing of no-call results, overall per-sample agreement was 99.8%, with a no-call rate of 0.1% and a contradictory call rate of 0.1%. Overall per-mutation agreement was 99.9%, with a no-call rate of 0.1% and a contradictory call rate of $0 . 0 0 8 \%$ .

# System Failure:

The first-pass no-call rate observed with the CFCD System in the Clinical Trial Method Comparison study of 486 samples was 3.3%, which was reduced to 1.0% after no more than 2 repeat tests for those samples which gave no-call results.

# 7. Conclusions

The eSensor® Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Detection System accurately identifies a selected panel of mutations in the CFTR gene from genomic DNA isolated from human whole blood.
