# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) is a two stage procedure using agarose gel high resolution electrophoresis in the first stage and immunoprecipitation in the second. In the second stage, the soluble antigen and antibody are allowed to react. The resultant antigen-antibody complex(es) may become insoluble (as long as the antibody is in slight excess or near equivalency) and precipitate. The precipitation rate depends on the proportion of the reactants, temperature, salt concentration and the pH of the solution. After immunofixation, the slide is washed to remove any excess soluble proteins. The separated complexes are then stained to visualize the bands.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: An abnormal control was run in replicate on each of 4 gel types. The abnormal control contains an IgM Kappa. Visual examination indicated the precision is $100 \%$ positive with total agreement on each plate size. No false negative or positive were observed.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods) No information was provided for traceability. The antisera is stable until expiration date indicated on the vial when

stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $d .$ . Detection limit:

The smallest amount of monoclonal bands detectable with the   
Pentavalent system was determined. Three known samples, IgG kappa $\mathrm { 3 5 0 0 m g / d L }$ , IgA kappa $\mathrm { 1 8 0 0 ~ m g / d L ) }$ , and $\mathrm { I g M }$ lambda ( $6 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ were used. Serial dilutions were prepared and samples were easily seen through the twelfth dilution (1:2048) giving detection limit as follows: IgG and kappa $= 1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
$\mathrm { I g M }$ and kappa $= 0 . 9 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
IgA and lambda $= 3 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

Since the Pentavalent antisera appear to capture only the gamma region, the sponsor was asked to explain how the antisera can routinely detect an IgA and M protein which could migrate in the Beta region. Two properly labeled examples were submitted to show bands in the Beta region. Since the antisera cover the entire pattern area, it will react with appropriate bands in any region of the pattern.

No data was submitted for Interference study. A statement has been added to the Limitations section of the package insert to indicate that testing had not been done for cross-reacting and interference substances.

f. Assay cut-off: Not provided.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Sixty serum samples, 15 normal and 45 abnormal, were run with the Pentavalent Antisera kit and the predicate device SPIFE kits. The samples are provided to Helena Labs from hospital labs with no patient demographics. The abnormal specimens demonstrated monoclonal and polyclonal patterns with both methods whereas the normal specimens were exclusively polyclonal. All of the specimens screened with the Pentavalent Antisera and determined positive were then identified with the G, A, M, K and L monospecific antisera in the SPIFE kits. The device demonstrated $100 \%$ agreement with the predicate device in identifying band patterns. Artifacts were observed in the 15 normal patient, samples 4 through 15 in the P9 slide and samples 1, 2, 4, and 7 in P6 slide. The sponsor claimed these bands are split beta or an application phenomenon that occurs at the application site. It does not interfere with pattern interpretation. This information was in the interpretation section of the package insert   
b. Matrix comparison: Serum is the only recommended matrix.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable   
4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable   
5. Expected values/Reference range: Normal samples do not contain monoclonal components.   
N. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.   
O. Conclusion: The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
