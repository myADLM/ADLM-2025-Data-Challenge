# Description:

All the reagents, controls and calibrators included in this submission are for use on the ABX PENTRA 400 (K052007), which is a discrete photometric benchtop clinical chemistry analyzer.

The ABX PENTRA CRP CP is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein in human serum and plasma based on an immunoturbidimetric test. The assay is composed of a bi-reagent cassette, with $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ E and $2 3 . 5 \mathrm { m l }$ compartments. Reagents are chemical solutions with additives.

The ABX PENTRA CRP Cal is a liquid human serum calibrator with chemical additives. It has 5 levels to be used for the calibration of the crp assay. The assigned values are given on the calibrator vials. This calibrator is provided in five vials of $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ .

The ABX PENTRA Immuno I Control L/H is a lyophilized two-level quality control product consisting of human serum. The assigned values of the control components are given in the enclosed annex, ensuring control of the appropriate HORIBA ABX methods on the ABX PENTRA 400 analyzer. Each level of control is provided in one vials of 3 ml.

The ABX PENTRA Low CRP Control is a liquid assayed control prepared by diluting crp at low concentration in human serum. It has to be used for the quality control of low levels measured with the crp assay. The assigned value is given in the enclosed annex. This control is provided in four vials of $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$

The ABX PENTRA Clean-Chem CP and ABX PENTRA Clean-Chem $\mathfrak { g g } \mathbf { \Lambda } _ { \mathbf { C P } }$ are ready-to-use chemical cleaning solutions for use on the ABX Pentra 400 system. They are respectively provided in mono-reagent $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ and $4 \times 9 9 \mathrm { m l }$ cassettes.

# Intended Use :

The reagent in this submission is intended for use on the ABX PENTRA 400 for the quantitative in-vitro determination of conventional range crp using human serum and plasma.

The controls, calibrators and additional reagents are intended for use in association with the above reagent.

Dear Mr. Lawton:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
