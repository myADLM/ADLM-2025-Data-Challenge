4. Device Description:

# Dimension Vista ™ IGA Flex® reagent cartridge

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a calibrator of known concentration.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 1 Calibrator

Protein 1 Calibrator is a liquid, human serum based product containing Immunoglobulin A and Immunoglobulin G.

# Dimension Vista T™ Protein 1 Controls L/M/H

Protein Controls L, M and H are multi-analyte, liquid human serum based product containing Immunoglobulin A and Immunoglobulin G.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

Dimension Vista ™ IgA Flex® Reagent Cartridge:

The igA method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of Measurements of IgA aid in the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body's lack of ability to resist infectious agents.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 1 Calibrator:

The PROT1 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of Immunoglobulin A (IGA) and Immunoglobulin G (IGG) methods on the Dimension Vista System.

Dimension Vista ™ Protein 1 Control L/M/H:

For use as an assayed intralaboratory quality control for assessment of precision and analytical bias in the determination of Immunoglobulin A (IGA) and immunoglobulin G (IGG) on the Dimension Vista™ System.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Dimension Vista™ IGA reagent cartridge, Dimension Vista™ Protein 1 Calibrator (K051087) and Dimension Vista™m Protein 1 Control L/M/H (K051087) are substantially equivalent to the Dade Behring N Antisera to Human IgA assay (K042735), N Protein Standard SL (K012470) and N/T Protein Control SL (K012468) respectively. The Dimension Vista™ IGA assay, like the N Antisera to Human IgA assay is an invitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative measurement of Immunoglobulin A in human serum and plasma.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The Dimension Vista™ IgA assay was compared to N Antiserum to Human IgA on the BN ProSpec® System by evaluating 50 serum and 50 plasma samples with concentrations ranging from 0.276 to $6 . 8 6 4 ~ 9 1 L$ Regression analysis of these results yielded the following equations:

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Scction 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially cquivalent (for the indications for use stated in the cnclosure) to legally marketed predicate deviccs marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labcling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA). it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your devicc can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements. including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807): labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
