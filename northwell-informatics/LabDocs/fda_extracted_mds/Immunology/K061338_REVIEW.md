# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical   
Devices: EP5-A2   
CLSI EP7-A, Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry

L. Test Principle:

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision testing was done in accordance with CLSI Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Devices: EP5-A. Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days. The within-run and total standard deviations (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ were calculated by the analysis of variance method. Additional testing covering the low and high end of the reportable range was performed. The data are summarized below

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity testing was performed on the Dimension $\mathrm { V I S T A @ }$ System using a serum sample containing $9 . 3 2 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ of IgA. The sample was serially diluted 12 times. Each dilution was tested in replicates of five and percent recovery calculated. All dilutions met the acceptance criterion of 80 to $120 \%$ .

The linear regression was calculated. The acceptance criteria of slope between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation coefficient ${ \ge } 0 . 9 5$ were met. Data showed a regression equation $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 6 1 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 3 8 ,$ $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 }$ of 0.9975.

Linearity was observed at 0.21 to $9 . 3 2 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ . Reportable range for the device was set at 0.25 to $7 . 5 \mathrm { g / L }$ .

# Prozone effect

The possibility of Prozone effect occurring when using the device was evaluated with a serum sample above the assay range. The sample was analyzed on both the BN Prospec System and the Dimension Vista instrument, indicating no hook effect up to $3 5 . 8 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The reference material is the IFCC/BCR/CAP CRM 470. Master Calibrator concentrated human serum pool was assayed vs. CRM 470. Commercial Calibrator Lot was prepared from human serum pool at target concentrations and assayed against the master lot.

Stability studies were performed and the following conclusions were obtained:

On-Board Instrument Stability of opened product a. The Immunoglobulin A Flex reagent cartridge are stable on –board the instrument for 21 days. b. PROT1 CAL is stable for 9 days. c. Controls are stable for 14 days.

Study duration is labeled product shelf life plus one month. 24 months shelf life requires testing a minimum of 1 month past 24 months. Product is stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ throughout the testing cycle and tested on day 0 and after 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 25 months.

d. Detection limit:

Detection limit $( 0 . 2 5 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ represents the lower limit of the reportable range of IgA.

The analytical sensitivity of the assay represents the lowest concentration of IgA that can be distinguished from zero. This is defined as the mean value $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 0 )$ ) plus two standard deviations of the low level 1 (1:200 dilution) using PROT1 CAL and system diluent. This was found to be $0 . 0 4 3 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Interference testing was performed using guidance supplied by CLSI EP7-A, “Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry”. No significant interference was observed in:

• Hemoglobin up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
• Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
• Triglycerides up to $7 0 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Rheumatoid Factor interference is below $10 \%$ up to $6 . 8 2 0 \ \mathrm { g / L }$

No cross-reactivity studies have been conducted with heterophile antibodies.

Non Interfering Substance section of the package insert provides a list of drugs and other exogenous substances that do not interfere with the assay.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The reported expected range for Immunoglobulin A in adults $( 0 . 7 - 4 . 0 \ : \mathrm { g / L ) }$ is from a literature:   
Dati F. Schumann G,Thomas L, et al. Consensus of a Group of Professional Societies and Diagnostic Companies on Guidelines for Interim Reference Ranges for 14 Proteins in Serum base on the Standardization against the IFCC/BCR/CAP Reference Material (CRM 470). Eur J Clin Chem Biochem 34:517-520, 1996.

During childhood and adolescence, reference ranges for IgA are dependent on age and can vary over a wide range.

Each laboratory should establish its own normal ranges since values may differ depending on the population studied.
