# Device Description

The Access TPO Antibody reagents, calibrators, and the Access Immunoassay Analyzers (Access, Access 2, Synchron LXi 725, UniCel DxC 600i, and UniCel Dxl 800) comprise the Access Immunoassay Systems for the determination of thyroperoxydase antibody (TPOAb) levels in human serum and plasma.

# Intended Use

The Access TPO Antibody assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of thyroperoxydase antibody (TPOAb) levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. The detection of TPO antibodies is an aid in the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disorders.

# Summary of Analytical Studies

Imprecision: Imprecision was tested for concentrations from approximately 0.6 to 809 IU/mL. The within run imprecision ranged from 2.6% CV to 7.9% CV. Between-run assay imprecision ranged from 1.3% CV to 4.9% CV. Total imprecision ranged from 3.1% CV to 8.7% CV.

Dilution Recovery (Linearity): Multiple dilutions of serum samples were analyzed. Mean % recovery ranged from 86.4% to 94.9%. The following statement has been added to the TPOAb directional insert: "Due to varying antigen specificity, affnity, and avidity of TPOAb in their epitope reactions, some samples may not dilute linearly."

Methods Comparison: A comparison of 119 values using the Access TPOAb assay and a commercially available immunoassay system gave the following statistical data using Deming calculations: Range of observations=5-1000, Slope=1.0207 (95% confidence interval 0.9722 to 1.0693), Intercept=-10.9123 (95 % confidence interval -24.6421 to 2.8175), Correlation coefficient (r)=0.97. The results of the study indicate that the slope and intercept are not significantly different from one and zero respectively.

Analytical Specificity: There was no significant interference from potential sample contaminants (bilirubin, hemoglobin, human serum albumin, and triglycerides).

Stality:Ab reagents are stable r 6 days aftereng.TA calirators are stable fo 120 days after opening.The calibration is stable for 5 days.

# Summary of Clinical Studies

Expected Values: Sera samples were obtained in the United States from a healthy male population $\mathtt { < } \mathtt { 3 0 }$ y  ollowig ecritutli y e Natinal cadey  Cal Biochemists (NACB) for establishing a normal reference range for the Access TPOAb assay. A 95% non-parametric determination of results gave an upper reference limit below 9 lU/mL.

Additionally, 679 normal samples were collected in the United States from both males and females ranging in age from 18-80 years old. The screening criteria included serum TSH levels between 0.5 and 2.0 mlU/L, no goiter, no personal or family history of thyroid disease, and absence of non-thyroid autoimmune disease. After completing the screen, 492 samples were tested. $9 3 \%$ of these samples fell below 9 IU/mL.

Clinical Sensitivity: The Access TPO Antibody assay was evaluated using sera obtained from 54 patients diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and 40 patients diagnosed with Graves' Disease. 100% of the Hashimoto's Thyroiditis patients and 77.5% of the Graves' Disease samples tested positive in the Access TPO Antibody assay.

# Conclusion

TPO Antibody and TPO Antibody Calibrators on the Access Immunoassay Systems is substantially equivalent to the Immulite 2000 Anti-TPO Ab for the quantitative determination of thyroperoxydase levels in human serum and plasma.
