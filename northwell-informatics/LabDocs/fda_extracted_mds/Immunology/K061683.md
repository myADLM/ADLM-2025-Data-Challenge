# Device Name

Proprietary name: Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Myoglobin Gen.2 test system; C.f.a.s. (Calibrator for automated systems) Myoglobin

Common name: Myoglobin Test system, calibrator

Classification name: Myoglobin immunological test system; Calibrator, secondary

# Predicate devices

The Tina-Quant $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Myoglobin Gen.2 test system is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Tina-Quant $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Myo globin Test System cleared under K972513.

# Device Description

The Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Gen.2 Test System is an immunoturbidimetric assay for the quantitative in vitro determination of myoglobin in human serum and plasma on Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers. In this immunoturbidimetric method, latex-bound anti- myoglobin antibodies react with antigen in the sample to form an antigen/antibody complex which after agglutination can be determined turbidimetrically. The calibrator is C.f.a.s. Myoglobin and the recommended control material is the Myoglobin Control Set.

# Intended use

The Tina-Quant $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Gen.2 Test System is an immunoturbidimetric assay for the quantitative in vitro determination of myoglobin in human serum and plasma on Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

C.f.a.s. (calibrator for automated systems) Myoglobin is for use in the calibration of quantitative Roche methods on Roche clinical chemistry analyzers as specified in the enclosed values sheet.

The below table compares the Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Myoglobin Gen.2 Test System with the predicate device, Tina-Quant $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Myoglobin Test System (K972513)

Dear Dr. Bush;

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classifed (see above) into cither class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements. including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809): and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin imarketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The DA fnding of substantial equivalence of your device to a leally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
