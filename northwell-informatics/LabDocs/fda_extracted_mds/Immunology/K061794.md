# 4 Intended use of the device

The FIDIS™M THYRO kit is a semi-quantitative homogeneous fluorescent-based microparticles immunoassays using flow cytometry readings. It is designed for the detection of antibodies dirccted against thyroperoxydase (TPO) and thyroglobuline (TG).

The presencc of these antibodics can be used to aid in the diagnosis of auto-immune thyroid pathologies (Grave's disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis).

# Description of the Device

The assay kits consist of:

- a vial of color-coded microsphercs coupled with thyroperoxydase (TPO) or thyroglobulin (TG)

- a ready to use anti-human IgG coupled to phycoerythrin, - a ready to use calibrator titered for the specificity,   
- a positive control IgG to be diluted,   
- a ncgative control to be diluted,   
- a 10X concentrated PBS-Tween.

Rk: Calibrators, positive and negative controls are diluted human sera.

# 6 Summary of the technological characteristics of the device compared to the predicate device

The FIDIS™ System is a fully integrated and automated system for immunodiagnostic testing.

FIDIS™ System comprised of FIDIS flow cytometer, XYP platform for automatic sampling into the analyser, the analyzer itself, a SD pump, some FIDISTM kits and a software MLX-BOOSTER.

The FIDIS™ THYRO kit resembles traditional EIA and allows the detection and identification of antibodies against thyroperoxydase (TPO) and thyroglobuline (TG).

1. Diluted patient sera and microsphere suspension are thoroughly mixed in the 96 well microtiter plate. TPO or TG specific antibodies in the patient sera, if present, bind to the immobilised antigen on the beads. Any unbound material is removed by performing a wash step.   
2. Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG is added to the plate and a further incubation performed. The conjugated anti-human IgG binds to the TPO or TG specific antibodies immobilised on the microsphere surface to form an antigen/antibody complex.

3. The bead suspension is then analysed by the FIDIS™M Instrument and rcactions are directly calculated in biological units using specific data software (MLXBOOSTER).

The FIDIS™m Instrument is able to distinguish the specific color-coded of the microsphere and it could associated the microsphere type with the individual tested antigen.

The FIDIS™m Instrument could quantify the fluorescencc of the antibody captured by each microsphere. Measurement of the fluorescent signal from the final reaction complex allows the quantification of the presence or absence of autoantibodies.

# 7. Testing

The comparability of predicate devices and new devices is supported by a data set including:

results obtained within a comparison study analysing positive, equivocal and negative sera   
results obtained for samples from apparently healthy subject (normal population) results obtained for samples from samples with potential biological cross reactivity

# Conclusions

In conclusion, all available data support that the new devices, FIDIS™ THYRO kit is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Re: k061794 Tradc/Device Name: FIDISTM THYRO Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.5870 Regulation Name: Thyroid Autoantibody Immunological Test System Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: JZO, JNI Dated: June 16, 2006 Received: June 26, 2006

Dear Ms. Courivaud:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination docs not mcan that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutcs and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
