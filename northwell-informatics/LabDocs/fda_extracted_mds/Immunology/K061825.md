Device Description:

# Dimension VistaRP Flex® reagent cartrg

Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to human CRP are aggregated when mixed with samples containing CRP. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 2 Calibrator

Protein 2 Calibrator is a liquid human serum based product containing C-reactive protein (CRP).

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 2 Control L and H

Protein 2 Control L and H are liquid human serum based products containing C-reactive protein (CRP).

# 5. Device intended Use:

Dimension Vista ™ CRP Flex® reagent cartridge:

The CRP method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of Creactive protein (CRP) in human serum and heparinized plasma by means of particle enhanced immunonephelometry on the Dimension Vista™M System. In acute phase response, increased levels of a number of plasma proteins, including C-reactive protein, are observed. Measurement of CRP is useful for the detection and evaluation of infection, tissue injury, and inflammatory disorders.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 2 Calibrator:

Protein 2 Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the C-reactive protein (CRP) method on the Dimension Vista™ System.

Dimension Vista ™m Protein 2 Control L and H:

Protein 2 Control L and H are for use as assayed intralaboratory quality controls for the assessment of precision and analytical bias in determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) on the Dimension Vista™ System.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Dimension Vista™ CRP Flex reagent cartridge, Dimension Vista ™M Protein 2 Calibrator an Dimension Vista Protein  Control Land H are substantially equivalent to he Dade Behring CardioPhase® hsCRP assay (K033908) assay, N Rheumatology Standard SL (K964527) and N/T Rheumatology Control SL (K962373), respectively. The Dimension Vista™ CRP assay, like the Dade Behring CardioPhase® hsCRP assay is an in vitro diagnostic reagent or the quantitative measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human serum and plasma by means of particle enhanced immunonephelometry.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The Dimension Vista™ CRP assay was compared to the Dade Behring CardioPhase® hsCRP assay on the BN ProSpec® System by evaluating serum and plasma samples with concentrations ranging from 3.36 to $1 8 2 . 7 6 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ Regression analysis of these results yielded the following equation:

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Interet address
