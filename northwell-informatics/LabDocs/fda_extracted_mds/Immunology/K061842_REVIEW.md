CLSI (NCCLS) H18-A3, Vol. 24(38), 2004: Processing Blood Specimens CLSI (NCCLS) C24-A2, Vol. 19(5), 2006: Statistical quality control

L. Test Principle:

A mixture containing affinity-purified recombinant antigen MIT3 which includes immunodominant portions of PDC-E2, BCOADC-E2, and OGDC-E2, a purified fragment of the sp100 protein, and a purified fragment of the $\mathrm { \tt g p 1 0 0 }$ protein is bound to the wells of a polystyrene microwell plate under conditions that will preserve the antigen in their native state. Pre-diluted controls and diluted patient sera are added to separate wells, allowing any mitochondrial antibodies present to bind to the immobilized antigen. Unbound sample antibodies are washed away and an enzyme labeled anti-human IgG/IgA conjugate is added to each well. A second incubation allows the enzyme labeled anti-human $\mathrm { I g G / I g A }$ to bind to any patient antibodies, which have become attached to the microwells. After washing away any unbound enzyme labeled anti-human $\mathrm { I g G / I g A }$ , the remaining enzyme activity is measured by adding a chromogenic substrate and measuring the intensity of the color that develops. The assay can be evaluated spectrophotometrically by measuring and comparing the color intensity that develops in the patient wells with the color in the control wells.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The intra-assay precision was determined using seven serum samples, with PBC Screen concentration levels ranged from 13.6 to 61.6 Units/mL. These seven samples were tested five times. The positive samples had $\leq 3 . 7 \%$ CV, and the negative samples had $\leq 2 . 4 \%$ CV as listed below.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

No claims were made regarding linearity for the assay. It is a semiquantitative assay with results reported out as negative $( 0 . 0 - 2 0 . 0 \mathrm { U n i t s } )$ , positive $( \geq 2 5$ Units), or equivocal (20.1 – 24.9 Units), when results are interpreted by comparison to the low positive control value of 25 Units.

Specimens with positive results may be tested for the presence of individual MIT3, gp210, and sp100 antibodies with MIT3, gp100, and sp100 specific ELISA assays.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): There is no recognized standard or reference material for antibodies to the PBC Screen multi-antigen mixture. The positive and negative controls are prepared in house and arbitrary units are assigned during the development process.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference by endogenous substances: No data provided. The package insert states that grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, microbially contaminated, heat-treated, or specimens containing visible particulate should be avoided in this assay.

Crossreactivity study to other autoantibodies was performed. Results were under in section for ‘Clinical specificity’.

f. Assay cut-off:

The cut-off value of 25 units/mL for the PBC Screen IgG/ IgA assay was established from a combined panel of 1012 specimens collected from 520 asymptomatic healthy individuals and 492 patients with a variety of non-PBC diseases, i.e. 29 autoimmune and infectious diseases: 3 anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), 4 antinuclear antibody (ANA), 3 tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTg), 2 gastric parietal antibody (GPA), 2 glomerular basement membrane antibody (GBM), 7 Helicobacter pylori, and 8 cytomegalovirus (CMV); 213 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); 48 Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC); 10 AIH/PSC; 8 autoimmune cholangitis (AIC); 9 cryptogenic hepatitis; 1 drug-induced hepatitis; 11 vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS); 71 HBV; 78 HCV; 3 autoimmune hepatitis type 2; 11 alcoholic liver disease. Using the 25 units/mL cut-off, $9 8 . 1 \%$ (510/520) of the normal samples were negative. Of the non-PBC samples, $89 \%$ (438/492) were negative. If the possible undiagnosed overlap syndromes (AIH/PCS, VBDS, AIC, cryptogenic hepatitis, AIH, and AMA-negative PBC) were excluded from the non-PBC group, $92 \%$ (229/249) of the samples were negative.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate: A total of 1209 specimens from seven clinical sites, were tested on PBC Screen $\mathrm { I g G / I g A }$ ELISA assay and the individual MIT3, gp210 and sp100 ELISA assays. The samples consisted of 440 PBC (426 definite PBC and 14 AIH/PBC overlap); 48 PSC; 149 viral hepatitis (HBV or HCV); 23 non-PBC liver diseases; 29 infectious or other autoimmune diseases, and 520 healthy individuals. Equivocals were excluded from the percent agreement calculations. Results are summarized below.

Positive percent agreement $= 9 9 . 5 \%$ (437/439) Negative Percent Agreement $= 9 8 . 9 \%$ (730/738) Overall Agreement $= 9 9 . 2 \%$ (1167/1177)

The 14 Equivocal samples with the individual assays had the following diagnosis: 2 normal, 2 AMA $^ +$ PBC, 2 PSC, 2 PBC, 3 HBV, 2 HCV, 1 Alc. Liver Dis. The 23 Equivocal samples with the PBS Screen assay had the following diagnosis: 20 non-PBC samples and 3 PBC samples.

b. Matrix comparison: All assay use serum as matrix.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity: The same samples in the method comparison study were used for the determination of clinical sensitivity and specificity. Equivocal results were included as negative. The sensitivity was $9 5 . 9 \%$ (422/440) and the specificity was $9 6 . 1 \%$ (739/769).

b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Same as assay cut-off.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Expected values in the normal population should be negative.

A panel of 520 asymptomatic, healthy individuals residing in the USA was tested with the PBC Screen $\mathrm { I g G / I g A }$ assay and with the three individual MIT3, gp210, sp100 ELISA assays. Age and gender data were available for 307 specimens and unavailable for the remaining specimens. The samples were from 150 male and 157 female subjects with age ranging from 18-78 years. The average PBC Screen value for this population was 6.6 units with a median value of 4.6 units. The PBC Screen $\mathrm { I g G / I g A }$ assay had a specificity of $9 8 . 1 \%$ (510/520). The 10 positive samples with PBC Screen assay had the following results: one sample had 105 units and showed a classic AMA staining on HEp-2 cells by IFA whereas the other 9 positive had values ranging from 28-46 units. On further testing, one of these 10 specimen did not have sufficient serum, 6 were positive and 1 equivocal with the MIT3 IgG assay, one sample was negative with all three individual assays, and one was negative with the $\mathtt { g p 2 1 0 }$ and sp100 assays but positive with the MIT3 assay only. Since these were donor samples, it is not possible to verify the true clinical status of the reactive specimens.
