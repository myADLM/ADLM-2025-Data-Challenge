4. Device Description:

# Dimension Vista IGM Flex® reagent cartrie

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 1 Calibrator

Protein 1 Calibrator is a multi-analyte, liquid human serum based product containing Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin $\Game$ , and Immunoglobulin M.

Dimension Vista ™ Protein 1 Control L, M and H

Protein 1 Control L, M and H are multi-analyte, liquid human serum based products containing Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin G, and Immunoglobulin M.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

Dimension Vista™ IGM Flex® reagent cartridge:

The IgM method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of Immunoglobulin M in human serum and heparinized plasma on the Dimension Vista™ System. Measurements of IgM aid in the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body's lack of ability to resist infectious agents.

Dimension Vista ™ Protein 1 Calibrator:

Protein 1 Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the Immunoglobulin A (IGA), Immunoglobulin G (IGG) and Immunoglobulin M (IGM) methods on the Dimension VistaSystem.

Dimension Vista ™ Protein 1 Control L, M and H:

Protein 1 Control L, M and H are assayed intralaboratory quality controls for the aent recisionananalytical s ndetermnation moglobulA GA), munoglobuln G GG and Imunoglobulin M GM) on the Dimension Vista System.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Dimension Vista ™ IGM Flex® reagent cartridge, Dimension Vista ™ Protein 1 Calibrator and Dimension Vista ™M Protein 1 Control L, M and H are substantially equivalent to the the Dade Behring N Antisera to Human IgM assay (K042735), N Protein Standard SL (K012470) an N/T Protein Control SL (K012468), respectively.The Dimension Vista™ IGM assay, like Dade Behring N Antisera to Human IGM assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of Immunoglobulin M in human serum and plasma by means of particle enhanced immunonephelometry.

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into cither class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Pleasc be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality

Page 2 - systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0484.
