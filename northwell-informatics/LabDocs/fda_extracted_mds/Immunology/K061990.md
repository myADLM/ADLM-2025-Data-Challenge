# 4. Device Description:

# Dimension Vista™ MALB Flex® reagent cartridge

Proteins contained in human urine form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of albumin in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 3 Calibrator

PROT3 CAL is a lyophilized, polygeline based (with urinary proteins of human origin) product containing Albumin.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 3 Control

PROT3 CON is a lyophilized, polygeline and albumin based product containing albumin of human origin.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

Dimension Vista ™ MALB Flex® reagent cartridge:

The MALB method is an in vitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative determination of albumin in human urine on the Dimension Vista™M System. Measurement of Albumin aids in the diagnosis of kidney and intestinal disease.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 3 Calibrator:

Protein 3 Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the Microalbumin (MALB) method on the Dimension Vista™ System.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 3 Control:

Protein 3 Control is an assayed intralaboratory quality control for the assessment of precision and analytical bias in determination of Microalbumin (MALB) on the Dimension VistaT System.

# 6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Dimension Vista ™ MALB Flex reagent cartridge, Dimension Vista™ Protein 3 Calibrator and Dimension Vista ™ Protein 3 Control are substantially equivalent to the Dade Behring N Antiserum to Human Albumin assay (K860894) assay, N Protein Standard SL (K012470) and N/T Protein Control LC (K991704), respectively. The Dimension Vista™ MALB assay, like the Dade Behring N Antiserum to Human Albumin assay is an in vitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative measurement of Microalbumin (MALB) in human urine by means of particle enhanced immunonephelometry.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The Dimension Vista ™m MALB assay was compared to the Dade Behring N Antiserum to Human Albumin assay on the BN ProSpec® System by evaluating urine samples with concentrations ranging from 5.87 to $3 3 2 . 7 4 \mathrm { \ m g / L }$ .Regression analysis of these results yielded the following equation:

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassifiedin accordance with the provisions of the Federal FoodDrug and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Intemet address
