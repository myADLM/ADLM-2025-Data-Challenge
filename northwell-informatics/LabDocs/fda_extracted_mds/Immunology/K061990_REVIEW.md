# L. Test Principle:

The Dimension Vista Microalbumin (MALB) Flex Reagent Cartridge utilizes a method based on nephelometric measuring principles that allows direct quantitation of albumin in urine samples. The cartridge contains specific antibodies to human albumin, which form immunocomplexes in an immunochemical reaction with albumin contained in human urine. These complexes cause a beam of light to scatter when passed through the urine sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the albumin concentration in the sample. The rate of aggregation is measured by reading the increased light signal at $8 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The results are evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-lab and repeatability precision was assessed according to EP5-A2. One low urine pool, one higher urine pool and the Dade Behring N/T Protein Control LC (twenty specimens per level) were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day for twenty days. The precision data is summarized in the chart below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor claims a reportable range for their assay of $5 - 3 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Linearity of the assay was evaluated using a dilution series that spanned from 6.70 to $3 1 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Serial dilution sets were prepared using system diluents using urine samples with high concentrations of albumin. Each dilution was tested in replicates of five. The sponsor calculated both percent recovery and linear regression. The mean recovery for the 13 dilutions was $9 8 . 1 \%$ . The dilution linearity regression line was $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 9 2 + 0 . 0 7 3$ with a correlation coefficient of 0.999.

The sponsor also conducted a hook effect study to evaluate urine samples above the assay range. The sponsor reports that there is no high end hook effect observed on samples up to $1 2 6 9 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The Dimension Vista has an auto dilution of samples that are above $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

A 24 month stability study using 3 Flex Reagent cartridges, Protein 3 calibrator and the Protein 3 Control (all tested in triplicates) were stored at 2 and $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested at several intervals. An onboard stability study was also conducted for unwrapped cartridges and open cartridges after being stored at 2 different temperatures to determine optimum shelf-life. The studies supported the sponsor’s expiration and open well stability claims listed in the chart below.

d. Detection limit:

Analytical sensitivity was defined as the minimal level of analyte (diluent) which is distinguished from zero. The sponsor calculated the value $1 . 2 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ as the mean value of twenty replicates plus standard deviations. This calculation supports the sponsor’s LOD claim of $5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A for endogenous and exogenous substances with the Dimension Vista™ MALB Assay. Bias was determined by testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing it to the value obtained from test sample containing the potential interferent. The endogenous substances that the sponsor tested were bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), creatine, hemoglobin, IgG and urea. The exogenous substances tested were acetone, ascorbic acid, boric acid, ethanol, glucose, oxalic acid, riboflavin, sodium azide, sodium chloride and sodium fluoride. Each substance at the concentration tested did not cause ${ > } 1 0 \%$ relative deviation from the base pool. See package insert for a summary of concentrations and results.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The Dimension Vista MALB assay was compared to the Dade Behring N

Antiserum to Human Albumin assay on the BN ProSPEC $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System. Seventyfour urine samples with concentrations ranging from 5.87 to $3 3 2 . 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ were measured with both devices and a linear regression analysis was conducted. The resulting equation was $\mathrm { Y = 0 } . 9 8 8 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { - } 0 . 9 3 6$ with a correlation coefficient of 0.996.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable as this is a urine only assay.

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor reports the following expected values obtained from literature from the American Diabetes Association: Standards of Medical Care for Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry, $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ edition.

Less than $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m i n ^ { g } }$

Less than $3 0 \mathrm { m g } / 2 4$ hour

Excretion rate: less than $3 0 \mathrm { m g }$ albumin/g creatinineh g. MALB $\mathrm { ( m g / L ) }$ x[Urine Volume (mL)/Time (minutes)] $= \mathrm { m } _ { \mathrm { 1 } }$ g MALB/min.

h. [MALB $( \mathrm { m g / L } )$ )/Urine creatinine $( \mathrm { m g / d L ) ] x 1 0 0 { = } \mathrm { m g M A L B / g } }$ creatinine.

The sponsor has placed in their label a statement regarding intra-individual variation.

“To minimize intra-individual variation, analysis of three random urine samples collected over the course of a week has also been recommended. Each laboratory should establish its own reference interval for microalbumin as performed on the Dimension Vista System. Calculation of an excretion rate requires a timed specimen collection and accurate volume measurement.”

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
