807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate device CellSearchTM Circulating Tumor Cell Kit, K050245

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The CellSearch" Circulating Tumor Cell Kit contains a ferrofluid-based capture reagent and immunofluorescent reagents. The ferrofluid reagent consists of nanoparticles with a magnetic core surrounded by a polymeric layer coated with antibodies targeting the EpCAM antigen for capturing CTC. After immunomagnetic capture and enrichment, fluorescent reagents are addcd for identification and enumeration of CTC. The fluorescent reagents include the following: anti-CK-Phycoerythrin (PE) specific for the intracellular protcin cytokeratin (characteristic of epithelial cells),

DAPI which stains the cell nucleus, and anti-CD45-Allophycocyanin (APC) specific for leukocytes.

The reagent/sample mixturc is dispensed by the CellTracks® AutoPrep $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EY System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device. The strong magnetic ficld of the MagNest® device attracts the magnctically labeled epithelial cells to the surface of the cartridge. The CellTracks® Analyzer II or CellSpotter® Analyzer automatically scans the entire surface of the cartridge, acquires images and displays any event to the user wherce CK-PE and DAPI fluorescence are co-located. Images are presented to the user in a gallery format for final classification. An event is classified as a tumor cell when its morphological features are consistent with that of a tumor cell and it exhibits the phenotype $\mathrm { E p C A M + }$ , $\mathrm { C K + }$ DAPI+ and CD45-.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended use

The CellSearchTM Circulating Tumor Cell Kit is intcndcd for the enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTC) of epithelial origin (CD45-, ${ \mathrm { E p C A M } } +$ , and cytokeratins 8, $^ { 1 8 + }$ , and/or $1 9 +$ in whole blood.

The presence of CTC in the pcripheral blood, as detcctcd by the CellSearchTM Circulating Tumor Cell Kit, is associated with decreased progression frec survival and decreased overall survival in patients treated for metastatic breast cancer. The test is to be used as an aid in the monitoring of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Serial testing for CTC should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring breast cancer. A CTC count of 5 or more per $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of blood at any time during the course of the disease is prcdictive of shorter progression free survival and overall survival.

# Recovery

Blood samples from a single healthy donor were pooled and five of six 7.5 mL aliquots were spiked with approximately 1300, 325, 81, 20, and 5 cultured breast cancer cells (SK-BR-3). The sixth tube was unspiked pooled blood and served as a zero point. These samples were processed on the CellTracks® AutoPrep System with the CellSearch™" Circulating Tumor Cell Kit and CTC counts were determined on the CellTracks®

Analyzer II. The cxperiment was repeated for four additional donors. Thc observed cell counts were plotted against the results of the expected cell count. The results are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1. Percent Detection Estimates.   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Expected Tumor CellCount</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean Observed Tumor CellCount</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range of Percent Recovery</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1215</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>91 to 95%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>325</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>308</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>82 to 101%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>81</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>85</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80 to 136%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95 to 140%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>120 to 200%</td></tr></table>

To dctermine the overall, or least squares fit, for the comparison of the observed and expected cell counts across all the data, lincar regression analysis was performed. The regression equation for thesc 30 samples was Y=0.93x + 3.87 with an R2=0.999 (R=0.999). Thc results of this study indicate that on average, over the tested CTC range, the recovery, as derived from regression analysis, is $9 3 \%$ .

Given the linear response of the tumor cell counts, one would cxpect the slope of the observed versus expected plot to be 1.0. However, the slope was O.93. This is because the CellTracks® AutoPrep System with CellScarch™" CTC Kit involves the capture and fluorescent labeling of cells followd by theiretction and enration by the CellTrcks Analyzer II. The loss of cells could therefore be attributed to one of the following possibilities; 1) the recovery of only 93% of the tumor cells spiked into 7.5mL of blood by the CellTracks® AutoPrep System, 2) the detection of only $9 3 \%$ of the tumor cells present in the sample chamber by the CellTracks® Analyzer II or 3) a combination of both of these sources of error.

# Linearity / Reportable Range

Another way to examine the previous data is to analyze it as a dilution series to evaluate test linearity. Wc removed the confounding variable of percent recovery by using the observed value of the initial sample in the dilution series (i.e. the first tubc) divided by the dilution factors to determine the expected values for the dilution series for each patient sample. Regression of all of these numbers of observed tumor cells versus the numbers of expected tumor cells yielded a slope of 1.007, an intercept of 3.0, and an $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 0$ $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 5$ . Therefore, once the percent recovery (cell loss) was factored out of the CTC values of each of the initial samples, the analysis of the data demonstrated that the detection of

CTC was linear over thc reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells.

# Limits of Detection

One CTC per $7 . 5 \ \mathrm { m L }$ can be detected by the CellTracks® Analyzer II resulting in a limit of detection of 1 CTC in a cartridge. Linear regression shows that on average, $9 3 \%$ of CTC present in a $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ blood sample are recovered using the CellTracks $\textcircled{1}$ AutoPrep System (see Recovery section). The loss of approximately $7 \%$ of the CTC in the sample is not sufficient to reduce thc limit of detcction of 1 CTC.

Single point CTC analyses wcre performed on control groups of 145 healthy volunteers, 101 women with non-malignant breast disease, and 99 women with other non-malignant diseases.

Epithelial cells are not expected to be prescnt in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. Of the 345 total samples from healthy volunteers and women with non-malignant disease, only one subject had more than 5 $\mathrm { C T C } / 7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ . The results are presented in Table 4.

Baseline CTC count was determined prior to initiation of a new line of therapy. Follow-up CTC counts were determined after the initiation of therapy at approximately 3 to 4 week intervals. For the baseline analyses, Progression Free Survival (PFS) was measured from the time of the baseline blood draw to the diagnosis of progression by CT scans and/or clinical signs and symptoms, and Overall Survival (OS) was measured from the time of baseline blood draw to the time of death. For the followup analyses, PFS was measured from the time of the follow-up blood draw to diagnosis of progression or death, and OS was measured from the time of the follow-up blood draw to the time of death.

# CTC Frequencies

Table 7 summarizcs the total number and percentage of patients in the clinical trial that differs from the numbers and percentages of patients for Progression Frcc Survival shown on Table 6. Of the total paticnt number of 177, 23 were not cvaluable at first follow-up. Of thcse 23 patients, ten patients dicd bcfore a follow-up blood draw could be obtained, nine patients progressed prior to a follow-up blood draw, and four were lost to follow-up. Notably, each of the ten patients who died had ${ \geq } 5$ to extremely high CTC counts at baseline (CTC counts 9, 11, 15, 24, 111, 126, 301, 1143, 4648 and 23618). Of the 154 patients available for follow-up, 132, 99, 129, and 85 patients had a blood draw at 3-5, 6-8, 9-14, and 15-20 weeks after initiation of therapy, respectivcly.

# Progression Free Survival (PFS) Analysis PFS Using Baseline CTC Results

All 177 patients had a baseline CTC tcst performed. For Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at baseline:

The Favorable group $( \Nu { = } 8 9 _ { , }$ ),represented in green, consisted of paticnts with $< 5$ CTC.   
:: The Unfavorable group $\left( \ N { = } 8 8 \right)$ , represented in red, consisted of patients with ${ \geq } 5$ CTC. PFS Using Follow-up CTC Results   
For Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at each of the various follow-up blood draws. Both patient groups at each of the different follow-up blood draw times after initiation of therapy for PFS are illustrated in Figure 2. PFS times were calculated from the time of each blood draw, and any patient   
showing evidence of progression prior to a particular blood draw was excluded from the analysis of that and all subsequent follow-up blood draws. Figure 2 illustrates the ability of CTCs in patients with ${ < } 5$ and ${ \geq } 5$ CTCs 3-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-14 weeks, and 15-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy to predict time to clinical progression in 177 patients with metastatic breast cancer.

TC $=$ Circulating Tumor Cells, $\mathbf { C I } =$ Confidence Interval, $\mathrm { P D = }$ Progressive diseas

As illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 6, patients with elevated CTCs $( \geq 5$ $\mathrm { C T C } / 7 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ whole blood) at any of the time points had a much higher likelihood of rapid progression than did those with $< 5$ CTCs. Table 6 column 4 shows the median PFS times for those patients with ${ < } 5$ CTCs ranged from 5.6 to 7.0 months and were substantially longer than the median PFS times for those patients with ${ \geq } 5$ CTCs, which ranged from 1.3 to 3.6 months (column 5). Thc difference in the number of patients at each timc point is due to the progression of some patients prior to the blood draw and based on the number of patients sampled.

Predictive Value of CTC Reduction or Increase on PFS Elapsed PFS times were calculated from the baseline blood draw. For Kaplan-Meicr analysis, patients were scgmented into four groups based upon their CTC counts:

\* Group 1 (green curve), 83 $( 4 7 \% )$ patients with ${ < } 5$ CTCs at all blood draw time points; Group 2 (blue curve), 38 $( 2 1 \% )$ patients with ${ \geq } 5$ CTCs prior to the initiation of therapy but who had decreased to ${ < } 5$ CTCs at the time of their last blood draw; Group 3 (' curve), 17 $( 1 0 \% )$ patients with ${ < } 5$ CTCs prior to the initiation of therapy who increased to ${ \geq } 5$ CTCs at the time of their last blood draw;

Overall Survival (OS) Analysis OS Analysis Using Baseline CTC Results

Death occurred in 109 $( 6 2 \% )$ of the 177 patients, with a mean follow-up time for the 68 $( 3 8 \% )$ patients still alive of $2 2 . 7 \pm 9 . 4$ months (median 21.1, range $= 4 . 4 - 4 8 . 6 $ . At the time of these analyses, 44 $( 4 9 \% )$ of 89 patients from Favorable group $\cdot < 5$ CTC at baseline) compared to 65 $( 7 4 \% )$ of 88 from Unfavorable group $2 5$ CTC at baseline) had died.

For Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at baseline:

\* The Favorable group $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 9 _ { , }$ ), represented in green, consisted of patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC.   
\* The Unfavorable group $( N { = } 8 8$ , representcd in red, consisted of patients with ${ \geq } 5$ CTC.

Median OS was 21.9 months for the Favorable group and 10.9 months for the Unfavorable group. The OS difference betwcen the two groups is highly significant. These results are illustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 6 shows that patients who exceed the threshold of 5 CTCs at any point after the initiation of therapy are at a significantly higher risk of dying sooner. Patients with $\ge 5$ CTCs at all time points (Group 4) had the shortest median OS, which was significantly different compared to the

median OS of , Group 2, and Group 1. The differencc in the median survival betwcen and Group I was also significant, and although the median OS for was shorter compared to Group 2, the difference was not statistically significant. Figure 6 also shows that paticnts who have ≥5 CTCs at baseline but eventually decrease to <5 CTCs after thc initiation of therapy have approximately the same risk of death as those patients who never excced the 5 CTC threshold.

As illustrated in Figure 6 and Table 7 in columns 4 & 5, patients with ${ \geq } 5$ CTCs at any of the time points had a much higher probability of dying sooncr than did those with ${ < } 5$ CTCs. The median OS times for those patients with ${ < } 5$ CTCs ranged from 19.1 to 21.9 months and wcrc substantially longer than the median OS times for those patients with ${ \geq } 5$ CTCs, which ranged from 6.2 to 1 1.3 months.

# Univariate Cox Regression Analysis

The following parameters wcre analyzed using Univariate Cox rcgression analysis to evaluate association with PFS and OS: patient age (continuous), stage of discase at diagnosis (1-4), time to metastasis (continuous), ECOG status bcfore initiation of a new line of therapy (0-2), ER/PR status $( + / - )$ , HER2/neu status $( 0 - 3 + )$ , linc of therapy $( \geq 2 ^ { { \mathrm { n d } } }$ or ${ \mathfrak { l } } ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ type of therapy (chemo only or hormonal / combination), baseline CTC count $2 5$ or $\mathopen { } \mathclose \bgroup \left. 5 \mathrm { C T C } / 7 . 5 \mathrm { m L } \aftergroup \egroup \right.$ ), and follow-up CTC counts 3-5 weeks, 6-8 wecks, 9-14 wecks, and 15-20 wccks after the initiation of therapy $\mathord {  }  \mathord {  \geq } 5$ or $< 5 \mathrm { C T C } / 7 . 5 \mathrm { m L } $ .

# Multivariate Cox Regression Analysis

Multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the independent predictive power of CTC count by adjusting for the effects of the known important clinical factors that are statistically significant in the univariate analyses. CTCs were found to be strong predictors of PFS and OS.

# USE OF CTC TO MONITOR CLINICAL STATUS

# Relationship between survival, CTCs and disease assessment by imaging

Radiological imaging is one of the primary means of determining disease status and response to therapy in metastatic breast cancer patients. To establish the relationship of CTCs, measured at two different timepoints, to clinical status as determined by imaging, CTCs and imaging results

were compared 1) to the true clinical endpoint overall survival and 2) to cach other.

# CTC

Previous data has shown that patients with ≥5 CTCs / 7.5mL of blood at any succccding follow-up visit after the initiation of therapy had a higher likelihood of progressive discase and decreased overall survival compared to patients with ${ < } 5$ CTCs $1 7 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood.

# Imaging

All imaging sites were in compliance with Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standards. Using standardized digital images, two expert radiologists (readers), working individually and blinded to clinical information, classified each follow-up disease asscssment (total of 231 imaging studies) from 138 patients with measurable disease as indcterminate (l), stable disease (S), partial response (PR), or progressive disease (PD) according to World Health Organization (WHO) bi-dimensional criteria. Measurable disease was defined as the presencc of at least one lesion $\geq 2 \mathrm { c m }$ in its longest dimension. Readers identified up to eight lesions per patient per time point by describing the longest dimension of the lesion and the longest perpendicular dimension. These two dimcensions were multiplicd and the "cross product" was reported. Summcd measurements for the crossproducts were calculatcd, and percent change from the previous time point was determined. Although all patients had measurable disease, nonmeasurable lcsions (still detectable by radiology) were included in the determination of patient status as described in the WHO guidelines. Progressive disease was defined as a >25% increase in the sum of all lesions or appcarance of a new measurable or non-measurable lesion. Partial response was defined as a decrease in the sum of all lesions of $\ge 5 0 \%$ and no new lesions.

Radiology interpretations from the two expert radiologists were classified as followed:

S and PR were considered to both reflect non-progressive disease (NPD) $\gtrdot$ PD was considered to reflect progressive disease In situations where onc of the radiologists rendered a classification of Indeterminate (I) but the other radiologist rendered a classification of S, PR or PD, the classification of the latter radiologist was used for comparison to CTCs $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 1$ When both radiologists rendered a classification of Indeterminate (I), then the data was not used in the comparison to CTCs $\mathrm { ( n = 3 ) }$ )

A third independent radiologist adjudicated disagreements between the two primary readers regarding PD and NPD (n=27) In situations where the third independent radiologist rendered a classification of Indeterminate (I), the data was not used in the comparison to CTCs $\mathrm { ( n = 2 ) }$ ) In scrial imaging studies, radiology results that were less than one month from a previous tabulated observation wcre not used (n=1).

o The CTC results obtained within $\pm$ one month of the imaging study were classified as <5 CTC and ≥5 CTC. If more than one CTC value was obtained within ± one month of the imaging study, the CTC result obtained closest to the date of the imaging study was used.

# Relationship between survival to imaging and CTC

Separate Kaplan-Meier analyses wcre performcd to compare the overall survival of paticnts in the Favorable (<5 CTCs) and Unfavorable (≥5 CTCs) groups using CTC results at two different time points and the first follow-up imaging study. Using results from thc first follow-up imaging studies, performed 10.1 ± 5.1 wecks (median = 9.0 weeks) after initiation of therapy (i.e. the baseline blood draw), the median survival of the 96 (70%) patients determined by imaging to have NPD was 23.8 months (95% Cl 20.4 to 28.6) (Figure 7.A, Table 9). For thc 42 (30%) paticnts determined by imaging to have PD, the median survival was 12.9 months $9 5 \%$ CI 7.1 to 19.3).

For CTCs at the first follow-up blood draw, performed 4.3 + 2.5 weeks (mcdian = 4.0 wceks) after initiation of thcrapy, the median survival of 104 (75%) patients with Favorable CTC results (<5 CTCs) was 21.9 months (95% CI 20.4 to 26.9) (Figure 7.B, Table 9). Thirty-four (34) patients (25%) with Unfavorable CTC results (≥5 CTCs) had a median survival of 8.3 months $9 5 \%$ CI 5.9 to 15.1).

To determine if CTC assessments performed closer to the time of the imaging resulted in similar survival prospects compared to CTC assessments done approximately 4 weeks after the initiation of therapy, only those patients with CTC assessments performed within ± one month of the first follow-up imaging study (9.9 ± 5.1 weeks, median = 8.8 weeks, after the initiation of therapy) were analyzed (Figure 7.C, Table 9). One hundred and thirty four (134) of the 138 patients (97%) had CTC assessments within one month of the first follow-up imaging study. The median survival of 105 (78%) patients with Favorable CTC results was 21.9 months (95% CI 19.9 to 31.6). For 29 (22%) patients with Unfavorable CTC results, the median survival was 8.5 months (95% CI 5.5 to 15.1). These data show that CTC assessments at both time points

provide similar results to imaging conducted approximatcly 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

# Concordances between CTC and Radiological Monitoring

As noted above, imaging studies are a major component of the current standard of care for dctermining disease progression and response to treatment in the metastatic breast cancer setting. To further support the effectiveness of CTCs in making these clinical assessments, two-by-two tabulations of concordant and discordant observations between CTCs and radiological imaging were constructed using the previously described criteria.

Using only the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ follow-up imaging study, the radiological response at this visit was compared with the CTC results obtained within $\pm$ onc month of this imaging study. A total of 134 of the 138 patients $( 9 7 \% )$ had CTC results that met this criteria. The result of this "patient-wise" comparison bctwcen CTCs and imaging is shown in Table 10.

Using all of the follow-up imaging studies performed after the initiation of therapy on the 138 patients that rendered uscable radiological response results $\mathrm { ( n = 2 2 5 }$ ), these results were then compared to CTC results obtained within $\pm$ one month of the imaging study. A total of 219 of the 225 $( 9 7 \% )$ EY imaging studies had CTC results meeting this criterion. The result of this "observation-wise" comparison between CTCs and imaging is shown in Table 11.

In serial observations, only a minority of the transitions for imaging results between non progressive disease and progressive disease coincided with a matching transition of CTC counts between ${ < } 5$ and $\ge 5 \mathrm { C T C s } / 7 . 5 \mathrm { m I } .$ (see Limitations).

Becausc the prognostic value of the CTC results at an carlicr time-point were cquivalcnt to that of the CTC results at the time of imaging (Figures 7B & 7C), a patient-wise comparison using results from only the $1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ follow-up imaging study, performed approximately 9 weeks after the initiation of therapy, and the CTC results obtained at the $1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ follow-up, performed approximately 4 wccks after initiation of therapy, was constructcd. All 138 patients had CTC results meeting this criterion. The result of this "patient-wise" comparison bctween CTCs at an carlier time point and imaging is shown in Table 12.

# CTC AS AN ADJUNCT TO IMAGING

While the overall agreement bctween CTCs and imaging was good (approximately $78 \%$ ), there was disagreement in approximatcly $2 2 \%$ of the patients. As the information from CTC assessments is intended to be used in conjunction with other diagnostic modalitics to make treatment decisions, CTC assessment at $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ follow-up (approximately 4 weeks after the initiation of therapy) and imaging in the following groups were compared to OS to determine which of the discordant results better reflected the prognosis of the patient.

These results suggest that CTC determination is a strong independent predictor of overall survival. This figure also suggests that the combination of CTC and radiological assessments provides the most accurate assessment of prognosis.

# CTCs

Inter-rcader variabilities for the CTC counts at the first follow-up blood draw was determined by counting the number of instances where the operator at the testing site was not in concordance with the central laboratory in classifying a sample as $\geq 5$ CTCs versus ${ < } 5 \mathrm { C T C s }$ .In a subsct of 71 patients, two tubes of blood were drawn and processed, and the classification of ${ \gtrsim } 5$ CTCs versus $< 5$ CTCs in cach of the two tubes as determined by the site as well as by thc central laboratory was compared.

# Imaging

Inter-reader variability was determined by comparing the radiological interpretations of the two radiologists, classificd as NPD vs. PD. Intrareader variability was calculated by comparing thc radiological interprctations of the two radiologists in a subset of paticnts where each radiologist determined the response at three separate sittings, each sitting separated by a minimum of one week.

Imaging segments of later assessments in these 138 patients and CTC assessments before initiation of thcrapy and at later follow-ups were studicd also.

The inter-reader variabilities of the radiological determinations were significantly higher in both the first follow-up disease assessment and in all subsequent disease follow-up assessments when compared to the interreader variability of the CTC counts in the samc groups (Fisher's $\mathrm { P { < } 0 . 0 0 1 }$ ).

# 807.92 (b)(3): Conclusions from Clinical Testing

The data demonstrate that CTC counts, obtained at various points in the clinical course of metastatic breast cancer, have prognostic value. The prognostic information from CTC mcasurements is similar in degrcc and adds to the prognostic information available from radiologic assessments of disease. In addition, CTC mcasurements are less variable than radiological assessments. Changes in CTC and radiologic status do not occur simultaneously, suggesting that CrC and radiologic assessments focus on different aspects of tumor biology. Nevertheless, the overall concordance of CTC and radiologic assessments supports the use of CTC to monitor the progression of metastatic breast cancer.

# Device Name: CellSearchTM Circulating Tumor Cell Kit

# Indications for Use:

The CellSearchTM Circulating Tumor Cell Kit is intended for the enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTC) of epithelial origin (CD45-, EpCAM+, and cytokeratins 8, $^ { 1 8 + }$ , and/or $1 9 +$ )in whole blood.

The presence of CTC in the peripheral blood, as detected by the CellSearch™M Circulating Tumor Cell Kit, is associated with decreased progression free survival and decreased overall survival in patients treated for metastatic breast cancer. The test is to be used as an aid in the monitoring of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Serial testing for CTC should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring breast cancer. A CTC count of 5 or more per $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of blood at any time during the course of the disease is predictive of shorter progression free survival and overall survival.
