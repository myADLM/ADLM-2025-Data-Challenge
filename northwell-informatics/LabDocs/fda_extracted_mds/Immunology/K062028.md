# 3.Equivalence to Legally Marketed Device

The Celera Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping (CF GT) Assay is equivalent to the Tm Bioscience Corporation Tag-It™ Cystic Fibrosis Kit 510(k) #K043011 and to bidirectional DNA sequence analysis (per FDA Special Controls Guidance, CFTR Gene Mutation Detection Systems, issued October 26, 2005).

# Device Description

The Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay is designed to genotype the normal and mutant alleles at 30 loci of the CFTR gene using purified human genomic DNA. Genotype coverage includes the panel of 23 mutations recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) 2004 guidelines for use in CF population carrier screening." Coverage also includes 9 additional mutations as part of an expanded core panel to support genetic diversity of multiethnic populations that may be underserved by the ACMG panel alone (e.g. Hispanic, African American). In addition to core panel coverage, the assay is designed to detect polythymidine variants (5/7/9T) within intron 8 of the CFTR gene and polymorphisms (I506V, I507V, and F508C) within Exon 10 of the CFTR gene, in accordance with ACMG guidelines.

Purified genomic human DNA is prepared by standard purification methods. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is then performed to amplify the genomic DNA sample with 16 pairs of PCR primers and DNA polymerase. Next, the oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) is performed on the CFTR amplicons. Allele-specific OLA probes hybridize to the respective normal, mutant, and variant alleles and become ligated with fluorescent-labeled common probes by the ligase enzyme. The OLA probes are varied in length due to the addition of inert mobility modifiers. The ligated, fluorescent-labeled DNA fragments are separated on the Celera CEGA $1 6 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Instrument System by electrophoresis. Detection is based on size and fluorescent label. The ligation products are then identified and genotyped by analysis with the CEGA-16 software and assay-specific configuration disk.

The CF GT Assay also contains Reflex OLA reagents for the detection of the polythymidine 5/7/9T variants in intron 8 of the CFTR gene and for the detection of the I506V, I507V, and F508C polymorphisms in Exon 10 of the CFTR gene. The CFTR R117H mutation, along with the 5T variant of the 5/7/9T polymorphism in intron 8 on the same chromosome (cis), can cause classical CF if another CF mutation is present on the other chromosome. As a result, reflex testing for the 5/7/9T variant with the CF 5/7/9T Reflex OLA assay is recommended when the R117H mutation is detected. The CF Exon 10 Reflex OLA assay is used to verify a homozygous deletion of the F508 or I507 codon and to exclude a potential false-positive result due to interference by certain non-CF causing variants at codons 506, 507, and 508. The CF Exon 10 Reflex OLA assay will distinguish between a true homozygous F508del or I507del from a sample containing one F508del or I507del allele plus the benign variants of I506V, I507V or F508C, respectively. The same software contained on the configuration disk is used to report reflex testing genotyping information.

# 5Intended Use

# Clinical Testing

# Overview

Clinical studies were performed to determine the performance characteristics of the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay. All studies were performed using materials, equipment and procedures described within the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay Operator's Manual. Every assay run included the CFTR Wild Type Control (allelic ladder/positive assay control) and No Template Control (CF Sample Diluent as a negative control), which are provided within the assay kit. Multiple reagent lots, testing sites, and operators were involved in performing the studies. Samples were blinded and randomized prior to use by the testing sites.

Bi-directional dideoxy DNA sequencing was performed on all clinical trial samples by an independent supplier operating under applicable good laboratory practices (GLPs) and current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) according to 21 CFR Parts 58, 211 and 820, respectively. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification was performed for fifteen (15) regions of interest (ROl) within each sample. Amplicons were sequenced to provide a minimum of double strand sequence data (4-fold coverage, 2 reads per strand) or, for regions containing a heterozygote insertion/deletion, 4-fold coverage from a single strand.

# Accuracy

The objective of this study was to assess the clinical accuracy of the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay for the targeted normal and mutant alleles. The samples tested included genomic DNA obtained from frozen whole blood and frozen pellets from commercially available cell lines. Results from bi-directional dideoxy DNA sequencing by an independent testing service were used as the gold standard for purposes of assessing accuracy of the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay.

# Sample Set

The study was conducted using a set of 201 samples where each core mutation was present within a minimum of 4 samples. The sample set was comprised of 163 unique samples representing purified genomic DNA (51), frozen whole blood (98), fresh whole blood (6) and frozen cell line pellets (8). Most of the samples $( 6 5 \% )$ contained a single, heterozygous core mutation. Full segmentation of the sample set is summarized in the following table:

\*Included to assess the assay's ability to detect the polymorphism when present.

To achieve the target minimum of 5 samples per mutation (one exception: 394delTT), additional independent aliquots were generated from 38 of the unique samples. Thus, the complete sample set consisted of 201 samples (i.e., 163 unique $^ { + 3 8 }$ duplicates). Ultimately, all samples were blinded and randomized prior to shipment to the study sites. An overview of the mutation, polymorphism and variant distribution within each of the complete sample set is provided in the following Mutation, Polymorphism and Variant Distribution Table:

All 201 samples, classified below into one of four genotypic categories, were tested twice for the presence of 32 mutant alleles, 30 normal alleles, 3 Exon 10 polymorphisms, and 3 polythymidine variants by each of the two independent sites:

25: normal DNA with none of the CFTR mutations within the test panel   
140: contained one mutant allele within the core panel   
35: contained either two mutant alleles within the core panel or one mutant allele $^ +$ one polymorphism/variant 1: contained two mutant alleles within the core panel $^ +$ one variant

Percent agreement between the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay and sequencing is summarized in the following table for all 24,954 genotype calls within the sample set. The results for the Core OLA Assay were compared to sequencing with respect to the mutations and normal alleles that the core assay is designed to identify in accordance with ACMG guidelines." When reflex testing was indicated by the Core OLA Assay, the results for the polymorphisms or variants identified by the reflex testing were compared with sequencing. The

Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay uses a testing algorithm based on the ACMG guidelines; therefore, testing for polymorphisms within Exon 10 and variants within the polythymidine tract of Intron 8 is only warranted when specific results are observed in the Core OLA Assay.

# System Failure Rate

A total of 24,954 genotype calls was generated by the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay during the accuracy study, and all but one call matched the sequencing result (failure rate $0 . 0 0 4 \%$ . The single incorrect genotype call was associated with the 5/7/9T Reflex OLA Assay result from a single replicate of sample 6043. The reflex assay erroneously indicated the presence of a 9T variant. One 5T and one 7T variant were also detected; thus, the genotype call was 5T/7T/9T. Sequencing confirmed that the sample contained a heterozygous 5T variant and the 7T normal allele. All other replicates of this sample produced the correct 5T/7T result.

# Retest Rate

Of the 804 sample replicates tested, a total of 20 $( 2 . 5 \% )$ required retest due to a poor reaction or PCR failure, or GeneMapper quality flags that indicated that the sample should be repeated when data results were considered questionable or invalid. For samples that did not initially report a genotype result, the correct result was reporte upon repeat testing.

Additionally, injection failures on the genetic analyzer were observed for 53 samples $( 6 . 6 \% )$ . The injections were repeated using the same sample-specific electrophoretic mixes that were prepared for the original injection. Therefore, the genotype call was classified as 'delayed' since repeating the assay was not required. In some cases, the user chose to limit the reinjection to the individual affected samples. In other cases, all samples within the capillary run or entire plate were reinjected, based on convenience. Reinjections were usually performed immediately after the previous run and were always performed within 48 hours of the addition of Hi-Di™m Formamide to the OLA sample. Upon reinjection, valid results were obtained for each sample. In cases where partial or entire plates were reinjected, the initial, correct genotype calls did not change upon reinjection.

# Reproducibility

To determine clinical reproducibility for the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay, a singleblinded study was conducted at three external test sites. Each test site had one set of instruments, two operators, and three lots of reagents. Each site also processed the same set of samples. The samples tested included genomic DNA obtained from frozen whole blood and frozen pellets from commercially available cell lines. The expected genotype call for every unique sample was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

# Sample Set

The set of 144 reproducibility study samples consisted of three (3) replicates each of forty-eight (48) unique genomic DNA samples derived from frozen whole blood $( \mathsf { n } = 2 5 ^ { \cdot }$ ), and frozen cell line pellets $( \mathtt { n } = 2 3$ ). The frozen whole blood samples contained homozygous normal alleles for each of the targeted loci within the Core OLA Assay, whereas the frozen cell line specimens contained either a single heterozygous mutation, a single homozygous mutation, or compound heterozygous mutations for CF. Each of three test sites received sufficient aliquots of each test panel member to conduct three independent assays (3 assays x 144 samples/assay $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \delta \pi } } } } }$ 432 results per site). Each assay was performed with a different reagent lot $( \mathfrak { n } = 3$ )on a different day. Reflex testing was performed as indicated per results of the Core OLA Assay and in accordance with ACMG guidelines. These details are summarized in the following table:

# Reproducibility Results

Results of the study indicate that the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay has a reproducibility of $100 \%$ , with zero (0) missed calls, as shown in the Reproducibility Table below.

Statistical analysis of all 1,296 results within the sample set (48 samples x 27 replicates) indicates $100 \%$ agreement between the Core OLA Assay and sequencing, with a one-sided $9 5 \%$ lower confidence limit equal to $9 9 . 8 \%$ .

Based on results of the Core OLA Assay, two samples required reflex testing. Sample #S009346 had a homozygous delF508 call by the Core OLA Assay. Both sequencing and Exon 10 reflex testing for all replicates (9) confirmed the homozygous delF508 call. The Core OLA Assay result for sample #S009369 contained an R117H mutation, therefore, reflex testing for variants in the polythymidine tract on Intron 8 (i.e., 5/7/9T) was conducted. Specifically, the 5T and 9T variant alleles were identified in this sample. Both sequencing and reflex testing results were in $100 \%$ agreement for all calls (18).

Each of the three reagent lots was tested on a different day at each site. Comparisons by site, operator and reagent lot were calculated for each of the 23 mutations tested. There were a total of 1,296 test results for each mutation (48 samples x 27 replicates).

Exon 10 reflex testing detected all polymorphisms as "present" or "not present," and 5/7/9T reflex testing detected all variants as "present" or "not present," with a precision of $100 \%$ These results are limited to two samples and 81 test results for each sample (27 sample

replicates x 3 tests each). The following table summarizes the precision results for the two reflex assays.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number: K062028

Device Name: Celera Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay

Indications for Use:

The Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic device used to genotype a panel of mutations and variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in genomic DNA isolated from human whole blood specimens. The panel includes mutations and variants recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2004) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG, 2005) plus additional multiethnic mutations. The Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay provides information intended to be used for carrier screening in adults of reproductive age, as an aid in newborn screening, and in confirmatory diagnostic testing in newborns and children.

This test is not indicated for use in fetal diagnostic or pre-implantation testing. This test is also not indicated for stand-alone diagnostic purposes.
