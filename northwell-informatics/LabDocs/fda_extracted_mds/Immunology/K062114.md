# 510(k) Summary - COBAS INTEGRA Ceruloplasmin K062114

# Introduction

According to the requirements of 21 CFR 807.92, the following information provides sufficient detail to understand the basis for a determination of substantial equivalence

# Purpose

Due to a misinterpretation caused in part by an error on the FDA classification database available on line, which had erroneously listed Ceruloplasmin as exempt until June 2005, this test system was erroneously considered by us to be exempt during its original application to the COBAS INTEGRA and Roche Hitachi families of analyzers. It was erroneously listed by us as exempt in the reagent lists accompanying the FDA-cleared premarket notification submissions for the COBAS INTEGRA 800 and Roche Hitachi 917 analyzers. The COBAS INTEGRA family of analyzers was cleared under K95 1595 and the Roche/Hitachi family of analyzers under K953239/A005.

In order to correct this error, Roche now submits a traditional 510(k) featuring performance data on the Integra 700 analyzer. The assay has already been applied to all Integra family members and to the Roche/Hitachi family of analyzers using the Application Validation Protocol submitted as part of this 510(k).

# Device Name

Proprietary name: COBAS INTEGRA Ceruloplasmin

Common name: Ceruloplasmin

Classification name: Ceruloplasmin immunological test system

# Device Description

The COBAS INTEGRA Ceruloplasmin cassette (CERU) contains an in vitro diagnostic reagent system intended for use on COBAS INTEGRA SYSTEMS for the quantitative immunological determination of human ceruloplasmin in serum and plasma. The calibrator and control were cleared via K954992.

Measurements of ceruloplasmin aid in the diagnosis of copper metabolism disorders.

The test principle is an immunoturbidimetric assay. The calibrator is Serumproteins T Standard and the recommended control material is the Serumproteins T Control.

# Intended use

The COBAS INTEGRA Ceruloplasmin cassette (CERU) contains an in vitro diagnostic reagent system intended for use on COBAS INTEGRA SYSTEMS for the quantitative immunological determination of human ceruloplasmin in serum and plasma (test CERU3, 0-666).

# Predicate Device

We claim substantial equivalence to the DakoCytomation assay for Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Ceruloplasmin cleared as K812486.

Dear Ms. Harper:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 1, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The
