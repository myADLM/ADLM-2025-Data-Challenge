# 510(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

# Intended use

The Wako LBA DCP immunological test system is an in vitro device that consists of reagents and an automated instrument used to quantitatively measure by immunochemical techniques DCP in human serum. The device is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid in the risk assessment of patients with chronic liver disease for progression to hepatocellular carcinoma in conjunction with other laboratory findings, imaging studies and clinical assessment.

# Summary and explanation of the test

Prothrombin is a vitamin K dependent blood coagulation factor that is formed in the liver. It contains 10 y-carboxy-glutamic acid (Gla) residues on its aminoterminal domain, which are synthesized from glutamic acid (Glu) residues by vitamin K dependent y-glutamyl carboxylase in the posttranslational process. When the deficiency of vitamin K or the ingestion of vitamin K antagonists (Warfarin sodium), the Des-y-carboxy-Prothrombin (DCP) is found in patients. DCP was reported by Liebman, H.A., in 1984 as a specific tumor marker that increases in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A number of reports have shown elevations in serum DCP level in patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. And DCP does not correlate with AFP and AFP-L3. DCP and AFP$1 3 \%$ are considered complementary assays for assessing for the risk of developing HCC. When used in combination, a greater number of patients at risl of developing HCC can be identified resulting in more treatment options for a larger number of patients.

The Wako LBA DCP assay is test kit for the quantitative determination of DCP based on a new method, LBA (Liquid-phase Binding Assay). The method uses a liquid-phase binding reaction between antigen and antibody and separates bound and free forms by column chromatography without a need for a solid phase. LBA DCP can offer fully automatic and highly precise DCP measurement by using an automated analyzer "LiBASys".

# Principle of the method

This reagent consists of anti-DCP monoclonal antibodies and anti-Prothrombin monoclonal antibodies which are used as Fab' molecules and a substrate for fluorophotometric measurement. When DCP in a sample reacts with anion conjugated anti-Prothrombin monoclonal antibody and peroxidase (horseradish) labeled anti-DCP monoclonal antibody, which binds to all the present DCP molecules it forms an immune complex shown in Fig. 1.

[Anion conjugated anti-Prothrombin monoclonal antibody]

The reaction mixture, which includes the above complex, is introduced into an anion-exchange column. The immune complex fractions are eluted into the reaction cup. Then the POD activity of the complex is measured. The POD activity is determined as the increase of fluorescence intensity of 5, 5'- diacetoamide $_ { 2 - 2 } ,$ -bisphenol formed by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide and 4- acetoamidophenol. These values are compared to fluorescence intensity of known standards for DCP concentration, in order to obtain the DCP values of samples.

Longitudinal data was collected on 441 subjects, 324 males and 117 females. The risk of developing HCC among patients with an elevation of $\mathsf { D C P } \geq 7 . 5$ Y $\mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ and among patients without such an elevation is calculated, along with their $9 5 \%$ confidence interval. The risk of developing HCC with an elevated DCP test is $3 6 . 5 \%$ The risk of developing HCC with a negative DCP test result is $7 . 6 \%$ .Their ratio is 4.8, indicating a 4.8-fold increase of developing HCC given an elevated DCP test result.

Dear Ms. Creasy:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of January 31, 2007.

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
