EliATM Celikey IgG - New Device 510(k) Submission Section 9. Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

# Intended Use Statement of the New Device

EliA Celikey IgG is intended for the in vitro semi-quantitative measurement of IgG antibodies directed to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) in human serum and plasma. EliA Celikey IgG is based on recombinant human tissue transglutaminase as the antigen and is useful as an aid in the clinical diagnosis of patients with celiac disease. EliA Celikey IgG uses the EliA $\mathrm { I g G }$ method on the instrument ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250.

Special condition for use statement The device is for prescription use only.

Special instrument requirements   
ImmunoCAP100/ImmunoCAP250 are fully automated immunoassay analyzers, that include software for evaluation of test results.

# General Description of the New Device

The new device belongs to a fully integrated and automated system for immunodiagnostic testing. It comprises a Fluorescence-Immunoassay test system using EliA single wells as the solid phase and is intended to be performed on the instruments ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250. The conjugate for the EliA IgG method is mouse anti-human IgG beta-galactosidase, which uses 4- Methylumbelliferyl-0D-Galactoside as substrate. The total IgG calibration is based on a set of six WHO-standardized IgG Calibrators derived from human serum. They are used to establish an initial calibration curve, which may be used for up to 28 days on additional assays and can be stored by the instrument. Each additional assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to recover in defined ranges to ensure that the stored calibration curve is still valid. The FluorescenceImmunoassay test system includes test-, method specific and general reagents that are packaged as separate units.

# Test Principle of the New Device

The EliA Celikey IgG Wells are coated with human recombinant tTG. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to tTG bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific $\mathrm { I g G }$ is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# Device Comparison

The new and the predicate device both represent non-competitive solid phase EIAs.   
Both IVDs are used as an aid in the diagnosis of Coeliac Disease.

# Laboratory equivalence

The comparability of predicate device and new device is supported by a data set including

results obtained within a comparison study between new and predicate device   
results obtained for clinically defined sera results obtained for samples from apparently healthy subjects (normal population).

In summary, all available data support that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Mann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Ac (ct) that onot require aproval  a preakt approval applicatn (MA).Yoy, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
