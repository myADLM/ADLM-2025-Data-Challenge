# Intended Use Statement of the New Device

EliA Celikey IgA is intended for the in vitro semi-quantitative measurement of IgA antibodies directed to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) in human serum and plasma. EliA Celikey IgA is based on recombinant human tissue transglutaminase as antigen and is useful as an aid in the clinical diagnosis of patients with celiac disease. EliA Celikey IgA uses the EliA IgA method on the instrument ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250.

EliA Celiac Control is intended for laboratory use in monitoring the performance of in vitro measurement of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and gliadin with ImmunoCAP 100 or 250 using the EliA IgG or IgA method.

Special condition for use statement The device is for prescription use only.

Special instrument requirements   
ImmunoCAP100/ImmunoCAP250 are fully automated immunoassay analyzers, which include software for evaluation of test results.

# General Description of the New Device

The new device belongs to a fully integrated and automated system for immunodiagnostic testing. It comprises a Fluorescence-Immunoassay test system using EliA single wells as the solid phase and is intended to be performed on the instruments ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250. The conjugate for the EliA IgA method is mouse anti-human IgA beta-galactosidase, which uses 4- Methylumbelliferyl-BD-Galactoside as substrate. The total IgA calibration is based on a set of six WHO-standardized IgA Calibrators derived from human serum. They are used to establish an initial calibration curve, which may be used for up to 28 days on additional assays and can be stored by the instrument. Each additional assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to recover in defined ranges to ensure that the stored calibration curve is still valid. The FluorescenceImmunoassay test system includes test-, method specific and general reagents that are packaged as separate units.

# Test Principle of the New Device

The EliA Celikey IgA Wells are coated with human recombinant tTG. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to tTG bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgA antibodies (EliA IgA Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgA is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# Device Comparison

The new and the predicate device both represent non-competitive solid phase EIAs.   
Both IVDs are used as an aid in the diagnosis of Coeliac Disease.

Re: k062787 Trade/Device Name: EliA™M Celikey IgA Immunoassay, EliATM Celiac Control Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.5660 Regulation Name: Tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies immunological test system, Antigen and Control Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: MVM Dated: September 15, 2006 Received: September 18, 2006

Dear Mr. Mann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listng o devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (1CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
