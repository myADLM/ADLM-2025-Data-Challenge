# Description of Device

The IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 and IMMULITE 2000 High Sensitivity CRP is a solid-phase, chemiluminescent immunometric assay. The assay utilizes a $1 / 4$ -inch polystyrene bead coated with anti-ligand. The bead is co-incubated with sample, murine monoclonal anti-CRP, and alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine)-conjugated to rabbit polyclonal anti-CRP in buffer for 30 minutes on each IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 and IMMULITE 2000 platform. Unbound enzyme conjugate is removed by a centrifugal wash procedure. Substrate is added and the resulting chemiluminescence is read in the luminometer.

# Indications for Use

The IMMULITE®/IMMULITE® 1000 High Sensitivity CRP assay is intended for use as follows:

For in vitro diagnostic use with the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Analyzer — for the quantitative measurement of C-Reactive protein (CRP) in serum or plasma as an aid in the detection and evaluation of infection, tissue injury and inflammatory disorders, and associated diseases. Measurements may also be used as an aid in the identification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements when used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndrome may be useful as an independent marker for recurrent events in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndrome.

The AHA/CDC Scientific Statement concerning inflammation and cardiovascular markers reports that hsCRP values $< 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ are low risk for cardiovascular disease prediction; values between $1 { - } 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ are average risk for cardiovascular disease prediction; and values $> 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ are high risk for cardiovascular disease prediction.

Increases in CRP are non-specific and should not be interpreted without a complete clinical history..

Consider these limits as guidelines only. Each laboratory should establish its own reference ranges.

# Conclusions

The IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 and IMMULITE 2000 hsCRP assays demonstrate substantial equivalence to the Dade Behring N High Sensitivity CRP assay.

The IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 and IMMULITE 2000 hsCRP assays are thereby safe and effective for the following intended use:

Measurements may also be used as an aid in the identification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements when used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndrome may be useful as an independent marker for recurrent events in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndrome.

Dear Ms. Deborah L. Morris:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Offce of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490.
