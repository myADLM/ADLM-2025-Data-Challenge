# L. Test Principle:

IMMULITE 1000/2000 High Sensitivity CRP is a solid-phase, chemiluminescent immunometric assay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with anti-ligand. The liquid phase consists of ligand-labeled anti-CRP murine monoclonal antibody and alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to rabbit polyclonal anti-CRP antibody in buffer.

The manually prediluted patient sample (1-in-101) for the Immulite 1000 and the automatically prediluted patient sample for the Immulite 2000 and the reagent are incubated together with the coated bead for 30 minutes. During this time, the CRP in the sample forms the antibody sandwich complex with the ligand-labeled anti-CRP murine monoclonal antibody in the reagent and the anti-ligand on the bead. The

enzyme conjugate then binds to the immobilized CRP. Unbound patient sample and enzyme conjugate are then removed by a centrifugal wash. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the reaction tube containing the bead and the signal is generated in proportion to the bound enzyme.

The assay or assay performance has not changed, but new assay performance characteristics have been established for the new indications and are presented below as applicable.

IMMULITE 2000 and IMMULITE $2 5 0 0 ^ { 1 }$ This study was performed using five IMMULITE 2000 instruments, four IMMULITE 2500 instruments, two IMMULITE 2000 hsCRP kit lots and two IMMULITE 2500 kit lots over a four day period. The IMMULITE 2000 and IMMULITE 2500 hsCRP assays are the very same reagents in two different colored boxes run under the same assay and instrument methodology, therefore the data generated on both IMMULITE 2000 and IMMULITE 2500

were pooled.

Stability and expected values are the subject of k003372

# d. Detection limit:

The IMMULITE family of instruments High Sensitivity CRP assays’ analytical sensitivity is $0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ as previously reported and cleared in Premarket Notification 510(k) K003372 for IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 and IMMULITE 2000.

Additional precision performance studies for determination of functional sensitivity were conducted guided by CLSI document EP5-A2. (Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.) and CLSI document EP17-A (Protocols for the Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline.)

Five serum pools were prepared at hsCRP values from $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ (below the analytical sensitivity of $0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ to the expected $10 \%$ CV functional sensitivity of $0 . 3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

The functional sensitivity (lowest concentration that can be measured with a total $C V \%$ of $10 \%$ ) is $0 . 2 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ on the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000. The Package Insert claim for the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 hsCRP is 0.3 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ .

The functional sensitivity (lowest concentration that can be measured with a total $C V \%$ of $10 \%$ ) is $0 . 1 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ on the IMMULITE 2000. The Package Insert claim for the IMMULITE 2000 is $0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Subject of k003372

The High Sensitivity/Cardiovascular claim was further evaluated using the same data set from the previously reviewed study in the range no greater than $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , by linear regression $\mathrm { ( N = } 1 8 9$ , range 0.1 to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ by Dade Behring, slope = 0.9445 95%CI 0.9235 to 0.9654, intercept $= 0 . 0 2 4 0 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } - 0 . 0 2 8 5$ to 0.0765)

Mean Dade Behring: $1 . 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ Mean IMMULITE: $1 . 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ $b$ . Matrix comparison: Not Applicable subject of k003372

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Subject device showed comparable analytical performance in its original submission (k003372) and has provided updated performance information to the DADE BEHRING, N HIGH SENSITIVITY CRP (k991385/k033908). The DADE BEHRING, N HIGH SENSITIVITY CRP assay was the device used in the clinical studies supporting an indication for cardiovascular use.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Expected high sensitivity CRP values for healthy individuals have been established in the literature at $< 3 \mathrm { m g / L } ^ { 2 }$ .

The AHA/CDC Scientific Statement3 concerning inflammation and cardiovascular markers reports that hsCRP • values $< 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ are low risk for cardiovascular disease prediction; • values between $1 { - } 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ are average risk for cardiovascular disease prediction; and values $> 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ are high risk for cardiovascular disease prediction.
