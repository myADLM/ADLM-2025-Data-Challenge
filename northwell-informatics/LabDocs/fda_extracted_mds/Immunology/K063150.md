# SpeciCal

For in vitro diagnostic use on T60 analyzer. SpeciCal protein calibrator is used as a stock calibrator for both quantification of specific proteins in serum and plasma by immunoturbidimetry and for antigen excess detection using methods defined by Thermo Electron Oy.

# SpeciTrol

For in vitro diagnostic use on T60 analyzer. SpeciTrol is intended to be used as an assayed control serum to monitor precision of specific protein tests defined by Thermo Electron Oy.

# Specitrol High

For in vitro diagnostic use on T60 analyzer. Specitrol High is intended to be used as an assayed control serum to monitor precision of specific protein tests defined by Thermo Electron Oy.

# E. Indications for use

The complement C3 and complement C4 are intended for quantative in-vitro diagnostic determination of the complement C3 and C4 concentration in human serum using T60 Clinical Chemistry Analyzers. C3 and C4 measurements may aid in the diagnosis of immunologic disorders, especially those associated with deficiencies of complement components.

# F. Substantial Equivalence

Bayer Corporation items: Bayer Clinical Method for ADVIA 1650 Complement C3 (C3) Bayer Clinical Method for ADVIA 1650 Complement C4 (C4)

Predicate devices for the Specitrol and Specitrol High controls: Liquid Assayed Immunology Controls 1 and 3, Medical Analysis Systems USA, k960824.

# G. Substantial equivalence -similarities

Complement C3 is substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in United States. We claim equivalence to the Bayer Clinical Method for ADVIA 1650 Complement C3 (C3)

Complement C4 is substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in United States. We claim equivalence to the Bayer Clinical Method for ADVIA 1650 Complement C4 (C4)

Specical is substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in United States. We claim equivalence to the Bayer Liquid Specific Protein Calibrator.

Specitrol and Specitrol High are substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in United States. We claim equivalence to the Medical Analysis Systems Liquid Assayed Immunology Controls 1 and 3.

Re: k063150 Trade/Device Name: Complement C3, Complement C4, Specical Calibrator, Specitrol Control, Specitrol High Control Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.5240 Regulation Name: Complement components immunological test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: CZW, DBI, JIX, JJY Dated: November 7, 2006 Received: February 7, 2007

Dear Päivi Sormunen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 -

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
