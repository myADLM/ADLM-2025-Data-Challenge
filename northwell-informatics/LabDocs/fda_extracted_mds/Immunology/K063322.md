4. Device Description:

# Dimension Vista™ TRF $\ F l e x ^ { \otimes }$ reagent cartridge

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# Dimension Vista" Protein 1 Calibrator

Protein 1 Calibrator is a multi-analyte, liquid, human serum based product containing C3 complement, C4 complement, immunoglobulin A (IGA), immunoglobulin G (IGG), immunoglobulin M (IGM), prealbumin (PREALB) and Transferrin.

Dimension Vista" Protein 1 Control L, M and H

Protein 1 Control L, M and H are multi-analyte, liquid, human serum based products containing C3 complement, C4 complement, immunoglobulin A (IGA), immunoglobulin G (IGG), immunoglobulin M (IGM), prealbumin (PREALB) and transferrin.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

# Dimension Vista " TRF $F l e x ^ { \textcircled { \circ } }$ reagent cartridge:

The TRF method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative determination of transferrin in human serum, heparinized plasma or EDTA plasma on the Dimension Vista System. Measurements of transferrin aid in the diagnosis of malnutrition, acute inflammation, infection, and iron deficiency anemia.

# Dimension Vista" Protein 1 Calibrator:

PROT1 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the C3 complement (C3), C4 complement (C4), Immunoglobulin A (IGA), Immunoglobulin G (IGG), Immunoglobulin M (IGM), Prealbumin (PREALB) and Transferrin (TRF) methods on the Dimension Vista® System.

Dimension Vista" Protein 1 Control L, M and H:

PROT1 CON L, M and H are assayed intralaboratory quality controls for assessment of precision and analytical bias in the determination of C3 Complement (C3), C4 Complement (C4), immunoglobulin A (IGA), immunoglobulin G (IGG), immunoglobulin M (IGM), prealbumin (PREALB) and transferrin (TRF) on the Dimension Vista® System.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Dimension Vista™" TRF assay, like the Dade Behring N Antisera to Human Transferrin assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of transferrin in human serum and plasma.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The Dimension Vista" TRF assay was compared to the Dade Behring N Antisera to Human Transferrin assay on the BN ProSpec® System by evaluating serum and plasma samples with concentrations ranging from 0.79 to 5.43 g/L. Regression analysis of these results yielded the following equation:

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must

comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
