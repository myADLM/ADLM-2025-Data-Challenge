# Device Description:

The configurations of the HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit consist of the components summarized in Tables I and II in main 510(k) submission. Each kit is supplied with Package Insert which contains instruction for use and all the necessary information on the reagents needed to run the tests that are sold separately. Each Package Insert also contains information on storage conditions, shelf-life and signs of deterioration of the kit components and the reagents sold separately, and on interpretation of the results.

# Intended Use:

The HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit is designed for the qualitative detection and identification of the different phenotypes of Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT). Phenotyping results in conjunction with clinical findings and other laboratory assays aid in the diagnosis of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency The analysis is performed on human sera separated into electrophoretic patterns ready for qualitative analysis. The procedure includes isoelectrofocusing on agarose gel, performed on the semi-automatic HYDRASYS system, followed by immunofixation with antiAlpha-l antitrypsin antiserum. The use of enzyme labeled anti-Alpha-1 antitrypsin antiserum enhanced the detection and identification of the different phenotypes.

# Substantial Equivalence Discussion:

For qualitative characterization of Alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotypes by isoelectric focusing and immunofixation with peroxidase labeled antiserum, the HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit was compared to a predicate technique currently used in clinical diagnostic laboratories, which is based on polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing followed by staining of separated Alpha-1 antitrypsin isoforms with Coomassie Blue staining solution. These two techniques were found, experimentally and conceptually, substantially equivalent in assay principle, function, use, safety and effectiveness.

In their concept and principle, and the techniques and the procedures used, the SEBIA HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING tests are also similar to other products currently marketed in the USA, notably to SEBIA HYDRAGEL 3 & 9 CSF ISOFOCUSING kits.

HYDRASYS uses semi-automated electrophoresis system, such as described in the 510(k) premarket notification Ref. No. K033277 for which FDA clearance was issued on November 4, 2003

# Assessment of Performance:

Performance study and comparisons of the HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING KITS with polyacrylamide gels isoelectric focusing and comassie blue staining was done.

For Alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotypes characterization, the SEBIA HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING in vitro diagnostic test is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, a polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing technique currently used in clinical diagnostic laboratories in the United States. Both tests are intended for qualitative analysis of Alpha1 antitrypsin isoforms from human serum samples. All these products utilize isoelectric focusing to separate the isoforms on a suitable medium. The separated isoforms are then visualized by immunological reactions with a peroxidase labeled antiserum and a staining reagent or by Coomassie Blue staining solution. In both tests, the resulting patterns are evaluated visually.

Data are presented documenting substantial equivalency of the SEBIA and the polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing technique for Alpha-l antitrypsin phenotype characterization. These devices were found experimentally and conceptually equivalent in assay principle, function, use, safety and effectiveness.

# Other testing:

A - Concordance study   
B - Within-gel reproducibility   
C - Gel-to-gel and lot-to-lot reproducibility   
D - Sensitivity study

# Testing for Controls:

A- Validation testing: -Reproducibility within gel and, -Reproducibility between gels on 4 gels and on 12 gels.

B-Stability testing

# Conclusion:

Performance studies of HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING yielded satisfactory results in terms of concordance, reproducibility, sensitivity, validation and stability.

Dear Ms. Anderson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
