# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): The HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit is designed for the qualitative detection and identification of the different phenotypes of Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT). Phenotyping results in conjunction with clinical findings and other laboratory assays aid in the diagnosis of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The analysis is performed on human sera separated into electrophoretic patterns ready for qualitative analysis. The procedure includes isoelectrofocusing on agarose gel, performed on the semi-automatic HYDRASYS system, followed by immunofixation with anti-Alpha-1 antitrypsin antiserum. The use of enzyme labeled anti-Alpha-1 antitrypsin antiserum enhanced the detection and identification of the different phenotypes. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

The A1AT Controls are designed for the migration control of the human Alpha-1 antitrypsin isoforms pattern obtained with HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING\* isoelectric-focusing procedure. The A1AT Controls should be used as human sera. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None provided.

# L. Test Principle:

A1AT is a polymorphic glycoprotein found in normal human serum. It belongs to a group of proteins which inhibit a variety of human proteases including trypsin, cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, etc. A1AT is mainly produced in hepatic cells and by immune system. The gene that encodes A1AT is located at a single locus on chromosome 14 and has three alleles designated by letters with M for normal, Z and S for deficiency, and null. Individuals with ZZ, SZ, MZ or null phenotypes show increased risks of disease which may vary in patients exhibiting the same phenotype. A1AT deficiency is a genetic disorder first described in patients with pulmonary emphysema.

The assay is carried out in two stages: isoelectrofocusing on agarose gel to fractionate the proteins in the serum samples and immunofixation with enzyme (peroxidase)-labelled antiAlAT antiserum to detect the different phenotypes of AlAT. The semi-automated HYDRASYS system performs all the steps needed to obtain gels ready for interpretation.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The within-run gel reproducibility was determined by testing eight samples fifteen or eighteen times each on a single gel of 15 or 18 tracks. Two gels of the same lot number were used in this study. Two normal serum samples with M1 and M1M2 phenotypes and six pathological serum samples with MS, SS, MZ, ZZ, MX phenotypes reproduced the corresponding phenotype correctly.

The between-run gel reproducibility was determined by testing fifteen samples and three controls twelve times on two lots of gels. Seven normal serum samples (2 M1M2, 4 MM, 1M1M3); eight pathological samples (2 MS, 1 SS, 1 MZ, 1 ZZ, 1 SZ, 1 MX, 1 MI [I allele is rare and associated with decreased A1AT levels]); and three controls (1 normal MM and 2 pathological MZ and SZ) reproduced the corresponding phenotype correctly.

The within-run and between-run antiserum reproducibility studies were determined by testing fifteen samples and three controls on four different lots of antiserum. The 18 samples were applied in 18 tracks of 4 gels. Nine normal samples with MM phenotype; six pathological samples with 2 SS, 2 M2Z, 1 MP, $1 \textbf { M }$ undetermined variant; and three controls with 1 normal MM and 2 pathological MZ and SZ reproduced the corresponding phenotype correctly.

The within-run and between-run control reproducibility studies were determined by testing each of the three controls (MM, MZ, SZ phenotypes) six times in four gels for two days. All three controls reproduced the corresponding phenotype correctly.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): No reference standards and method available. Stability: The expiration date claims for the products are as follows:

Expected values: Qualitative Interpretation of normal pattern for A1AT ‘MM’ phenotype fraction.

d. Detection limit:

The detection limit was determined by testing diluted A1AT (concentration of 27 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ with pathological ZZ phenotype) down to $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The ZZ phenotype was detectable at $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference study: Two studies were performed. For each interfering substance, four concentrations were tested. Study 1 consisted of aliquots from one normal serum pool sample (normal MM phenotype) and three controls (1 normal MM and 2 pathological MZ and SZ). One set of these aliquots was spiked with hemoglobin up to $0 . 3 5 { \mathrm { g } } / { \mathrm { d L } }$ and another set with bilirubin up to $0 . 2 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ . Study 2 consisted of aliquots from six normal MM serum and three controls (1 normal MM and 2 pathological MZ and SZ). One set of these aliquots were spiked with total cholesterol up to $6 . 9 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and another with triglycerides up to $8 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ . No interference was observed.

i. Study design: A total of 68 serum samples were tested on HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit using HYDRASIS apparatus and on polyacrylamide gels using a standard isoelectric focusing apparatus. Forty-one (41) were pathological serum samples, 4 unclear diagnoses, and 23 were normal serum samples. There was $100 \%$ agreement between the two methods.

\*Equivocals were excluded from the calculation. The four equivocal samples were from patients with normal A1AT quantitative measurements being ruled out for infertility, pulmonary and hepatic disorder and congenital deficiency. The A1AT phenotypes were IM or FM, IM, IM, and heterogeneous pattern respectively.

\*\*The two false positive samples were from asymptomatic patients, one with a diagnosis of infertility and the other, panniculitis and the A1AT phenotypes were MZ and MS respectively. These two patients (without underlying pulmonary or hepatic disorders) are assumed to be carriers of S and Z deficiency alleles.

Sensitivity: $100 \%$ (39/39) Specificity: $92 \%$ (23/25) Overall percent Agreement: 97% (62/64)

b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable): Not applicable.
