Good Biotech Corp. Transferrin TIA is a ready to use reagent for the quantitative determination of transferrin in human serum by turbidimetric immunoassay (TIA). When transferrin of the serum sample encounters with duck anti-transferrin antibody, the agglutination based on the antigen-antibody reaction increases the turbidity of the sample. The value of the absorbance change at $5 0 5 \ \mathsf { n m }$ is proportional to the transferrin concentration of the sample and is recorded by a general chemistry autoanalyzer. Then, the actual transferrin concentration of the serum sample is determined by interpolation of the calibration curve obtained by standard samples with known transferrin concentrations.

# Intended Use

# Reagent:

Good Biotech Corp. Transferrin test system is intended to be used for the quantitative determination of transferrin in human serum by turbidimetric immunoassay (TIA). Measurement of transferrin levels aids in the diagnosis of malnutrition, acute inflammation, infection, and red blood cell disorders, such as iron deficiency anemia.

# Calibrator:

Good Biotech Corp. Transferrin Calibrator Set is intended to be used with Transferrin TIA for the quantitative determination of transferrin in serum samples.

# Control:

Good Biotech Corp. Transferrin Controls are intended to be used as the assayed quality control material for transferrin analysis.

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

# Substantial Equivalence

Comparative performance studies conducted on 82 serum samples yielded high correlation coefficients upon comparison of the GBC Transferrin TIA system and the predicate devices,

Roche Tina-quant Transferrin ver.2. The results are summarized below:   

<table><tr><td>Comparative Method</td><td>Slope</td><td>Intercept (mg/dL)</td><td>Correlation Coefficient</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>Roche Tina-quant Transferrin ver.2</td><td>0.927</td><td>19.784</td><td>0.992</td><td>82</td></tr></table>

# Conclusion

Good Biotech Corp. Transferrin TIA system, calibrator set and controls are substantially equivalent to the predicate devices based on their intended purposes, design and the comparison performance results.

Dear Mr. Chiou:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 -

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
