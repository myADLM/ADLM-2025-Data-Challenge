# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy; Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators; Shelf Life of Medical Devices, FOD Number 415; CLSI EP14-A Evaluation of Matrix Effects, Approved Guideline.

# L. Test Principle:

When a sample containing transferrin is mixed with the duck anti-transferrin antibodies, the resulting agglutination based on the antigen-antibody reaction increases the turbidity of the sample. The value of the absorbance change at $5 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the transferrin concentration of the sample and is recorded by the instrument. The transferrin concentration of the serum sample is determined by comparison to a standard curve. The calibration curve is generated by running 6 standards with known concentrations.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three samples with three different levels of transferrin were prepared. For within run precision, each level was assayed 10 times.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity: To cover the low and high ends of the measuring range, dilutions were made of the 100 and the $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ calibrators. Linear regression analyses yielded $\mathtt { R } ^ { 2 }$ values of 0.9995 and 0.9982 for the low range and the high range respectively.

Prozone Effect: Diluted samples were prepared from the transferrin standard $( 2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . No hook effect was observed for the tested specimens up to $2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ compared to the upper limit of the measuring range of 700 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The assay reportable range is from 10 to $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The recommended calibrators are standardized against the Certified Reference Material, CRM 470. The calibrators are assigned values of 0, 50, 100, 200, 400 and $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The zero calibrator is stable for 19 months and calibrators $5 0 - 7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ are stabile for 4 years unopened and at the recommended storage conditions of $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection Limit:

The detection limit was calculated as 2 SD above the mean response for the zero calibrator when assayed 20 times and was $0 . 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The detection limit claim is $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed by spiking different levels of each interferant into low and high transferrin serum samples. Percent recoveries ranged from 94.4 to $1 0 6 . 6 \%$ . The following concentrations of potential interferants were tested.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Serum samples from 82 patients were tested with the new device and the predicate. Transferrin values for the samples ranged from 33.0 to 648.5 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Linear Regression Analysis showed: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 2 7 \mathrm { x } + 1 9 . 7 8 4 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ with a correlation coefficient of $\dot { \mathrm { R } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 2$ .

The recommended reference interval is $2 0 0 { - } 3 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 2 . 0 { - } 3 . 6 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ . The interval may vary with the populations studied and individual laboratories should establish their own. The reference range is based on the published article, Dati F, et al. Consensus of a group of professional societies and diagnostic companies on guidelines for interim reference ranges for 14 proteins in serum based on the standardization against the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference material (CRM 470).
