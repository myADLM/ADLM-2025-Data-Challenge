# Intended Use Statement of the New Device / EliA Gliadin IgA

EliA Gliadin IgA is intended for the in vitro semi-quantitative measurement of IgA antibodies directed to gliadin in serum or plasma to aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings. EliA Gliadin IgA uses the EliA IgA method on the instrument ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250.

EliA Celiac Control is intended for laboratory use in monitoring the performance of in vitro measurement of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and gliadin with ImmunoCAP 100 or 250 using the EliA IgG or IgA method.

Special condition for use statement The device is for prescription use only.

Special instrument requirements

ImmunoCAP100/ImmunoCAP250 are fully automated immunoassay analyzers, which include software for evaluation of test results.

# General Description of the New Device

The new device belongs to a fully integrated and automated system for immunodiagnostic testing. It comprises a Fluorescence-Immunoassay test system using EliA single wells as the solid phase and is intended to be performed on the instruments ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250. The conjugate for the EliA IgA method is mouse anti-human IgA beta-galactosidase, which uses 4- Methylumbelliferyl-BD-Galactoside as substrate. The total IgA calibration is based on a set of six WHO-standardized IgA Calibrators derived from human serum. They are used to establish an initial calibration curve, which may be used for up to 28 days on additional assays and can be stored by the instrument. Each additional assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to be measured in defined ranges to check whether the stored calibration curve is still valid. The FluorescenceImmunoassay test system includes test, method specific, and general reagents that are packaged as separate units.

# Test Principle of the New Device

The EliA Gliadin IgA Wells are coated with gliadin antigen. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to gliadin bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labelled antibodies against human IgA antibodies (EliA IgA Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the

more specific IgA is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# Device Comparison

The new and the predicate device both represent non-competitive solid phase EIAs. . Both IVDs are used as an aid in the diagnosis of Celiac Disease, in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.

# Laboratory equivalence

The comparability of predicate device and new device is supported by a data set including

results obtained within a comparison study between new and predicate device   
• results obtained for clinically defined sera results obtained for samples from apparently healthy subjects (normal population).

In summary, all available data support that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

# Intended Use Statement of the New Device / EliA Gliadin IgG

EliA Gliadin IgG is intended for the in vitro semi-quantitative measurement of IgG antibodies directed to gliadin in serum or plasma to aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease, in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings. EliA Gliadin IgG uses the EliA IgG method on the instruments ImmunbCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250.

Dear Mr. Mann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
