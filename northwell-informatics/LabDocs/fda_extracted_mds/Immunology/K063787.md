# COMMON NAME:

CFTR Gene Mutation Detection System

# CLASSIFICATION NAME:

Class I, 21 CFR 866.5900:Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Gene Mutation Detection System

# PREDICATE DEVICE:

Tag-It ™M Cystic Fibrosis Kit, K043011

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

InPlex™M CF Molecular Test amplifies specific regions of the CFTR gene in genomic DNA extracted from human whole peripheral blood. Each amplified DNA sample is subsequently mixed with Cleavase® enzyme and buffer then added to a loading port on an InPlex™M microfluidic card. An InPlex™m card contains eight sample-loading ports, each connected to 48 independent reaction chambers. Twenty-eight of these reaction chambers contain dried assay mixes specific for reporting the 23 ACMG/ACOG recommended CFTR mutations and variants. The remaining chambers consist of a "No Invader® Control", an Independent Quality Control, and several unused chambers.

After an InPlex™ card is loaded; the channels are mechanically sealed using a micro-fluidic card sealer, isolating each individual reaction chamber from all other chambers. The card is then incubated to allow individual Invader® reactions to occur. Following incubation, the card is read in a multi-well fluorometer and the raw signal data are imported into the InPlex™m CF Molecular Test Call Reporting Software for final result analysis.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

# ANALYTICAL STUDIES

# DNA Extraction Equivalency

Equivalency between four different DNA purification methodologies and their subsequent performance using the InPlex ™m CF Molecular Test was evaluated using 7 CF positive genomic DNA samples isolated from whole peripheral blood. Internal processing involved the purification of the same 7 samples using four commonly used, commercially available DNA extraction kits. These samples were also genotyped by DNA sequencing to confirm results.

Genotype calls as generated by the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test were compared to DNA sequencing based genotyping for all extraction methods.

The seven CF positive genomic DNA samples extracted from human peripheral whole blood using four different DNA extraction kits generated a total of 644 calls with 28 positive and 616 normal (negative) calls. Each extraction method provided 161 data points. All calls were concordant with the DNA sequencing based genotyping, providing an overall agreement of $100 \%$ $( 9 9 . 5 \%$ , 1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit).

# Fluorometer Equivalency

Equivalency between three multi-well fluorometers meeting indicated specifications in generating signal data from the InPlex ™M CF Molecular Test micro-fluidic card was determined using a panel of eight genomic DNA (gDNA) samples. The genomic DNA samples were either positive for a subset of the CFTR mutations listed as part of the ACMG recommended panel or normal. The eight samples were tested in triplicate providing a minimum of 1,656 data points (8 samples $\yen 23$ assays x 3 replicates $\times 3$ plate reader data).

All InPlex™ CF Molecular Test genotype results for the characterized gDNA samples described were concordant with DNA sequencing genotype results and in $100 \%$ $9 9 . 8 \%$ 1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit) agreement regardless of the fluorometer used.

# Incubator Equivalency

Three thermal incubators were evaluated for equivalency in generating concordant genotype data using the InPlex™M CF Molecular Test. A panel of eight gDNA samples was tested in triplicate using each incubator. A total of 1,656 data points (8 samples $\yen 23$ assays x 3 replicates $\textsf { x 3 }$ incubators - 552 data points per incubator) were generated in this study. The percent agreement to known genotypes was $9 9 . 8 8 \%$ $( 9 9 . 7 4 \%$ , 1-sided $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit).

# Interfering Substances

The performance of the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test was evaluated using eight, CF positive, genomic DNA samples isolated from whole peripheral blood in the absence (untreated) and presence (treated) of potential interfering substances. These substances included compounds that are endogenous to the blood sample matrix, compounds associated with blood collection and those that may result from sample preparation solutions. Depending on the nature of the substance, compounds were added either directly to the blood sample or to purified genomic DNA. Compounds added to the blood sample included bilirubin, triglycerides, and potassium EDTA (blood collection anti-coagulant). Compounds added to the purified genomic DNA sample included Qiagen® Buffer AW2 and hemoglobin. Following DNA extraction, eight whole peripheral blood samples were each tested as treated and untreated samples. The number of samples provided 1, 104 data points (8 blood samples x 23 assays $\textsf { x 6 }$ treatments).

The InPlex™ CF Molecular Test detected a total of 23 CFTR mutations. The genotype calls for the DNA samples containing an interfering substance were compared to the untreated samples for calculation of percent agreement. The results of this study showed that the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test achieved a $100 \%$ agreement $( 9 9 . 7 \%$ ,1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit)

between the genotypes of the samples containing potential interfering substances and bidirectional sequencing.

# Limit of Detection

An input genomic DNA concentration range was evaluated with the InPlex ™M CF Molecular Test. A panel of eight gDNA samples were prepared and tested at eight concentrations ranging from 1ng/μL to 150ng/μL (total input DNA range of 5-750ng $1$ reaction). The number of samples analyzed provided 1,472 data points (8 samples $\times 8$ concentrations $\yen 23$ assays). One hundred and eighty four genotype calls were generated per DNA concentration tested (8 samples x 1 concentration $\yen 23$ assays).

Genotype call results for all eight characterized samples were assessed for percent agreement at each concentration. The lower limit of detection was defined as the lowest DNA concentration in which a $9 9 \%$ or greater concordance with DNA sequencing was observed.

Based on these results, a 5ng/uL. DNA concentration (input DNA of 25ng) provided a percent agreement of $100 \%$ $( 9 8 . 4 \%$ , 1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit) with DNA sequencing qualifying it as the lower limit of detection. At the highest DNA concentration tested, $1 5 0 n g / \mu L$ EPY (input DNA of 750ng), a $9 9 . 5 \%$ percent agreement was obtained $( 9 8 . 6 \%$ , 1 sided lower $9 5 \%$ E Confidence Limit). The remaining DNA concentrations tested, 10, 20, 50, and $1 0 0 \mathsf { n g } / \mu \mu \mu$ (input DNA of 50, 100, 250 and 500ng) all obtained a 100 percent agreement $( 9 8 . 4 \%$ , 1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit) with expected results (see Table 3).

# Lot-to-Lot Equivalency

Equivalency between three lots of InPlex ™ CF Molecular Test kits was evaluated. A panel of 23 CFTR gDNA samples was tested in singlicate with each lot. Five hundred twenty-nine (529) genotype calls were generated for each lot tested (23 samples x 23 assays). All genotype calls were in $100 \%$ $( 9 9 . 4 \%$ 1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit) agreement to pre-characterized gDNA genotypes for each lot tested.

# Accuracy and Repeat Rate

Accuracy and repeat rate of the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test was determined by comparing InPlex™ CF Molecular Test genotyping results from of a panel of unique genomic DNA samples to bi-directional DNA sequence analysis. The sample panel tested consisted of genomic DNA samples isolated from peripheral whole blood and cell lines. A total of 23 CFTR mutations (as well as the IVS8-5T/7T/9T variants) were tested in this study. Genotype cals were compared between the DNA sequencing results and the InPlex ™M CF Molecular Test results for the calculation of overall agreement. In addition, positive and negative agreement for each mutation was calculated. The repeat rate was determined by the number of samples that generated an invalid genotype call for one or more mutations with the InPlex ™ CF Molecular Test on the first attempt.

This study was performed on a total of 123 unique samples containing 144 positive CFTR calls and 2808 normal (negative) CFTR calls.

The results of this study showed that the InPlex ™M CF Molecular Test achieved $9 9 . 9 6 \%$ (2951/2952) overall agreement $( 9 9 . 9 \%$ $\uparrow$ -sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit), $100 \%$ (144/144) positive agreement $( 9 7 . 9 \%$ , 1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit), and $9 9 . 9 6 \%$ (2807/2808) negative agreement $( 9 9 . 9 \%$ , 1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit). There was one "Invalid" call out of 123 tests, resulting in a repeat rate of $0 . 8 \%$ .This overall agreement of $9 9 . 9 6 \%$ is derived without repeat testing. No repeat testing was done to support this study.

Of the 123 unique samples in the initial study, four (4) samples (negative for R117H) were confirmed by sequencing as 7T/9T, but miscalled as 7T/7T by the InPlex ™M CF Molecular Test. The four miscaled samples were tested in a reproducibility study once a day for 5 days in conjunction with two 7T/7T and two 7T/9T samples, which were called correctly in the initial study. Upon retesting al four (4) miscalled samples gave the correct 7T/9T result on each of the five consecutive days. The root cause of the miscalls was determined to potentially be due to the InPlex cards failing to be rotated during incubation resulting in temperature inconsistencies InPlex" CF Molecular Test 510(k) Submission

(e.g., hot spots) near the heat source causing the 9T/7T ratio to fll below the cut-off for the 9T/7T call. The 7T/7T miscall was reproduced in one of the four samples experimentally.

# Freeze-Thaw Tolerance

A study was performed to establish the tolerance of the InPlex ™ CF Molecular Test to various freeze-thaw cycles. The InPlex™ CF Molecular Test kit were subjected to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 freeze-thaw cycles (test points) followed by functional testing of the product with control samples. Each freeze-thaw cycle consisted of freezing at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for at least 24 hours and thawing at room temperature for 30 minutes. For the multiple freeze-thaw cycles the cards were returned to $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ storage after 30 minutes at room temperature.

This study used a panel of 23 CFTR gDNA samples to evaluate the 23 CFTR mutations at each freeze thaw cycle. The samples generated 3,703 data points (23 samples x 23 assays $\textsf { \textsf { X } 7 }$ test points). Each Freeze-Thaw cycle generated 529 data points (23 samples $\yen 23$ assays).

The InPlex ™m CF Molecular Test achieved an overall percent agreement of $100 \%$ $9 9 . 9 2 \%$ ,1- sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit) as compared to DNA sequencing for all freeze-thaw cycles tested. See Table 4 below.

Eight or fewer freeze-thaw cycles for the InPlex ™ Molecular Test are recommended to ensure the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test maintains the ability to generate accurate genotype calls.

# Real-Time Stability

A was pom with heetiv tablish heal-imabili e Ple™ Molecular Test when stored under pre-defined storage conditions.

Three lots of the InPlex™ micro-fluidic cards and three lots of InPlex™ reagents were used to create three master lots of the InPlex ™ CF Molecular Test used in this study. A panel of seven CFTR gDNA samples and a panel of eight control samples comprised of pooled amplicons that cover the mutations in the InPlex™m CF Molecular Test were used to assess the performance. The samples were tested in duplicate with each lot for each storage condition at each time point.

Three lots of the $\ln P \mid e x ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Reagents are being maintained at the recommended storage temperature of $( - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C + 1 - 3 ^ { \circ } C )$ .

This study showed that multiple lots of the InPlex ™ CF Molecular Test produce equivalent results after storage for one month under the conditions tested. This is an ongoing study for which the results from future time points wil be used to extend shelf-lie dating.

# Reproducibility Study

Samples from pre-characterized commercially available reference materials were used to assess the reproducibility of the InPlex ™ CF Molecular Test. The study was conducted in two main phases, a proficiency phase, and a performance phase. The purpose of the proficiency phase was to ensure that each site had the required expertise in the fundamental methodologies so that meaningful assay reproducibility measures could be calculated from the data generated during the performance phase. The proficiency phase was carried out in two steps, one for the training on the product methodology, and one for the confirmation of proficiency. Proficiency testing was performed using eight (8) pre-characterized, gDNA samples. Technicians at each of three investigative sites ran the same DNA samples in duplicate. Data generated during this phase of the study was to demonstrate technician proficiency only and not used to demonstrate the clinical performance of the test.

The reproducibility testing for the performance phase was conducted using 23 samples containing mutations representing the ACMG recommended panel. Each site ran the same samples tested in duplicate by each technician, with tests being run on each of five (5) nonconsecutive days. There were two technicians at each test site.

Percent agreement ranged from $9 9 . 9 6 2 \%$ to $100 \%$ at each of the three sites and $9 9 . 9 8 7 \%$ to $9 9 . 9 9 4 \%$ across all sites. Out of 31,740 calls generated (23 [samples] $\yen 23$ [assays] x 2 [replicates] $\textsf { x 2 }$ [operators] $\textsf { \textsf { X } 5 }$ [days] x 3 [sites]), the within operator agreement for two calls at one site yielded an equivocal result for both replicates of a single mutation. The overall accuracy rate was 31,738/31, $7 4 0 = 9 9 . 9 9 4 \%$ (99.986, 1-sided lower $9 5 \%$ Confidence Limit).
