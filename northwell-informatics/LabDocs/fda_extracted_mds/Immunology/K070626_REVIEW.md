1. CLSI Guideline, EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved Guideline Second edition

2. CLSI Guideline, EP6-A Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods; Approved Guideline

3. CLSI Guideline, EP9-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline Second edition

# L. Test Principle:

Synchron Ssystems High Sensitivity Cardiac CRP is based on the highly sensitive near infared particle immunoassay rate methodology. An anti-CRP antibody-coated particle binds to CRP in the patient sample resulting in the formation of insoluble aggregates causing turbidity.

The chemical reaction scheme is as follows:

C-reactive protein (sample) $^ +$ Particle bound anti-CRP (antibody) [C-reactive protein (sample)-antibody complex]

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run and total imprecision studies were designed using CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Three levels of serum based controls were run twice a day, in duplicate, for 20 days on the UniCel DxC system. Mean, SD, and $\%$ CV are calculated and shown in the tables below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

i.) The linearity study was designed using the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Serial dilutions of high serum samples were used on the Synchron LX20 PRO system for this study.

The linear regression of the correlation was as follows:

$$
\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 0 5 1 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 1 4 1 5 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 7 7
$$

A low sample with concentration of $1 3 . 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ with serial dilutions was also tested to show the low end linearity and the linear regression was as follows:

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 8 6 1 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 9 4 1 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 3
$$

The sponsor claimed a linear range of 0.2 to $8 0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

ii.) A dilution study was done to verify the extended range on the candidate device. Seventeen (17) serum samples with different CRP concentrations were tested on the Synchron LX20 PRO system using the Synchron Systems Cardiac High Sensitivity CRPH Reagent (candidate) and the Synchron Systems High Sensitivity CRPH Reagent (predicate). The results demonstrated that the two assays agreed within $\pm$ $1 5 \%$ . The sponsor claimed that the extended (ORDAC) range is 60.0 to $3 8 0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Synchron Systems Cardiac High Sensitivity CRPH Reagent is traceable to CRM 470 reference materials.

# d. Detection limit:

i.) An analytical sensitivity (limit of blank) study was performed using several low standards and the Synchron LX 20 PRO System. Analytical sensitivity was defined as the lowest measurable concentration which can be distinguished from zero with $9 5 \%$ confidence. The standards were run in 20 replicates and the mean and SD was calculated based on the observed results. The sponsor claimed that the analytical sensitivity of the candidate device is $0 . 1 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

ii.) A functional sensitivity (limit of quantitation) study was performed using serum samples and the UniCel DxC System. The functional sensitivity was defined as the lowest concentration that can be measured with an inter-assay CV of $20 \%$ . Six serum samples with different CRP concentrations were run in duplicates of 10 and the mean and SD were calculated based on the observed results. The sponsor claimed that the functional sensitivity of the candidate device is $0 . 1 8 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was not repeated and remained unchanged as the previously cleared predicate device, Synchron Systems High Sensitivity CRP (k010597)

f. Assay cut-off:

Not Applicable

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison studies were designed using CLSI EP9-A as a guideline and employed Deming regression analysis to analyze the data. The correlation test results were obtained using the Dade Behring CardioPhase High Sensitivity CRP (predicate) on the BN System and the Synchron System High Sensitivity Cardiac CRPH reagent (candidate) on the UniCel DxC System. 269 serum patient samples ranging from 0.2 to $8 0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ were utilized for this study and no samples were diluted or fortified. The Deming regression correlation is as follows:

$$
\mathrm { Y = 1 } . 0 4 8 \mathrm { X + 0 } . 0 2 4 , \mathrm { r = 0 } . 9 8 9 9
$$

A separate regression was calculated for samples ranging from 0.2 to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ (cardiac range) and Deming regression correlation is as follows:

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 3 0 - 0 . 0 0 8 , \mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 1 0 , \mathrm { N } = 1 4 9 .
$$

( $\mathrm { Y } =$ candidate device, $\mathrm { X = }$ predicate device)

# b. Matrix comparison:

Matrix comparison studies using 47 healthy individuals with paired serum, EDTA, Lithium Heparin and Sodium Heparin were analyzed using the Synchron System High Sensitivity Cardiac CRPH reagent (candidate) on the Synchron LX 20 PRO System. Samples ranged from 0.221 to $2 3 . 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Deming regression analysis was used to evaluate the results.

For serum vs Sodium heparin plasma: $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 8 4 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 4 9 .$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 7$

For serum vs Lithium heparin plasma: $\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 1 7 \mathrm { X } - 0 . 0 1 2$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 8$

For serum vs EDTA plasma: $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 8 2 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 2 1$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 9$

( $\mathrm { X } ^ { = }$ serum results)

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

i.) AHA/CDC\* recommends the following cardiovascular disease risk assessment guidelines for CRP.

ii.) The reference range interval values for CRP were based on a population of 551 apparently healthy, non-smoking, $\geq 1 8$ years of age, male and female adults from a Southern California blood bank. The expected normal range is $< 7 . 4 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ in $9 5 \%$ of the population tested. (See k010597).
