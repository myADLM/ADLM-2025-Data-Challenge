5. Proprietary Name MammaPrint®

# 6. Classification Name

Gene expression profiling test system, for breast cancer prognosis.

7. Common Name Multivariate device for cancer prognosis

# 8. Classification

Class II, regulated under 21 CFR 866.6040, product code NYI

9. Predicate Device Agendia BV's MammaPrint (k062694)

# 10. Device Description

The MammaPrint service is a microarray based gene expression analysis of a tumor. The analysis is based on several processes: using fresh tissue stored in RNAlater, isolation of RNA from frozen tumor tissue sections, DNA'se treatment of isolated RNA, linear amplification and labeling of DNA'se treated RNA, cRNA purification, hybridization of the cRNA to the MammaPrint microarray, scanning the MammaPrint microarray and data acquisition (feature extraction), calculation and determination of the risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.

The MammaPrint analysis is designed to determine the gene activity of specific genes in a tissue sample compared to a reference standard. The result is an expression profile, or fingerprint, of the sample.

The correlation of the sample expression profile to a template (the mean expression profile of 4 tumors with a known good clinical outcome) is calculated and the molecular profile of the sample is determined (Low Risk, High Risk).

# 11. Intended Use

MammaPrint is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed in a single laboratory, using the gene expression profile of fresh breast cancer tissue samples to assess a patient's risk for distant metastasis.

The test is performed for breast cancer patients who are less than 61 years old, with Stage I or Stage Il disease, with tumor size <= 5.0 cm and who are lymph node negative. The MammaPrint result is indicated for use by physicians as a prognostic marker only, along with other clinicopathological factors.

# 12. Performance Data (non-clinical)

# Analytical performance

MammaPrint analytical (i.e., non-clinical) performance characteristics investigated comprise Precision, Reproducibility, Cutoff, Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, Robustness and Ruggedness. :

The technical validity of MammaPrint is determined on multiple individual validation experiments; a comprehensive three-way inter-laboratory comparison study between three independent laboratories in three different countries (Dutch, French and U.S.); data of about 200 analyses of two reference samples over a period of 12 months, used to monitor experiment-o-experiment quality; and quality controls for which the cut-off fr all QCs is based on over 5000 hybridizations (2500 samples) performed at Agendia.

Comparison validation experiments performed on over 50 human tissue tumor pairs and 6 mice xenografts, preserved using two different tissue preservation methods (fresh frozen and fresh RNAlater preservation at room temperature), show similar analytical results (MammaPrint Index) and prognostic outcome (High Risk/Low Risk) of the MammaPrint device.

Based on 12 month repeated experiments of a Low Risk and High Risk control sample (i.e., more than 190 independent analyses), the Analytical Accuracy of the measurement is $9 8 , 5 \%$ .

# Classification performance

Based on the analytical performance of MammaPrint, the accuracy of classifying a sample as High Risk or Low Risk, is 97.7% (i.e., 1.1% false negative classification).

# Borderline Sample

As a result of the technical inaccuracy, analytical measurements (i.e., MammaPrint Index) can fall within a pre-defined area around the classification cut-off between the High Risk and Low Risk profile (i.e., "Borderline Sample").

Based on the analyses results of independent MammaPrint analyses over a time period of over 2 years, it has been shown that less than 5% of the analyzed samples are considered to be "Borderline Samples".

"Borderline Samples" have a less than 90% classification accuracy (i.e. >10% chance of false classification).

Looking at all generated data it is concluded that the MammaPrint analysis is considered to be Precise, Reproducible, Sensitive, Specific, Accurate and Robust and valid for the Intended Use.
