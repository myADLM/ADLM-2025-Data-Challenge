3. Identification of the Legally Marketed Device:

N Latex RF - K942328

# 4. Device Descriptions:

N Latex RF Kit

Polystyrene particles coated with an immunocomplex consisting of human immunoglobulin and antihuman IgG from sheep are aggregated when mixed with samples containing RF. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# 5. Device Intended Uses:

N Latex RF Kit

Quantitative determination of rheumatoid factors (RF) in human serum, lithium heparin and EDTA plasma on the BN ™ II and BN ProSpec® Systems as an aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.

# 6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The N Latex RF Kit is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed N Latex RF device (K942328). The N Latex RF Kit, like the currently marketed N Latex RF assay, is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative determination of rheumatoid factors (RF) in human serum by means of particle-enhanced immunonephelometry using the BN TM Systems as an aid in the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The N Latex RF Kit was compared to the current N Latex RF assay on the BN ™m Il System by evaluating serum samples with concentrations ranging from 15.8 to 589.8 IU/mL. Additionally, 43 of these same serum samples, with results ranging from 15.8 to 98.4 IU/mL, were evaluated by PassingBablok regression to demonstrate correlation at levels closer to the clinical cutoff. Regression analysis of these results yielded the following results:

# 8. Conclusion:

Based upon the results of performance studies the N Latex RF Kit is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, N Latex RF.

Dear Ms. Lee:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The

FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at 240-276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
