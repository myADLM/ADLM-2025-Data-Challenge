# 4. Device Description(s):

# Method

The AFP method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCITM technology. The LOCI™M reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-AFP monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-AFP monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-AFP-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the AFP concentration in the sample.

# Calibrator

The LOCI 5 Calibrator is a liquid multi-analyte product containing AFP from human cord serum. An aditional analyte (CEA from human tissue culture) is contained in the product and will be included in the submission to FDA with its respective method. The kit consists of ten vials, two each of five levels containing $2 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial. Description of the manufacturing, value assignment and stability testing processes are provided.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

# Method

The AFP method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of alpha-fetoprotein in human on the Dimension Vista $^ { \textregistered }$ System. Measurements of alpha-fetoprotein are used as an aid in managing non-seminomatous testicular cancer when used in conjunction with physical examination, histology/pathology, and other clinical evaluation procedures.

# Calibrator

For the calibration of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) method on the Dimension Vista® System.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed:

# Substantial Equivalence:

These products are substantially equivalent to other AFP test systems, such as the Abbott AxSYM® AFP Method (P820060/S019) and calibrators; Beckman Access AFP Calibrators on the Access $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Immunoassay System (K981354).

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

The proposed Dade Behring Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { ( \textregistered ) }$ AFP method and the predicate Abbott AxSYM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ AFP method are both in vitro diagnostic immunoassays intended for the measurement of alphafetoprotein (AFP) as an aid in managing non-seminomatous testicular cancer when used in conjunction with physical examination, histology/pathology, and other clinical evaluation procedures.

The Dade Behring Dimension Vista® LOCI 5 calibrator and the predicate Beckman Access AFP Calibrators are both calibrators intended to calibrate their associated AFP methods.
