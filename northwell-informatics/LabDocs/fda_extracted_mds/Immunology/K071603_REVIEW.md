# L. Test Principle:

The CEA method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI™ technology. The LOCI™ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-CEA monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-CEA monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-CEA-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffused into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the CEA concentration in the sample.

The LOCI™ 5 Calibrator is a liquid multi-analyte product containing CEA from human tissue culture cells.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The reproducibility testing was conducted in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods, EP5-A2. Samples (pooled serum, pooled plasma, and controls) were measured in duplicate, two times per day over 20 days. Repeatability, between-run, between day, and within-lab were determined by the analysis of variance method. The repeatability and withinlab data are presented below. Imprecision was less than $3 . 6 \%$ CV at all levels, which was acceptable.

Between-Lot reproducibility was also evaluated using 6 different samples (3 serum pools and 3 levels of quality control materials) representing the range of the assay $( 2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $4 8 6 . 4 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) on two different CEA Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent lots (with a single calibrator lot). The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ was less than $3 . 3 \%$ at all levels for both lots, which was acceptable.

Between-Lab/Instrument reproducibility was also evaluated at three different laboratories (New York, Glasgow Scotland and Maryland) on three different instruments using 2 - 3 levels of quality control materials representing the range of the assay $2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $2 4 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) on 2 different CEA Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent lots and two calibrator lots). The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ was less than $3 . 4 \%$ at all levels, which was acceptable.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity of the reportable range $( 1 . 3 - 1 2 0 7 . 8 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ was evaluated by comparing observed vs. expected values using a serially diluted sample pool mixture. Linear regression analysis demonstrated the following results:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range(ng/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.3 - 1207.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.98</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15.35</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.999</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td></tr></table>

The acceptance criteria of slope between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation coefficient $\geq 0 . 9 5$ were met.

Spiking recovery: A spiking recovery study was performed by adding known amounts of CEA $( \sim 5$ , 15, 75, and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ ) to a human serum pool with a baseline CEA value of $3 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The sample concentrations were measured and the percent recovery ranged from $9 4 . 0 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 4 \%$ with a mean recovery of $9 7 . 1 \%$ .

Dilution recovery: A dilution recovery study was performed by diluting 5 serum samples with CEA values from $1 5 7 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $7 5 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with Reagent grade water. The samples were diluted 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:10 and assayed for recovery. The recoveries ranged from $9 8 . 0 \%$ to $109 \%$ with a mean of $1 0 2 . 9 \%$ .

Antigen Excess (Hook Effect): The effect of antigen excess was evaluated using a serum sample above the assay range. The CEA method generated signal high enough to trigger the Above Assay Range flag and thus did not hook back to generate falsely low value with CEA up to $2 2 5 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The declared analytical measurement range for this assay is $0 . 2 - 1 0 0 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The data provided in the submission and summarized above support this choice of measurement range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): No information provided on traceability to any reference standard. The predicate device, Beckman Coulter™ Access $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CEA is used to assign values to the Dimension Vista CEA calibrators.

Calibrator stability claims in the IFU were supported by stability protocols

and data.

Specimen stability claims were supported by protocols employing freeze-thaw and stress testing up to 7 days at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ or stored at ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ and $- 7 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ for 30 days. Results were within $7 \%$ of the control sample demonstrating that the specimen was stable at recommended temperatures.

d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) were evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.” The LoD defined as the lowest concentration that can be detected reliably) was determined to be $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with proportions of false positives $( { \mathfrak { a } } )$ less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 15 determinations, with 4 blank and 4 low level samples. The LoB is the highest concentration that is likely to be observed for a blank sample and was determined to be $0 . 1 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

i. Interference Studies: Interference testing was performed according to CLSI Approved Guideline for Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry EP7-A2, to determine the effect of various substances on the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CEA assay at two concentrations of CEA $\mathrm { \langle 5 n g / m L }$ and 500 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ . The following interferents were tested for their effect on test samples and compared to a control sample without interferent; bias exceeding $10 \%$ was considered interference: bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated, $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , hemoglobin ( $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 m g / d L }$ , Intralipid 3000 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , albumin $( 6 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ , total protein $( 8 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ , urea $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , uric acid $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and rheumatoid factor $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ ). Acceptance criteria were met. Additionally, 53 potentially interfering drugs were also assayed on serum and plasma samples containing 1.3 and $5 4 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ CEA and shown to exhibit minimal interference $( < 1 0 \% )$ .

ii. HAMA: Interference by human anti-murine antibodies was evaluated by mixing a sample with a high CEA level into three different heterophilic human samples containing HAMA and comparing the results to the CEA specimen before mixing. The percent bias at $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ CEA was calculated and shown to be less than $- 8 . 9 \%$ which meets the acceptance criteria of $10 \%$ . The standard limitation for possible interference from heterophilic antibodies is included in the package insert.

iii. Cross Reactivity: NCA (nonspecific crossreactive antigen) and NCA-2 were evaluated for cross-reactivity with the CEA method when present in serum in the amounts indicated. Systematic inaccuracies (bias) due to these substances are less than $10 \%$ at a CEA concentration of $5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A split serum sample method comparison study was performed according to CLSI document EP9-A2; “Guideline for Method Comparison and Bias Estimation using Patient Samples.” A total of 141 serum samples spanning the assay range (0.8 to $9 7 4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) were evaluated on both the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Vista and the Beckman Coulter™ Access $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ methods. Linear regression of singlicate measurements yielded the following statistics:

b. Matrix comparison:

Recommended sample types are serum and plasma (lithium and sodium heparin). A matched sample method comparison study was performed. A total of 54 paired serum and plasma samples spanning the assay range (1.2 to $9 9 2 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) were evaluated on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Vista System. Linear regression of singlicate measurements yielded the following statistics:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample Comparison</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interceptng/mL [ug/L]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lithium heparin vs.Serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.45</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>54</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sodium heparin vs.serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.998</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>54</td></tr></table>

No clinically significant difference was observed between serum and plasma samples.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity: Not applicable.

$b$ . Other clinical supportive data (when a .is not applicable):

A clinical evaluation was performed to assess the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CEA method for the purpose of obtaining FDA premarket clearance for monitoring cancer patients. Seventy-five (75) retrospective serial serum sample sets (with a minimum of 3 blood draws for each patient) with colorectal cancer clinical data were tested. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the samples were provided. One patient was excluded from statistical analysis when it was determined that they did not meet the protocol inclusion criteria. Samples were characterized by sex, age (range 36.1 year old to 86.2 years old; average age 63 years old), ethnicity, smoking history, treatment, and stage of disease (stage I through IV).

A longitudinal analysis of serial draws from 74 patients was performed. All patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding, Stable, or No Evidence of Disease (NED). Disease progression was determined by the patient physician based on either or all of the following:

Physical examination of clinical signs and symptoms, including results of laboratory tests.   
Radiographic findings used in the assessment of cancer status (CAT Scans, MRI, X-rays, or colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or ultrasound images.   
Surgical procedures including biopsy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, laparotomy or resection.

The Reference Change Value (RCV) was used to determine if a significant change in CEA occurred. For this calculation, the RCV for each assay (the Dimension Vista CEA method and predicate) was derived by taking into account the published biological variation for CEA and the total imprecision of the assay. The formula for this calculation is RCV Z CV CV A I = + 21 2 2 2 1 2 / / \* \* ( ) , where $Z$ is the z-score, $\mathrm { C V _ { A } }$ is the analytical variation, and $\mathrm { C V _ { I } }$ is the biological variation (Fraser, Callum G. Biological Variation: From Principles to Practice, Washington, DC: AACC Press, 2001). The within-subject biological variation $( 1 2 . 7 \% )$ was obtained from the literature (Ricos C, Alvarez V, Cava F, Garcia-Lario JV, Hernandez A, Jimenez CV, Minchinela J, Perich C, Simon M. "Current databases on biologic variation: pros, cons and progress." Scand J Clin Lab Invest 1999;59:491-500) and used for both the new assay and the predicate. The RCV for the Vista CEA method was calculated to be $3 6 . 2 \%$ and that of the predicate to be $3 6 . 7 \%$ .

# Per Visit analysis:

Changes in CEA concentrations and in disease status were analyzed on a per visit basis. Patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding, Stable or No Evidence of Disease (NED) by the attending physician based on the clinical information. All 74 patients were analyzed to determine the change of disease status per sequential pair $\mathrm { ( n { = } } 2 1 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). The table below shows the distribution of results when compared to the disease status:

The per visit concordances were pooled by taking the correlation structure within each patient series into consideration as recommended by B. Emir, S. Wieand, John Q.S., and S. Cha, Statistics in Medicine, 17, 2563-2578 (1998).

Efficacy is demonstrated when the sum of sensitivity and specificity is greater than one. Non-parametric estimates for the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals were derived using a bootstrap resampling technique with 2000 iterations. For the Dimension Vista CEA method the bootstrap $9 5 \%$ CI was 1.2416 to 1.5227 for the sum of Sensitivity $^ +$ Specificity, and for the comparative method the bootstrap $9 5 \%$ CI for the sum of the Sensitivity $^ +$ Specificity was 1.2180 to 1.4771. This demonstrated that both tests are effective.

Concordance between Dimension Vista CEA and predicate:

All specimens were analyzed for percent agreement between the two assays using their RCVs. Results are shown below:

4. Clinical cut-off:

Not applicable for serial monitoring assay that looks for a significant rise.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The distribution of CEA values was determined using the Dimension Vista System in 347 specimens from normal individuals (smokers and non-smokers) and patients with colorectal cancer. In this study $9 6 . 4 \%$ of the healthy subjects had CEA levels less than $5 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Expected Values: Non- smokers: 0.0 – 3.0 ng/mL [µg/L] Smokers: 0.0 – 5.0 ng/mL [µg/L]

The expected values were calculated non-parametrically and represent results determined from a population of healthy adults $\mathrm { ( n = } 3 4 7$ ); 198 $( 9 6 \% )$ non-smokers and 149 $( 9 6 . 6 \% )$ smokers).
