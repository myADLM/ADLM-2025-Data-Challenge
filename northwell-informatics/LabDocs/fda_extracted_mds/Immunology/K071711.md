Class II, 21 CFR 866.5785

# Predicate Devices

QUANTA Lite™M ASCA IgG (K000732). An ELISA for the semi-quantitative detection of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae IgG antibodies (ASCA) in human serum as an aid for the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis. QUANTA Lite™M ASCA IgA (K000733). An ELISA for the semi-quantitative detection of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae IgA antibodies (ASCA) in human serum as an aid for the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis.

# Intended Use

The ASCA-CHEK test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative detection of human anti-S. cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) in feces and serum. The test result is used as an aid in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease in combination with clinical and other laboratory findings. FOR IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC USE.

# Device Description

The ASCA-CHEK test is an ELISA for the measurement of human anti-S. cerevisiae antibodies in feces and serum as an indicator of Crohn's disease in combination with other clinical and laboratory findings. The assay utilizes antigens of S. cerevisiae for capture and a polyvalent anti-human immunoglobulin conjugate. For feces, a specimen dilution of 1:10 and an $\mathrm { \bf O D _ { 4 5 0 } }$ cut-off $\ge 0 . 1 5 0$ or $\mathrm { O D } _ { 4 5 0 / 6 2 0 }$ ${ \ge } 0 . 1 1 0$ are used for the analysis. For serum, a specimen dilution of 1:1000 and an $\mathrm { \bf O D } _ { 4 5 0 }$ cut-off $\ge 0 . 1 1 0$ or $\mathrm { O D } _ { 4 5 0 / 6 2 0 } \geq 0 . 0 8 0$ are used for the analysis. When human ASCA is present in fecal or serum specimens, the specific immunoglobulins bind to the S. cerevisiae antigens that are immobilized in the test well. Following this binding step, the polyvalent anti-human horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate binds to the ASCA and reacts with the substrate to produce a positive result. The measurement of fecal and serum ASCA is an indicator of Crohn's disease within the setting of differentiating Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis and IBS. This diagnostic method offers a simple to perform assay that may be used with either fecal or serum specimens.

\*Reference guidance document entitled "Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic".

Based on these findings, we believe the ASCA-CHEK test is substantially equivalent to other diagnostic tests now used to evaluate patients suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease. Further, our results demonstrate that the ASCA-CHEK test is suitable for use with both fecal and serum specimens as an in vitro diagnostic aid to help identify patients with Crohn's disease in combination with other clinical and laboratory findings when assessing patients with chronic intestinal illnesses.
