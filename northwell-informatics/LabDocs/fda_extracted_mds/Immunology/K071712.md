TECHLAB® LEUKO EZ VUE™M

# Classification

Class I, 21 CFR 866.5570

# Predicate Devices

TECHLAB® LEUKO-TEST (K931241/A1). The LEUKO-TEST is a latex agglutination test for detecting elevated levels of fecal lactoferrin as a marker of fecal leukocytes and intestinal inflammation. The test is simple to use and rapid.

Methylene Blue stain and Gram stain along with microscopic observation. This assay is exempt from 510(k), but serves as a predicate device because it was marketed prior to 1976 and continues to be legally marketed today. The procedure involves the staining of fecal smears from patients with diarrhea followed by microscopic observation for the presence of leukocytes. The analysis must be performed by qualified individuals who have experience in the microscopic identification of leukocytes in fecal specimens. In addition, the test must be performed as soon as possible after collection of the specimen because of the instability of fecal leukocytes.

# Intended Use

The LEUKO EZ VUETM test is an immunochromatographic test for the qualitative detection of elevated levels of fecal lactoferrin, a marker for fecal leukocytes and an indicator of intestinal inflammation. The $L E U K O . E Z \ V U E ^ { \mathbf { \mathsf { T M } } }$ test detects lactoferrin in liquid, semi-solid, and solid fecal specimens. A positive test result indicates an increased level of fecal lactoferrin and warrants additional testing. FOR IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC USE.

# Device Description

The LEUKO EZ VUETM test is a 10 minute immunochromatographic device for the detection of elevated levels of lactoferrin, a marker for fecal leukocytes and an indicator of intestinal inflammation. The test utilizes the same polyclonal antibodies against human lactoferrin as our previously cleared LEUKO-TEST assay. The polyclonal antibodies to human lactoferrin are immobilized on nitrocellulose and the conjugate consists of the same antibodies linked to colloidal gold particles. The membrane cassette contains two stripes of immobilized antibodies. One stripe contains anti-lactoferrin antibodies. The other, representing a control stripe, contains anti-IgG antibodies. The diluted sample and gold conjugate migrate by capillary action when the sample is added to the well. If elevated lactoferrin is present in the sample, gold conjugate-lactoferrin complexes form and are captured by the immobilized anti-lactoferrin antibodies in the stripe. The lactoferrin-conjugate-antibody complexes appear as a single red line in the test portion of the Results window. In the control stripe, conjugate binds to the immobilized anti-IgG antibodies, demonstrating correct migration of the sample and conjugate along the membrane. The conjugate-anti-IgG antibodies appear as a single red line in the control portion of the Results window.

# Summary of Performance Data

TECHLAB®, Inc. has evaluated the $L E U K O \ E Z \ { V } { U } { E } ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ test, which is a new lateral flow test for the detection of elevated levels of fecal lactoferrin, a marker for fecal leukocytes and an indicator of intestinal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the LEUKO EZ VUE™M test as an in vitro diagnostic aid to help identify patients with inflammatory diarrhea.

When comparing the LEUKO EZ VUE™M to the LEUKO-TEST in clinical studies, the LEUKO EZ VUE™M test had positive, negative, and overall agreements of $9 3 \%$ $80 \%$ , and $8 3 \%$ , respectively. Individual results are shown in the table below.

Additional studies including intra- and inter-assay variation showed the assay to be reproducible with all positive samples remaining positive and all negative samples remaining negative upon additional testing. Serial dilutions of highly purified human lactoferrin demonstrated acceptable assay sensitivity with a minimum detection limit $\geq$ EY $1 2 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The LEUKO EZ VUE™M test is simple to perform, requiring minimal technical training. The procedure includes a single specimen dilution, the transfer of 4 drops of diluted specimen to the sample well of the membrane cassette and a visual reading following a 10-minute incubation.

Based on these findings, we believe the LEUKO EZ VUE™M test is substantially equivalent to the LEUKO TEST now used to evaluate patients for elevated fecal leukocytes as an indicator of intestinal inflammation. Further, our results demonstrate that the LEUKO EZ VUE™ test is suitable as an in vitro diagnostic aid to help identify patients with inflammatory diarrhea.
