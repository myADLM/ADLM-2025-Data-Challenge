# Name of the device:

Quantia Beta-2 Mcroglobulin

Classification name(s):

866.5630 JZG

Class II

Beta-2-microglobulin immunological test system System, Test, Beta-2-Microglobulin Immunological

# Identification of predicate device(s):

K943686 IL Test Beta-2-Microglobulin (Instrumentation Laboratory Co.)

Quantia Beta-2-Microglobulin reagent was already 510(k) cleared as Quantia Beta-2- Microglobulin for its use with serum and EDTA plasma (K050613). A new submission for the Quantia Beta-2-Microglobulin reagent has been prepared as it is intended to also claim urine as a sample. The kit Quantia Beta-2-Microglobulin already cleared, contained Buffer and Latex Reagent. The Calibrators were already cleared in the submission K050613. There have also be addedtwo dfferent evelconrols   eparate .he conrols e upplied byB Rad (K851202/A1) and the values are assigned at Biokit S.A. This test with Biokit labeling was cleared k050596.

# Description of the device/intended use(s):

The Quantia Beta-2 Microglobulin is intended as a latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay for thein vitro quantitative determination of beta-2-microglubulin concentration in human serum, plasma (EDTA) or urine on the AEROSET ® Instrument as an aid in the diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis and kidney disease.

# Statement of Technological Characteristics of the Device Compared to Predicate Device:

Qiglobulanalyquivalen ecially vailable device, IL Test Beta-2-Microglobulin, in performance and intended use.

# Summary of Performance Data:

In a method comparison study 110 urine samples with Beta-2 Microglobulin levels ranging from 0.01 to $1 8 . 8 5 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ were evaluated on the Abbott AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ instrument. The slope was 1.088, a the correlation coefficient ) was0.84 or the Quantia Beta Microglobulin verss he predicate device.

Within run precision assessed over multiple runs (with the Dilution Protocol 2) using urine samples on an AEROSET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ gave a CV of $4 . 2 \%$ (at a mean of $0 . 0 6 6 \mathsf { m g / L } ,$ . $1 . 7 \%$ (at a mean of $0 . 0 9 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / L } ;$ + $1 . 5 \%$ (at a mean of $0 . 2 0 4 \mathrm { m g / L } ,$ and $1 . 6 \%$ (at a mean of $0 . 3 0 2 \mathsf { m g / L }$

The linear range using urine samples is 0.025 to $1 . 6 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ with the automatic rerun capability (Dilution Protocol 2), 0.250 to $1 6 ~ \mathsf { m g } / L$ with Standard Dilution Protocol, and 16 to $9 6 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ with the automatic rerun capability Dilution Protocol 1.

There are no significant interferences in urine with this assay for conjugated bilirubin up to $2 0 . 9 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ , high protein immunoglobulin $( \log G )$ up to $1 0 0 \ m g / L$ and no positive or negative influence of the pH has been found. Ascorbic acid interference is below $10 \%$ up to $2 0 m g / \mathrm { d L }$ Do not use hemolyzed urine (hemoglobin interference is below $10 \%$ up to $2 3 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L } ,$

Dear Ms. Guixer:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to l and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Ifyour device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at 240-276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
