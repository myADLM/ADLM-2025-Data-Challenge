# EliA™ Symphony - New Device 510(k) Submission Section 9. Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

# Intended Use Statement of the New Device

EliA Symphony Immunoassay is intended for the in vitro qualitative measurement of antinuclear IgG antibodies in human serum and plasma (heparin, EDTA and citrate). EliA Symphony Immunoassay is based on human recombinant U1RNP (RNP 70, A, C), SS-A/Ro $6 0 \ \mathrm { k D a }$ $5 2 \ \mathrm { k D a }$ , SS-B/La, Centromere B, Scl-70, Jo-1 proteins and native purified Sm proteins as antigen and is useful as an aid in the clinical diagnosis of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma and polymyositis/dermatomyositis, in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings. EliA Symphony Immunoassay uses the EliA IgG method on the instrument ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250.

EliA ANA Control is intended for laboratory use in monitoring the performance of in vitro measurement of antinuclear antibodics (ANA) with ImmunoCAP 100 or ImmunoCAP 250 using the EliA IgG method.

Special condition for use statement The device is for prescription use only.

Special instrument requirements   
ImmunoCAP $1 0 0 ~ /$ ImmunoCAP 250 are fully automated immunoassay analyzers, which include software for evaluation of test results.

# General Description of the New Device

The new device belongs to a fully integrated and automated system for immunodiagnostic testing. It comprises a Fluorescence-Immunoassay test system using EliA single wells as the solid phase and is intended to be performed on the instruments ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250. The conjugate for the EliA IgG method is mouse anti-human IgG beta-galactosidase, which uses 4-Methylumbelliferyl-BDGalactoside as substrate. The total IgG calibration is based on a set of six WHOstandardized IgG Calibrators derived from human serum. They are used to establish an initial calibration curve, which may be used for up to 28 days on additional assays and can be stored by the instrument. Each additional assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to recover in defined ranges to ensure that the stored calibration curve is still valid. The Fluorescence-Immunoassay test system includes test-, method specific and general reagents that are packaged as separate units.

# Test Principle of the New Device

The EliA Symphony Wells are coated with human recombinant U1RNP (RNP 70, A, C), SS-A/Ro $6 0 ~ \mathrm { \ k D a }$ $5 2 ~ \mathrm { k D a }$ ), SS-B/La, Centromere B, Scl-70 and Jo-1 proteins, native purified Sm proteins. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to the antigens bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgG is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# Device Comparison

The new and the predicate device both represent non-competitive solid phase ElAs. The predicate device for the demonstration of the Centromere B antigen was an IIF, NOVA Lite™m HEp-2 assay. These IVDs are used as an aid in the diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and related connective tissue diseases, in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.

# Laboratory equivalence

The comparability of predicate device and new device is supported by a data set including

results obtained within a comparison study between new and predicate devices results obtained for clinically defined sera results obtained for samples from apparently healthy subjects (normal population).

In summary, all available data support the conclusion that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Mann:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The

Page 2 -

FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474.
