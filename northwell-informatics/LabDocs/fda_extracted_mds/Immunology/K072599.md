# Legally Marketed Device to which Equivalency is Claimed PLAC® Test (k062234)

# Description of Device

The diaDexus $\mathrm { P L A C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Test assay consists of separately packaged reagents, calibraors and controls for the measurement of Lp-PLA2 in serum or plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

PLAC® Test Reagent Kit R1 Tris-based buffer solution R2 Suspension of latex microparticles coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to $\mathrm { L } { \mathfrak { p } } { \cdot } \mathrm { P L A } _ { 2 }$ (2C10 and 4B4).   
PLAC® Test Calibrator Kit Five level set of $\mathrm { L } { \mathfrak { p } } { \mathrm { - P L A } } _ { 2 }$ calibrators made with recombinant $\mathrm { L } \mathfrak { p } \mathbf { - } \mathbf { P } \mathrm { L } \mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ in a protein stabilizing buffer and used to calibrate the PLAC assay.   
Lp $\mathbf { \mathrm { P L A } } _ { 2 }$ Control Kit Two level set of $\mathrm { L } { \mathfrak { p } } { \mathrm { - P L A } } _ { 2 }$ controls made with recombinant $\mathrm { L } { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { - P } } \mathrm { L A } _ { 2 }$ in a protein stabilizing buffer and used for quality control of the PLAC assay.

The diaDexus $\mathrm { P L A C } ^ { \otimes }$ Test is based on turbidimetric immunoassay technology utilizing two Lp-PLA2-specific monoclonal antibodies (2C10 and 4B4) coated to latex microparticles. A set of $\mathrm { L } { \mathfrak { p } } { \mathrm { - } } \mathrm { P } \mathrm { L } \mathrm { A } _ { 2 }$ calibrators is used to plot a standard curve of absorbance (y-axis) versus $\mathrm { L } \mathsf { p } { \mathsf { - P L A } } _ { 2 }$ concentration in $\mathfrak { n g / \mathrm { m L } }$ (x-axis) from which the Lp$\mathbf { P } \mathrm { L A } _ { 2 }$ concentration in the test sample can be determined. The concentration of Lp- $\mathbf { P L A } _ { 2 }$ in each sample and control is then interpolated from the standard curve using a spline curve fit with appropriate calibration curve fitting software. The kit expiration date and storage conditions are indicated on the package.

# Characterization of Rare Reagents

# Antigen

The antigen used in the diaDexus turbidimetric immunoassay $\mathbf { P } \mathrm { L A C } ^ { \otimes }$ Test is purified recombinant $\mathbf { L } \mathfrak { p } \ – \mathbf { P } \mathbf { L } \mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ (DDX-RA). Antigen preparations were characterized using SDSpolyacrylamide gels under reducing and non-reducing conditions and Western blot analysis using an anti-Lp- $\mathbf { \mathrm { P L A } } _ { 2 }$ antibody, to demonstrate consistency with the molecular weight of the antigen reported in the literature.

# Antibodies

The monoclonal anti-Lp- $\mathbf { P L A } _ { 2 }$ antibodies (2C10 and 4B4) used in the preparation of the coated microparticles were characterized for purity and reactivity in a series of procedures including Paragon gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, size exclusion

chromatography, isotyping and enzyme immunoassay. These results demonstrated that the monoclonal antibodies bind to the $\mathrm { \bf L  p - P L A } _ { 2 }$ antigen quantitatively and specifically.

# Intended Use Statements

# REAGENT KIT

The $\mathrm { P L A C } ^ { \otimes }$ Test Reagent Kit is a turbidimetric immunoassay for the quantitative determination of $\mathrm { L } { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { - P } } \mathrm { L A } _ { 2 }$ (lipoprotein-associated phospholipase $\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ ) in human plasma or serum on automated clinical chemistry analyzers, to be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation and patient risk assessment as an aid in predicting risk for coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis.

# CALIBRATOR KIT

The PLAC® Test Calibrator Kit is intended to establish points of reference that are used in the determination of values in the measurement of Lp-PLA2 by the PLAC® Test Reagent Kit.

# CONTROL KIT

The Lp $\mathrm { \cdot P L A } _ { 2 }$ Control Kit is intended for use as a quality control tool to monitor the performance within the clinical range of the $\mathsf { \bar { P } L A } \mathsf { \bar { C } } ^ { \otimes }$ Test Reagent Kit, a turbidimetric immunoassay for the quantitative determination of Lp-PLA2.

# Performance Characteristics - Analytical

# Sensitivity

The minimum detection limit is $4 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , as calculated by interpolation of the mean plus two standard deviations of 20 replicates of the $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Lp-PLA2 calibrator from the standard curve.

# Precision

Intra-assay precision $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 8 0 )$ ranged from $1 . 6 \% \mathrm { C V }$ to $2 . 4 \ \% \mathrm { C V }$ throughout assay range (69 to $4 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Total precision $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ranged from $1 . 8 \mathrm { ~ \% C V }$ to $3 . 2 \ \% \mathrm { C V }$ throughout assay range (69 to $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$

# Linearity/Assay Range

The average recovery in linearity experiments was $9 7 \%$ , demonstrating linearity of samples over a range of 96 to $4 7 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Lp-PLA2.

# Interfering Substances

No appreciable interference from the addition of the following substances was observed at the noted concentrations:

• Bilirubin 20 mg/dL • Cholesterol 500 mg/dL • Hemoglobin 10,000 mg/dL • Triglycerides 3000 mg/dL Total Albumin\* \~6500 mg/dL

$^ { * } 2 . 5 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ albumin added to plasma pool of presumptively $4 \mathrm { g / d L }$ albumin

# Method Comparison

The turbidimetric immunoassay PLAC Test compared to the cleared PLAC Test (ELISA method) in a correlation study, and analyzed by linear regression, resulted in a correlation coefficient of ${ \bf r } = 0 . 9 5$ , with a slope of 1.02.

# Performance Characteristics - Clinical

No new clinical data were generated.

# Conclusions

The latex-particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay PLAC Test has the same performance characteristics and clinical utility as the cleared enzyme immunoassay PLAC Test (k062234), and therefore is substantially equivalent.

Dear Dr. Wolfert:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490.
