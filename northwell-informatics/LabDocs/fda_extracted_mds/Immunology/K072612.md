# Summary of Precision Study

Imprecision: Within-run assay imprecision was tested for concentrations from approximately 18 to $5 1 3 \cup 1 \mathrm { m L }$ . The within-run imprecision ranged from $5 . 1 \%$ CV to $9 . 6 \%$ CV. Between-run assay imprecision ranged from $3 . 1 \%$ CV to $5 . 8 \%$ CV. Total imprecision ranged from $7 . 7 \%$ CV to $10 . 8 \%$ CV.

# Conclusion

Imprecision above 500 U/mL was the only performance characteristic revised in the Access BR Monitor assay and was not found to impact the safety and efficacy of the device. The modified Access® BR Monitor assay is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared Access® BR Monitor assay.

Dear Ms. Parsons:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been recassified i accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The

FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket survellance, please contact CDRH's Offce of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at 240-276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number (if known): _K072612

Device Name: BR Monitor and BR Monitor Calibrators on the Access® Immunoassay Systems

Indication For Use:

The Access BR Monitor assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of CA 15-3 antigen levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. This device is indicated for use in the measurement of CA 15-3 antigen to aid in the management of breast cancer patients. Serial testing for patient CA 15-3 antigen concentrations should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring breast cancer.

The Access BR Monitor Calibrators are intended to calibrate the Access BR Monitor assay for the quantitative determination of CA 15-3 antigen levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems.
