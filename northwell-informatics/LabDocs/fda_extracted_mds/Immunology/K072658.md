# Device Description:

The ADVIA Chemistry C-Reactive Protein_2 (CRP_2) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of the concentration of C-Reactive Protein in human serum and plasma on the ADVIA® Chemistry systems. The ADVIA Chemistry CReactive Protein_2 Calibrators are used to calibrate this method. The proposed labeling indicates the ADVIA Chemistry CRP_2 reagents and Calibrators are for use on the family of ADVIA Chemistry Systems (1200 / 1650 / 1800 / 2400).

The CRP_2 latex reagent is a suspension of uniform polystyrene latex particles coated with rabbit anti-CRP antibody. When serum or plasma containing CRP is mixed with the latex reagent, agglutination takes place resulting in an increase in the turbidity. This turbidity is measured at 571 nm. The CRP concentration in serum or plasma is determined from a calibration curve that is generated with the calibrators.

The ADVIA® Chemistry C-Reactive Protein_2 Calibrators consist of six (6) levels of protein stabilized matrices containing varying concentrations of recombinant human CRP. The Calibrators have targeted expected values (lot specific) of 0, 5, 20, 40, 160, and 320 mg/L.

The calibrators (1 mL/vial) are liquid and ready to use. Storage is at $2 - 8 \%$ .

# Statement of Intended Use:

The ADVIA Chemistry C-Reactive Protein_2 assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of the concentration of C-Reactive Protein in human serum and plasma (lithium heparin) on the ADVIA Chemistry systems. Such measurements are used in the evaluation of infection, tissue injury, inflammatory disorders, and associated diseases. Increases in CRP values are non-specific for many disease processes and should not be interpreted without a complete clinical evaluation.

The ADVIA Chemistry C-Reactive Protein_2 Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of ADVIA Chemistry Systems for the ADVIA Chemistry C-Reactive Protein_2 (CRP_2) method.

# Performance:

Substantial equivalence was demonstrated by testing several performance characteristics including imprecision, method comparison, interfering substances, serum/plasma equivalency, and analytical range. The following tables summarize the precision (total), interfering substances, analytical range, and method comparison results.

All of the evaluation studies gave acceptable results compared to the predicate devices. These studies support that the ADViA Chemistry C-Reactive Protein_2 assay is substantially equivalent to the ADVIA Chemistry C-Reactive Protein assay that is currently marketed.
