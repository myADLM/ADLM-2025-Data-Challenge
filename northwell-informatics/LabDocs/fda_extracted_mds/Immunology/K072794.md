Reagent Reagent system for the measurement of CA 125 antigen in human sera.

# Classification:

Class II device; Product Code: LTK (21 CFR 866.6010)

# 21 CFR 866.6010:

A tumor-associated antigen immunological test system is a device that consists of reagents used to qualitatively or quantitatively measure, by immunochemical techniques, tumor-associated antigens in serum, plasma, urine, or other body fluids. This device is intended as an aid in monitoring patients for disease progress or response to therapy or for the detection of recurrent or residual disease.

# Panel:

Immunology

# CLIA Complexity Category:

We believe the category to be moderate based on previous classification of analogous tests.

Substantially Equivalent Predicate Device: IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA Immun0assay (K983391)

# Description of Device:

The IMMULITE 2500 OM-MA Immunoassay is a solid-phase, two-site, chemiluminescent immunometric assay for use with the IMMULITE 2500 Automated Analyzer.

# Intended Use of the Device:

The IMMULITE 2500 OM-MA is intended for in vitro diagnostic use with the IMMULITE 2500 analyzer - for the quantitative measurement of CA125 antigen in serum, as an aid in monitoring the response to therapy for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, and in detecting residual ovarian cancer in patients who have undergone first-line therapy and would be considered for diagnostic second-look procedures.

# Conclusion:

The information presented in this Special $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ is that which the Food and Drug Administration used in granting Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics substantial equivalence for the IMMULITE 2500 OM-MA Immunoassay when compared with the IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA Immunoassay.

Dear Dr. Mahue-Giangreco:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The

FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at 240-276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
