# 3.0 INTRODUCTION

This document describes a clinical trial using retrospective blood samples collected prospectively in which serum measurement of FDP using the AMDL, Inc. DR- $7 0 ^ { \circ }$ (FDP) immunoassay was compared to the patients clinical disease status to aid in the monitoring of Subject tumor status, treatment outcome in Subjects previously diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and detection of disease recurrence. For AMDL, Inc.'s 510(k) submission of the DR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { \div } }$ (FDP) immunoassay, CEA is the predicate device for the intended use and methodology only. The effectiveness of the DR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { 8 } }$ (FDP) immunoassay in the clinical trials willbe evaluated based on a comparison to the clinical disease status. In this application, AMDL will demonstrate that the DR- $\boldsymbol { 7 0 ^ { \circledcirc } }$ (FDP) immunoassay is an informative test by addressing the null hypothesis that if the sum of the positive and negative concordance rates is less than one, then the test is not informative. Using the FDA guidelines, in which tumor markers used for the purposes of monitoring status in Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of cancer are regulated via the $5 1 0 ( k )$ submission, performance of the DR- $7 0 ^ { \textregistered }$ (FDP) immunoassay was compared to the clinical impressions of the treating physicians based on Subject interviews, physical examination, laboratory results, $\mathsf X$ -rays, CAT scans and MRI as they are used in routine clinical practice in managing colorectal cancer Subjects.

# 4.0 DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The AMDL, Inc. DR- $\cdot 7 0 ^ { \textregistered }$ (FDP) assay is an ELISA based assay utilizing removable strips in a 96 micro titer plate well format. The wells are coated with affinity purified rabbit antiDR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { \div } }$ (FDP) antibodies. The DR- ${ 7 0 } ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ (FDP) in diluted sera (1:200) is captured from the sera by these antibodies immobilized on the well of a micro titer plate. After a wash step, anti-DR ${ 7 0 } ^ { \textcircled { \div } }$ (FDP) antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase are added to the wells. If the DR- $\dot { 7 } 0 ^ { \textcircled { 8 } }$ (FDP) antigen is present, the anti-human fibrinogen peroxidase complex will bind to the captured tumor marker to form an immunological sandwich with the immobilized antibodies.

After a second wash step, the enzyme substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to the well. The end point is read in a micro plate reader at 450 nm once the reaction is stopped with 0.1N HCl. The intensity of the color formed is proportional to the amount of DR $\dot { 7 } 0 ^ { \textcircled { 8 } }$ (FDP) in the serum. The amount is quantified by interpolation from a standard curve using the calibrators provided with the kit.

# 5.0 PERFORMANCE TESTING

To determine the analytic validity of the DR- $7 0 ^ { \textregistered }$ FDP) immunoassay, the following performance tests were conducted.

# 5.1 Recovery

Serums from three normal subjects having DR- $\cdot 7 0 ^ { \circledast }$ (FDP) values ranging from 0.3 $\mu g / m$ to $0 . 6 \mu g / m !$ and a control diluent buffer were spiked with a DR- $7 0 ^ { \textregistered }$ (FDP) antibody solution to obtain expected levels ranging from $1 . 5 \mu g / m l$ to $1 0 \mu g / m$ to

# 510(k) summary: AMDL-ELISA DR-70® (FDP)

represent the range of the DR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { \div } }$ (FDP) calibrators. The values of DR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { 8 } }$ (FDP) in the spiked serum were measured and compared to the theoretical values and to values obtained for the control diluent buffer.

The experiment was designed to compare responses of the analyte in a biological sample versus the standard diluent to assess for any difference in assay response. Based on the overall analysis of results, the DR- ${ 7 0 } ^ { \textcircled { \otimes } }$ (FDP) immunoassay kit is a quantitative test with concerns of sample matrix affects.

# 5.2 Linearity

Serums from 5 colorectal cancer patients with DR- $7 0 \textcircled{8 }$ assay values in the range of 19.7 to $2 2 . 2 ~ \mu 9 / \mu$ were diluted with assay diluent buffer in a two-fold serial dilution series. For each CRC patient serum sample, a total of 9 DR- $\mathrm { 7 0 \textcircled { \times } }$ (FDP) dilution samples were tested. The table on the following page lists the $\%$ difference between the actual DR- $70 \textcircled{8}$ (FDP) concentrations and the estimated DR- $\operatorname { 7 0 } \textcircled { \textcircled { \times } }$ (FDP) concentrations $1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ column) for each patient at each dilution. For each dilution, the average $\%$ difference is listed as well as the average $\%$ recovery. Grey boxes contain $\%$ differences per CRC patient at dilutions whose values were statistically non-linear. Values below the lowest calibrator included in the DR- $7 0 \textcircled { \times }$ (FDP) assay kit are in the non-linear portion of the DR- $\boldsymbol { 7 0 }$ (FDP) assay curve.

# 510(k) summary: AMDL-ELISA DR $\cdot 7 0 ^ { \textcircled { 8 } }$ (FDP)

Total variability ranged from a low of $9 . 9 1 \%$ at a concentration of $2 . 7 3 9 \vert 1 9 / m \vert$ to a high of $2 8 . 2 1 \%$ at $0 . 2 4 0 ~ | \mu \ g / \mathrm { m } |$ .   
Day-to-day Variation across sample-site-lot combinations, the highest $\% C V$ measured was $8 . 5 8 \%$ with a nadir of $3 . 4 3 \%$ .   
The highest variation seen in run-to-run comparisons was $5 . 5 3 \%$ .

# 5.4 Analytical Sensitivity

The minimal detectable concentration (MDC) of DR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { \Xi } }$ (FDP) is estimated to be $0 . 0 6 \mu g / m l$ The MDC is defined as that concentration of DR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { \Xi } }$ (FDP) corresponding to the absorbance that is two standard deviations from the mean rate of absorbance of 20 replicate determinations of a zero calibrator.

# 5.5 Functional Sensitivity

The functional sensitivity was determined by diluting the lowest non-zero calibrator serially, measuring the DR- $\boldsymbol { 7 0 ^ { \circledast } }$ (FDP) concentration and extrapolating to the point where the $C V \% = 2 0 \%$ .Functional sensitivity for the AMDL-ELISA DR- $7 0 ^ { \textregistered }$ (FDP) is calculated as being between 0.052 and $0 . 0 6 3 \ : \mu g / m |$ . This compares well to the Analytical Sensitivity of $0 . 0 6 ~ | { \mu } { \ g } / m |$ .

# 5.6 Interference

Interference is defined, for purposes of this study, to be recovery outside of $10 \%$ of the known specimen mean concentration.

Added hemoglobin (up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { \ m g / d } | _ { \cdot }$ does not interfere with the assay. Added bilirubin (up to $3 0 m g / \mathsf { d l } ,$ do not interfere with the assay.   
Lipemia, as indicated by added triglyceride (up to 1000 mg/dl), does not interfere with the assay.   
Heparin (at concentrations of $5 0 0 \ \mathsf { U / m l } ,$ do not interfere with the assay. The following pharmaceutical agents were tested at levels indicated and found not to cause analyte recovery outside $10 \%$ : 5'-fluorouracil (Adrucil), 1.0 mg/ml; acetaminophen, $0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / m } |$ ; adriamycin (Doxorubicin HCI), 0.10 mg/dl; coumarin, $1 . 4 \ m g / m |$ ; cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), 0.25 mg/ml; Paclitaxel, $3 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ ;amethopterin hydrate (Methotrexate), 4.5 mg/ml; mitoxanntrone (Novatrone), $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / m ! }$ ; folinic acid (Leucovorin), 1.10 mg/ml, Mitomycin C, $0 . 0 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / m ! }$ ;cisplatin, $0 . 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / m | }$ .

# 5.7 Hook Effect

Studies were performed testing for hook effect in the AMDL-ELISA DR- $\boldsymbol { 7 0 ^ { \textregistered } }$ (FDP).   
No evidence of a hook effect was found up to a concentration of $2 5 0 ~ \lvert \lvert \mathfrak { g } / \mathfrak { m } \rvert$ .

# 6.2 Statistical Analysis of DR- $70 ^ { \textcircled { \div } }$ (FDP) Immunoassay as an Informative Test for Monitoring Disease Progression in Colon Cancer Patients.

The DR- ${ \bf 7 0 ^ { \otimes } }$ (FDP) immunoassay was evaluated as an informative test for monitoring disease progression in colorectal cancer patients. An informative test must provide evidence to show that its performance is greater than the clinical diagnoses based on chance alone. There are many measures that can be used to quantify the value of cancer markers including the receiver operating characteristic (RoC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive, and predictive value negative. While the most useful measures for the clinician are the predictive values, these are rarely used because of their reliance on the prevalence of disease. Measures independent of the prevalence of disease such as ROC, sensitivity and specificity are most frequently studied. Furthermore, the predictive values are functions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.

Serial samples were taken from 112 colon cancer patients resulting in 446 paired observations in which a DR-70 reading and a determination of disease progression were obtained. Since several patients had signs of progression even at the first examination, it was decided to attempt to determine the relationship between DR-70 and progression at successive visits.Thus from the data, a variable was derived by taking the ratio of a subsequent DR-70 reading and the previous reading. This measure is intended to determine the increase from a previous reading as a means of providing information on progression. A determination was made that a meaningful increase to determine evidence of progression was $15 \%$ increase or more. Thus, if the ratio was 1.15 or higher, the DR-70 test was deemed to be positive, otherwise it was deemed to be negative and this determination was paired with the finding at that visit of progression or not.

The resulting 335 paired observations from the post baseline sampling were evaluated in two ways. The initial analysis presents estimates directly from the data. This analysis is followed by a bootstrap sample for each patient by randomly sampling one

visit at for each sample and recording the sensitivity or specificity for that visit. Note that if there was a progression and the sensitivity would be 1 if the DR-70 increased from the previous visit by $15 \%$ or more and O if it did not. If there were no progression at that visit, then there would be no sensitivity reported at that visit, but the specificity would be reported as a 1 if the DR-70 value was below a $1 5 \%$ increase for that visit and 0 otherwise. For the per visit analysis, there were 135 visits for sensitivity and 198 visits for specificity.

A second analysis was done on a per patient basis in which the number of progressions across all visits for a given patient were used to compute a patient level sensitivity by taking the number visits that DR-70 increase by at least $1 5 \%$ among the number of visits that there was a progression. Similarly, the number of visits at which DR-70 had a lower than $1 5 \%$ increase divided by the number of visits in which there was a non-progression allowed the computation of a per patient specificity. Recall that if a patient had all progressions there would be no specificity for that patient and if a patient had all non-progressions, there would be no sensitivity for that patient. This resulted in a sample of 112 patients with at least one sensitivity, specificity, or both. This resulted in 70 estimates of per patient sensitivity and 86 estimates of per patient specificity.

The computed per visit sensitivity from the 335 per visit evaluations was $1 0 0 ^ { \star } 8 8 / 1 3 5 \mathrm { = }$ 65.19 with standard deviation (SD) 2.58, the specificity was $1 0 0 ^ { \star } 1 3 4 / 1 9 9 = 6 7 . 3 4$ with $S { \mathsf { D } } = 2 . 9 4$ , the sum of sensitivity and specificity was 132.53 with $\mathsf { S D } = 3 . 9 1$ , the PPV was $1 0 0 ^ { \star } 8 8 / 1 5 3 = 5 7 . 5 2$ with ${ \mathsf { S } } { \mathsf { D } } = { \mathsf { 1 } } . { \mathsf { 6 3 } }$ , and the NPV was $1 0 0 ^ { \star } 1 3 4 / 1 8 1 = 7 4 . 0 3$ with $S D = 2 . 4 4$ .

For the per patient analysis, the computed per visit sensitivity from the 112 per patient evaluations was $1 0 0 ^ { \star } 4 5 . 6 8 / 6 9 = 6 6 . 2 1$ , the specificity was $1 0 0 ^ { \star } 5 8 . 6 3 / 8 6 = 6 8 . 1 8$ , the sum of sensitivity and specificity was 134.39, the PPV was $1 0 0 ^ { \star } 5 1 . 8 3 / 9 7 = 5 3 . 4 4$ , and the NPV was $1 0 0 ^ { \star } 7 1 . 6 7 / 1 0 3 = 6 9 . 5 8$ , There is no method to obtain variance estimates from this process, so the confidence intervals are obtained from the bootstrap evaluations below.

These data and analyses demonstrate that the DR-70 test when taken as a $15 \%$ or greater change from the previous visit, yields informative data regarding colon cancer progression. The DR- ${ 7 0 } ^ { \textcircled { \div } }$ (FDP) immunoassay results must be used in conjunction with standard of care procedures for monitoring colorectal cancer patients.

# 7.0 General Conclusions from the $5 1 0 ( k )$ submission

The data demonstrates that the proposed DR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { 8 } }$ (FDP) immunoassay has the same intended use as legally marketed predicate device, similar technological characteristics as a legally marketed predicate device, and that DR- $7 0 ^ { \textcircled { \div } }$ (FDP) immunoassay does not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness. As such, the data provided in the submission support a finding of substantial equivalence.
