# Device Description

The HE4 EIA is a solid-phase, non-competitive immunoassay based upon the direct sandwich technique based on two mouse monoclonal antibodies, 2H5 and 3D8, directed against two epitopes in the C-WFDC domain of HE4. Calibrators, controls and patient samples are incubated together with biotinylated Anti-HE4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2H5 in streptavidin coated microstrips. HE4 present in calibrators or samples is adsorbed to the streptavidin coated microstrips by the biotinylated Anti-HE4 MAb during the incubation. The strips are then washed and incubated with HRP labeled Anti-HE4 MAb 3D8. After washing, buffered Substrate/Chromogen reagent (hydrogen peroxide and 3, 3', 5, 5' tetra-methyl-benzidine) is added to each well and the enzyme reaction is allowed to proceed. During the enzyme reaction a blue color will develop if antigen is present. The intensity of the color is proportionate to the amount of HE4 present in the samples. The color intensity is determined in a microplate spectrophotometer at 620 nm (or optionally at 405 nm after addition of Stop Solution).

Calibration curves are constructed for each assay by ploting absorbance value versus the concentration for each calibrator. The HE4 concentrations of patient samples are then read from the calibration curve.

# Reportable Range

The reportable range for the HE4 EIA Kit is 15 - 900 pM

# Intended Use

The HE4 EIA is an enzyme immunometric assay for the quantitative determination of HE4 in human serum. The assay is to be used as an aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Serial testing for patient HE4 assay values should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer.

# Statement of Substantial Equivalence

The HE4 EIA is an enzyme immunometric assay for the quantitative determination of HE4 in human serum. The assay is to be used as an aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Serial testing for patient HE4 assay values should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer.

As there is no FDA cleared or approved device for the HE4 EIA Kit, substantial equivalence for the HE4 EIA test kit was determined by comparing the clinical performance to the ARCHITECT CA 125 Il assay as an aid in monitoring patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.

The regulatory submission will be prepared pursuant to Title 21CFR $\ S$ 866.6010(b) which states Tumor Markers must comply with the following special controls;

# Performance Characteristics

# Precision:

A study was performed with the HE4 EIA Kit modeled after the NCCLS (CLSI) guideline EP5- A2. A panel of four serum samples was assayed, using two lots of reagents, in replicates of two, at two separate times per day for 20 days. The HE4 ElA Kit precision is $\leq 1 5 \%$ total CV.

# Linearity:

A dilution linearity study was conducted for the HE4 EIA Kit modeled after the NCCLS (CLSI) guideline EP6-A. Serum samples with elevated HE4 values were diluted with HE4 Calibrator A (zero). The HE4 concentration was determined for each dilution and the percent $( \% )$ recovery was calculated.

The HE4 EiA Kit was determined to have a mean recovery within $1 5 \%$ of the expected result for diluted samples.

# Functional Sensitivity:

The functional sensitivity of the HE4 EIA Kit is $\leq 2 5 \ \mathsf { p M }$ . The functional sensitivity is expressed as the concentration of an analyte at which the CV is $20 \%$ . The NCCLS guideline EP5-A2 was used to design the experiments for determination of functional sensitivity. A study was conducted where a five member sensitivity panel was tested in replicates of 4 in 2 runs on twenty separate days with two lots of reagents. The functional sensitivity determined for the HE4 EIA was found to be $< 5 p M$ .

# Detection Limit:

The limit of detection of the HE4 EIA Kit is $\leq 1 5 \ p M$ The limit of detection (LoD) corresponds to the upper limit of the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval and represents the lowest concentration of HE4 antigen that can be distinguished from zero. The NCCLS guideline EP17-A was used to design the LoD experiments. A study was conducted where HE4 Calibrator A (zero) and 4 samples from healthy subjects diluted to 5 pM with Sample Diluent was tested in replicates of 24 per run in 4 runs on two separate days. The LoD was calculated as follows:

$$
\mathsf { L O D } \left( \mathsf { p W } \right) = 5 . 0 \mathsf { p M } \times \left( 1 . 6 5 \times \mathsf { S D } _ { 0 } + 1 . 6 5 \times \mathsf { S D } _ { 5 } \right) / \left( \mathsf { O D } _ { 5 } - \mathsf { O D } _ { 0 } \right)
$$

The Limit of Detection of the HE4 EIA Kit was calculated to be $< 2 . 5 ~ \mathsf { p M }$ .

# Interference:

The HE4 EIA Kit mean assay specificity is $100 \pm 1 5 \%$ . Recovery studies were performed to compare sera containing the following compounds at the indicated concentrations with control sera. The NCCLS guideline EP7-A was used to design the interference experiments. The following substances and concentrations were tested and found not to interfere with the test.

# Potentially interfering clinical conditions

The HE4 EIA Kit mean assay specificity is $100 \pm 1 5 \%$ The HE4 EIA Kit was evaluated using specimens with HAMA and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) to further assess the assay specificity. Five specimens positive for HAMA and five specimens positive for RF were evaluated for $\%$ recovery with HE4 ElA antigen spiked into each specimen at approximately 50 and $4 5 0 p M$

Monitoring of Disease status in Patients Diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer

The effectiveness of the HE4 ElA as an aid in monitoring of disease status in ovarian cancer patients was determined by assessing changes in HE4 levels in serial serum samples from 80 patients compared to changes in disease status. A study involving a total of 354 pairs of observations was undertaken with an average number of 4.4 observations per patient. A positive change in HE4 was defined as an increase in the value that was at least 25% greater than the previous value of the test.This level of change takes into account the variability of the assay and the biological variability. Sixty percent (60%) or 76/126 of the patient samples with a positive change correlated with the disease progression while seventy-five percent $( 7 5 \% )$ or 171/228 of the patient serial samples with no significant change in HE4 value correlated with no progression. The total concordance was seventy percent ( $70 \%$ or 247/354). The following table presents the data in a ${ \tt 2 } \times { \tt 2 }$ format.

<table><tr><td colspan="4">Change in Disease State per Sequential Pair</td></tr><tr><td>Increase in HE-4 concentration</td><td>Progression</td><td>No Progression</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;25%</td><td>76</td><td>57</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;25%</td><td>50</td><td>171</td><td>221</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>126</td><td>228</td><td>354</td></tr></table>

The following table shows the resulting sensitivities and specificities of the HE4 EIA compared to the disease status at various changes in HE4 ElA concentrations.
