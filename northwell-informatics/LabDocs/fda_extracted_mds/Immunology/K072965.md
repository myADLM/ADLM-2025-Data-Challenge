Dade Behring N Antisera to Human C1 Inhibitor- K960257   
Dade Behring N Protein Standard PY - K962410   
Dade Behring N/T Protein Control PY - K962407

# 4. Device Descriptions:

# on a

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# Dimension Vista® C1IN CAL

C1 Calibrator is a lyophilized, human plasma based product containing C1 Inhibitor (C1IN).

# Dimension Vista® C1IN CON

C1 Control is a lyophilized, mid-level, human plasma based products containing C1 nhibitor (C1IN).

# 5. Device Intended Uses:

ion

The C11N method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of C1 inhibitor in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista® System. Measurements of C1 Inhibitor aid in the diagnosis of hereditary agioneurofic edema (increase blood vessel permeability causing swelling of tissues) and a rare form of angioedema associated with lymphoma (lymph node cancer).

# Dimension Vista C1IN CAL:

The C1IN CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the C1 Inhibitor (C1IN) method on the Dimension Vista® System.

# Dimension Vista® C1IN CON:

C1 Inhibitor Control is an assayed, mid level, intralaboratory quality control for assessment of precision and analytical bias on the Dimension Vista® System in the quantitative determination of C1 Inhibitor (C1IN).

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Dimension Vista® C1IN $F I e X ^ { \otimes }$ reagent cartridge, Dimension Vista® C1IN CAL and Dimension Vista® C1 CON are substantially equivalent to the Dade Behring N Antisera to Human C1 Inhibitor assay (K960257), N Protein Standard PY (K962410), and N/T Protein Control PY (K962407), respectively. The Dimension Vista® C1IN assay, like Dade Behring N Antisera to Human C1 Inhibitor is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of C1 Inhibitor in human serum and plasma.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The Dimension Vista® C1lN assay was compared to the Dade Behring N Antisera to Human C1 Inhibitor assay on the BN ProSpec® System by evaluating serum and plasma samples with concentrations ranging from 0.03 to $0 . 3 9 9 ^ { \prime \lfloor }$ . Regression analysis of these results yielded the following equation.

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 -

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at 240-276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
