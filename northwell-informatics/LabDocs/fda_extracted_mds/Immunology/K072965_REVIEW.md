K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

There are no standard reference preparations or materials for C1 inhibitor. The following   
guidelines for performance of studies were utilized:   
Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute Guideline EP5-A2, “Evaluation of Precision   
Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”   
Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute Guideline EP7-A2, “Interference Testing in Clinical   
Chemistry”

# L. Test Principle:

The assay uses the principle of immune precipitation of C1 inhibitor with specific antiserum (nephelometry) as the technological method to measure C1 inhibitor in human plasma or serum. When C1 inhibitor in serum or plasma immunochemically binds with the supplied antiserum, complexes are formed. When a beam of light passes through a solution containing the complexes light is scattered and the intensity of scattered light is proportional to the concentration of C1 inhibitor in the specimen. The amount scattered using samples containing known defined amounts of C1 inhibitor are utilized to create a calibration curve to relate the intensity of scattered light from unknown samples with the intensity of scattered light from the samples with known concentrations of C1 inhibitor. The calibrator system in this device uses 5 different concentrations and has an analytical measurement range of 3.0 to $4 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ C1 inhibitor. For a serum or plasma specimen of unknown value, an initial dilution of the specimen of 1:2.5 is performed by the instrument. The Dimension Vista System calculates the concentration of C1 inhibitor in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ under usual calibration conditions. Turbidity and particles in the specimen may interfere with the determination.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Utilizing CLSI guideline EP5, serum and plasma specimens at 2 different concentrations were tested in duplicate twice a day for 20 days. Additionally, the control was tested in a similar manner. Repeatability (within run) and within-lab standard deviations and percent coefficients of variation were calculated using analysis of variance. The data are summarized as follows:

Accuracy determination:

As a measure of accuracy highly purified C1 inhibitor at $2 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was measured in the proposed assay in 5 replicates. The percent recovery (observed concentration divided by known concentration, expressed as a percentage) was calculated for the 5 replicates. The mean percent recovery was $9 8 . 8 \%$ (ranging from $9 5 . 7 \%$ to $1 0 3 . 4 \%$ . The acceptance criterion was $\pm 1 5 \%$ deviation from the nominal value (%recovery ranging from $8 5 \%$ to $1 1 5 \%$ ). All tested replicates met this acceptance criterion.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity of sample result on dilution was assessed using a single sample with a high C1 inhibitor concentration. The sample was diluted 11 times with system diluent from $4 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each of the 11 dilutions was tested in the proposed assay in 5 replicates. Linearity was assessed using linear regression where the x-axis is the theoretical concentration on dilution and y-axis is the observed mean value of each of 11 dilutions. The acceptance criteria were a slope between 0.9 and 1.1 and a correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0.95. The slope of the best fit line was 0.981 with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. The acceptance criteria were met.

Hook effect

The possibility of a hook effect was evaluated using a single sample with a value above the assay range in the proposed and predicate assay. A sample with a value of $1 0 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on the predicate assay was tested using the proposed assay. The resulting value in the proposed assay was ${ \mathrm { > 4 ~ m g / d L } }$ , above the assay range of the proposed assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): No standard reference material for C1 inhibitor is available at present. A concentrated pool of human plasma containing C1 inhibitor is designated a Master Calibrator. I t is assigned a value by the assay using highly purified C1 inhibitor protein preparation as a calibrator. A commercial calibrator lot preparation is prepared by dilution to a target concentration. The commercial lot is assigned a value by the assay in multiple replicates of multiple runs on at least 2 instruments using the Master Calibrator to generate several calibration curves. The commercial lot is vialed, labeled, and packaged for shipment.

d. Detection limit:

Three samples with $3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (the lower limit of the reportable range) were measured in triplicate in 5 runs in one day to validate the limit of quantitation for the assay. The mean, standard deviation, $\%$ coefficient of variation, and percent bias were calculated for the 15 replicates. The acceptance criterion of $\pm 3 0 \%$ bias was met.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interferences were assessed using CLSI document EP7 to determine the effect of endogeneous and exogeneous substances on the assay. For all interfering substances, except rheumatoid factor, the acceptance criterion for percent bias was $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Interference was assessed by testing a control sample with or without addition of the interfering substance. Bias was calculated as the percentage of concentration in the presence of substance to the concentration in the absence of substance. To assess interference from rheumatoid factor samples with concentrations greater than 470 $\mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m l }$ were mixed in equal volume with samples without rheumatoid factor. The samples were tested in the assay and percent recovery of C1 inhibitor was calculated. The acceptance criterion of $\pm 1 0 \%$ deviation was used. For the substances tested no significant interference was detected in the proposed assay. The complete list of tested interfering substances is listed in the labeling. The labeling states that at the concentrations of interfering substances tested, there is less than $10 \%$ interference at C1 inhibitor concentrations of 23 to $3 8 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

As described in the labeling, the range of values expected from normal donors is $2 1 -$ $3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $[ 0 . 2 1 - 0 . 3 9 \ : \mathrm { g / L } ]$ . Samples from 370 healthy Central European donors were used to establish this reference interval. It represents the range from the $2 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $9 7 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile determined using the predicate device.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Assay results of the proposed assay were compared with results of the predicate assay (N antisera on the BN Prospec system) using 67 serum and 129 plasma samples ranging from 3 to $3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed on results of the two assays. The slope of the best fit regression line was 0.915 $9 5 \%$ confidence interval 0.903 to 0.928). The intercept of the best fit line was 0.006 $9 5 \%$ confidence interval 0.3 to $0 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.993.

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

A comparison of test results using three specimen types (serum, lithium heparin plasma, and sodium heparin plasma) was performed on 10 matched specimens. Linear regression analysis was performed to show agreement of values between serum and plasma samples. The range of C1 inhibitor concentrations in the 10 samples was 3 to $3 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The slope of the best fit line of sodium heparin plasma and lithium heparin plasma vs. serum was 0.94 ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for lithium heparin vs. serum 0.931 to 0.96; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for sodium heparin vs. serum 0.917 to 0.97). The correlation coefficient was 1.0 and 0.998 for lithium and sodium heparin, respectively vs. serum. The standard error in value in lithium or sodium plasma for a given serum value was 1 and $0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , respectively.
