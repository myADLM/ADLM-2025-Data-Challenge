# Submission Purpose

Roche Diagnostics hereby submits this Special 510(k): Device Modification to provide notification of modifications to our C-Reactive Protein (Latex) assay. This assay was originally cleared for use in K981897 on the COBAS Integra 700 (analyzer cleared in K951595). Submission history for additional applications to the COBAS Integra family and to Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems are summarized in the following Submission History section.

Since the K981897 filing, several modifications to the C-Reactive Protein (Latex) application on the COBAS Integra platform include:

change of calibrator and controls,   
validation of the high end of the measuring range of the assay up to 200 ${ \bf { m g / L } }$ , and   
more specific Lipemia interference (L-Index) data provided based on testing with Intralipid instead of triglycerides.

The Limitations-interference section of the COBAS Integra labeling was also modified to include information about HAMA, monoclonal gammopathy, and additional testing of a common drug panel. This information is not a device modification but was provided for more safe and effective use of the assay.

A further device modification was validated in C-Reactive Protein (Latex) applications to the Roche/Hitachi cobas c 501 and cobas c 311:

The high end of the measuring range was validated up to $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$

# Submission History

Applications of the K981897 CRP Latex modified reagent were applied to additional analyzers within the COBAS Integra family including Integra 400, 800, 400 Plus and cobas c 111, as well as Roche/Hitachi family cobas c 501 and c 311 analyzers via Letters to File or Internal Documentation per the Reagent Replacement policy:

# Device Description

The C-Reactive Protein (Latex) assay is a particle enhanced turbidimetric assay. Human CRP agglutinates with latex particle coated with monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. The precipitate is determined turbidimetrically at 552 nm (546 nm on cobas c 501 and c 311 analyzers).

# Intended use

In vitro test for the quantitative immunological determination of C-reactive protein in human serum and plasma on COBAS INTEGRA systems.

In vitro test for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein in human serum and plasma on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems.

# Predicate Device

We claim substantial equivalence to the COBAS INTEGRA C-Reactive Protein (Latex) cleared as K981897.

Dear Mr. Kaufman:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to dvha havbeecasdanc wi rovisns edeal FoDr and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter wil allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification. The
