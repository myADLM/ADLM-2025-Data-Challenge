807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate device CellSearchTM Circulating Tumor Cell Kit, K071729

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The CellSearch" Circulating Tumor Cell Kit contains a ferrofluid-based capture reagent and immunofluorescent reagents. The ferrofluid reagent consists of nanoparticles with a magnetic core surrounded by a polymeric layer coated with antibodies targeting the EpCAM antigen for capturing CTC. After immunomagnetic capture and enrichment, fluorescent reagents are added for identification and enumeration of CTC. The fluorescent reagents include the following: anti-CK-Phycoerythrin (PE) specific for the intracellular protein cytokeratin (characteristic of epithelial cells), DAPI which stains the cell nucleus, and antiCD45-Allophycocyanin (APC) specific for leukocytes.

The reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks® AutoPrep® System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device. The strong magnetic field of the MagNest® device attracts the magnetically labeled epithelial cells to the surface of the cartridge. The CellTracks® Analyzer II or CellSpotter® Analyzer automatically scans the entire surface of the cartridge, acquires images and displays any event to the user where CKPE and DAPI fluorescence are co-located. Images are presented to the user in a gallery format for final classification. An event is classified as a tumor cell when its morphological features are consistent with that of a tumor cell and it exhibits the phenotype $\mathrm { E p C A M ^ { + } }$ , $\mathrm { C K ^ { + } }$ DAPI+ and CD45-.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended use

Th CelSarchCirlatiTumr ell Ki is intende o h rati r tumor cells (CTC) of epithelial origin (CD45-, EpCAM+, and cytokeratins 8, $1 8 +$ , and/or $1 9 \mathrm { + } )$ in whole blood.

The presence of CTC in the peripheral blood, as detected by the CellSearchTM Circulating Tumor Cell Kit, is associated with decreased progression free survival and decreased overall survival in patients treated for metastatic breast, colorectal or prostate\* cancer. The test is to be used as an aid in the monitoring of patients with metastatic breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. Serial testing for CTC should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring metastatic breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Evaluation of CTC at any time during the course of disease allows assessment of patient prognosis and is predictive of progression free survival and overall survival.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Non-clinical data Recovery

Blood samples from a single healthy donor were pooled and five of six $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ aliquots were spiked with approximately 1300, 325, 81, 20, and 5 cultured breast cancer cells (SK-BR-3). The sixth tube was unspiked pooled blood and served as a zero point. These samples were processed on the CellTracks® AutoPrep® System with the CellSearch™" Circulating Tumor Cell Kit and CTC counts were determined on the CellTracks® Analyzer I. The experiment was repeated for four additional donors. The observed cell counts were plotted against the results of the expected cell count. The results are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Percent Detection Estimates.   

<table><tr><td>Expected Tumor Cell</td><td>Mean Observed</td><td>Range of Percent Recovery</td></tr><tr><td>Count</td><td>Tumor Cell Count</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1300</td><td>1215</td><td>91 to 95% 82 to 101%</td></tr><tr><td>325</td><td>308 85</td><td>80 to 136%</td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td>22</td><td>95 to 140%</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>7</td><td>120 to 200%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

To determine the overall, or least squares fit, for the comparison of the observed and expected cell counts across all the data, linear regression analysis was performed. The regression equation for these 30 samples was $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 3 \mathrm { x } + 3 . 8 7$ with an $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . \dot { 9 } 9 9$ $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { R } = 0 . 9 9 9 )$ The results of this study indicate that on average, over the tested CTC range, the recovery, as derived from regression analysis, is $9 3 \%$ .

Given the linear response of the tumor cell counts, one would expect the slope of the observed versus expected plot to be 1.0.However, the slope was 0.93.This is because the CellTracks® Autorep System with CellSearch" CTC Kit involves the capture and fluorescent labeling of cells followed by their detection and enumeration by the CellTracks® Analyzer I. The loss of cells could therefore be attributed to one of the following possibilities; 1) the recovery of only $9 3 \%$ of the tumor cells spiked into $7 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood by the CellTracks® AutoPrep System, 2) the detection of only $9 3 \%$ of the tumor cells present in the sample chamber by the CellTracks® Analyzer II or 3) a combination of both of these sources of error.

# Linearity / Reportable Range

Another way to examine the previous data is to analyze it as a dilution series to evaluate test linearity. We removed the confounding variable of percent recovery by using the observed value of the initial sample in the dilution series (i.e. the first tube) divided by the dilution factors to determine the expected values for the dilution series for each patient sample. Regression of all of these numbers of observed tumor cells versus the numbers of expected tumor cells yielded a slope of 1.007, an intercept of 3.0, and an $\mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 0 \ ( \mathbf { R } = 0 . 9 9 5 )$ .Therefore, once the percent recovery (cell loss) was factored out of the CTC values of each of the initial samples, the analysis of the data demonstrated that the detection of CTC was linear over the reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells.

# Limits of Detection

One CTC per $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ can be detected by the CellTracks® Analyzer II resulting in a limit of detection of 1 CTC in a cartridge. Linear regression shows that on average, $9 3 \%$ of CTC present in a $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ EPY blood sample are recovered using the CellTracks $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AutoPrep® System (see Recovery section). The loss of approximately $7 \%$ of the CTC in the sample is not sufficient to reduce the limit of detection of I CTC.

# b. System Reproducibility with Patient Samples Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)

A total of 163 duplicate blood samples were collected from 47 metastatic breast cancer patients over the course of the clinical study. These samples were processed at multiple sites to determine the reproducibility of CTC measurements. The regression equation for the comparison of these 163 duplicate samples was $\mathbf { Y } { = } 0 . 9 8 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 6 7 _ { \mathrm { { i } } }$ $\scriptstyle \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of the duplicate CTC results in blood from MBC patients plotted on a logarithmic scale, with the threshold of 5 CTC indicated by the dashed lines.

# Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (MCRC)

A total 1,627 duplicate blood samples were collected from 430 MCRC patients over the course of the clinical study. These samples were processed at multiple sites to determine the reproducibility of CTC measurements. The regression equation for the comparison of these 1,627 duplicate samples was $\mathbf { Y } { = } 0 . 9 8 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 1 8$ , $\scriptstyle \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 6$ .Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of the duplicate CTC results in blood from MCRC patients plotted on a logarithmic scale, with the threshold of 3 CTC indicated by the dashed lines.

Figure 2 Note:There may be more than one point superimposed over another. For example, on this plot, there are 975 instances $( 6 0 \% )$ where both tubes had 0 CTC, 116 instances $( 7 \% )$ where Tube I had 0 CTC and Tube 2 had 1 CTC, and another $I O 9$ instances (7%) where Tube 1 had 1 CTC and Tube 2 had 0 CTC.

The tube-to-tube variation of CTC counts in blood samples from metastatic breast and colorectal cancer patients is shown in Figures 1 & 2. The distribution of infrequent events (such as tumor cells) within a given volume is random and independent of cell or disease type. This is best characterized by the Poisson distribution  a mathematical method employed for modeling systems where the probability of an event occurring is very low but the number of opportunities for such an event to occur is large. For tubes with very few prostatic CTC it is reasonable to expect variation in results similar to what is depicted in Figures 1 & 2. Because the two previous studies in MBC and MCRC patients showed almost identical results, a tube-to-tube comparison of CTC counts in blood samples from metastatic prostate cancer patients was not performed during the CellSearch™M CTC prostate clinical trial. However, results of an independent study using CellSearch™ technology conducted at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center demonstrated no systematic site-to-site or tube-to-tube variation in CTC counts across a range of 0 to 1192 CTC per tube in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

# 807.92(b)(2): Brief Description of Clinical Data

# Metastatic Prostate Cancer (MPC) Patients

A multi-center prospective, clinical trial was conducted to determine whether the number of CTC predicted disease progression and survival.Metastatic prostate cancer patients in this study were defined as having two consecutive increases in the serum marker prostate-specific antigen (PSA) above a reference level, despite standard hormonal management. These patients are commonly described as having androgen-independent, hormone-resistant, or castration-resistant prostate cancer. A total of 231 metastatic prostate cancer patients with evidence of (PSA) progression despite standard hormonal therapy and starting a new line or type of chemotherapy were enrolled. Clinical data were analyzed on an intentto-treat basis. Patient demographic information is presented in Table 3.

Baseline CTC count was determined prior to initiation of a new line of chemotherapy. The following timeframes were chosen for evaluation: baseline (prior to the initiation of therapy), 2-5 weeks (14 - 41 days from baseline), 6-8 weeks (42 - 62 days from baseline), 9-12 weeks (63 - 90 days from baseline), and 13-20 weeks (91 - 146 days from baseline) after the initiation of therapy. If more than one blood draw fell within the designated timeframes, the blood draw furthest from the baseline blood draw was used as the result for each timeframe.

# CTC frequencies

All 231 evaluable MPC patients had a baseline blood draw. Two hundred and twenty-one of these MPC patients had one or more follow-up blood draws ater the initiation of therapy. Of the ten MPC patients with only a baseline blood draw, three died before a follow-up blood draw could be obtained, one progressed and was sent to hospice, one stopped their chemotherapy due to a broken hip, one patient moved, three refused any further blood draws, and one withdrew their consent fr the study. There werea total of 214, 171, 158, and 149 MPC patients with follow-up blood draws 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy, respectively.

In metastatic prostate cancer, disease progression is primarily determined using changes in PSA. For this study, disease progression was determined by the sites using PSA, imaging, and/or clinical signs and symptoms. For the baseline analyses, progression free survival (FS) was determined from the time of the baseline blood draw to the determination of progression or death, and overall survival (OS) was determined from the time of the baseline blood draw to the date of death or the date of last contact with the patient. For the follow-up analyses, PFS was determined from the time of the follow-up blood draw to diagnosis of progression or death, and OS was determined from the time of the follow-up blood draw t the date deathorhe dateo last contact with the patintatients with progression prior o tate of the blood draw being evaluated were excluded from the PFS analyses of that time point and all subsequent follow-up blood draws.Patients with no additional survival follow-up beyond the dateof the blood draw being evaluated were excluded from the PFS & OS analyses of that time point. Table 4 shows the numbers of patients at each time point excluded from the PFS or PFS & OS analyses and the reasons for their exclusion.

The CTC results obtained from the baseline and follow-up blood draws at 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy were classified as being favorable $( < 5$ CTC)or unfavorable $( \ge 5 \ : \mathrm { C T C } )$ . The PSA, Alkaline Phosphatase, and LDH levels summarized in the demographics table and used in the analyses were all measured at a central laboratory in serum samples collected at the same time as the blood samples used for CTC evaluation. The hemoglobin and albumin levels summarized in the tables and used in the analyses were values provided by the sites and verified from the patient's medical records that were determined within ± 30 days of the baseline CTC evaluation.

# Progression Free Survival (PFS) Analysis of MPC Patients

# PFS Using Baseline CTC Results

Two hundred nineteen of the 231 evaluable patients had a baseline CTC result available. For KaplanMeier analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at baseline:

The Favorable group $\scriptstyle ( \ N = 9 4 )$ , represented in green, consisted of patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC.   
The Unfavorable group $( N { = } 1 2 5 )$ , represented in red, consisted of patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC.

Median PFS was longer in the Favorable group compared to the Unfavorable group (5.8 vs. 4.2 months, respectively.These results areillustrated inigure3or Tale5.

As illustrated in Figure 4 and Table 5, MPC patients with elevated CTC $\mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { \backslash } \mathrm { \Sigma } 5 \mathrm { C T C / 7 . 5 m L }$ whole blood) at any of the time points had a much higher likelihood of rapid progression than did those with <5 CTC. Table 5 column 4 shows the median PFS times for those patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC ranged from 4.1 to 6.5 months and were substantially longer than the median PFS times for those patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC, which ranged from 1.2 to 4.2 months (column 5).

# Reduction or Increase in CTC Predicts Improved or Decreased PFS

Elapsed PFS times were calculated from the baseline blood draw. For the Kaplan-Meier analysis shown in Figure 5, MPC patients were segmented into four groups based upon their CTC counts at baseline, 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy:

EY $\bullet$ Group 1 (green curve), 88 $( 3 8 \% )$ patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC at all time points. Five $( 6 \% )$ of these patients only had a baseline blood draw while seven $( 8 \% )$ had a single blood draw between their first and last blood draw that had ${ \ge } 5$ CTC;   
Group 2 (blue curve), 45 $( 2 0 \% )$ patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC prior to the initiation of therapy but who had decreased to $< 5$ CTC at the time of their last blood draw;   
Group 3 (orange curve), 26 $( 1 1 \% )$ patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC at an early draw (baseline, 2-5 weeks, and/or 6-8 weeks) but who increased to ${ \gtrsim } 5$ CTC at the time of their last blood draw;   
Group 4 (red curve), 71 $( 3 1 \% )$ patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC at all draw time points. Eight $( 1 1 \% )$ of these patients had only a baseline blood draw and two $( 3 \% )$ had a single blood draw between their first and last blood draw that had ${ < } 5$ CTC.

Figure 5 shows that MPC patients with ${ \geq } 5$ CTC at all time points (Group 4) had the shortest median PFS, which was significantly different compared to the median PFS of Group 3, Group 2 and Group 1. The difference in the median PFS between those patients who showed a CTC reduction after the initiation of therapy (Group 2) was significantly longer compared to those patients who showed a CTC increase (Group3).

# Overall Survival (OS) Analysis of MPC Patients

# OS Analysis Using Baseline CTC Results

Death occurred in 119 $( 5 2 \% )$ of the 231 MPC patients, with a mean follow-up time for the 112 $( 4 8 \% )$ EPY patients still alive of $1 6 . 1 \pm 4 . 9$ months (median $= 1 6 . 5$ months, range $= 1 . 9$ to 25.7 months). At the time of these analyses, 28 $( 3 0 \% )$ of 94 patients from the Favorable group ( ${ < } 5$ CTC at baseline) compared to 83 $( 6 6 \% )$ of 125 from the Unfavorable group $2 5$ CTC at baseline) had died.

For Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 219 of the 231 evaluable patients that had baseline results were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at baseline:

The Favorable group $\scriptstyle ( \ N = 9 4 )$ , represented in green, consisted of patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC.   
The Unfavorable group $\mathrm { ( N } { = } 1 2 5 ,$ ), represented in red, consisted of patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC. Median OS was significantly longer in the Favorable group compared to the Unfavorable group (21.7 vs.   
11.5 months, respectively). These results are illustrated in Figure 6.

As illustrated in Figure 7 and Table 6 in columns 4 & 5, MPC patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC at any of the time points had a much higher likelihood of dying sooner than did those with ${ < } 5$ CTC. The median OS times for those patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC ranged from 19.6 to 21.7 months and were substantially longer than the median OS times for those patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC, which ranged from 6.7 to 11.5 months.

# Reduction or Increase of CTC Predicts Improved or Decreased OS

Elapsed OS times were calculated from the baseline blood draw. For Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 8), patients were segmented into four groups based upon their CTC counts at baseline, 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-0 weeks after the initation of theap:

Group 1 (green curve), 88 $( 3 8 \% )$ patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC at all time points. Five $( 6 \% )$ of these patients had only a baseline blood draw while seven $( 8 \% )$ had a single blood draw between their first and last blood draw that had ${ \ge } 5$ CTC;   
Group 2 (blue curve), 45 $( 2 0 \% )$ patients with ${ \gtrsim } 5$ CTC prior to the initiation of therapy but who had decreased to ${ < } 5$ CTC at the time of their last blood draw;   
Group 3 (orange curve), 26 $( 1 1 \% )$ patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC at an early draw but who increased to ${ \geq } 5$ CTC at the time of their last blood draw;   
Group 4 (red curve), 71 $( 3 1 \% )$ patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC at all draw time points. Eight $( 1 1 \% )$ of these patients had only a baseline blood draw and two $( 3 \% )$ had a single blood draw between their first and last blood draw that had ${ < } 5$ CTC.

Figure 8 shows that those patients with ${ } ^ { \ge 5 } \mathrm { C T C }$ at any point after the initiation of therapy had a much higher likelihood of dying sooner. Patients with ≥5 CTC at alltime points (Group 4) had the shortest median OS, which was significantly different compared to the median OS of Group 2, and Group I but not Group 3. Patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC at all time points (Group 1) had the longest median OS, which was significantly different compared to the median OS of Group 4 and Group 3, but not Group 2. Figure 8 also demonstrated that patients who showed a decrease in CTC (Group 2) improve their survival chances and had a median OS similar to those patients with favorable CTC at all draws (Group 1). The figure also shows that unfavorable CTC levels after the initiation of therapy significantly decreased overall survival (Group 3 and Group 4).

# Univariate Cox Regression Analysis in MPC Patients

Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of the following pre-treatment parameters with PFS and OS: stage of disease at diagnosis (1-4), patient age (70 or <70 years), ECOG status before initiation of a new line of therapy (0-2), Gleason score (2-10), hemoglobin level within $\pm \nobreakspace 3 0 \nobreakspace$ days of baseline draw $\varrho / \mathrm { d L }$ , continuous), albumin level within $\pm ~ 3 0$ days of baseline draw $\rho / \mathrm { d L }$ , continuous), testosterone level at the time of the baseline draw $\scriptstyle ( { \mathfrak { n g } } / { \mathfrak { m L } }$ , continuous), LDH level at the time of the baseline draw $( \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , continuous), alkaline phosphatase level at the time of the baseline draw $\mathrm { ( I U / m L }$ , continuous), PSA level at the time of the baseline draw $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n g } / \mathrm { m L }$ , continuous), pre-treatment PSA doubling time (months, continuous), pre-treatment PSA velocity (ng/mL/month, continuous), line of therapy $( 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } } , 2 ^ { \mathrm { r i d } } , 3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } } , 4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } } , 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ ,or $6 ^ { t h }$ ), type of therapy (taxotere included or not), presence of measurable disease (yes or no), presence of bone metastasis (yes or no), presence of visceral metastasis (yes or no), and baseline CTC level $\mathtt { ( \ge 5 \ C T C / 7 . 5 m L }$ or $\mathopen { } \mathclose \bgroup \left. 5 \mathrm { \ C T C } / 7 . 5 \mathrm { m L } \aftergroup \egroup \right.$ and follow up CTC counts at 2-5, 6-8, 9-12 and 13-20 weeks.

For these analyses, the elapsed times for both PFS and OS were calculated from the time of the baseline blood draw. The Cox regression results (i.e. the hazards ratio and associated $9 5 \%$ confidence interval, chi-square value, and associated $\mathfrak { p }$ -values) for the ability of the parameters to independently predict PFS and OS are provided in Table 7 as well as the number of patients in each evaluation.

# Multivariate Cox Regression Analysis in MPC Patients

Multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the independent predictive power of CTC count by adjusting for the effects of the known important clinical factors that are statistically significant in the univariate analyses.

# Use of CTC to Monitor Clinical Status of Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients

# Relationship between survival, CTCs and disease assessment by PSA

At present, a reduction in PSA is one of the primary means to determine response to therapy in MPC patients. To establish the relationship of clinical status as determined by a PSA to CTC, reduction of $\geq 3 0 \%$ or $\geq 5 0 \%$ PSA and CTC were measured 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks and 13-20 weeks after initiation of therapy and compared to overall survival.

For the Kaplan-Meier analysis the elapsed OS times were calculated from the time of blood draw. Patients were segmented into Favorable groups based upon a CTC of <5 at the time of evaluation and a $23 0 \%$ reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation. Patients were segmented into Unfavorable groups based upon a CTC of ${ \tt > } 5$ and $< 3 0 \%$ reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation.

Figure 9 shows the results of the analysis 2-5 weeks ater initiation of therapy, Figure 10 the analysis 6-8 weeks after initiation of therapy, Figure 11 the analysis 9-12 weeks after initiation of therapy and Figure 12 the analysis 13-20 weeks after initiation of therapy.

# Concordances between CTC and PSA Changes in MPC Patients

The data in Figure 9 through 12 and in Table 9, illustrate a highly significant difference in overall survival between patients with Unfavorable CTC and Favorable CTC at all time points tested, whereas PSA evaluations were not significant until 6-8 weeks after the initiation of therapy. Although the differences in median OS between the Favorable $( \geq 3 0 \%$ or $\ge 5 0 \%$ PSA reduction from baseline) and Unfavorable $( < 3 0 \%$ or $< 5 0 \%$ PSA reduction from baseline) PSA reduction groups were significant, the separation between the Favorable ( $< 5$ CTC) and Unfavorable $( \ge 5$ CTC) CTC groups appeared greater and was significant at all time points after the initiation of therapy.

At present, either a $\geq 3 0 \%$ or $\geq 5 0 \%$ reduction in PSA is commonly used to evaluate disease progression in metastatic prostate cancer patients. Therefore, to establish the relationship between CTC and changes in PSA two by two tabulations of concordant and discordant observations between CTC and PSA changes for each time point after the initiation of therapy were constructed. Although comparisons of CTC to PSA change at both magnitudes were calculated, only data from the CTC vs. $\ge 3 0 \%$ PSA change are reported. This decision was based on a recent publication (J Nat Ca Inst. 98 (8):p.516-521, 2006) demonstrating that a 3-month $30 \%$ PSA decline showed a stronger association with decrease in risk of death than did a $50 \%$ decrease in PSA. Furthermore, a comparison of patient-wise and observation-wise results from the $30 \%$ and $50 \%$ PSA decline vs. CTC analyses did not demonstrate substantial differences in the Positive $\%$ Agreement, Negative $\%$ Agreement and Overall Agreement at any of the observed time points.

A total of 197, 159, 146, and 138 patients had serum samples analyzed by the central laboratory and had evaluable CTC results 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy, respectively. To determine a patient's response to therapy, the percent change in PSA from the baseline value was calculated for each of the time points after the initiation of therapy. For PSA changes at each time point, the Favorable group was defined as patients with a ≥30% reduction in PSA and the Unfavorable group was defined as patients with a $< 3 0 \%$ reduction in PSA. For CTC at each time point, the Favorable group was defined as patients having <5 CTC per 7.5mL of blood and the Unfavorable group was defined as patients having ${ \ge } 5$ CTC.

Because CTC vs. PSA results of the patient-wise comparisons between CTC and a $\geq 3 0 \%$ PSA reduction at 2-5 weeks and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy showed the most significant discordance and concordance, respectively, these data are presented in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively.

The overall concordance between CTC and PSA changes at the various time points after the initiation of therapy ranged from 59% to 77% when comparing to a ≥30% PSA reduction and from 52% to 75% when comparing to $\mathbf { a } \geq 5 0 \%$ PSA reduction, showing that there was discordance between CTC and PSA changes in ${ \sim } 2 5 \%$ to $40 \%$ of the patients.

# CTC Levels and PSA Reduction Combined to Predict OS in MPC Patients

To determine which of the discordant results better reflected the prognosis of the patient, CTC assessment and changes in PSA 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks and 13-20 weeks after initiation of therapy were compared to overall survival. Elapsed OS times were calculated from the blood draw being evaluated. For the Kaplan-Meier analysis Figure 13 (Panels A, B, C and D) patients were segmented into four groups based upon their CTC counts and PSA reduction at 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy, respectively:

Group 1 (green curve), patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC at the time of evaluation and a $23 0 \%$ reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation; Group 2 (blue curve), patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC at the time of evaluation and a $- 3 0 \%$ reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation; Group 3 (orange curve), patients with ${ \ge } 5$ CTC at the time of evaluation and a $23 0 \%$ reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation • Group 4 (red curve), patients with ${ \ge } 5 \thinspace \mathrm { C T C }$ at the time of evaluation and a $< 3 0 \%$ reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation.

Figure 13 shows that patients with ≥5 CTC at any point after the initiation of therapy had a much higher likelihood of dying sooner, irespective of the changes in PSA levels from baseline. Patients with ≥5 CTC at all time points (Group 3 and Group 4) had the shortest median overall survivals, which were not significantly different. However, the median OS of these two groups was significantly different compared to the median OS of the patients with ${ < } 5$ CTC at all time points (Group 1 and Group 2). These two groups (Group 1 and Group 2) had the longest median overall survivals, which were not significantly different.The important finding illustrated in Figure 13 is that although a reduction o PSA at some points ater initiation of therapy may reach significance or prediction of survival, Favorable CTC at any time point were more accurate than the PSA evaluation. The practical implication is the use of CTC analysis for the evaluation of the probability of survival of MPC patients. In cases where CTC and PSA change were discordant, CTC provided the most accurate assessment of prognosis.

Device Name: CellSearchTM Circulating Tumor Cell Kit

Indications for Use:

The CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit is intended for the enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTC) of epithelial origin (CD45-, EpCAM+, and cytokeratins 8, 18+, and/or 19+) in whole blood.

The presence of CTC in the peripheral blood, as detected by the CellSearch™M Circulating Tumor Cell Kit, is associated with decreased progression free survival and decreased overall survival in patients treated for metastatic breast, colorectal or prostate\* cancer. The test is to be used as an aid in the monitoring of patients with metastatic breast, colorectal or prostate cancer.Serial testing for CTC should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring metastatic breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Evaluation of CTC at any time during the course of disease allows assessment of patient prognosis and is predictive of progression free survival and overall survival.

\*Metastatic prostate cancer patients in this study were defined as having two consecutive increases in the serum marker PSA above a reference level, despite standard hormonal management. These patients are commonly described as having androgen-independent, hormone-resistant, or castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The CellSearch system includes: CellSave Preservative Tubes, the CellTracks® AutoPrep® System, the CellTracks® Analyzer II or the CellSpotter® Analyzer, and the CellSearch" Circulating Tumor Cell Control Kit
