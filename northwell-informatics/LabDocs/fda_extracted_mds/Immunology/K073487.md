Device name

Proprietary Name: Olympus IgM reagent (OSR6X173)

Common Name: IgM reagent

Classification Name: IgM (mu chain specific), antigen, antiserum, control.

Predicate device

Reagent:

Olympus (OSR6X46) IgM Reagent Submitted K950900

Device description

In this Olympus procedure:

When a sample is mixed with R1 buffer and R2 antiserum solution, human IgM reacts specifically with anti-human IgM antibodies to yield insoluble aggregates.   
Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in   
proportion to their size, shape and concentration.   
Turbidimeters measure the reduction of incidence light due to reflection, absorption or scatter.   
In the Olympus procedure, the decrease in intensity of light transmitted (increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution is as a result of complexes formed during the antigen-antibody reaction.

5Intended use

System reagent for the quantitative determination of IgM immunoglobulins in human serum and plasma on OLYMPUS analyzers.

For in vitro diagnostic use.

Dear Ms. Donnelly:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number (f known):o 73487

Device Name: Olympus IgM reagent (OSR6X173)

Indication For Use: System reagent for the quantitative determination of IgM immunoglobulins in human serum and plasma on OLYMPUS analyzers.

The spectrum of abnormalities in serum immunoglobulin concentrations is broad. Abnormal concentrations range from a virtual absence of one or more of the three major classes of immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, and IgM) to polyclonal increases in one or more immunoglobulins. Measurement of these immunoglobulins aids in the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body's lack of ability to resist infectious agents.

For in vitro diagnostic use.
