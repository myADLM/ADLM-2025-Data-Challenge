# L. Test Principle:

The assay principle is a two-step immunoassay sandwich method measuring a fluorescent signal. A solid-phase receptacle (SPR) serves as solid support to which anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (derived from mouse) is coated. Serum specimen, calibrator, or control samples are incubated in the SPR to allow capture of bound material to the solid phase. Unbound components are washed away during a washing step. Alkaline-phosphatase labeled anti-CEA polyclonal antibody (goat derived) is added and incubation begun. During incubation labeled anti-CEA binds to solid-phase captured CEA. Unbound material is washed away during a second wash step. The substrate (4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate is added to the SPR and cycled in and out. During this incubation the enzyme catalyzes a reaction in which a fluorescent product is produced (4-methyl-umbelliferone) and measured at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ by the VIDAS analyzer. The intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of CEA present in the sample. Fluorescence intensity is converted to a concentration by comparison with a signal generated by known concentrations of CEA in calibrators. The final concentration is printed by the analyzer.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three serum samples were assayed in duplicate in 40 runs, 2 runs per day for 20 days with 2 reagent lots at 3 sites. Kit controls and 2 levels of a commercially available tumor marker control (Bio-Rad) were run in each run as quality control checks. The mean CEA concentration, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ were calculated for each stated source of variation. The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for day-to-day variation ranged from $1 . 2 \%$ to $4 . 5 \%$ across sites, lots, and CEA concentrations. The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for run-to-run variation ranged from $0 \%$ to $1 . 6 \%$ across sites, lots, and CEA concentrations. The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for intra-assay variation ranged from $2 . 7 \%$ to $5 . 3 \%$ across sites, lots, and CEA concentrations. The total variability across all sites and samples ranged from $3 . 9 \%$ to $6 . 5 \%$ across sites, lots, and CEA concentrations. The sponsor concludes that the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of total variation across sites and samples was $\leq 5 . 6 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A high concentration spiked serum pool and a low concentration natural serum pool were mixed in varying amounts to evaluate the linearity of the assay in its full measurement range. The analysis and study protocol utilized CLSI evaluation protocol EP6-A. Nine samples were generated by mixing a pool supplemented with a high CEA concentration and a pool with low CEA concentration. Each dilution was tested in 4 assay runs with 2 lots of assay kit. The mean CEA concentration in $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of replicates across runs were calculated. The sample $\% \mathrm { C V }$ was compared with the expected $\% \mathrm { C V }$ from the precision analysis. If the observed $\% \mathrm { C V }$ was less than the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence limit of the expected $\% \mathrm { C V }$ , the results were included for polynomial regression analysis. For acceptance criteria, the criteria resemble the CLSI acceptance criteria. In these acceptance criteria, parameter estimates of the second and third order polynomial regression are not significant and the linearity is indicated for the first order parameter estimates. If these conditions are present then the assay is deemed linear.

In the sponsor’s description, there was deviation from linearity (parameter coefficients were different from 0) for both lots studied but the deviation was acceptable since the difference in linear and polynomial models is the same magnitude as assay variability. The sponsor shows 2 graphs. The sponsor asserts that the assay is linear from 0.500 to $2 0 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

A graphical representation is as follows:

![](images/a213fbfbc1de504f492911c2683d35a12b72585a43255a5b3f195687b7c8e83b.jpg)

Three samples with very high CEA values were diluted with kit diluent to yield CEA concentrations across the assay measurement range. Each sample was diluted 8 times. Dilutions were tested in triplicate with $2 \mathrm { k i t }$ lots and 1 diluent lot. The mean CEA concentration at each dilution and the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of replicates at each dilution were calculated. Using CLSI protocol EP6-A, the coefficient estimates for the first, second, and third order polynomials were calculated to determine if the models for the second and third order polynomials had statistically significant coefficients. If the coefficients are not significant, the first order linear model is deemed linear on dilution.

The linearity demonstrates linearity on dilution with the assay diluent in the assay measurement range. The graphs of the three samples are as follows:

![](images/1c1cc4a9c8ef2a80e729c8b44ffce913787d0b8e18076068b8b455da2340c2d0.jpg)

Hook effect

Four specimens (3 with very high CEA values and one specimen spiked with a very high CEA concentration) were assessed after dilution over a large measurement range. At least one dilution was within the CEA assay range. Dilution was made using CEA negative serum. A hook effect would be apparent in a graphic representation of relative fluorescence units with increasing CEA concentration when the fluorescence signals decreases after reaching a maximum CEA concentration. Tested samples were graphically plotted and a recreation of the graph based on sponsor supplied data is as follows:

![](images/37368b0077068b891bf17b9e7b37a1bb40a4063b526ecc82c2e72fa89ed7ee9c.jpg)

The RFV (relative fluorescence value) signals do not decrease at high CEA concentrations and is indicative of the lack of a hook effect. The graph does indicate a flattening of fluorescence signals above $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ but no decrease in signal up to approximately $1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . While no formal analysis is performed the graph is supportive of the lack of a hook effect.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Assay calibrators are traceable to reference standards established at the sponsor and to Carcinoembryonic Antigen $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ International Reference Preparation provided by the National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls (code 73/601).

d. Detection limit:

Limits of blank, detection, and quantitation were determined using 2 kit lots on 2 instruments (one per lot) using CLSI protocol EP17-A. Seven low CEA samples were tested using two lots on two VIDAS instruments. Tested CEA values ranged from approximately 0.05 to $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Samples ranging from 0.2 to $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were used to estimate the limit of detection while 3 samples of lower CEA value (0.05 to 0.08 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) were used to estimate the limit of quantitation. Acceptance criteria for the limit of blank, detection, and quantitation were described as follows:

• Limit of blank – highest measurement result which has a $9 5 \%$ probability to be observed for a blank sample. It is the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of a blank distribution   
• Limit of detection – lowest amount of analyte that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability, though not quantified at an exact value. Limit of quantitation – lowest actual amount of analyte that can be reliably detected and at which total error meets lab requirements for accuracy. Total error specification $\pm 1 0 0 \%$ for doses $< 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The results are noted to support a claim for a limit of detection and limit of quantitation of $< 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Therefore, the lowest value for the range of the assay is $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Hemoglobin, triglyceride, bilirubin, human albumin, rheumatoid factor, HAMA, and 27 drug interferents were evaluated for interference when added to a human serum pool containing measured amounts of CEA.

Three samples, one CEA negative and two positive CEA (spiked into a negative sample) were prepared and split into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with hemoglobin, triglyceride, or bilirubin and the other with a corresponding volume of buffer. Five intermediate CEA concentrations, derived from the highest and lowest CEA concentrations, were prepared by mixing varying amounts of the two aliquots. Hemoglobin concentrations ranged from 0 to $3 0 5 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ . Triglyceride concentrations ranged from 0 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ . Bilirubin concentrations ranged from 0 to $5 1 0 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ . Aliquots of each concentration were tested in single replicates in 2 runs. The linear regression coefficients were calculated for the mean CEA concentration at each interfering substance concentration. The hypothesis that the slope of the best fit line was zero was tested. If the slope is not equivalent with 0 with a probability $< 0 . 0 5$

then there is interference in the assay from the tested substance and testing must be repeated with lower concentrations of interfering substance. As acceptance criteria, there must be no effect from hemoglobin for concentrations less than $3 0 0 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ , no effect from triglycerides for concentrations less than $3 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ , and no effect from bilirubin at concentrations less than 510 umol/L.

For hemoglobin concentrations ranging from 0 to $3 0 5 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ , three different CEA concentrations were within the CEA specification range in the presence and absence of hemoglobin. The $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) of the slope of the best fit line of CEA concentration and hemoglobin concentration all included zero in the confidence interval (-0.0001 to 0.0023 for CEA value $3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ; -0.0097 to 0.0124 for CEA value $4 4 . 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ; -0.0626 to 0.0756 for CEA concentration $1 3 5 . 4 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ).

For triglyceride concentrations ranging from 0 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ , three different CEA concentrations were within the CEA specification range in the presence and absence of triglyceride. Additionally, the $9 5 \%$ CIs of the slope of the best fit line of CEA concentration and triglyceride concentration all included zero in the confidence interval (-0.0083 to 0.0069 for CEA value $3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ; -0.0645 to 0.0205 for CEA value $2 6 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ; -0.422 to 0.140 for CEA concentration $7 4 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ).

For bilirubin concentrations ranging from $< 2$ to $5 9 5 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ , three different CEA concentrations were within the CEA specification range in the presence and absence of bilirubin. Additionally, the $9 5 \%$ CIs of the slope of the best fit line of CEA concentration and bilirubin concentration all included zero in the confidence interval (-0.0002 to 0.0006 for CEA value $3 . 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ; -0.0038 to 0.0025 for CEA value 28.8 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ ; -0.0254 to 0.0115 for CEA concentration $9 4 . 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ).

Interference with human albumin, rheumatoid factor, and human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) was evaluated at a separate site during clinical study testing for precision. A modified variation of CLSI document EP7-A2 was used. The 3 interferents were added to a human serum pool containing known CEA concentration $( 2 4 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L } \pm 3 . 3 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ; range 21.3 to 27.9). The acceptance criterion was no interference if the test sample $\%$ recovery was within the range $8 5 \%$ to $1 1 5 \%$ (i.e. $\pm$ $1 5 \%$ of $100 \%$ recovery). No interference was seen with human albumin or HAMA up to $1 5 0 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ albumin and up to $9 1 2 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ HAMA. Decreased CEA recovery $( 5 5 \% )$ was seen in the presence of rheumatoid factor at $2 4 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The sponsor states that the RF concentration exceeds any value expected in usual serum samples. The limitations section of the labeling will reflect this interference.

Interference with various chemotherapeutic drugs was evaluated at a separate site during clinical study testing for precision. A modified variation of CLSI document EP7-A2 was used. Twenty-seven drug interferents were added to a human serum pool containing a known CEA concentration $( 2 4 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L } \pm 3 . 3 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ; range 21.3 to 27.9) and tested in three assay runs. The drugs tested represent drugs typically used in treatment and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. The following drugs were tested:

Tested interfering drugs 5-fluorouracil Acetaminophen N-acetyl-L-cysteine Acetylsalycilic acid Ampicillin Ascorbic acid Bleomycin Carboplatin Cefoxitin Cisplatin Cyclophosphamide Cyclosporine Dactinomycin Doxocycline Doxorubicin Etoposide Ibuprofen Levodopa Methotrexate Metronidazole Mitomycin C Naprosyn Paclitaxel Phenylbutazone Rifampicin Vinblastine Vincristine

The acceptance criterion is a ratio of test sample to control between 0.9 and 1.10. The sponsor notes that rifampicin tested at 2 concentrations had significant interference (ratio of 0.03 at $1 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ and 0.04 at $0 . 7 6 6 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ). No significant interference was noted for other tested drugs. All %recoveries were between 0.9 and 1.1 with the exception of N-acetyl-L-cysteine at $2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and acetylsalicyclic acid at $1 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ (%recoveries ranged from 0.85 to 1.15). For rifampicin, a statement is included in the Limitations section of the labeling. The recovery for N-acetyl-Lcysteine at $2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and acetylsalicyclic acid at $1 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ will be claimed at $8 5 \%$ - $1 1 5 \%$ recovery.

Cross-reactivity with beta-HCG, CA125, CA27.29, CA19-9, AFT, Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) was assessed using samples serving as calibrators in respective TOSOH assays at its designated concentration. A human serum-based diluent served as a blank. The samples and concentrations tested are:

• Beta-HCG - 206 mIU/mL • CA125 - 100 U/mL • CA27.29 - 21.6 U/mL • CA19-9 - 423 U/mL • AFP - 201 ng/mL • PSA - 52 ng/mL • PAP - $1 9 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

All samples gave CEA values less than $2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , the acceptance criterion for this analysis.

f. Assay cut-off:

The sponsor defines a $1 2 . 2 \%$ percentage change in CEA values as significant. The significant change is 2.5 times the total imprecision of the CEA assay across sites, lots, and concentration (expressed as $\% \mathrm { C V } = 4 . 8 \%$ ). The sponsor chose this value to ensure that the change in CEA value is not attributed to assay variation.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Using 1307 samples representing paired values between 0.5 and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were tested with the proposed and predicate assays. Deming regression analysis of comparison gave a slope of 0.941 $9 5 \%$ CI 0.824 to 1.058) and an intercept of -1.291 ( $9 5 \%$ CI -1.681 to -0.90). The slope was not significantly different from 1.0 ( $9 5 \%$ CI of slope includes 1.0) indicating the lack of proportional bias in assay result between the proposed and predicate assay. The intercept is significantly different from 0 $9 5 \%$ CI does not include 0) indicating the presence of constant bias between the two assays.

Using 311 samples collected from colon cancer subjects undergoing serial surveillance monitoring for disease progression, Deming regression analysis yielded a slope of the best fit line of 0.82 ( $9 5 \%$ CI 0.527 to 1.107) and an intercept of 13.3 ( $9 5 \%$ CI 0.27 to 26.31). This analysis indicates the presence of constant bias of 13.3 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ in serial surveillance monitoring samples when using the proposed assay compared with the predicate assay. Proportional bias is not present in this comparison.

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

Not applicable since only serum specimens are utilized.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

$b$ . Clinical specificity:

The National Cancer Institute’s fact sheet for colorectal cancer (http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html) notes the following information: The stage distribution based on historic stage shows that $40 \%$ of colon and rectum cancer cases are diagnosed while the cancer is still confined to the primary site (localized stage); $36 \%$ are diagnosed after the cancer has spread to regional lymph nodes or directly beyond the primary site; $19 \%$ are diagnosed after the cancer has already metastasized (distant stage) and for the remaining $5 \%$ the staging information was unknown. The corresponding 5-year relative survival rates were: $89 . 7 \%$ for localized; $6 8 . 4 \%$ for regional; $10 . 8 \%$ for distant; and $3 6 . 6 \%$ for unstaged.

Localized stage as described in this way is stage I and II. Regional stage corresponds to stage III, and distant stage corresponds to stage IV. Therefore the stage distribution for stage III and IV would be $5 5 \%$ . The fact that the sponsor’s study utilized $70 \%$ subjects as stage III and IV indicates a significant over-sampling of these subjects in the study.

The outcome of interest was defined as progression of disease from time point $i$ (clinical visit $i$ , $i { = } 1$ to n-1) to a succeeding time point j (clinical visit $j , j { = } i { + } 1$ to n). The number of clinical visits for which samples and data are available is defined as n. The visit number made by a study subject is at the time of diagnosis or after diagnosis and prior to death, loss to follow-up or remission of disease. The sponsor statistically defines $\mathrm { W _ { i j } }$ as a variable representing disease progression and has 2 values as follows:

1 if there is disease progression from visit $i$ to visit $j$

0 if no progression (stable disease, response to therapy) from visit $i$ to visit $j$ Disease progression is determined by the subject’s physician and is based on any or a composite of physical signs/symptoms, results of lab tests for colorectal cancer, radiographic findings (CAT scans, PET scans, MRI, x-ray, or ultrasound), or patient reported symptoms.

The sponsor defines the variable $\mathbf { V } _ { \mathrm { I j } }$ as 1 if the difference in value of the test assay at visit $i \left( \mathbf { x } _ { i } \right)$ and value of the test assay at a later visit $j \left( \mathbf { { x } } _ { j } \right)$ is greater than or equal to $1 2 . 2 \%$ (i.e. $\mathbf { v } _ { i j } = 1$ if $( \mathbf { { X } } _ { j } - \mathbf { { X } } _ { i } ) \geq 1 2 . 2 \% )$ . The variable $\mathrm { v } _ { i j }$ is 0 if the difference is otherwise (i.e. $\mathbf { V } _ { i j } = 0$ if $( \mathbf { { x } } _ { j } - \mathbf { { x } } _ { i } ) < 1 2 . 2 \% )$ . The sponsor chose this value to ensure that the change in CEA value is not attributed to assay variation and is statistically significant. In the same way, the percentage change in the predicate device was defined as 2.5 times the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of total imprecision as stated in the predicate package insert. This value was $2 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 4 \% = 1 0 \%$ change.

To determine an association between the variables w (disease progression) and v (change in CEA value) a $2 \times 2$ contingency table can be constructed to find an association between variables. Items in each of the 4 cells represent pairs of v and w (1 and/or 0) for visits for all subjects (or for subjects only). The total concordance from the $2 \times 2$ contingency table (equivalent with total agreement), positive concordance, and negative concordance can be calculated. In each situation, it is assumed that agreement is with physician determined disease progression or no progression. No specification for concordance values was present. A similar definition and association will be sought for the predicate device for comparison purposes.

The table and calculation of concordance values for the association of the proposed test with disease state across all patient visits for all subjects is the following:

The probability of no association between disease status and change in VIDAS CEA $( \geq 1 2 . 2 \% )$ was less than 0.0001. The difference in positive concordance (0.672) and 1 minus the negative concordance (1-0.660) was 0.332 ( $9 5 \%$ CI of difference 0.196 to 0.469). The test is informative on a per visit basis.

Comparison of the concordance values for the proposed and predicate assays was available from analysis of the line listings for monitored colorectal cancer subjects. For comparison of the positive concordance (concordance of $\%$ change in CEA among subjects with progression) the following table results:

The difference in positive concordance value was $2 . 9 \%$ , the proposed assay having a higher concordance value. However, the difference is not statistically significant ( $9 5 \%$ CI of difference is -0.119 to 0.061).

For comparison of the negative concordance (concordance of %change in CEA among subjects without progression) the following table results:

The difference in negative concordance value was $3 . 9 \%$ , the proposed assay having a higher concordance value. However, the difference is not statistically significant ( $9 5 \%$ CI of difference is -0.026 to 0.104).

Comparison of the $\%$ change in CEA value in the clinical study population of subjects was performed. A graphical representation of the $\% { \mathrm { C E A } }$ change in the proposed and predicate assay is shown in the following graph.

![](images/da66ae27205d1aa7ed958bb8cadc01a485e67f54c3ab8cae1710bae0bedf99bd.jpg)

Note from the graph that the linear correlation between $\% { \mathrm { C E A } }$ change is modestly good. Among non-progressing subjects, the slope of the best fit line is 1.14 $9 5 \%$ CI 1.005 to 1.274), a value significantly different from 1.0. The intercept of the line for non-progressing subjects was 0.026 ( $9 5 \%$ CI -0.100 to 0.152), a value not

significantly different from 0. Among progressing subjects, the slope of the best fit line is 1.22 ( $9 5 \%$ CI 1.160 to 1.281), a value different from 1.0. The intercept of the line for progressing subjects was 0.094 $9 5 \%$ CI -0.115 to 0.304), a value not different from 0. The $9 5 \%$ CIs of the regression line on the graph is the interval for the progressing subjects. This indicates that the slopes of the best fit line for nonprogressing and progressing subjects are equivalent up to approximately $100 \%$ change, despite the difference in the slopes from 1.0. This fact suggests similar, possibly equivalent, slopes and equivalent $\% { \mathrm { C E A } }$ changes in both assays.

ROC analysis was performed of the proposed test with disease state classifications for all subjects with any progression/no progression and any change in CEA value (223 events in 80 subjects). There is no cutoff value for $\%$ change in CEA that is published or clinically accepted as a reasonable choice. Therefore, clinicians can choose a cutoff value that they believe is acceptable for the clinical situation of the patient they are managing. The following table summarizes various sensitivity values and the resulting specificities and cutoff values at a chosen sensitivity value for the proposed device:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=5>VIDASlower 95%     upper 95%CI of            CI ofcutoff       Sensitivity   specificity     specificity      specificity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sensitivity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>specificity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>lower 95%CI ofspecificity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>upper 95%CI ofspecificity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-48.9%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90.6%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.3%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.8%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>17.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>75.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50.3%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42.3%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>58.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.3%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>67.2%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>66.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>58.1%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>73.4%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24.3%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>62.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>75.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>68.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>81.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>47.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>53.1%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>86.8%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>91.6%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>184.2%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95.6%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>91.1%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>98.2%</td></tr></table>

Note from the table that at high sensitivity there is low specificity $( \sim 1 2 \% )$ and the cutoff $\%$ change value is negative. At a cutoff value of $12 . 3 \%$ , very near the sponsor choice of cutoff, the specificity of the proposed assay is $6 6 \%$ . At this specificity for the predicate assay, the sensitivity is equivalent $( 6 6 . 7 \% )$ with the proposed assay but the cutoff value for %change in CEA is different, $- 0 . 8 \%$ or essentially $0 \%$ .

4. Clinical cut-off:

The sponsor defines a $1 2 . 2 \%$ percentage change in CEA values as significant. The significant change is 2.5 times the total imprecision of the CEA assay across sites, lots, and concentration (expressed as $\% \mathrm { C V } = 4 . 8 \%$ ). The sponsor chose this value to ensure that the change in CEA value is not attributed to assay variation.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Estimation and empirical distributions of CEA values in various populations of subjects was performed. A normal healthy population of subjects was recruited for assessment of CEA values. Approximately 150 each of male and female subjects aged 18-80 years of age who were apparently healthy (by self report) and were not sick on the day of serum sampling were tested using the proposed assay. Additionally approximately 75 current/recent male and female smokers were recruited and tested in the proposed assay. Cumulative distributions and order statistics were calculated in normal healthy

individuals. Confidence intervals for the $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ , $9 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ , and $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ order statistic were constructed. The results for these normal healthy subjects for the $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Population</td><td>Percentile</td><td>CEA Estimate</td><td>Lower 95% confidence</td><td>Upper 95% confidence</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5th</td><td>(ng/mL)</td><td>limit</td><td>limit</td></tr><tr><td>Female non- smokers</td><td>95th</td><td>0.50 1.77</td><td>0.50 1.34</td><td>0.50 2.44</td></tr><tr><td>Female smokers</td><td>5th</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td>95th</td><td>3.12</td><td>2.42</td><td>3.53</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Male non-smokers Male smokers</td><td>95th</td><td>2.78</td><td>2.19</td><td>3.23</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.53</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>95th</td><td>5.10</td><td>3.63</td><td>6.44</td></tr></table>

The empirical distribution of CEA in normal healthy individuals is fundamentally different and the labeling should reflect the differences.

The following benign disease cohort of 423 subjects was collected for analysis of the CEA distribution:

Benign urogenital disease 54   
Benign diseases of gastrointestinal tract and lung 110   
Diabetes 106   
Heart disease/hypertension/liver disease 108   
Benign breast disease 45

Subjects were males and females 18-80 years of age who had no history of malignancy (other than non-invasive skin cancer) diagnosed with the above benign diseases. ANOVA analysis was performed on the CEA values and also included factors for disease group (5 levels), smoking status (3 levels) and age category $( < 5 6$ years and $> 5 6$ years). Analysis indicated a significant smoking and age effect. Empirical distributions and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals of the $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ , ${ \mathsf { 9 0 } } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ , and $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles was developed and is summarized as follows ${ 9 0 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile value not shown):

The following malignant disease cohort of 514 subjects was collected for analysis of the CEA distribution:

Lung/liver cancer 102   
Gall bladder/biliary/gastric/pancreatic cancer   
Prostate/testicular/bladder cancer 147   
Colorectal cancer 151   
Breast cancer 55

Banked serum samples from the above subjects who were 18-80 years of age, had a no history of other malignancy (except non-invasive skin cancer), and diagnosed with only one of the above cancers were selected and analyzed for CEA values. ANOVA analysis was performed on the CEA values and also included factors for disease group (5 levels), smoking status (4 levels) and age at diagnosis. The results indicated no differences in CEA level. Empirical distributions and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals of the $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } } .$ , $9 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ , and $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles was developed and is summarized as follows ${ \mathfrak { g } } 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile value not shown):
