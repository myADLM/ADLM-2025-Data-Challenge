Summary Prepared On: February 1, 2008

2. Device Name:

Trade/Proprietary Name:

The HY• TECTM Extended Specific IgE EIA, MCS Assay Using The Tecan Freedom EVO® RSP 200

Common/Usual Name:

Enzyme Immunoassay System for Specific IgE

Classification Name:

Radioallergosorbent (RAST) Immunological Test System

3. Legally Marketed Equivalent Device Name:

We are claiming substantial equivalence to the The HY • TECTM Automated EIA System for Total IgE and Specific IgE, MCS Assay Using The HY• TECTM 480, cleared 510(k) K941278.

4. Intended Use of the Device:

The HY•TECTM Extended Specific IgE EIA, MCS Assay Using The Tecan Freedom $\mathbf { E V O } ^ { \mathfrak { P } }$ RSP 200 is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method for the quantitative determination of allergen-specific IgE concentrations in human serum. The assay system is for in-vitro diagnostic use.

The EVO RSP 200 Automated EIA instrument is a fully-automated system, which performs sample dilution and pipetting, incubation, washing, reading and data analysis and prints reports. The EVO RSP 200 Automated EIA System for Specific IgE performs the same functions as the HY• TEC 480 Automated EIA System. The specific IgE assay for both systems, the HY • TEC 480 and the EVO RSP 200, is the same (utilizes same reagents and procedures) except for the following:

A zero calibrator is being added to the current set of five calibrators (0.35, 0.7, 3.5, 17.5 and 100 IU/mL) for the EVO Specific IgE assay.

The incubation times and temperatures have been changed.

The HY •TEC 480 and EVO RSP 200 allergy systems are standardized using antiIgE discs and reference sera calibrated against WHO $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ IRP 75/502 and offers a broad menu of specific allergens. An allergen-coated paper disc is incubated with a serum sample. Non-specific proteins are removed by washing and the disc is incubated with enzyme-labeled monoclonal anti human IgE conjugate. Following a second wash, substrate color is developed. The results are read spectrophotometrically against a calibration curve; results are reported in both $\mathrm { I U } I _ { \mathrm { I m L } }$ and Classes.

# 6. Device Comparison, Verification and Results:

Validation of software, instrument functions and assay performance, including correlation with the predicate, intra and inter assay precision, limits of detection and quantitation, and dilution linearity demonstrate the acceptability of the EVO RSP 200.

# 7. Conclusion:

The EVO RSP 200 has the same technological characteristics and intended use as the HY• TEC 480. Therefore, the modified device does not raise any new safety or effectiveness issues.

Dear Mr. Nayak:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must coply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set for in the quality systems (QS) regulation (1 CFR Part 820).This letter will alow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The
