# L. Test Principle:

The Access Myoglobin assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with the mouse monoclonal anti-myoglobin alkaline phosphatase conjugate, mouse monoclonal anti-myoglobin-biotin conjugate, and paramagnetic particles coated with a goat polyclonal anti-biotin. Human serum myoglobin binds to anti-myoglobin biotin conjugate and is immobilized on paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-biotin antibody, while the mouse antimyoglobin alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts specifically with a different antigenic site on the myoglobin molecule. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of myoglobin in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were designed according to the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Five levels of control materials were measured twice a day in duplicate on two separate UniCel $\mathbf { D x I 8 0 0 }$ analyzers for 20 days. The results from one of the two instruments $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ) are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SampleID</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean(ng/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within-run(CV %)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Between-run (CV %)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Totalprecision(CV %)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>78.73</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.49</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.39</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>177.97</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.05</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.34</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.32</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>427.74</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.32</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.44</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.60</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1624.61</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.45</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.58</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.25</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2404.64</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.11</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.51</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.13</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study across the entire measuring range was assessed using the UniCel $\mathrm { D x I } 8 0 0$ analyzer. Two previously frozen spiked serum samples were analyzed in this study, one sample at greater than $4 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and a second lower sample at approximately $7 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Five dilutions were prepared from both of these samples using Sample Diluent A as the diluent. All samples were tested in replicates of seven in random order. The range of the samples tested was from $0 . 6 4 - 4 1 7 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The values were plotted for the expected concentrations (X) verses the observed concentrations (Y) and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regressions was calculated. The linear regression correlation is $\mathrm { Y } { = } 1 . 0 1 2 \mathrm { X } + 6 . 6 4 1$ , ( $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I }$ for slope is 0.98 to 1.043 and intercept is -36.9 to 50.19).

The data provided support the sponsor’s claims that the reportable range of this assay is $\mathrm { 1 - 4 0 0 0 n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Access Myoglobin Calibrators is traceable to the in-house calibrations. See k021229

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) determination was based on multiple measurements of the Myoglobin calibrator, S0, on multiple instruments. The mean, SD, and $\%$ CV were calculated. The limit of blank for Myoglobin as determined by being distinguishable from zero with $9 5 \%$ confidence is $0 . 2 1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ on DxI 800. Limit of Detections (LoD) determination was based on measurements of 4 low samples in replicates of 7 on a $\mathbf { D x I 8 0 0 }$ analyzer according to CLSI EP17-A. The sponsor claimed that the LoD is $0 . 7 6 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The Access Myoglobin assay has a reportable range of $\scriptstyle 1 - 4 0 0 0 { \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were designed according to the CLSI EP7-A guideline. A normal human serum was spiked with the known interference substances and analyzed in replicate of ten on the $\mathbf { D x I 8 0 0 }$ analyzer. No significant interference was defined as the observed value ${ < } 1 0 \%$ of the expected value (neat sample). The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference $( < 1 0 \% )$ by the following interferents:

• Hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Bilirubin up to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Triglycerides (triolein) up to $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Human serum albumin up to $6 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:

“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by heterophile antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may produce antibodies, e.g. HAMA, that interferes with immunoassays. Additionally, other heterophile antibodies such as human anti-goat antibodies may be present in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous results. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these antibodies.”

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed at an internal site. A total of 110 serum samples were evaluated using UniCel DxI 800 (candidate) and Access 2 (predicate). Deming regression analyses were used to evaluate the correlations between results obtained using the UniCel $\mathrm { D x I } 8 0 0$ and Access 2. Correlation regression is summarized below:

$\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 3 \mathrm { X } + 7 . 4 7$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9$ , range of sample tested $= 3 2 . 3 - 3 7 4 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ( $\mathrm { X = }$ Access 2 and $\mathrm { Y = }$ UniCel DxI 800)

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

In the labeling, the sponsor recommends serum, EDTA and heparinized plasma as the samples to use. Matrix comparisons between all the sample types were previously performed on the Access 2 analyzer. See previously cleared submission, k021229

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:   
Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity:   
Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A reference range study was performed by evaluating 277 healthy subjects (140 males and 137 females, age range from 22-93) on the Access 2 analyzer. The cen

tral $9 5 \%$ reference intervals for different sample types were determined as follows:

<table><tr><td>Sample type</td><td>Sex</td><td>Reference intervals (ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Heparin plasma and serum</td><td>Females</td><td>14.3-65.8</td></tr><tr><td>Males</td><td>17.4-105.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">EDTA plasma</td><td>Females</td><td>11.1-57.5</td></tr><tr><td>Males</td><td>15.2 - 91.2</td></tr></table>
