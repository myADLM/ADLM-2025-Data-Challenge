# Device Description

VIDAS® CA 125 II is an automated quantitative test for use on the VIDAS instruments, for the measurement of CA 125 reactive antigenic determinants in human serum using the ELFA technique (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay). The VIDAS CA 125 II is indicated for the serial measurement of OC 125 reactive antigenic determinants as an aid in the monitoring of patients previously diagnosed with Stage IV (metastatic) ovarian cancer for disease progression or response to therapy. The VIDAS CA 125 Il assay can also be used as an aid in the early detection of recurrence in previously treated Stage II and Ill ovarian cancer patients.

CA 125 Ilis a registered trademark from Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. (formerly named Centocor Diagnostics of Pennsylvania, Inc.)

The assay principle combines a two-step immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR), a pipette tip-like device, serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. It is coated with mouse monoclonal M 11 antibodies. The other assay reagents are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips (STRs). The individual kit components are described in detail on the following pages.

All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. This operation enables the monoclonal M11 antibody fixed onto the interior wall of the SPR to capture the reactive antigenic determinants present in the sample. Unbound components are eliminated during the washing steps. Alkaline phosphatase labeled mouse monoclonal OC 125 antibody (conjugate) is then incubated in the SPR where it binds with the OC 125 reactive antigenic determinant. Unbound conjugate is then eliminated during the washing steps.

During the final detection step, the substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of OC 125 reactive antigenic determinants present in the sample.

At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to the calibration curve stored in memory, and then printed out.

# E. Intended Use

VIDAS® CA 125 II is an automated quantitative test for use on the VIDAS instruments, for the measurement of OC 125 reactive antigenic determinants in human serum using the ELFA technique (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay). The VIDAS CA 125 II is indicated for the serial measurement of OC 125 reactive antigenic determinants as an aid in the monitoring of patients previously diagnosed with ovarian cancer for disease progression or response to therapy. The VIDAS CA 125 Il assay can also be used as an aid in the detection of recurrence in previously treated ovarian cancer patients.

# G Performance Data

A summary of some of the non-clinical and clinical test results is presented in the tables below.

# Precision:

Three serum samples were tested in duplicate in 40 different runs (2 runs per day over 20 sequential days) with 2 reagent lots using one instrument at each of three sites $( N = 4 8 0 )$ . The between-site precision, between-lot precision, between-recalibration precision, betweenday precision, between-run precision, repeatability (within-run precision) and total precision (within-run, between-run, between-day, between-recalibration, between-lot and between-site) were calculated using a modified protocol, which was written based on the recommendations of $\mathsf { C L S l } ^ { \otimes }$ EP5-A2:

# Measurement range

The measurement range of the VIDAS CA 125 Il kit is: 4-600 U/mL.

# Analytical detection limit

Based on a modification of $\mathsf { C L S l } ^ { \otimes }$ document EP17-A , LoB, LoD and LoQ detection limit results are estimated to be less than $4 0 / \mathsf { m l }$ .

# Hook effect

No hook effect was found up to OC 125 reactive antigenic determinant concentrations of 200,000 U/mL.

# Comparison with other test methods

One serum sample randomly chosen from each of the 77 women with ovarian cancer tested for the monitoring of the disease status (77 samples) and for the expected values (133 samples) using the VIDAS® CA 125 I1 $( Y )$ assay were compared with another commercially available CA 125 |l assay (X). The results obtained are presented below (Deming). The equation represents the relationship between the two techniques.
