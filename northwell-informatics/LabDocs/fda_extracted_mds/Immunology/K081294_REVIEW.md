2. Indication(s) for use:

The ADVIA Chemistry CardioPhase High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of the concentration of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in human serum and plasma (lithium heparin or

potassium EDTA) on the ADVIA Chemistry systems. In acute phase response, increased levels of a number of plasma proteins, including CRP, are observed. Measurement of CRP is useful for the detection and evaluation of infection, tissue injury, inflammatory disorders, and associated diseases. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements may be used as an independent risk marker for the identification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease. Measurement of hsCRP, when used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.

The ADVIA Chemistry CardioPhase High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of ADVIA Chemistry systems for the CardioPhase High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein method.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI - Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices - EP05-A2 CLSI - Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods - EP06-A CLSI - Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation - EP17-A

# L. Test Principle:

The CardioPhase hsCRP latex reagent is a suspension of uniform polystyrene latex particles coated with anti-CRP antibody. When serum or plasma containing CRP is mixed with the latex reagent, agglutination takes place resulting in an increase in turbidity. This turbidity is measured at $5 7 1 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ . The CRP concentration in serum or plasma is determined from a calibration curve that is generated with the calibrator materials.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within run and total imprecision were evaluated by testing five serum pools and three levels of control materials. Each sample was assayed 2 times per run and 2 runs per day for 10 days. All runs were done with one instrument calibration. Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The assay range of this method is from $0 . 1 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ based on Functional Sensitivity (Limit of Quantitation, LOQ) see detection limit below, to the CRP concentration of the highest level linearity.

The linearity of this method was evaluated following the guidelines of CLSI EP6-A protocol where recombinant CRP was spiked into pooled human serum for the high CRP level, which was then diluted with a zero pool to make nine equally spaced linearity pools within the assay range. The observed CRP results on the ADVIA 1650 were compared with the expected CRP concentration. The resulting recovery information is presented in the table below:

Testing the nine samples, the resulting linear regression equation was obtained: Slope $= 0 . 9 8 5 7$ (0.9651 to 1.0062), Intercept $= - 0 . 0 3 0 3$ (-.1857 to 0.1252), $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 7$

Recovery at the lower end of the range was also shown with serial dilutions of the CRM 470 reference material. The linear regression equation obtained from testing the 4 samples was: Slope $= 0 . 9 7 3 0$ (0.9020 to 1.0440), Intercept $=$ - 0.0017 (-0.1620 to 0.1587), $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 7$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability to CRM 470 is claimed for the calibrator materials.

The ADVIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Chemistry CardioPhaseTM High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) Calibrators are used to calibrate the hsCRP method. The calibrators consist of six (6) levels of protein stabilized matrices containing varying concentrations of recombinant human CRP (synthesized in bacteria - not human source). The Calibrators have targeted expected values (lot specific) of 0, 0.53, 1.05, 1.58, 5.25, and $1 0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , and these values are traceable to IRMM reference material CRM 470.

Shelf Life Stability

The ADVIA Chemistry hsCRP calibrator materials have a shelf stability of 18 months stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and have open-vial stability of 60 days when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ .

Real Time:

The Shelf Life of the ADVIA Chemistry hsCRP calibrator materials was evaluated with Real Time Stability testing at the recommended storage temperature $\left( 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ . Two lots of calibrators were tested at Day 0 (QC release) and at 19 months (for one lot) and at 117 weeks (or 27 months for another lot), respectively.

Open Vial:

Open Vial Stability of the ADVIA Chemistry hsCRP calibrator materials was tested up to 60 days (64 days for the 2nd lot). On Day 0, calibrators were used to calibrate ADVIA 1650 hsCRP method, and recoveries of the controls were obtained using this calibration. The opened calibrator vials (each level) were then recapped and stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ . At each checkpoint following Day 0, these stored, opened vials of calibrators were used for calibration and control recovery, and compared to control recoveries from calibration with freshly opened vials of calibrators.

The sponsor’s acceptance criteria are as follows: less than $+ 1 0 \%$ difference in control recovery using calibration with open calibrator materials versus calibration with fresh calibrator materials

# d. Detection limit:

The functional sensitivity (Limit of Quantitation) of this assay is $0 . 1 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , which is the lowest CRP concentration in a sample where total imprecision is less than $10 \%$ .

CRM 470 material was serially diluted to $0 . 9 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , $0 . 4 9 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , 0.247 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ , $0 . 1 2 4 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ and $0 . 0 6 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Each level was run at 8 reps/run, 5 runs total (40 reps total) on the ADVIA 1650. $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and $\%$ deviation from the target were calculated. To determine the CRP concentration at which $20 \%$ deviation of accuracy and $10 \%$ precision and the observed recovery vs. deviation from target data was plotted.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference was evaluated by spiking human serum pools with hemoglobin (from lysed human red blood cells), unconjugated (free) bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, triglycerides (Intralipid) and Rheumatoid Factor (RF). Multiple levels of each of the interfering substances were tested at a clinically relevant CRP concentration. Samples were assayed in duplicate. The results for each analyzer are presented in the labeling. There was no significant interference for bilirubin up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , for hemolysis up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , lipemia up to $7 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and rheumatoid factor up to $1 0 4 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

All results passed Siemens Diagnostics internal acceptance criteria for interference of $\leq 1 0 \%$ up to the acceptable level of interferent.

The labeling includes a limitation that there is a potential that heterophilic antibodies may interfere with this method. Also, the labeling includes a statement that the performance of this method has not been evaluated with patients containing heterophilic antibodies.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable   
$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): The method comparison studies between the device and the former Dade Behring CardioPhase™ hsCRP on the BNII system (this predicate device was used in the clinical studies supporting an indication for cardiovascular use) demonstrate acceptable correlation between both methods, thus the performance and accuracy of the device is substantially equivalent to those of the predicate device.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected values provided in the labeling for healthy individuals as noted in the literature are typically $\leq 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

The below referenced AHA/CDC Scientific Statement concerning inflammation and cardiovascular markers also reports that CRP values $< 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ are low risk for cardiovascular disease prediction, values between $1 - 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ are average risk for cardiovascular disease prediction and values $\mathrm { \Omega } > 3 \mathrm { m g / L \Omega }$ are high risk for cardiovascular disease prediction.
