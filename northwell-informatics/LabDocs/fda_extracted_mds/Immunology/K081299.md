# 4. Device Descriptions:

# Dimsion Vista® System RF Flex® reagent cartrige

Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# Dimension Vista® System Protein 1 Calibrator

Protein 1 Calibrator is a multi-analyte, liquid human serum based product containing ${ a } _ { 1 } \cdot$ acid glycoprotein, ${ \mathfrak { a } } _ { 1 }$ -antitrypsin, $\beta _ { 2 }$ -microglobulin, C3 complement, C4 complement, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, hemopexin, homocystine, immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin E, immunoglobulin $\textsf { G }$ , immunoglobulin G subclass 1, immunoglobulin G subclass 2, immunoglobulin G subclass 3, immunoglobulin G subclass 4, immunoglobulin M, prealbumin, retinol binding protein, soluble transferrin receptor and transferrin.

# Dimension Vista® System Protein 3 Control

Protrein 3 Control is a multi-analyte, lyophilized, polygeline and rabbit plasma albumin based product containing $a _ { 1 }$ -Microglobulin, albumin, immunoglobulin G and transferrin.

# 5. Device Intended Uses:

Dimension Vista® System TRF $\mathsf { F l e x } ^ { \boldsymbol { \mathfrak { G } } }$ reagent cartridge:

The TRF method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of transferrin in human serum, heparinized plasma, EDTA plasma or urine on the Dimension Vista® System. Measurements of transferrin aid in the diagnosis of malnutrition, acute inflammation, infection, and iron deficiency anemia.

# Dimension Vista® System Protein 3 Control:

PROT3 CON is an assayed, Iow level intralaboratory quality control for assessment of precision and analytical bias on the Dimension Vista® System in the determination of α-Microglobulin (A1MIC), specialty Albumin (sALB\*), Immunoglobulin G (IGG $- G ^ { \ast } ]$

Microalbumin (MALB) and Transferrin (TRF- $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { U } } ^ { \star \star }$ )

\* For Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \*\* For urine

6. Medical devices to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Dimension Vista® System TRF assay, Dimension Vista® System Protein 1 Calibrator and Dimension Vista® System Protein 3 Control are substantially equivalent and have the same intended uses to the Dade Behring N Antisera to Human Transferrin (K053075), Dade Behring N Protein Standard SL (K012470) and Dade Behring N/T Protein Control LC (K032237), respectively.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The Dimension Vista® System TRF assay was compared to the Dade Behring N Antisera to Human Transferrin assay on the BN ProSpec® System by evaluating urine samples with concentrations ranging from 2.0 to $2 4 . 4 \ m g / L$ .Regression analysis of these results yielded the following equation:

Dear Mr. Ricsgo:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your devicc to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450.
