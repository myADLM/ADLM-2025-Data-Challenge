# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP17-A: “Protocol for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline”   
CLSI EP5-A2: “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline-Second Edition”

L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys Anti-CCP immunoassay is a two step IgG-capture test principle immunoassay with streptavidin-coated microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision of the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Anti-CCP Test System was evaluated on Elecsys® 2010/cobas $\mathbf { e } ^ { \mathcal { P } } 4 1 1$ Immunoassay Analyzer according to CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each control $( { \mathrm { P C } } =$ PreciControl) or sample $\mathrm { H } \mathbf { S } =$ human serum) per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days. Within run precision and total precision was calculated according to EP5-A2.

A 10 day inter-assay precision study with a sample at $6 6 4 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ was also performed to support high end precision. Results are acceptable with $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of $3 . 4 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the Elecsys® Anti-CCP was evaluated on the Elecsys® 2010/cobas $\mathbf { e } ^ { \mathcal { P } } 4 1 1$ Immunoassay Analyzer by diluting three high through medium analyte level serum sample pools with varying amounts of low-level serum. Pure samples $0 \%$ and $100 \%$ ) were run $\mathrm { n } { = } 6$ with mean measured value reported. The regression equations of the three pools are as follows:

Sample 1 $\therefore y = 1 . 0 0 2 9 \mathrm { x } - 4 . 1 7 3 3$ ; $\scriptstyle \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 2$   
Sample 2: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 1 3 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 5 1 4 6$ ; $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 2$   
Sample 3: $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 2 6 1 \mathrm { x } { + } 5 . 4 9 7 \mathrm { l }$ ; $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 4 4$

The measuring range is $\mathrm { 8 - 1 0 0 0 U / m L }$ (defined by the limit of detection and the maximum of the master curve). Performance information at the low end of the assay range is summarized in the Detection Limit section below. Roche has performed linearity testing to cover the low end of the measuring range. The linear regression is $y = 0 . 9 3 3 8 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 2 2 7 6$ ; $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 0 4$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): There is no recognized material for anti-CCP. The Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Anti-CCP test is standardized against a commercially available anti-CCP assay.

d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank and limit of detection were determined in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A requirements.

The limit of blank $( \leq 7 \mathrm { U / m L } )$ is the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile value from $\mathrm { n } \geq 6 0$ measurements of analyte free samples over several independent series. The limit of blank corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free samples are found with a probability of $9 5 \%$ . The distribution of values for five zero-level human serum samples have been determined on two Elecsys® 2010 / cobas $\mathbf { e } ^ { \mathcal { P } } 4 1 1$ Immunoassay Analyzer over 3 days, 2 runs per day.

The limit of detection $( \leq 8 \mathrm { ~ U / m L } )$ ) is determined based on the limit of blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The limit of detection corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be detected (value above the limit of blank with a probability of $9 5 \%$ ). The distribution of values for five low-level human serum samples have been determined on two Elecsys® 2010 / cobas $\mathbf { e } ^ { \mathcal { P } } 4 1 1$ Immunoassay Analyzer over 3 days, 2 runs per day.

The limit of quantitation $\mathrm { ( 8 ~ U / m L ) }$ is the lowest analyte concentration that can be reproducibly measured with a between-run coefficient of variation of $\leq$ $20 \%$ . It has been determined using low concentration anti-CCP samples.

Nine human serum sample pools with concentrations ranging from 6.57 to $2 7 . 2 \mathrm { U / m L }$ were tested once per day, for 10 days.

e. Analytical specificity:

Effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances using the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Anti-CCP Immunoassay was determined on

Elecsys $\textcircled{8}$ 2010/cobas $\mathbf { e } ^ { \mathcal { P } } 4 1 1$ Immunoassay Analyzer using natural (low analyte concentration) and spiked serum sample pools.

The assay is unaffected by:

• Bilirubin: $< 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Hemoglobin: $< 0 . 5 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ $\bullet$ Intralipid: $< 1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $\bullet$ Biotin: $< 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Rheumatoid Factors: $< 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$

Hook effect:

No hook effect was detected up to concentration of $7 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

In cohorts of 792 confirmed rheumatoid arthritis patients, 420 asymptomatic healthy individuals and 907 patients with other rheumatic and non-rheumatic disorders, an optimal cut-off of $1 7 \mathrm { U / m L }$ was determined. At this cut-off the sensitivity was calculated at $6 7 . 7 \%$ and the specificity at $9 7 . 0 \%$ . The calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: A method comparison study was performed to compare the Elecsys Anti-CCP values obtained with both the Elecsys® 2010/cobas $\mathbf { \hat { e } } ^ { \otimes } 4 1 1$ and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas $\mathbf { e } ^ { \mathcal { P } } 6 0 1$ Immunoassay Analyzer to the values obtained with the predicate device Eurodiagnostica IMMUNOSCAN RA Anti-CCP.

Cohort:

Non-RA cohort:

Negative cohort consisting of 319 apparently healthy individuals and 673 patients with non-rheumatoid arthritis diseases; in total 992 patients from two sites.

# RA Cohort:

Positive cohort consisting of 614 patients with clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis based on the ARA (American Rheumatology Association) 1987 Revised Criteria for the Classification of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

1606 samples tested using a cut-off $\mathrm { \Delta } ) \mathrm { f } \geq 1 7 \mathrm { ~ U } / \mathrm { m L }$ for the Elecsys Anti-CCP assay.

b. Matrix comparison:

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with Elecsys Anti-CCP Immunoassay was determined on Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer by comparing values obtained from samples drawn into Serum, Li- and K3-EDTA-Heparin plasma primary tubes. Potential effects are assessed by Passing/Bablok regression analysis. The following was found:

Serum/K3-EDTA: y=1.10x-0.977 (anti- $\mathrm { C C P } = \ 8 . 3 7 { - } 4 7 3 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ , $\mathrm { n } { = } 3 1$ ) Serum/Li-Heparin: y=1.03x-0.143 (anti- $\mathrm { C C P } = \mathrm { 8 . 3 7 } \mathrm { - 7 6 9 ~ U / m L } ,$ $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = } 3 3$ )

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity: The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined by testing 792 confirmed rheumatoid arthritis patients, 420 asymptomatic healthy individuals and 907 patients with other rheumatic and non-rheumatic disorders. Results showed sensitivity and specificity of $6 7 . 7 \%$ and $9 7 . 0 \%$ respectively.
