# Intended Use

The PAXgene ™ Blood RNA System consists of a blood collection tube (PAXgene ™ Blood RNA Tube) and nucleic acid purification kit (PAXgene ™ Blood RNA Kit). It is intended for the collection, storage, and transport of blood and stabilization of intracellular RNA in a closed tube and subsequent isolation and purification of host RNA from whole blood for RT-PCR used in molecular diagnostic testing.

Performance characteristics for the PAXgene™ Blood RNA System have only been established with "cfos and IL1B." The user is responsible for establishing appropriate PAXgene™ Blood RNA System performance characteristics for other target transcripts.

# Device Description:

The PAXgene ™M Blood RNA System consists of:

PAXgene ™ Blood RNA tubes •PAXgene ™ Blood RNA kit.

The PAXgene™ Blood RNA tube is of a sterile, plastic, evacuated blood collection tube containing stabilization solution (tetradecyl trimethyl-ammonium oxalate and tartaric acid. These components serve to lyse cells, protect RNA molecules from degradation by ribonucleases (RNases) and prevent induction of gene expression. The kit consists of 5 aqueous buffer solutions for resuspending, binding, washing, and eluting RNA, RNase-free water, proteinase K, an RNase-Free DNase set, spin columns, microcentrifuge tubes, processing tubes, and secondary blood collection tube closures.

# Substantial Equivalence:

Based on comparison of the device features, materials, intended use and performance, the PAXgene ™ Blood RNA System is shown to be substantially equivalent to the commercially available PAXgene™M Blood RNA System as described in K042613, cleared on April 14, 2005.

The PAXgene ™ Blood RNA System described in this submission differs from the predicate device as described in K042613 as follows:

1. Change in operating principal to allow automation of the PAXgene ™M Blood RNA System sample purification process on QIAGEN's QIAcube instrument.

2. Change in Buffer BR5 (Elution Buffer) volume from 5 mL to 6 mL.

# Summary of Design Control Activities:

The Design Control activities performed demonstrated the RNA obtained from the QlAcube is compatible with molecular diagnostic applications such as mRNA transcript level determination by RT-PCR. Therefore the processing of RNA by the automated protocol on QIAGEN's QlAcube is equivalent to the manual process as described in K042613.

Dear Ms. Ballesteros:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally miarketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
