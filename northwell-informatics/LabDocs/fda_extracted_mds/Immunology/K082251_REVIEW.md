# L. Test Principle:

MA reagent is used to measure the albumin concentration by a turbidimetric method. In the reaction, albumin combines with specific antibody to form insoluble antigenantibody complexes. The Synchron System(s) automatically proportions the appropriate sample and reagent volumes into the cuvette. The ratio used is one part sample to 24 parts reagent. The system monitors the change in absorbance at 380

nanometers. This change in absorbance is proportional to the concentration of albumin in the sample and is used by the system to calculate and express albumin concentration based upon a non-linear calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance was demonstrated on the CX4 CE system.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision studies were designed according to the CLSI EP05-A guideline. Three levels of urine control materials were measured twice a day in duplicates for 20 days $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ). The results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The claimed measuring range for the device is $\mathrm { 0 . 2 { - } 3 0 m g / d L }$

Linearity studies were designed according to the CLSI EP06-A guideline. A high patient urine sample was used to prepare 7 different levels of microalbumin concentration. All samples were measured 4 times on the CX4CE analyzer. Concentration of samples ranged from $0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to 30 mg/dL (0.2, 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30). An appropriate line was fitted by standard linear regression and the following slope and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ measurements were obtained.

Extended measuring range studies (ORDAC) were performed using 8 concentrations ranging from 20- $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80 and 100).

The sponsor claimed that the reportable range is 0.2 to 30 m /dL g and the extended range is 24 t c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The SYNCHRON $\mathrm { C X } ^ { \mathfrak { \otimes } }$ Systems MA Calibrator (six levels) is designed for use on the SYNCHRON CX Systems. Calibrators are traceable to the IFCC reference preparation for plasma proteins, BCR-470. Traceability process is based on EN ISO 17511. Traceability statements for the calibrator are included in the instructions for use included with the calibrator kit.

Calibrators are stable between $+ 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until date of expiration. Exposure of Urine Protein Calibrator to temperatures greater than $3 2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ may adversely affect performance. Once opened, the reagent is stable for 60 days unless the expiration date is exceeded. Users are instructed to not freeze the reagent.

# d. Detection limit:

Studies on limit of detection were performed according to CLSI EP17 guideline. Limit of blank (LoB) and Limit of detection(LoD) were determined by using saline $\mathrm { ( 0 ~ m g / d L ) }$ , protein free urine $( 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , diluted urine protein control $( 0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) and diluted urine protein control $( 0 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . All samples were run in 10 replicates over a period of six days on the CX4CE analyzer. Limit of Blank (LoB) is less than $0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated using the mean and SD for the low sample measurements:

$$
\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 3 * \mathrm { S D }
$$

The Limit of Detection (LoD) is less than $0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were designed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Three levels of patient samples or pools were spiked with the known interference substances and analyzed on the Sychron CX 4 CE analyzer. No significant interference was defined as the observed value for Microalbumin values $\leq 2 . 3 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is $\leq \pm 0 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and values $> 2 . 3 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is $< 1 0 . 8 \%$ difference of the expected value (neat sample). The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference $< 1 0 . 8 \%$ or $\leq \pm 0 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } \rangle$ ) by the following interferents:

• Ascorbic acid to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Calcium up to $1 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Citrate up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Creatinine up to $1 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Glucose up to $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Magnesium up to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Oxalate up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Urea up to $1 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

The sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:

Do not use turbid samples. Samples should be centrifuged before testing if they have debris in them.

• Do not use samples contaminated with blood.   
• If serum proteins carryover is suspected, a saline sample should be assayed prior to assaying the patient samples.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

A method comparison study was performed based on the CLSI EP9-A guideline. A total of 111 urine samples were evaluated using Synchron CX4 (candidate) and IMMAGE (predicate). Deming regression analyses were used to evaluate the correlations between results. Correlation regression is summarized below:

$\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 0 \mathrm { X } - 0 . 1 1$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 8 7$ , range of sample tested $= 0 . 2 \mathrm { - } 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ( $\mathrm { X = }$ IMMAGE and $\mathrm { Y = }$ Synchron CX4)
