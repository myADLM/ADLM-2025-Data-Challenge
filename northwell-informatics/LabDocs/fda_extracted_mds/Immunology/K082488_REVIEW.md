# L. Test Principle:

The Diazyme Lipoprotein (a) Assay is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Lp(a) in the sample binds to specific anti-Lp(a) antibody, which is coated on latex particles, and causes agglutination. The degree of the turbidity caused by agglutination can be measured optically and is proportional to the amount of Lp(a) in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The precision of the Diazyme Lp(a) Enzymatic Assay was evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP5-A guideline. In the study, three levels of serum specimens containing about 17.2, 43.2, and $7 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L } \ : \mathrm { I }$ Lp(a) respectively are tested with 2 runs per day with duplicates over 20 working days on Hitachi 717.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Eleven levels of linearity set were prepared by diluting a serum control containing $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ LP(a) with saline according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP6-A to test a range from 5 to $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ LP(a) and was shown to be linear. The following regression equation was obtained.

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 4 5 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 5 9 9 7 } } \\ { { \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 5 } } \end{array}
$$

The assay has a linear range up to $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and a low reportable range to $5 . 4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ based on LOQ.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrators

Using a single lot of predicate device reagents and calibrator, Diazyme Lp(a) master lot of calibrator materials were assigned values as follows. The calibrator materials were assayed as samples three times in triplicate on the Hitachi 717 Analyzer. For each calibrator level, mean values were calculated from the data points and assigned as the calibrator value. For each new lot of calibrator materials produced, the master lot or reference lot calibrator is used in conjunction with the reference lot of Diazyme reagents to test and verify calibrator value.

# Controls

Using in-house reagents and calibrator, control materials were assigned values as follows. The control materials were assayed as samples three times in triplicate on the Hitachi 7171 analyzer with a single lot of released reagents and calibrator. Fer each control level, mean values were calculated from the data points and assigned as the target value.

Stability for both calibrators and controls is based on real time stability studies.

# d. Detection limit:

The LOB, LOD, and LOQ of Diazyme LP(a) Assay was determined according to CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of

Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline on the Hitachi 717. LOB was determined using a BSA solution in phosphate buffered saline and tested twenty times each day for three days. The LOD was determined using low samples tested in replicates of four each day for three days. LOQ was determined using 6 samples ranging from 0.42 to $1 7 . 3 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and using a fitted curve to determine the value at $20 \%$ CV. The results obtained are as follows:

The Limit of Blank (LOB) for Lp(a) assay is $0 . 6 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • The Limit of detection (LOD) for Lp(a) assay is $1 . 1 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ The Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) for Lp(a) assay is $5 . 4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

Two levels of Lp(a) 16 and $4 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested for interference from hemoglobin to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Bilirubin to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , conjugated Bilirubin to 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , triglyceride to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Ascorbic Acid to $1 0 \mathrm { m M }$ with no interference based $0 \mathrm { { n } \pm 1 0 \% }$ deviation from expected result.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

To demonstrate method comparison, the Diazyme LP(a) Assay was tested with individual serum samples and with the Denka Lp(a)-Latex Seiken Assay and calibrator (k013359).

A total of 76 serum samples were used for the comparison experiment. To ensure the concentrations of LP(a) distributed across the reportable dynamic range, some serum samples were spiked with stock solution of LP(a) or diluted with saline to targeted concentrations.

LP(a) concentrations obtained with Diazyme LP(a) Enzymatic Assay are plotted against that obtained with Denka Seiken Lp(a) Reagent kit (Predicate) on HITACHI 717.

Conclusion: For the 76 serum samples with Lp(a) ranging from $5 . 2 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $9 4 . 8 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.9983, slope was 0.9895, and y intercept was 0.0279.

b. Matrix comparison:

Lp(a) levels of 20 sample pairs covering the assay range using EDTA plasma   
to serum yielded the following data analysis:   
$\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 4 \dot { 4 } \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 4 0 7 \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 \dot { 8 } 0 3$
