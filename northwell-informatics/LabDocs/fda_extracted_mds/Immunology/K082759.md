Special condition for use statement

The device is for prescription use only.

Special instrument requirements

ImmunoCAP $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 100/ImmunoCAP $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 250 are fully automated immunoassay analyzers, which include software for evaluation of test results.

# General Description of the New Devices

The new devices belong to a fully integrated and automated system for immunodiagnostic testing. It comprises a Fluorescence-Immunoassay test system using EliA single wells as the solid phase and is intended to be performed on the instruments ImmunoCAP 100 and ImmunoCAP 250. The conjugate for the EliA IgG method is mouse anti-human IgG beta-galactosidase, which uses 4-Methylumbelliferyl-BDGalactoside as substrate. The total IgG calibration is based on a set of six WHOstandardized IgG Calibrators derived from human serum. They are used to establish an initial calibration curve, which may be used for up to 28 days on additional assays and can be stored by the instrument. Each additional assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to recover in defined ranges to ensure that the stored calibration curve is still valid. The Fluorescence-Immunoassay test system includes test-, method specific and general reagents that are packaged as separate units.

# Test Principle of the New Devices

The EliA Wells are coated with the following antigens:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Test</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Antigen coated to the wells:</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EliA CENP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>human recombinant centromere protein B</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EliA UIRNP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>human recombinant RNP (RNP 70 kDa, A, C) protcin</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EliA Sm</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>native Sm proteins purified from bovine tissue</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EliA Ro</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>human recombinant SS-A/Ro (60 kDa, 52 kDa) protcin</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EliA La</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>human recombinant SS-B/La protein</td></tr></table>

If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to the antigens mentioned above bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific $\mathfrak { l g } \mathbb { G }$ is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# Device Comparison

The new and the predicate devices both represent non-competitive solid phase ELISAs. Both IVDs are used as an aid in the diagnosis of the following diseases:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Disease</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Detection of antibodies to</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>scleroderma (CREST Syndrome)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CENP</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>UIRNP</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sm, U1RNP, Ro, La</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ro, La</td></tr></table>

# Laboratory equivalence

The comparability of predicate device and new device is supported by a data set including

results obtained within a comparison study between new and predicate devices   
results obtained for clinically defined sera   
results obtained for samples from apparently healthy subjects (normal population).

In summary, all available data support that the new devices are substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Mann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 1, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be dvisd that FDA's issuanc substantial equivalence determinaion does ot mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with a e Act' equements, including, but notimit t: registratin nd listing (21CFR Part 07;

labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The.FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at 240-276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474.
