Integrated system for the qualitative detection of IgA and IgM Rheumatoid Factors and IgG antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides in serum samples

# Classification:

Class II

21 CFR 866.5775- Rheumatoid Factor Immunological System

21 CFR 862.2570- Instrumentation for Clinical Multiplex Test

# 807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate device

The test system is substantially equivalent to other ELISA test kits and microarray systems, specifically the Quanta LITETM line of reagents (Inova Diagnostics, Inc., San Diego, CA), namely Quanta LITETM RF IgA ELISA, Quanta LITETM RF IgM ELISA, and Quanta LITETM CCP3 IgG ELISA, and thc BioplexTM 2200 Multi-Analyte Detection System (the instrument, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA) respectively.

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The device consists of the IgX PLEXTM Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay (RL1 kit) and the SQiDworksTM Diagnostics Platform (the Platform); the Platform incorporates the SQiDworksTM Integrated Software (the Software). The Platform is a multiplex immunoassay instrument that fully automates the process of a specific IgX PLExTM Assay from serum transfer to reporting of all assay markers for each individual patient sample. Once the assay's biochemical reactions have completed, the instrument automatically performs a multi-color fluorescent scan of each well in the microarray, analyzes the data, and generates a report containing qualitative results for all assay markers. The SQiDworks Diagnostics Platform also includes numerous internal quality checks and user safety features with fail-safe and interlock mechanisms.

The instrument integrates an automated pipetting station, a fluorescent scanner, washing and drying stations, and other ancillary hardware components using dedicated instrument control. In addition, the software provides scheduling, self-verification, data acquisition, data managcment, analysis algorithms and reporting software.

Rcsults for each patient sample from the IgX PLEXTM Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay and the SQiDworksTM Diagnostics Platform are obtained simultaneously for cach of the three assay markers: RF IgM, RF IgA and CCP IgG using the results from one well containing one aliquot of the patient's serum. Results are reported independently.

The IgX PLEXTM Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay (RL1) kit consists of two boxes (with different temperature requirements) of components as described below.

# $\mathbf { I g } \mathbf { X }$ PLEX RL1 Microarray Plate

The RL1 microarray plate consists of an array of protein and antibody replicate spots, covalently bound to the surface of coated glass within each well of a standard 96-well assay plate. All wells have the identical configuration of microarray elements, containing:

0 Capture spots for Rheumatoid Factor Fc and CCP. Internal normalization curve and control spots for internal consistency confirmation.

The outer plate holder is labeled with a barcode indicating the assay type and lot number which is read by the platform.

# Reporter Mix

The reporter mix is comprised of diluted fluorescently labeled marker antibodies. There is a marker antibody which is specific to each antibody of interest. In the case of the RLl assay, the labeled markers are anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies (for example mouse $\mathfrak { X }$ -hIgM). Each type of marker antibody is labeled with a dye in a different spectral range.

# Calibrators/Standards

The external calibrators (standards) are eight dilutions of a sample derived from human sera containing an appropriate representation of each of the analytes to be reported. The assay standards (secondary standards) for RF (IgA and IgM) are traceable to the WHO/First British Standard 64/2 (primary standards) and internally calculated in IU/mL. The CCP IgG results are internally calculated in U/mL and are comparable to other assays on the market. The quantitative results are converted to qualitative results (positive and negative), based on assay-specific cutoff values. No. dilutions or reconstitutions are needed.

# Controls

The positive and negative control samples are derivcd from human sera. The platform treats the controls as samples and does not perform any quality assessment based on thc

results. Although expected results for each applicable analyte of each control are provided, each lab is expected to follow their own quality procedures for assessing controls.

# Sample Diluent

The sample diluent is a proprietary buffer mix optimized to the requirements of the platform.

# Wash Buffer Concentrates

Specific buffer compositions for each wash procedure. The concentrate must be diluted prior to use.

# CDROM

One CD is included in each shipment. The contents are a database of lot specific calibration data for each lot in the shipment and the documentation for the user's convenience.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use

The IgX PLEXTM Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay and SQiDworksTM Diagnostics Platform is an in vitro diagnostic test system for the qualitative detection of the IgA and IgM classes of Rheumatoid Factors and the IgG class of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (CCP-proprietary third generation equivalent formulation) in human serum specimens.

The IgX PLEXTM Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay is intended for use in clinical laboratories as an aid in the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings, and requires the SQiDworksTM Diagnostics Platform.

# 807.92 (b)(1) Brief Description of Nonclinical and Clinical Data and (b)(2):

A series of nonclinical (in-house) studies were conducted in support of the performance characteristics for the $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { I g } } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { X } } \mathsf { P } \mathsf { L E } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { X } } ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay and SQiDworksTM Diagnostics Platform. Those characteristics are defined as follows:

Reproducibility ranges were $9 5 . 0 \% 1 0 0 \%$ for RF IgA, $9 6 . 3 \%$ - $100 \%$ for RF IgM and $8 3 . 3 \% - 1 0 \%$ for $\mathrm { C C P \ I g G }$   
• Clinical sensitivity ranged from $7 7 . 7 \%$ (CCP IgG) to $9 3 . 3 \%$ (RF IgM) and clinical specificity ranged from $9 2 . 7 \%$ (RF IgA) to $9 6 . 0 \%$ (CCP IgG). This performance is consistent with literature references. In this study, clinical diagnosis (RA or non-RA, including normals) was used as the reference result.   
• Overall agreement between the analytes in the IgX PLEXTM Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay and established predicate test systems ranged from $8 5 \%$ (RF IgA) to $9 5 \%$ (CCP IgG). None of the analytes in the assay were affected by high levels of the following biological substances: bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglycerides and human IgG.

# 807.92 (b)(3): Conclusions from Nonclinical and Clinical Testing

Nonclinical and clinical testing was performed for the IgX PLExTM Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay and SQiDworksTM Diagnostics Platform. The test system was shown to be safe and effective for its intended use.
