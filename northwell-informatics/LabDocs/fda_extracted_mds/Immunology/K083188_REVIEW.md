The assay contains the following: microplate strips coated with nuclear antigens: dsDNA, U1RNP (RNP70, A, C), Sm, SS-A/Ro (52 kDa, $6 0 \mathrm { k D a }$ ), SS-B/La, Scl-70,

CENP-B and Jo-1, calibrator, negative control, wash buffer concentrate, sample diluent, horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human IgG, 3,3’,5,5 tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate, and $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O 4 }$ stop solution.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Varelisa ReCombi ANA Screen   
2. Predicate K number(s): k050625   
3. Comparison with predicate: The new assay is similar to the predicate assay as follows: same indications for use, specimen type, assay principle, conjugate, and reagents. The new assay differs from the predicate assay by replacing the previous Sm antigen with a synthetic human Sm peptide and the elimination of a pre-washing step.

CLSI H18-A3: Procedures for the Handling and Processing of Blood Specimens; Approved Guideline—Third Edition

L. Test Principle:

The Varelisa ReCombi ANA Screen is an indirect noncompetitive enzyme immunoassay for the qualitative determination of dsDNA, U1RNP (RNP 70, A, C), Sm[D], SS-A/Ro ( $5 2 \mathrm { k D a }$ , $6 0 \mathrm { k D a } )$ , SS-B/La, Scl-70, CENP-B and Jo-1 antibodies in serum and plasma. If antibodies specific for the nuclear antigens are present in a patient sample they bind to these nuclear antigens coated to the assay wells. In the second step an enzyme labeled secondary antibody (conjugate) binds to the antigenantibody complex. The enzyme labeled antigen-antibody complex converts the substrate to form a colored solution. The results are read spectrophotometrically and are interpreted as positive, equivocal, or negative by comparison to a cut-off calibrator.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Three samples (high negative, equivocal and high positive) per parameter were analyzed in 5 runs, with 8 replicates per run. Each sample contained all eight antigens. The runs were carried out by one operator within one day.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The consistency of calibration material is ensured by a testing procedure comparing the new calibrators to corresponding master calibration material demonstrating that the internal target values are met. No international standards have been established for these analytes. The performance of the bulk production of positive and negative control sera is adjusted until the release criteria are met. Values have to be found in accordance to an established acceptance range.

Based on accelerated stability testing, unopened kits were projected to be stable for 12 months when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Sample stability claims are based on the recommendations in CLSI H18-A3.

d. Detection limit:

This study was intended to verify the previously established detection limit (k050625). Sample diluent was measured 90 times per run on two different lots. Analytical sensitivity (detection limit) was calculated as the mean of the optical densities (OD) of the sample diluent plus three times the standard deviations (SD) then converted to a ratio. The analytical sensitivity for the assay was 0.1.

e. Analytical specificity:

Ten CDC ANA human reference sera from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 10 sera of the AMLI Consensus Reference Panel 2002, were diluted and tested twice by two different operators on two different lots of the new device and one lot of the predicate device. Both the new assay and the predicate assay gave a positive result $( > 1 . 4$ mean ratio) for CDC 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 which all contain antigens recognized by the Recombi ANA Screen. All other samples in the CDC panel were negative (CDC 6, 11, and 12). Both the new assay and the predicate assay gave a positive result for AMLI panel members AMLI 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 which contain target antigens recognized by the test. AMLI 1 and 10 were negative as expected.

Endogenous interferences:

The following interfering substances (up to the listed concentration) did not adversely affect the test results (i.e. change the outcome): Bilirubin C (21.6 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ , Bilirubin F $1 9 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Chyle (1590 FTU), Hemoglobin (494 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ , and Rheumatoid Factor $( 5 5 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ).

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

The equivocal range and cut-off of the assay were determined in k05625. The sponsor presented a study of 460 healthy Caucasian blood donors evenly distributed by age and sex that confirmed the established cut-offs.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The performance of the new device was compared to the performance of the old device using 253 samples from patients with known clinical background (50 infectious disease, 50 non-connective tissue disease (CTD), 103 CTD, and

50 Rheumatoid Arthritis) and 92 blood donor samples. Equivocal results were regarded as negative:

b. Matrix comparison:

26 negative samples from healthy donors and 13 samples spiked with different amounts of sera from $\mathrm { { A N A } + }$ donors each available as serum, citrate plasma, EDTA plasma, and heparin plasma were run in duplicate. Performance was acceptable in citrate plasma and EDTA plasma however heparin plasma samples interfered with correct test results. The labeling contains a warning not to use heparin plasma.
