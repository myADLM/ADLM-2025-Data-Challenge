# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys Myoglobin Immunoassay includes two applications of the same reagents, the 18 minute Myoglobin assay and 9 minute Myoglobin STAT assay. The assay is a twostep sandwich immunoassay, using two different monoclonal antibodies directed against human myoglobin with streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision for the Elecsys Myoglobin (18 minute) assay was evaluated on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Expected values for the Elecsys Myoglobin Test System were defined based upon two reference range multicenter studies conducted in 1999. Testing took place in 10 countries using self-reported healthy individuals, blood donors, ambulatory patients and hospital workers. Results were obtained from the Elecsys 1010 and the 2010 immunoassay analyzers using the Myoglobin STAT reagent. This information is transferable between the Elecsys Myoglobin $1 8 \mathrm { m i n }$ . assay and STAT applications. Both the $1 8 \mathrm { m i n }$ and the STAT versions of the product are the exact same formulation. The difference is that one assay utilizes a 9 minute incubation time and the other an 18 minute incubation time. The method comparisons demonstrate acceptable correlation.

Expected values were determined to be:
