# L. Test Principle:

In this assay, patient sera, reference control, positive and normal controls are added to the genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells which express chimeric form of the human TSHR and a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) induced luciferase reporter gene. The cells are seeded and grown for 15-18 hours to a confluent monolayer in a 96-well plate prior to the addition of the samples. CHO cell monolayer is incubated with patient serum for 3 hours to allow the binding of TSI immunoglobulin to the chimeric human TSHR on the cell surface. This binding induces a signaling cascade resulting in increased production of intra-cellular cAMP which induces the production of luciferase. After incubation, the cells are lysed and luciferase levels are measured with a luminometer. A significant increase in luminescence over the Reference Control indicates the presence of TSI antibodies in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Intra-assay Precision: Intra-assay precision was conducted by a single user over a 20 day period, with each sample tested in triplicate. The resulting RLU values were averaged per sample. Each plate of cells analyzed per day contained 16 samples (3 high responding samples, 3 medium responding samples, 3 low responding samples, 3 normal samples, 2 reference controls, 1 positive control and 1 blank replicate). The average variation for each sample was calculated $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ across each plate. The result was summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveControl</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean%SRR</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>525</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>310</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>184</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>62</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>291</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>*</td></tr></table>

Average intra-plate variation was calculated at $4 . 7 \%$ $( \% C V )$ .

Inter-Assay Precision (Intra-Day and Inter-Day):

Inter-Assay Precision was assessed using the same set of samples. Six replicates of each, high positive, medium positive, low positive, normal samples, 2 TSI positive control, and 4 reference control samples were tested per day, respectively. The results were summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample(plate to plate)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveControl</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean (%SRR)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>509</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>313</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>183</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>61</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>302</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>19</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample(day to day)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>120</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>120</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>120</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>120</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean (%SRR)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>446</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>263</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>158</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>52</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>267</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>51</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>34</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>23</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>33</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.3</td></tr></table>

# Site-to-Site Reproducibility:

Site-to-site reproducibility was assessed at 3 trained sites (with 2 technicians at site 3) that performed 2 runs per day with each of four samples in triplicate over an eight day period. Two days were excluded from site 2 due to a technical failure. The total number of replicates for each sample is 180 $( 3 \mathrm { x } 2 \mathrm { x } 8 \mathrm { x } 4 - 3 \mathrm { x } 2 \mathrm { x } 2 \mathrm { x } 1 )$ ). The data was summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=5>ReproducibilityAverage SRR% (%CV)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Specimen</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Site 1</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Site 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Site 3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>T1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>T2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>A</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>270.09%(11.47%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>439.8%(10.51%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>280.10%(13.56%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>289.49%(10.55%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>B</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>293.11%(14.72%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>495.14%(14.59%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>374.26%(14.70%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>345.13%(11.8%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>48.23%(14.94%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>67.89%(14.66%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>44.33%(20.21%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>48.60%(22.46%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>D</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>158.6%10.62%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>198%(10.96%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>143.6%(14.43%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>142.7%(12.12%)</td></tr></table>

The overall percents of coefficient of variation $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ for the four specimens were $2 3 . 7 \%$ , $2 3 . 7 \%$ , $2 4 . 6 \%$ , and $1 7 . 9 \%$ respectively.

An additional smaller study was performed using three samples near the cut off at two sites twice a day for five-days.

Each site’s data were analyzed to determine the Reproducibility and Repeatability of the panel samples. Sample E had a positive ratio (Number Positive/Total Number Tested) of 60/60, Samples $\mathrm { F }$ and G had negative ratios (Number Negative/Total Number Tested) of 60/60. The overall coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ for the three samples was $1 5 . 0 \%$ , $2 0 . 3 \%$ , and $2 0 . 5 \%$ , respectively.

# b. Assay temperature:

The effect of temperature on cell lysis was determined to be critical during the reproducibility study. The assay was tested at different temperature to confirm the effect of the temperature on assay result. No statistical difference was observed when the lysis occurred between $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; however, a decrease of approximately $20 \%$ in $\% { \mathrm { S R R } }$ was observed if the lysis temperature was dropped from $2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $1 9 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The following notation was added to the assay procedure in the package insert: “Note: It is critical to maintain the cell lysis temperature above ${ \bf 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . The test result will be affected if the lysis temperature is dropped to $\mathbf { 1 9 \% }$ or less.”

# c. Cell density:

Cell density was determined to be critical to the assay performance. The impact of cell density was studied on duplicate plates that were seeded with three concentrations of cells, which will reach to $90 \%$ confluent, $100 \%$ confluent and over- $100 \%$ confluent (more densely packed) respectively, after 18 hours of incubation. Each plate was treated with a positive, reference and normal controls as well as with serum containing high, med and low levels of TSI. No difference was found on $\% { \mathrm { S R R } }$ among three plates containing different cell confluent levels when high and med levels of TSI were tested; however, a $1 9 \%$ decrease in $\% { \mathrm { S R R } }$ was observed in wells planted with densely packed cells when serum containing a low level of TSI was tested.

A following warning note was added into the package insert: “Individual wells containing piled or layered cells should be disqualified from use based on over-confluence.”

d. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

f. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Reference Control was the bovine Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (bTSH) standardized against the rhTSH Standard (WHO Standard NIBSC 03/192, Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone, Recombinant, Human, for Bioassay).

Positive control:

Positive control values between lots provided in the kit are different due to differences in each manufactured antibody lot. An extra warning sentence was therefore added to the package insert as following:

“It is good practice to examine the results of the Positive and Normal Controls before examining the test results of the specimens. However different lots might have a different positive control range. Please check the positive control reference range label for the test range before the test. If one or both of the controls fail to perform as expected, review the steps and conditions under which the test was performed to determine the cause(s). Do not report results until controls perform as expected.”

Specimen stability:

Four specimens containing two positive (near the cut-off) and two high positive samples were stored at $2 ^ { \circ } C \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } C$ (up to 72 hours), $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (up to 3 months) and compared to samples stored at $- 8 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . No apparent decrease of the signal was observed.

Freeze and thaw:

Four specimens, one negative and three positives, were tested repeatedly for up to 4 cycles. No statistical difference in the results was shown when a sample was repeatedly frozen and thawed for a maximum of three cycles.

# g. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by 20 blank measurements and the average of the $1 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { { t h } } }$ ranked measurement was $6 2 . 7 5 \%$ . Twenty measurements of a low positive were carried out and the standard deviation was calculated at $1 6 \%$ .

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of $8 9 . 1 4 \% \mathrm { S R R }$ was calculated based on the formula provided in CLSI EP17-A. $[ \mathrm { L o D = L o B + c _ { \beta } S D _ { S } }$ $6 2 . 7 5 ^ { + }$ $1 . 6 4 9 ^ { * } 1 6 )$ ]. The LoD was verified in 25 measurements of a positive specimen diluted to the claimed LoD (5 measurements of 5 positive specimens over 5- days). 24 out of 25 $( 9 6 \% )$ measurements showed $\%$ SRR value higher than

LoB.

# h. Analytical specificity:

# Cross-Reactivity:

Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) share the same $\alpha \cdot$ -chain with TSH. The crossreactivity study was performed by testing different amounts of FSH, LH and hCG in normal human serum and TSI containing sera from confirmed Graves’ Disease (GD) subjects with low positive and high positive $\% { \mathrm { S R R } }$ . No crossreactivity was observed with FSH up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , LH up to $6 2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , and hCG up to $4 0 { , } 6 2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ in the serum. No cross-reactivity was observed in studies of spiked sera with TSH up to $0 . 3 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (the normal physiological range in healthy adults is $0 . 0 0 0 3 - 0 . 0 0 3 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L } )$ .

# Autoimmume Specimen Cross-Reactivity:

Serum from patients with auto-antibodies associated diseases [10 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), 10 patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and 16 patients with Hashimoto's' thyroiditis $\left( \mathrm { H m } \right) ]$ were tested and found to have no increased cAMP induced luciferase in the TSI Reporter Assay except one Hm sample. This sample which had a $\mathrm { S R R \% }$ of $1 5 0 \%$ , was found to have a TSH level at or above $- 0 . 3 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . A statement that any specimens with TSH levels above this range need to be disqualified for use is included in the Package Insert.

# Interference:

Normal sera and TSI positive sera (one in high positive and one in low positive) were tested in the presence of different amounts of hemoglobin, bilirubin and lipemic samples. No interference was seen in samples spiked with hemoglobin up to $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , bilirubin levels up to $3 6 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , or lipemic levels up to $1 1 6 8 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ .

# i. Assay cut-off:

The assay cut-off was established using 74 samples from 30 patients with diagnosed GD and 44 normal patients with no known or clinically diagnosed thyroid disease. The $\% { \mathrm { S R R } }$ is calculated by the ratio of RLU (Relative Light Unit) from sample to RLU from reference control. The $\mathrm { S R R \% }$ data obtained for each of these subjects were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The cutoff was verified in pre-clinical testing with an additional $5 0 \mathrm { G D }$ positive sera from non-treated patients and 140 normal sera. The patient serum is considered positive for the presence of TSI if the $\mathrm { S R R \% }$ measured $\ge 1 4 0 \%$ over the Reference Control.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

An initial study was performed at two testing sites with a total of 312 specimens to be evaluated by both the subject and predicate devices. One specimen was excluded due to insufficient quantity for testing. Twelve of these specimens were excluded from statistical analysis due to indeterminate results on the predicate device. The remaining 299 specimens were analyzed for positive and negative percent agreement.

The predicate device detects autoantibodies to the TSHR, of which there are two classes, stimulating (TSI-hyperthyroidism) and blocking (TBIhypothyroidism). The predicate device is unable to distinguish between the two antibody types, whereas the TSI Reporter is specific for the TSI class. The patient populations tested in site 1 and 2 are different from site 3. Site 3 is a reference laboratory that receives specimens from all medical disciplines. The difference in patient populations tested at sites 1 and 2 vs. site 3 accounts for the decreased positive percent agreement value that is caused by the specificity difference between TSI Reporter and the predicate device at site 3.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable. Serum is the only matrix.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity: Sera from 50 Graves disease patients and 199 normal subjects were tested for assay sensitivity and specificity. The result is summarized in the following table:

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A total of 140 normal samples with 72 female subjects and 68 male subjects were tested to determine the reference range of $\mathrm { S R R \% }$ . The average $\mathrm { S R R \% }$ for the female population is $34 \%$ (ranged from $9 \%$ to $1 1 6 \%$ ) and the average $\mathrm { S R R \% }$ for the male population is $3 7 \%$ (ranged from $5 \%$ to $1 1 6 \%$ ). There are no apparent differences in the reference ranges for male and female populations. Expected value in normal population is negative.

# N. Proposed Labeling:
