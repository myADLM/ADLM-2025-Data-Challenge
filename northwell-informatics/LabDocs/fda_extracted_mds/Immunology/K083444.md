# Submission Purpose

Roche Diagnostics hereby submits this Special $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ : Device Modification to provide notification of modifications to our TinaQuant C-Reactive Protein Gen 3 assay. This assay was most recently cleared for use in K032336 on the Roche/Hitachi Clinical Chemistry analyzers.

Since the K032336 filing, modifications to the CRPL3 assay on the Roche/Hitachi clinical chemistry analyzers include:

The Interference section of the insert was modified regarding potential HAMA interference. The lower detection limit was added to the measuring range section in the package insert according to the product specification of ${ < } 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . √ Modification to the insert to clarify when calibration is required.

Modifications prompting this filing include:

o The reagent composition for R2 was modified. LOB and LOD values were determined and reported in the insert.   
$\bullet$ The functional sensitivity was modified. The measuring range for the Roche/Hitachi clinical chemistry analyzers was harmonized to $0 . 3 { - } 3 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ The Interference with Hemolysis and Lipemia were modified. Only standard anticoagulants were tested and claimed; Naheparin and ${ \bf N a } _ { 2 }$ EDTA were not mentioned in the insert.

# Submission History

The Tina-Quant C-Reactive Protein assay was originally cleared in K003400. In K032336, the following device modifications were cleared:

Broadening the measuring range of the assay Increasing the R1 buffer concentration Deleting citrated plasma and adding $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA as acceptable specimen types Changing the name of the assay to TQ CRP (latex)

Roche Diagnostics Corp. c/o Ms. Kathie J. Goodwin Regulatory Affairs Consultant 9115 Hague Rd., P.O. Box 50416 Indianapolis, Indiana 46250-0416

Re: k083444 Trade/Device Name: Tina-Quant C-Reactive Protein (Latex) Gen. 3 Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.5270 Regulation Name: C- reactive protein immunological test system Regulatory Class: II Product Code: DCN Dated: January 26, 2009 Received: February 2, 2009

Dear Ms. Goodwin:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. However, you are responsible to determine that the medical devices you use as components in the [kit/tray] have either been determined as substantially equivalent under the premarket notification process (Section 510(k) of the act), or were legally on the market prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. Please note: If you purchase your device components in bulk (i.e., unfinished) and further process (e.g., sterilize) you must submit a new 510(k) before including these components in your kit/tray. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, and labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on the labeling regulation, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at 240- 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For question regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical Device Reporting (MDR), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at 240-276-3464. You many obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufactuers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
