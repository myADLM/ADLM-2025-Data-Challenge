The C-Reactive Protein Gen 3 assay is a particle enhance turbidimetric assay consisting of two working reagents. Reagent 1 (R1) is a TRIS buffer with BSA and preservatives and Reagent 2 (R2) consists of Latex particles coated with mouse anti-CRP in glycine buffer, mouse immunoglobulins, and preservative. Human CRP agglutinates with latex particles coated with monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. The assay is meant to be run on the Roche/Hitachi H902, H912, H917, Mod P, and Mod D family of analyzers. The precipitate is determined turbidimetrically at $5 7 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# L. Test Principle:

Particle enhanced immunoturbidmetric assay. Human CRP agglutinates with latex particles coated with monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. The aggregates are determined turbidmetrically.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Within-run precision of the CRPL3 assay was determined using 2 control samples and 3 human samples, run 21 times on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Day-to-day precision was determined by three determinations of two controls and three human samples in 1 run/day for 21 days. For the day-to-day precision, the second replicate of the 3-fold determination is used.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To determine the linearity of the CRPL3 test system, three clinical samples were diluted with $0 . 9 \%$ saline in order to cover the measuring range of the assay and were tested on the Hitachi 917. The samples covered theoretical values from 0.13-5.03 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ , $0 . 4 2 { - } 2 0 . 5 9 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ , and $3 . 2 4 { - } 4 2 9 . 3 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and the percent recovery was determined for each region of the measuring range by comparing the measured value of CRP to the theoretical value and shown below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Region (mg/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Percent Recovery (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>97.3 - 100.56</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5 - 350</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>98.5-101.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt; 350</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>88.7 - 105.45</td></tr></table>

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: This method is standardized against an internal method traceable to CRM 470 (RPPHS- Reference Preparation for Proteins in Human Serum).

Stability (real-time studies): The unopened kit components are stable up to 12 months stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Both reagents are stable opened and refrigerated on the analyzer for 84 days.

d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LOB) was evaluated on the Hitachi 917 analyzer using 5 replicates of one analyte free sample, run 6 times over $\geq 3$ days on 2 instruments. LoB was determined to be $\leq 0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ by calculating the mean value $\pm 3$ SD.

The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of blank (LOB) were according to CLSI EP 17-A guidelines. The LOD was calculated using the standard deviation of 5 samples with low analyte content measured once per run on two instruments and corresponds to the sample concentration which leads with a probability of $9 5 \%$ to a measurement result above the limit of blank. The LOD was calculated to be $< 0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ from 5 replicates of analyte-free sample on two instruments, with six runs distributed over 3 days.

The functional sensitivity (Limit of Quantitation) for the CRPL3 test system was measured using five low concentration CRP samples in one run/day over 10 days on two analyzers and determined to be $0 . 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

The effect of endogenous interferences was examined by measuring analyte recovery in the presence of hemoglobin, bilirubin, and lipids. No significant interference with CRP measurement was determined with icterus (up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ), hemoglobin (up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), lipids (up to L index of 1000), rheumatoid factor (up to $1 2 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ ), and no high dose hook effect seen with CRP concentrations up to $1 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . $f .$ Assay cut-off: Not applicable
