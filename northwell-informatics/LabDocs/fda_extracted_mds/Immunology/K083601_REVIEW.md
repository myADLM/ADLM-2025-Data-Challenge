L. Test Principle:

When a sample is added to the cuvette, the antiserum against human Immunoglobulin Lambda light chains will form a complex with its corresponding antigen in the sample under optimal pH conditions and in the presence of PEG. These complexes scatter a beam of light passing through the sample. The intensity of the light that passed through the complex can be captured and measured by the instrument. The intensity of the light passed through the complex is proportional to the concentration of the respective antigen (free and bound Lambda light chains) in the sample. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed to generate a calibration curve which is used to determine the unknown concentration of the sample. The memory can be stored in the machine and used for the calculation of the unknown samples in the future runs.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Within run precision: Within run precision was determined by running four serum controls at different detection levels and one human sera pool once a day for 20 days. Level 1 represented the low to mid detection range $( 2 5 \% - 3 0 \% )$ , Level 2 represented the low detection range $( < 2 0 \% )$ , Level 4 represented the mid level of detection range $( \sim 5 0 \% )$ , and level 3 represented the high detection range $( > 8 0 \% )$ . The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ from all 5 serum controls tested was less than $5 \%$ .

# Total Precision (Run- to-Run and day-to-day):

Total precision was determined by running two levels of serum control materials twice a day for 20 days with each sample ran in duplicate $( 2 0 X 2 X$ 2). Level 1 represented the low detection range, level 2 represented the mid detection range. Three additional human sera pools that span the region of $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were added later. The result was summarized in the following table. The $C V \%$ of each test level was $\leq 5 \%$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

# Linearity:

Linearity was assessed using two different pools of human sera to cover all measuring range. Pool 1 was used to determine the linearity of the assay over “Whole Analytical Measurement Range (Whole AMR),” and Pool 2 was used to determine the linearity of the assay over “Low Analytical Measurement Range (AMR).” Pool 1 was created by spiking concentrated Lambda light chains into a human pool serum, followed by serially diluting the spiked sample with saline to obtain 10 samples with concentrations of Lambda light chains from $4 2 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } - 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Pool 2 was created by serially diluting a human pooled serum sample to create 10 samples with concentrations ranging from $5 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } - 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was run in triplet in both AMR test and Whole AMR tests. The measured value from each sample was plotted against the theoretical value. The data is summarized in the following table:

ORDAC range (Over Range Detection and Correction):   

<table><tr><td>Range</td><td>Test Range (mg/dL)</td><td>Slope (95% CI)</td><td>Y-intercept (95% CI)</td><td>R^{2}$</td><td>Relative Bias range</td><td>% CV range</td></tr><tr><td>Low AMR</td><td>1.8 - 54.3</td><td>1.05 (0.97 to 1.12)</td><td>-3.82 (-6.15 to -1.49)</td><td>0.9916</td><td>-67.5% to 0%</td><td>0.3% to 2.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Whole AMR</td><td>37.8 - 424.1</td><td>1.01 (0.98 to 1.04)</td><td>-5.74 (-12.57 to 1.08)</td><td>0.9987</td><td>-11.2% to 2%</td><td>1.0% to 5.8%</td></tr></table>

For a sample that is out of the linear range but between 400 to $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the machine will follow the automated protocol ORDAC to achieve an acceptable degree of accuracy. To verify the accuracy of the ORDAC protocol that is performed automatically by the machine, a set of 25 samples, equally distributed within the range of 300 to $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were run in duplicate on Synchron $\operatorname { L x } 2 0$ according to the ORDAC parameters setting. The results were compared with manually pre-diluted saline. Data was evaluated by plotting the result from automatically run with ORDAC protocol against the result from manually pre-diluted protocol. The data was summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td>Test Range (mg/dL)</td><td>Slope (95% CI)</td><td>Y-intercept (95% CI)</td><td>R^{2}$</td><td>Average Bias (95% CI)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">285 to 1055</td><td>1.017</td><td>-12.88</td><td rowspan="2">0.998</td><td>-4.72</td></tr><tr><td>(0.987 to 1.047)</td><td>(-28.69 to 2.92)</td><td>(-10.74 to 1.30)</td></tr></table>

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Calibrator: SENTINEL Plasmaproteins Cal 3X, previously cleared in k081533 is traceable to ERM-DA 470 (European Reference Material) from BCR (EG Community Bureau of Reference), corresponding to RPPHS(Reference Preparation for Protein in Human Serum).

# On-board Stability test:

Three levels of serum controls containing Lambda light chains $( 6 2 . 9 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 4 5 . 9 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $2 2 6 . 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were tested on Synchron LX 20 System with opened on-board reagents up to 29 days. Percent recovery for each control level was tested within $9 0 \% - 1 1 0 \%$ thought out the 29 days period.

# Unopened Reagent Stability test:

Three different lots of unopened Reagent 1 and three different lots of unopened Reagent 2 were tested at different time frame up to 25 months. The calibrator is used as sample to be tested for the same time frame as the reagent. Percent recovery ranged from $8 5 \% - 1 1 5 \%$ for Reagent 1 and 2, $9 5 \% - 1 0 5 \%$ for calibrator. The shelf life for both reagents were claimed to be stable up to 24 months when stored at $2 ^ { \circ } C - 4 ^ { \circ } C$ .

# d. Detection limit:

# Limit of Blank:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by 20 blank measurements of saline in three different runs (total $2 0 \mathrm { ~ X ~ } 3$ ). The LoB was calculated to be $0 . 5 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ based on formula of Mean $+ \ : 1 . 6 5 \ : \mathrm { x }$ SD.

# Limit of Detection:

To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), a human sera pool was diluted with saline to obtain a concentration higher than the LoB $\mathrm { 0 . 5 5 m g / d L } )$ . The diluted pool was measured in three different runs with 20 replicates each on Synchron LX20 System. If the result of Mean – 3 SD from all three runs is below the measuring range yet greater than LoB, then the concentration of the diluted pool is considered to be the LoD.

The LoD of this assay is $5 . 7 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# Limit of Quantification:

A pool of human sera with a concentration around $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was serially diluted with saline to obtain a set of samples with decreased concentrations of human Lambda light chains. Each sample was tested on Synchron LX20 system with 10 replicates. The LoQ is defined by $\% \mathrm { C V }$ being $\leq 1 0 \%$ and the $\%$ relative bias, which is defined as the absolute bias (theoretical value – observed value) divided by theoretical value, being $\leq 2 0 \%$ . The Limit of Quantification is $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference on Endogenous compounds in serum:

For the interference study on bilirubin, hemoglobin and triglycerides, human serum samples were spiked with various concentrations of interferents. A minimum of three replicates of each interference level were run. Absolute bias at each concentration level was determined against concentration of nonspiked pool. For the determination of potential interference by Rheumatoid Factor (RF), a human serum with a RF concentration of about $1 0 1 2 \mathrm { U / m L }$ was diluted with a human serum without RF. Absolute bias for RF interference was determined against theoretical values which were calculated based on the dilution ratio.
