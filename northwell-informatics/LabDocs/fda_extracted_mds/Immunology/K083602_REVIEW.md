# L. Test Principle:

When a sample is added to the cuvette, the antiserum against human Immunoglobulin Kappa light chains will form a complex with its corresponding antigen in the sample under optimal pH conditions and in the presence of PEG. These complexes scatter a beam of light passing through the sample. The intensity of the light that passed through the complex can be captured and measured by the instrument. The intensity of the light passed through the complex is proportional to the concentration of the respective antigen (free and bound Kappa light chains) in the sample. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed to generate a calibration curve which is used to determine the unknown concentration of the sample. The memory can be stored in the machine and used for the calculation of the unknown samples in the future runs.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Testing was performed according to CLSI EP5-A Within run precision: Within run precision was determined on four levels of serum control materials and on one human serum pool in 20 replicates one run per day.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was assessed using two different pools of human sera: Pool 1 was used to determine the linearity of the assay over the “Whole Analytical Measurement Range (Whole AMR)” and Pool 2 was used to determine the linearity over the “Low Analytical Measurement Range (Low AMR)”. Pool 1 was created by spiking concentrated Kappa light chains into a human pool serum, followed by serially diluting the spiked sample with saline to obtain at least 10 samples with concentrations of Kappa light chains of $0 \mathrm { m g / d L } - 7 5 0$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Pool 2 was created by serially diluting a human pooled serum sample to create at least 10 samples with concentrations ranging from $0 \mathrm { m g / d L } - 7 7$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each diluted sample was run in triplicate in both Whole AMR and Low AMR tests. Data were analyzed in accordance with CLSI EP6-A. The measured value from each sample was plotted against the theoretical value. The data is summarized in the following table:

# ORDAC (Over Range Detection and Correction):

For samples that are out of the linear range but between 600 to $1 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , the instrument will automatically dilute the sample following the automated protocol ORDAC. Study was done to verify that serum samples diluted by the automated protocol ORDAC, achieve an acceptable degree of accuracy as determined by comparison with manually diluted samples. The ORDAC function was verified by using a panel of 25 samples, equally distributed within the range of 591 to $1 8 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples were run in duplicate on Synchron LX20 according to the ORDAC parameters setting. The results were compared with paired aliquots of each sample that was manually prediluted. Data generated met the Preapproved Acceptance Criteria of slope 0.95 to 1.05; $\mathrm { R } { \geq } 0 . 9 7 5$ and demonstrated the accuracy of the assay within the range of $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $1 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The following table summarizes the results:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Test Range(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y-intercept (mg/dL)(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>r</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average Bias(95% CI)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>591 to 1825</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.963(0.925 to 1.002)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>48.29(10.39 to 86.19)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14.36(1.24 to 27.48)</td></tr></table>

Prozone effect – samples from 1250 up to $1 0 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / d L } }$ will be reported as $> 7 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): SENTINEL Plasmaproteins Cal 3X, previously cleared in k081533 is traceable to ERM-DA 470 (European Reference Material) from BCR (EG Community Bureau of Reference), corresponding to RPPHS (Reference Preparation for Protein in Human Serum).

# On board stability

Three levels of serum controls containing Kappa light chains ( $1 1 7 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $2 6 6 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $4 3 5 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were tested on Synchron LX 20 System with opened on-board reagents over 29 days. Percent recovery for each control level against measurement at time zero was $9 8 . 5 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 9 \%$ . The claimed On Board Stability will be 28 days.

# On board calibration stability

The study for on-board stability described above was used to determine calibration stability of the Kappa light chains assay reagents on the Synchron LX20 System. For the study, a calibration with fresh reagents was performed at Day 0 and was used throughout. The acceptance criteria of percent recovery against measurement at Day 0 ( $90 \%$ to $1 1 0 \%$ ) were met through the Study from Day 0 to Day 29. The claimed on Board Calibration Stability will be 14 days.

# Unopened Reagent Stability Test:

A Real Time Study was carried out on three different lots of Kappa light chains assay for up to 38 months. Reagents were stored at $^ { + 2 }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ throughout the duration of the study. Accuracy was tested on two levels of serum control material. During the analysis, a fresh material was used to calibrate the tests. Three replicates were tested for each level. Percent recovery ranged from $9 8 . 4 \% - 1 0 4 . 0 \%$ for calibrator and $9 8 . 2 \% - 1 1 0 . 6 \%$ for controls. The shelf life of the Kappa Light chains assay was claimed to be stable up to 24 months when stored at $2 ^ { \circ } C - 8 ^ { \circ } C$ .

d. Detection limit:

Analytical sensitivity studies were conducted following the preapproved internal protocol and acceptance criteria according to CLSI document EP 17- A.

# Limit of Blank:

The limit of Blank (LOB) was determined by 20 blank measurements of saline in three different runs (total 20 X 3). The LOB is based on formula of ( $\mathrm { M e a n } { + } 1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { S D }$ ) and was calculated to be $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Limit of Detection:

To determine the Limit of Detection (LOD), a human serum pool was diluted with saline to obtain a concentration higher than the LOB $( 0 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d / L } )$ . The diluted pool was measured on three different runs with 20 replicates each, on Synchron LX20 System. LOD was defined as the concentration at which (Mean–3SD) is below the measuring range yet greater than LOB.

The LOD of this assay is $6 . 1 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# Limit of Quantitation (LOQ):

A pool of human sera with a concentration around $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was serially diluted with saline to obtain a set of samples with decreased concentrations of human Kappa light chains. Each sample was tested on Synchron LX20

System with 10 replicates. LOQ is defined by the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ being $\leq 1 0 \%$ and the percent bias must be $\leq 2 0 \%$ .

$\%$ Bias was defined as: (Theoretical value – Found value)/ (Theoretical value) $^ { * } 1 0 0$ .

The LOQ of this assay is $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous compounds in serum:

Interference study was done to evaluate interference caused by bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), hemoglobin, lipids (triglycerides), and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) in the Kappa light chains assay on the Synchron LX20 System. Human serum samples were spiked with various concentrations of the interferents. A minimum of three replicates of each interferent level were run. Absolute bias at each concentration level was determined against concentration of unspiked pool. For the determination of potential interference by RF, a human serum with a concentration of RF of about $1 0 1 2 \mathrm { U / m L }$ was diluted with a human serum without RF. Absolute bias at each concentration level was determined against theoretical values. The table below shows that the data generated met the acceptance criteria:

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

To demonstrate that the Kappa light chains assay can be used in both human serum and Li-heparin plasma, blood from 77 volunteers was collected in Liheparin plasma and serum tubes. The result from Li-heparin specimens were plotted against the results from serum specimens. The slope of the linear regression fell into the acceptance range of 0.95 – 1.05, and the $\mathrm { R \ge 0 . 9 8 }$ .

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: See expected values

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Normal reference range was established by testing 100 female and 102 male voluntary healthy donors, 20 – 69 years old. Reference range was calculated at $9 5 \%$ of the samples distribution. The Kappa light chains were found to range from $1 2 2 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } - 4 3 7 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ among the tested healthy donors.

N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
