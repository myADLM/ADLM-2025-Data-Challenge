# L. Test Principle:

The xTAG® CFTR 60 Kit v2 incorporates multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and multiplex Allele Specific Primer Extension (ASPE) with Luminex’s proprietary Universal Tag sorting system on the Luminex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 100 or 200 xMAP™ platform. First, a multiplex PCR reaction produces amplimer sizes ranging from 179 to 465 base pairs. The sample then undergoes a multiplex allele specific primer

extension (ASPE) reaction where 2 aliquots of the PCR product are run through 2 parallel ASPE reactions (“A and B reactions”). Panel A (ASPE and bead mix) is identical to that in the $\mathbf { x } \mathrm { T A G } ^ { \circledast }$ CF39 Kit v2 product (k083846). Analysis using the xTAG® CFTR 60 Kit v2 requires that each sample be tested with both the ‘A’ and $ { ^ \circ } _ { \mathrm { B } }  { ^ \prime }$ portions of the Kit.

The ASPE step allows for detection of each allele (wild-type or mutant) of a given locus using an allelespecific probe (ASP) which contains a unique DNA sequence (tag) at its $5 ^ { \circ }$ end. Each bi-allelic locus has two ASPs and each tri-allelic loci has 3 ASPs included in the ASPE Mix. For each ASP, the $3 ^ { \circ }$ end of the primer is a perfect match for its allele, but will have a $3 ^ { \circ }$ mismatch on any other allele. The only exception is the CFTR dele 2,3 which has two ASPs to detect the presence of the deletion due to the presence of an underlying polymorphism. Both these ASPs however are tagged with a common tag at their $5 ^ { \circ }$ end. The DNA polymerase will only extend the primer when there is a perfect match on the $3 ^ { \circ }$ end such that the primer is only extended if its target allele is present in the sample. Biotin-dCTP is incorporated into the extending chain if extension occurs.

For the hybridization reaction, the 2 ASPE reaction products are added directly to microwells containing aliquots of the Bead Mix (A and B) which contains bead-immobilized anti-tags which are the perfect complement to the tag sequences associated with the ASPs in the respective ASPE reaction. Each coupled bead is spectrally distinguishable from the other coupled beads in a given bead mix. A fluorescent reporter molecule (streptavidin-phycoerythrin) is bound to the biotin on the extended primers. Each tagged primer hybridizes only to its unique anti-tag complement; therefore, each colored bead represents a specific allele, through the bead/anti-tag/tagged primer association. The beads are then analyzed by the Luminex instrument. The Luminex instrument contains two lasers: one identifies the color-coded bead, and the other identifies the presence or absence of extended allele specific primer through the phycoerythrin reporter. Thus, the genotype of that locus is identified by the presence of phycoerythrin signal attached to one or both ASPs.

For each sample analyzed by the CFTR 60 kit v2, two output files containing MFI signals from the Luminex instrument are generated (one output file for the “A” reaction and one for the “B” reaction). The proprietary software component of this product analyzes these two output data files, matches the information from the two templates based on the Sample IDs, and combines all the information to provide a final qualitative genotype for the sample. The genotypes identified can be found in the tables shown above in the section titled Device Description. TDAS CFTR enables the end-user to select between 2 options for the final result displayed for a given sample: Option 1: Full Panel (60 mutations/deletions $^ { + 4 }$ variants), or Option 2: ACMG/ACOG panel (23 mutations and deletions). When Option 2 is chosen, results for the remaining mutations and variants in the full panel are not available to the user.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: A multi-site, multi-operator, multi-lot, blinded study design was used to evaluate total variability of the $\mathbf { x T A G } ^ { \mathbb { ( B ) } }$ Cystic Fibrosis $6 0 \mathrm { k i t } \mathrm { v } 2$ . There were 2 operators per site, each performing 1 run per day across 3 non-consecutive days (3 runs per operator or 6 runs per site). Within a given run, each assay point was run in duplicate. A total of three (3) assay lots were tested (1 lot at each site). The reproducibility sample set consisted of genomic DNAs that were purified from 41 clinical samples, 7 Coriell lymphoid cell lines, and 15 plasmids. Compound heterozygous and homozygous samples were represented. A summary of results of the reproducibility study and $\%$ agreement between sites by sample and by allele are shown in the two tables below.

Samples that list one allele are heterozygous. Samples 49 through 63 were plasmids.

Samples $\# 4 3$ and $\# 4 8$ (Coriell genomic DNA) made a ‘No Call’ after an allowable rerun at Site 3 (operator 1) whereas sample $\# 5 7$ (plasmid) made 3 miscalls at Site 1 between 2 operators.

Reproducibility of detection of a compound heterozygote dF508 / F508C was also characterized in this study. Of the 36 replicates of sample $\# 3 2$ tested, 30 generated a dF508 HET call and 6 generated a $\mathrm { d F } 5 0 8 \mathrm { M u }$ D call. Both results are accurate when taking into consideration the definition of a Mu D call (i.e. only the mutant allele is detected).

\*plasmids \*\*plasmids in addition to Coriell samples and clinical samples

Extraction study: To evaluate the effect of the extraction step on sample reproducibility, the pre-analytical (sample extraction) step was evaluated at a single site, using 18 unique clinical (whole blood) samples representing wild-type and 3 mutant genotypes (ΔF508, N1303K, V520F). Three different extraction methods were tested using the same assay lot by 2 operators, across 9 non-consecutive days. Each operator performed 3 runs per extraction method, and each assay point was run in duplicate. The total number of replicates per sample was 36: (3 extraction methods) x (2 operators / extraction method) x (3 runs / operator) x (2 replicate $/ \mathrm { r u n } ) = 3 6$ replicates. All assays passed, with no miscalls. The xTAG CFTR v2 assays demonstrated a reproducibility of $100 \%$ across the 3 extraction methods evaluated.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability: The stability performance of the $\mathbf { x T A G } ^ { \mathbb { \left( B \right) } }$ Cystic Fibrosis 60 Kit v2 was evaluated using at least three kit lots. The stability protocol includes testing under realtime and accelerated conditions. Real-time data is based on kit components stored at the recommended temperature. Accelerated data is based on stressed conditions where components are stored at elevated temperatures. The baseline shelf-life takes into consideration both empirical data collected on related kits, including the $\mathbf { x T A G } ^ { \mathbb { ( B ) } }$ Cystic Fibrosis 60 Kit v2 and the products cleared under k043011 and k060627, and available real-time and accelerated data generated through testing the $\mathbf { x T A G } ^ { \mathbb { ( B ) } }$ Cystic Fibrosis 60 Kit v2. The current claimed shelf-life for the $\mathbf { \bar { x } } \mathbf { T } \mathbf { A } \mathbf { G } ^ { \textsuperscript { \textregistered } }$ Cystic Fibrosis 60 Kit v2 is 12 months, which is supported by historical and accelerated data.

d. Detection limit:

The usable range of the xTAG® CFTR 60 Kit v2 assay was determined by testing serial dilutions of genomic DNA samples prepared from Coriell lymphoid cell lines. Ten samples covering 11 mutations were chosen to represent frequently occurring cystic fibrosis mutations in the pan-ethnic CF population, or because they may present unusual, potentially problematic conditions, such as relatively high or low MFI values, high cross-over signals, large amplicons, etc. Both heterozygous and homozygous samples were evaluated. Each of several genomic DNA samples were assayed in duplicate at 9 concentrations (300, 150, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, 0.78 and 0.39 $\mathrm { n g / \mu L } )$ . Genomic DNA, extracted from whole blood, was used as a wild-type positive control in all runs. At each tested concentration, the data across all samples were pooled. The lowest concentration giving an apparent assay failure rate of ${ \leq } 5 \%$ was considered an estimator of the LoD. The proposed assay lower bound (LB) was set at a concentration $( \mathrm { C ^ { * } } )$ lying at or slightly above the estimated LoD. At concentration $\mathrm { C ^ { * } }$ , 22 replicates of each of the 10 genomic DNAs were run along with 8 negative controls dispersed uniformly throughout the plate to determine the LoD. The Lower Bound and Upper Bound of the assay range was determined to be $2 { \mathrm { n g / \mu L } }$ and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / \mu L } }$ , respectively. The LoD was determined to be $1 . 5 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / \mu L } }$ . The claimed DNA input range is $2 { - } 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ . The assay was optimized for $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

The effects of the potential interferents hemoglobin $( 1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , bilirubin $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and triglycerides $\mathrm { 3 0 0 m g / d L } )$ on the performance of the xTAG® CFTR $6 0 \mathrm { v } 2$ Kit was examined using 8 whole blood samples. Four (4) samples were wild type and four (4) samples were heterozygous (N1303K Het (1 sample), V520F Het (1 sample), and $\Delta \mathrm { F } 5 0 8 \mathrm { H e t }$ (2 samples)). The sample spiked with interferent was compared to sample without interferent and run in quadruplicate. Of 48 samples (4 mutations x 3 interferents x 4 replicates), 3 samples produced no-calls that required repeating. Upon repeat testing, all alleles were called correctly. The results indicated that none of the substances produced an inhibitory effect on kit performance at the concentrations tested.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison

Accuracy of the xTAG® CFTR 60 v2 Kit was assessed by evaluating samples representing all alleles (mutations and polymorphisms) probed by the assay. A total of 488 mutant alleles were tested using a total of 386 clinical samples comprised of both compound heterozygous and homozygous mutants. The majority of samples consisted of left-over, anonymized, banked whole-blood specimens. These specimens were supplemented with genomic DNAs from EBV-transformed lymphoid cell lines (Total 8), and 2 custom-designed plasmids engineered to contain 1-2 CFTR mutations each. The FDA cleared xTAG Cystic Fibrosis Kit (k043011 and k060627) was used as the comparator for the panel A mutations and dideoxy-sequencing was used for the panel B mutations. Acceptance criteria were provided for the Phred Scores.

b. Matrix comparison:

Studies using both wild-type (10) and mutant samples (8) in EDTA and citrate were conducted to demonstrate that the anticoagulants do not interfere with the assay. The data supports the claimed anticoagulants.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity: The clinical sensitivity and specificity can be estimated based on the published studies of mutation frequencies in various ethnicities and based on the results of analytical studies described in this submission.

Other clinical supportive data:

The following literature was provided for the 21 alleles not previously reviewed and cleared by FDA (all patients had a CF diagnosis). PI refers to Pancreatic insufficient and PS refers to pancreatic sufficiency:
