# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods (EP5-A2).

# L. Test Principle:

The Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AFP method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-AFP monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-AFP monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-AFP-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the

AFP concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: In addition to the original precision results using serum samples, a precision study using a lithium heparinized plasma pool sample was conducted in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2 Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.

To determine the precision at the lower end of the assay range, the sponsor provided data from a 5-day precision study using a lithium heparinized plasma pool sample with $8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ AFP. The results are summarized below.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.   
b. Matrix comparison: Matched serum and lithium (Li) heparinized plasma samples $( \mathrm { N } { = } 7 0 )$ ), were collected from patients and immediately frozen at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . All samples were tested within 60 days from the date of collection. On the date of testing, serum and Li heparinized plasma samples were thawed at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 30 minutes and the AFP values were determined with the Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AFP assay. Samples above the assay range $( 0 . 5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ ) were manually diluted with matched normal human serum and Li heparinized plasma. Samples were run in triplicate. AFP recovery in serum versus Li heparinized plasma was compared by Passing & Bablok regression analysis.

The range of AFP values in the correlation study was 0.9 to $9 9 9 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ [0.7 to $8 2 5 . 6 \mathrm { I U / m L } ]$ .
