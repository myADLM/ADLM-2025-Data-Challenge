# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use: The Piccolo® C-Reactive Protein Test System used with the Piccolo xpress™ Chemistry Analyzer is intended to be used for the in vitro quantitative determination of CRP concentration in lithium heparinized whole blood, lithium heparinized plasma, or serum, in a clinical laboratory setting or point-of-care location. This test is not intended for high sensitivity CRP measurement.

2. Indication(s) for use: C-reactive Protein test results aid in the evaluation of infection, tissue injury, and inflammatory disorders in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.

# I. Device Description:

Each Piccolo MetLyte Plus CRP Reagent Disc contains dry test-specific reagent beads: $6 7 . 2 \mu \mathrm { g }$ Anti-human CRP coated latex ( mouse) and $0 . 3 { \mu } \mathrm { g }$ Anti-human CRP (goat). A dry sample blank reagent (comprised of buffer, surfactants, excipients and preservatives) is included in each disc for use in calculating concentrations of CRP and chemistry analytes. Each disc also contains a diluent consisting of surfactants and preservatives.

The discs are designed to separate a heparinized whole blood sample into plasma and blood cells. The disc meters the required quantity of sample and diluent., then mixes the plasma sample with the diluent and delivers the mixture to the reaction cuvette contained in the disc perimeter. The diluted sample mixes with the reagent beads initiating the chemical reactions that are then monitored by the analyzer. The discs are $8 \mathrm { c m }$ in diameter and are single-use devices. The disc may also be used with serum.

(The Abaxis Piccolo System is an established point of care device since 1994 with eight cleared Chemistry analytes: Blood Urea Nitrogen (k942782); Chloride (k010670); Creatinine Kinase (k992140); Creatinine (k942782); Glucose (k934592); Potassium (k992140); Sodium (k993211); and Total Carbon Dioxide (k992149).

\* Beckman LX 20 has an Overrange Detection and Correction for samples that exceed the 80 $\mathrm { m g / m L }$ limit. This is an automated process within the analyzer that retests with a smaller sample volume.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Standard documents:

CLSI EP 17: Determination of limits of detection and limits of quantitation CLSI EP 18: Quality management for unit-use testing.

L. Test Principle:

The method used by Abaxis is an enhanced latex-agglutination turbidimetric immunoassay. Sample is mixed with a suspension of mouse anti-human CRP monoclonal antibody that is bound to latex. CRP in the sample binds to the antibodylatex particles and agglutinates creating turbidity. Light scattering from the turbidity is used as a measure of CRP. Turbidity is measured as a change in absorbance at 630 nm. This absorbance change is directly proportional to the CRP in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility of the assay was assessed by testing in duplicate two levels of controls, one patient samples close to the $7 . 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ assay cut-off performed in two sites over 20 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ). Additional four samples (two close to assay cut-off, one mid-range and one upper-range) were tested in duplicate at one site for five days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 4 0 )$ ). The intra-assay and inter-assay $\% \mathrm { C V }$ ranges were from $1 . 7 \%$ to $8 . 4 \%$ and $2 . 9 \%$ to $9 . 8 \%$ , respectively (see tables below).

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity across the assay measuring range $( 5 . 0 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ) was confirmed by testing pooled sera with low range concentration of $4 . 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ and pooled sera with high concentrations from $2 0 2 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Nine dilution pools were calculated and prepared with the low and high sample pools using the ${ \bf S } { = } 9$ Dilution Scheme recommended in CLSI EP6-A standard Appendix A. The diluted samples were re-assayed four times on four Piccolo xpress Chemistry Analyzer.

Linearity results were as follows:

Reportable range: $5 . 0 - 2 0 0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: The calibrators are traceable to Beckman’s method calibration to Standard Reference Material BCR 470

Stability: Accelerated stability testing $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ at 0, 14, 21, and 28 days and 0, 3, and 10 days testing intervals respectively. Real time testing at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ were tested at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 ans 21 months. The reagent discs are stored at recommended temperature $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ in their sealed pouches. Expiration date claim is 21 months.

d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB) Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were determined using five pools including the lowest CRP calibrator (human serum spiked with CRP to $4 . 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ), three dilutions of lowest calibrators in saline, and a saline blank. Each pool was assayed twenty times, twice on each of 10 Piccolo xpress Chemistry analyzers.

The LoB is determined either by Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution. If Gaussian, LoB is determined by equation; if non-Gaussian, it is determined as the non-parametric $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile.

The LoD was determined by equation $\mathrm { L o D = L o B + ( C \beta \mathrm { ^ * S D s ) } }$ where $\mathrm { { C } \{ \} = }$ 1.645/(1- $( 1 / ( 4 ^ { * } \mathrm { f } ) )$ , where f is degrees of freedom $\mathrm { ( n { = } l ) }$ ), and SDs is the standard deviation of the observations.

The LoQ was determined as the lowest sample run that displayed $C V { < } 2 0 \%$ and Accuracy vs. expected value of $8 0 - 1 2 0 \%$ (inaccuracy $< 2 0 \%$ ).

The results were as follows: $\mathrm { L o B } = 0 . 3 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / L }$ $\mathrm { L o D = 0 . 9 l \ m g / L }$ $\mathrm { L o Q } = 2 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m g / L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies:

Endogenous substances : Six Human serum pools (28 and $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP) and a control pool were tested with up to $7 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Hemoglobin, $3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Bilirubin and $7 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Triglycerides) in four replicates on each of four Piccolo xpress Chemistry analyzers. Interference were observed at $\leq 1 0 \%$ . The Piccolo xpress Chemistry analyzer will automatically print ‘HEM’, ‘LIP’, or ‘ICT’ if interferents are above the physical interferent values as listed above.

Exogenous substances: Thirty five drugs and other substances were selected as potential interferents with the CRP methods based on recommendations by Young, DS Effects of drugs on laboratory testing $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ Ed. Wash DC AACC Press 1990. Listing of exogenous and other substances and levels tested of CRP for each level with $\pm 1 0 \%$ shift were as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Concentration Which Produces &gt; 10% Interference</td><td>% Interference Observed</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C-Reactive Protein Glutathione</td><td>30</td><td>13% dec.</td></tr><tr><td>Isoniazide</td><td>4</td><td>16% dec.</td></tr><tr><td>L-dopa</td><td>5</td><td>28% dec.</td></tr><tr><td>Oxaloacetate</td><td>132</td><td>57% dec.</td></tr></table>

Rheumatoid factor (RF): Undiluted and Normal serum samples were spiked ${ \sim } 1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP were tested with RF serum (up to $6 4 4 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ). Each sample was run in quadruplicate on four Piccolo analyzers. No interference were obsserved.

HAMA interference: Undiluted and Normal serum samples were spiked 50 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP were tested with a known HAMA serum (up to $1 1 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ from ProMedDx). Each sampole was run in quadruplicate on four Piccolo analyzers. No interference were obsserved.

The Package Insert states “Specimens from patients who have recceived preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain HAMA”.

These interferent listings and results as shown above are listed in the CRP Package Insert.

High dose effect: A commercial CRP calibrator with an assigned value of $1 { , } 0 4 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ was run neat and diluted into a serum pool to obtain CRP at 520 adn $2 6 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Each sample was assyaed four times on four Piccolo analyzers. No high dose effect (prozone effect) was observed.

The extrememly high CRP concentrations up to $1 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ would not be expected to provide numbers within the Abaxix dynamic ranges. An error code stating ${ > } 2 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ will flag the results.

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

Assay cut-off: ${ < } 7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The assay cut-off was determined from 69 healthy adults tested in duplicate by the Abaxis CRP method and the Beckman CRP method. CRP Reference interval was based on demonstrated transferability of the reference intervals from Beckman reference interval (per CLSI EP5-A guideline).
