Contact Person: Kathie J. Goodwin

Date Prepared: June 10, 2009

# Device Name

Proprietary names: Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin

Common names: Ceruloplasmin assay

Classification names: Ceruloplasmin Immunological Test System

# Device Description

Product codes: CHN   
The Tina-quant Ceruloplasmin assay employs an immunoturbidimetric test in which anti-ceruloplasmin antibodies react with antigen in the sample to form antigen/antibody complexes which, following agglutination can be   
determined turbidimetrically.

# Intended use

Immunoturbidimetric assay for the quantitative in vitro determination of ceruloplasmin in human serum and plasma on Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

# Indications for Use

Measurements obtained by this device aid in the diagnosis of copper metabolism disorders.

# Substantial equivalence

The Tina-quant Ceruloplasmin assay is substantially equivalent to the Roche Ceruloplasmin assay on the cobas c501 analyzer. The cobas c501 Ceruloplasmin assay was cleared under K062114.

Dear Ms. Goodwin:

We have reviewed your Section S10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
