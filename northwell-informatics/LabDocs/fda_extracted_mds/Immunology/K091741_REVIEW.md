# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A: “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved Guideline”

CLSI EP17-A: “Protocol for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline”

L. Test Principle:

The Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin assay employs an immunoturbidimetric method in which anti-ceruloplasmin antibodies react with antigen in the sample to form antigen/antibody complexes which, following agglutination, can be determined turbidimetrically.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision of the Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin on the Roche/Hitachi 917 was analyzed according to CLSI EP5-A2 guideline using pooled human sera assayed in duplicate with 2 runs per day for 21 days. Repeatability is comparable to formerly used intra-assay or within-run precision. Intermediate precision describes within device day-to-day and run-to-run precision formerly referred to as within-lab or total precision. The specifications were ${ \leq } 3 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ : $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \vec { s D } } { \le } 2 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ and ${ \mathrm { > } } 3 0 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ : CV $6 \%$ . Five samples (low and high control, low medium and high serum) were used to acquire $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = } 8 4$ .

In a second study conducted to more thoroughly cover the measuring range, eleven samples (5 low, 3 medium, 3 high) were analyzed using a classical withinrun experiment design, and these data points are presented in the following table. The specifications were ${ \leq } 3 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ : $\mathrm { \Delta \ l D \leq l \ m g / d L }$ and ${ \mathrm { > } } 3 0 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ : CV $\leq 4 \%$ .

Results are acceptable within specifications.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity of the Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin on the Roche/Hitachi 917 was evaluated by preparing two dilution series using high analyte level native human serum samples. Series one covered theoretical values from 0 to 46 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and contained 10 dilutions steps. Series two covered theoretical values from 0 to $2 5 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Samples in both series were diluted with saline. Ceruloplasmin values were measured and the recovered value was compared to the theoretical value. Diluted samples were run in triplicate with median measured values reported. The theoretical values were generated by applying the dilution factors to the undiluted patient sample concentration. The acceptance criteria for linearity are measured recovery $\pm 5 \%$ of theoretical values for samples $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 1 4 0 ~ m g / d L }$ and $\pm 2 \mathrm { S D }$ for samples up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The regression equations of the two series are as follows:

Passing-Bablok   
Series 1 (low) $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 0$ ( $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I }$ for slope 0.988 to 1.009 and for   
intercept -0.126 to 0.242)   
Series 2 (high) $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 6 \mathrm { x } + 2 . 7 0$ $9 5 \%$ CI for slope 0.92 to 0.98 and for   
intercept 0.75 to 7.77)   
Linear regression:   
Series 1 (low) $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 3 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 3 5 7$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI for slope 0.973 to 1.012 and   
for intercept -0.172 to 0.885)   
Series 2 (high) $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 9 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 3 0 3$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI for slope 0.975 to 1.022 and   
for intercept -1.46 to 2.067)

The recommended measuring range is defined as the limit of detection to the upper limit of linearity. The recommended measuring range is $3 { \mathrm { - } } 1 4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The Calibration method has been standardized against the reference preparation CRM 470 (RPPHS – Reference Preparation for Proteins in Human Serum). All calibrators and controls have been previously cleared. The C.f.a.s. PAC calibrator was cleared in k040245. The Prealbumin/Ceruloplasmin Control set was cleared in k062379. The adjusted concentration of the control components are usually in the normal range or at the normal/pathological threshold.

Unopened kit components are stable up to the expiration date at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Reagents R1 and R2 are both stable for 90 days opened and refrigerated on the analyzer.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) of the Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin on the Roche/Hitachi 917 were determined in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A requirements. For LoB, one analyte free sample was analyzed in five-fold determinations over three days, two runs per day, for a total of $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = 6 0 }$ . For LoD, five human serum samples with low analyte concentration were analyzed in one-fold determination over three days, two runs per day. Two lots of reagents were used for testing.

The LoB is $2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the LoD is $3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances using the Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin assay on the Roche/Hitachi 917 was determined by using pooled human serum samples spiked with varying levels of interferent, including bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), hemoglobin, lipemia, and rheumatoid factors. The resulting sample series (ten dilution steps per sample) were tested in triplicate and the median values were used to calculate recovery. The specifications were $\leq \pm 3$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ for I index (bilirubin) $\le 6 0$ ; $\leq \pm 3 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ for L index (intralipid) ${ \le } 4 0 0$ ; $\leq \pm 3 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ for H index (hemoglobin) $\leq 3 5 0$ ; and $< 7 6 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ $( < + 0 . 0 3 \ \mathbf { g } / \mathrm { L }$ or $< + 1 0 \%$ ) for rheumatoid factor. The assay is unaffected by:

Bilirubin: approximate conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin concentration: $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Hemoglobin: approximate hemoglobin concentration: $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $\bullet$ Intralipid: $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Rheumatoid Factors: $< 7 6 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$

Eighteen commonly used pharmaceuticals were added to native patient samples and tested for interference on the Roche/Hitachi 917. Significant interference was defined as $a \pm 1 0 \%$ deviation from the reference value. No pharmaceuticals tested showed significant interference.

Hook effect:

No hook effect was detected up to $5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L }$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: A method comparison study was performed to compare the Roche Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin on the Roche/Hitachi 917 and Roche Ceruloplasmin assay on cobas c501. Eighty-two native human samples from multiple donors including hospitalized patients and healthy blood donors were analyzed. In a second study, an additional 15 samples were included to fully span the measuring range. Sample concentrations were between $4 . 7 \mathrm { - } 1 3 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . In all, $\mathtt { n } { = } 9 7$ and the following correlation was obtained using Passing/Bablok: $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 1 2 \mathrm { x } { - } 1 . 0 4$ $9 5 \%$ CI Slope: 0.99 to1.03 $9 5 \%$ CI Intercept: -1.79 to -0.44 $\tau { = } 0 . 9 4 5$

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

To validate the use of the lithium heparin sample type on the Tina-Quant   
Ceruloplasmin assay on the Roche/Hitachi 917, parallel samples were   
collected in serum and lithium heparin plasma for 58 samples. Each plasma   
sample was compared to the respective serum sample result and percent   
recovery was determined. The acceptance criteria were that plasma results   
=had to be within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the serum result or for serum results of ${ \le } 3 0 . 0$   
$\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , a recovery of $\leq \pm 3 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The experiment allowed for $20 \%$ of   
samples to be within $10 \%$ and $1 5 \%$ recovery. Later, four additional lithium   
heparin plasma samples were tested to fully span the measuring range. The   
data have been combined for $\mathtt { n } { = } 6 2$ , and all recoveries except one were within   
$10 \%$ or $\pm 3 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (as applicable). The following correlation was obtained   
using Passing/Bablok:   
$\scriptstyle \mathrm { y = } 0 . 9 9 \mathrm { x + } 0 . 1 4 4$   
$9 5 \%$ CI Slope: 0.97 to 1.00   
$9 5 \%$ CI Intercept: -0.54 to 0.81   
$\tau { = } 0 . 9 3 7$
