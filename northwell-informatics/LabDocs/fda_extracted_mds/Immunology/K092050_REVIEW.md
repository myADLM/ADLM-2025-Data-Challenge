# L. Test Principle:

The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP, reacts with the specific

IgE in the patient sample. After washing away non-specific IgE, enzyme –labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value the more specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the response for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: To demonstrate lot-to-lot reproducibility of the ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House dust mite, three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen from routine production were tested using two positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma). The samples were tested in duplicates in one assay run. Mean concentration values, concentration quotients, and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated. The concentration quotients between lots based on uptake of positive sample were between $0 . 9 9 - 1 . 0 9 $ , the concentrations of the negative samples were $< 0 . 3 5 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ , and all $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were less than $4 \%$ .   
$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not provided (see k962274)   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): A stability study was performed to demonstrate 24 months real time stability (at recommended storage temperature of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) of ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House dust mite. The study was planned in accordance with CEN 13640, Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. Three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Two positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma) were tested in duplicates in one assay at monthly intervals. The mean concentrations were calculated for each sample and occasion. Concentration quotients were calculated for the positive samples. The sample concentration at a specific month is divided with the start value, (month x)/(month 0). The concentration quotients ranged from 0.8 $- 1 . 3 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ of the starting value for the positive samples while the value for the negative sample remained at ${ < 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } }$ demonstrating at least 24 months stability from the date of manufacture.   
d. Detection limit: $0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ (see k051218)   
$e$ . Analytical specificity: Not provided (see k051218)   
$f .$ Assay cut-off: Not provided (see k051218)

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable for this kind of submission.

$b$ . Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical specificity:

To demonstrate the presence of specific IgE to Blomia tropicalis in the serum/plasma samples of patients with diagnosed or suspected allergy to the allergen and healthy, non-sensitized donors with no reported clinical reaction, 66 positive and 100 negative samples were tested with the ImmunoCAP Allergen d201. The positive samples consisted of 3 clinical, 37 positive, and another 26 patients with allergic asthma and exhibited positive reactions to either conjunctival and/or bronchial challenge with B. tropicalis. A clinical sample was defined as a sample from an individual with a clinical history of allergylike symptoms upon exposure to the specific allergen, as diagnosed by a physician. A positive sample was defined as a sample from an individual with a relevant suspected allergy and with measurable levels of IgE antibodies. Negative samples were collected from healthy non-atopic donors.

The 26 patients were from a published studya of 42 patients from Spain with allergic asthma and/or rhinoconjunctivitis sensitized to house dust mites. 26 patients had positive reactions to conjunctival and/or bronchial challenge with freeze-dried extracts of Blomia tropicalis and $D$ . pteronyssinus, 23 of these were positive by ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House dust mite (Blomia tropicalis). For the purposes of the clinical study, the clinical results used to define the subjects were a clinical history, clinical symptoms compatible with mite sensitization, and/or a positive result from either bronchial and/or conjunctival challenge, irrespective of skin prick test results. For this study values below $0 . 3 5 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ were reported as negative.

Sensitivity: 95.5% (63/33) Specificity: 100% (100/100)

The study was designed to verify the immunological specificity of Blomia tropicalis allergen solution as bound to ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House dust mite. The study was planned in accordance with appendix D (“Specificity Analysis of Allergen-Containing Reagents”) in the CLSI standard I/LA20-A2, “Analytical Performance Characteristics and Clinical Utility of Immunological Assays for Human Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Antibodies and Defined Allergen Specificities.” To establish the theoretical response level for $100 \%$ inhibition, $( ^ { 6 6 } 1 0 0 \% ^ { 3 9 } )$ , $9 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of negative sample was premixed with $9 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ of buffer. This is done to mimic the state where all IgE antibodies are bound by the added soluble inhibitor (allergen) and thus leaving no available IgE antibodies that may be bound to the ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House dust mite solid phase.

To establish the maximum response level for $0 \%$ inhibition, $( ^ { 6 6 } 0 \% ^ { 3 3 } )$ , $9 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of positive sample was premixed with $9 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ buffer. To show an overall dose dependent inhibition, $9 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of positive sample was premixed with varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor). The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer in a $1 / 1 0$ -dilution sequence. The initial allergen solution dilution factor is dependent on the concentration of the allergen solution at hand. Subsequent dilutions were then adjusted to the 1/10-dilution sequence. The unrelated allergen solutions were not further diluted. Only concentrated solutions are used for the inhibition studies. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 16-24 hours before being analyzed with ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House dust mite on ImmunoCAP 100E instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was performed in duplicates in one assay run. Mean values were calculated. The results are shown in Table 2 and Figures 1 and 2, below.

Each laboratory should establish its own expected range of values.

N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
