# Substantial Equivalence Information:

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory disease of the joints. The disease is caused by an inflammatory reaction that leads to increasing joint damage, occupational disability and premature invalidity. About 0.5 to 1 percent of the population is affected. Contrary to common belief, RA is a serious disease that affects people at all ages. In most cases it becomes manifest between the age of 30 and 50. Children and young persons can be affected as well. RA is not curable, but in many patients it is easily controlled and brought to a halt. The earlier the diagnosis is made and treatment begins, the better its progression can be slowed or even stopped. The goal for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis today is early detection and initiation of the earliest possible effective treatment.

RA is an autoimmune disease. The trigger for this disease remains unknown. Infection by viruses or bacteria could play a role in its inception. It is highly probable that a hereditary predisposition plays an important role in this disease. It has also been demonstrated that smokers are at higher risk.

Diagnosis of RA is based on clinical findings according to the ACR criteria and on laboratory tests. Of special importance is the detection of disease-specific autoantibodies:heumatoid factors and anti-citrullinated protein / peptide antibodies (ACPA). Determination of RF is a well established method and until now the only autoantibody laboratory parameter included in the ACR criteria. The sensitivity of RF for

RA-Diagnosis is 50 $-90 \%$ and the specificity is 50 $- 9 5 \%$ . False positive results commonly occur in the setting of chronic infections, malignancies and other rheumatic diseases. RF is detected in the sera of $1 - 4 \%$ of healthy young persons and in a high percentage of elderly persons without RA.

One of the most important serological discoveries in rheumatology in recent years has been the characterization of autoantigens in RA containing the amino acid citrulline. Citrullination is a posttranslational modification that occurs naturally during inflammation, apoptosis and keratinization. Several citrullinated proteins have been found in RA synovium and citrullinated epitopes have been identified as targets of highly RA-specific autoantibodies.

ELISA-tests using synthetic cyclic citrulinated peptides (CCP) have improved the specificity of detection of RA-autoantibodies without changing the sensitivity compared to RF. Several studies have now shown that anti-CCP antibodies are not only highly specific, but also of high predictive value for an erosive course of the disease and are thus of prognostic value.

Citrullinated vimentin is present in synovial fluid and autoantibodies directed against it are detectable in RA synovium. The most recent studies have shown that both citrullination and mutation can influence the antigenicity of vimentin. An ELISA based on mutated citrullinated yimentin (MCV) (Patented) has been commercially available for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis for some time and has about the same diagnostic sensitivity and specificity as anti-CCP antibodies.

ACPA, such as anti-CCP and anti-MCV are associated with known genetic and epidemiologic risk factors for RA and therefore identify a population of RA patients with more severe, erosive joint disease that is at high risk for rapid joint destruction. The ACPA-assay may be especially valuable in predicting RA in patients who are RFnegative but nevertheless have a high probability of RA. When used in the identification of patients potentially developing RA among those presenting with early and undifferentiated symptoms, in a high risk population (rather than screening the entire population) the prevalence of the disease will be high. ACPA are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing RA in healthy individuals and are detectable in the blood of healthy persons prior to clinical manifestation of RA.

# f. Assay cut-off:

cut-off of ≥ 20 U/ml is positive

# Comparison/Clinical studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device / Clinical comparison:

Studies were performed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Anti-MCV® (ELISA) test when compared to the predicate assay Anti-CCP assay using a mix of clinically diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis disease state samples and a presumed normal asymptomatic blood bank population plus other arthritic and autoimmune patient samples obtained from hospital labs and autoimmune clinics.

Specificity can be defined as the ability of a test to give a negative result for "normal" and control disease sera. The specifcity performance of the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV® assay was

established using 234 "presumed normal" sera obtained from blood donor centers age 24 to 82 years, 522 other samples from patients with arthritic and autoimmune disease conditions, obtained from a variety of clinical sources (hospitals and autoimmune clinics) age 2 to 92 years. The samples collectively included 166 males and 590 females.

Sensitivity can be defined as the ability of a test to give a positive result for sera from patients diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. The sensitivity performance of the ORGENTEC Anti$M C V ^ { \otimes }$ assay was established using four hundred and ninety samples from clinically diagnosed patients as having Rheumatoid Arthritis disease that were obtained from a variety of clinical sources (hospitals and autoimmune clinics). The patients collectively included 124 males and 366 females. The age ranged from 19 to 92 years.

The results were calculated for each sample from a calibration curve on the basis of six calibrators tested. Quantitative values above or equal to 20 U/ml were considered positive, values below ${ 2 0 } \cup / \mathsf { m l }$ were considered negative.

Five hundred and fifty five (555) sera were tested by the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV® ELISA and by the commercially available Anti-CCP IgG ELISA. The quantitative results were calculated from a calibration curve on the basis of tested calibrators. In the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV® assay quantitative values above or equal to 20 U/ml were considered positive, values below 20 U/ml were considered negative. In the Anti-CCP IgG assay quantitative values above or equal 25 U/ml were considered positive, values below 25 U/ml were considered negative.

Based on clinical diagnosis, three hundred ninety-eight of the 490 Rheumatoid Arthritis disease negative, thus yielding a clinical diagnostic sensitivity of $8 1 . 2 \%$ .

Note that the predicate assay also missed many of the same specimens. This data is consistent with reported data of sensitivities ranging from $69 \%$ to $82 \%$ for commercial AntiMCV IgG assay for the diagnosis and follow up of RA Disease patients (Table in Egerer et al., Deutsches Arzteblatt Internationalm Dtsch Arztebl Int 2009; 106 (10):15963).
