# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT HE4 assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of HE4 antigen in human serum using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the first step, sample and anti-HE4 coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. HE4 antigen present in the sample binds to the anti-HE4 coated microparticles. After washing, acridinium-labeled anti-HE4 conjugate is added. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of HE4 antigen in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i$ System optics.

The ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrators are for the calibration of the ARCHITECT $i$ System when used for the quantitative determination of HE4 antigen in human serum. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls are used for the verification of the accuracy and precision of the ARCHITECT $i$ System when used for the quantitative determination of HE4 antigen in human serum.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the ARCHITECT HE4 assay was assessed at three (3) different sites. These studies were modeled after CLSI guideline EP5-A2 (“Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition, $2 0 0 4 ^ { \ ' } )$ . At each site, 2 lots of reagent kit, calibrator kit, and control kit were utilized. At one site and 1 lot, the ARCHITECT i2000 instrument system was used while the other sites used the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instrument system. Only the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System data will be used to communicate performance claims in the proposed ARCHITECT HE4 package insert.

Six samples were tested in 2 replicates using 2 lots of reagents, at 2 separate runs per day, for 20 days (not necessarily consecutive) on 1 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System or 1 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0$ System. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The 6 samples were the following:

Panel 1: pooled human serum - HE4 concentration is approximately 40 pmol/L

Panel 2: pooled human serum spiked with native HE4 antigen - HE4 concentration is approximately 200 pmol/L   
Panel 3: pooled human serum spiked with recombinant HE4 Antigen (kit Calibrator/Control antigen) - HE4 concentration is approximately 1000 pmol/L   
Low Control: recombinant HE4 Antigen spiked into PBS buffer with a protein (bovine) stabilizer - HE4 concentration is approximately $5 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$   
Medium Control: recombinant HE4 Antigen spiked into PBS buffer with a protein (bovine) stabilizer - HE4 concentration is approximately 175 pmol/L   
High Control: recombinant HE4 Antigen spiked into PBS buffer with a protein (bovine) stabilizer - HE4 concentration is approximately 700 pmol/L   
Human pool 1 was a specimen containing HE4 concentration levels that could be   
deemed as natural. However, it is difficult to obtain samples at higher HE4   
concentration levels due to the infrequent prevalence of ovarian cancer in young   
healthy women. So the use of spiked samples is sufficient.   
Within-run, between-run, between-day, and total imprecision, expressed as   
standard deviation and %coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ for both lots and for each   
lot separately, was calculated. The following table summarizes data for both   
combined lots:

The upper $9 5 \%$ confidence limit for total imprecision for all samples is less than or equal to $6 . 1 \% \mathrm { C V }$ . The ARCHITECT HE4 assay meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of $\leq 1 0 \%$ total CV.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The assay measures concentrations between 20 and $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ . To assess the linearity of the assay in the reportable range, CLSI guidance EP6-A, entitled “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline”, was used to design the linearity experiment. Four concentration levels ranging from 200 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ were prepared from a panel of ovarian cancer patients prior to dilution. A fifth panel was prepared from normal female serum supplemented with native HE4 (derived from cell culture). A series of 10 dilutions was prepared from these 5 starting pools. The un-diluted and diluted series were tested in 4 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The assay kit controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The expected concentration value at each dilution was calculated for each sample using the dilution factor and the initial concentration of the undiluted sample pool. The mean observed HE4 concentration of 4 replicates at each dilution was calculated from the assay results. A polynomial regression analysis of observed and expected HE4 concentration was performed for first-, second-, and third-order polynomials using a weighted regression method. If the non-linear coefficients of the second or third order polynomial are statistically significant then the deviation from linearity was investigated. For 2 of the 5 specimen pools, significant non-linearity was observed. Deviation from linearity was investigated. The assay met the bias allowance for deviation from linearity defined $a \mathbf { s } \pm 1 0 \%$ for concentration levels above $2 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ and $\pm 2$ pmol/L for samples at or below $2 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The assay meets the requirements of the CLSI Guideline EP6A for linearity from 20 to 1500 pmol/L.

Analysis of the sponsor’s data was performed without using weighted regression analysis. For all specimen pools with expected HE4 concentrations ranging from $2 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ to $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , the second and third order polynomials were significant. The deviation from linearity, expressed as a percentage deviation of the non-linear model, for all samples ranged from $- 2 . 9 \%$ to $7 . 3 \%$ deviation from linearity. The mean percentage deviation from linearity compared with the expected HE4 concentration was - $. 0 . 0 4 3 \%$ . The deviation from linearity met the sponsor’s specification $0 f \pm 1 0 \%$ for HE4 concentrations above $2 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The following graph illustrates this analysis.

![](images/cef8c881b337edd3981910514307fb9e5b08ff9de711c6fa2a8e0ab3c312b51d.jpg)

The individual replicates for the dilution series of the 5 specimen pools is indicated in the graph. The line of linearity and the observed best fit line of a linear model are also shown. The upper and lower allowable deviation from linearity are plotted based on the sponsor’s specification for deviation from linearity. The graph shows that the individual datapoints of the dilution series of all 5 specimen pools, though not statistically linear, are sufficiently close to the line of linearity and the sponsor’s specification for deviation from linearity. The data is acceptable and indicates sufficient linearity in the assay range of 20 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

High Sample Dilution Study   
To evaluate the recommended dilution procedure of 1:10 for out of range samples $( 1 5 0 0 - 1 5 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L ) }$ as described in the package insert for the assay,   
recombinant HE4 antigen was added to 6 serum samples to create out-of-range conditions. The final HE4 concentrations before automatic dilution were   
approximately 2100, 4300, 6500, 8600, 10,800, and $1 4 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The expected value for each sample was determined from the concentration and volume of HE4 antigen added and the endogenous concentration and volume of serum sample. Samples were tested undiluted and diluted using the auto-dilution function (1:10 dilution) on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ instrument in 2 replicates. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration value was calculated for each sample. The percent recovery of observed HE4   
concentration relative to the expected concentration was calculated. The mean recoveries for the six (6) individual samples ranged from 91 to $106 \%$ . The mean percent recovery for samples was $9 9 \%$ . The assay meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of $10 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recovery of all samples.

There is a slight proportional bias in observed HE4 and Expected HE4 for the samples tested. %recovery increased with increasing expected HE4 concentrations, though the mean %recovery is within the acceptance criteria. From the data it is possible to calculate the $\%$ bias between observed and expected HE4 concentration. The %recoveries and calculated $\%$ bias are as follows:

# High Dose hook effect

To determine the effect of extreme levels of analyte in the assay, one pooled serum sample (un-spiked) and two normal sera were supplemented with recombinant HE4 antigen. These samples were then serially diluted in Wash Buffer such that one or more of the dilutions fell within the reportable range of the assay but above the B calibrator (30 pmol/L). All samples were run in 2

replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The instrument response values (i.e., Relative Light Units) of the neat and diluted samples were plotted against their respective calculated HE4 value. For each sample and its corresponding dilutions, the calculated HE4 value was determined by multiplying the mean value of the samples by their respective dilution factor when the HE4 concentration was within the range of the assay. The values of sample dilutions within the standard curve but above the B calibrator were used to calculate the neat sample concentration.

The results are graphically summarized by the sponsor as follows:

![](images/eef488224c90602890579cb45346a4317835494c1aa75c47b69e41401670e675.jpg)  
ARCHITECT HE4 HIGH HOOK EFFECT STUDY

The data in the figure shows that increasing levels of analyte increases the response of the assay to a plateau level of approximately 2,000,000 RLU’s. The RLU values of the samples did not diminish with increasing antigen concentration as would be expected with high dose hook (prozone) effect but maintained a response level in excess of the RLU value of the F Calibrator.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Kit Calibrators

The kit contains 6 bottles $4 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ each) of ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrators. Calibrators A through F are prepared in PBS buffer with a protein (bovine) stabilizer. Preservative: ProClin 300. The calibrators are at the following concentrations:

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Calibrator</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Concentration(pmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CAL A</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CAL B</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CAL C</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CAL D</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">250</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CAL E</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">750</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CAL F</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1500</td></tr></table>

There is currently no known internationally recognized consensus reference method or reference material for standardization. Calibrator value is related to a sponsor maintained reference preparation. The calibrators are manufactured volumetrically and are referenced to this standard. HE4 assay values are expressed as pmol/L.

The material used to standardize the assay is recombinant Ig-HE4 fusion protein consisting of a Human Fc antibody fragment and Human Epidydimis protein (HE4). The material was produced in a stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. The cell line was grown in serum free medium. The cell culture supernatant was purified by Protein A affinity chromatography. The concentration of the resulting material was determined by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry This material is the primary source material from which secondary and bulk kit calibrators are prepared. Bulk testing is performed by measuring the Relative Light Unit (RLU) of each calibrator as compared to the RLU of the reference calibrators when tested on the ARCHITECT System. When the bulk calibrators are within specifications, they are aseptically filtered and filled into their final containers. Quality Control testing of the filled calibrators as bottled components is performed followed by finished goods testing of the packed Calibrator Kit using packaged Reagent Kits. The calibrator curve and controls must meet predetermined acceptance criteria.

# Kit controls

The control kit contains 3 Bottles $\mathrm { 8 . 0 \ m L }$ each) of ARCHITECT HE4 Controls. The Low, Medium, and High Controls are prepared in PBS buffer with a protein (bovine) stabilizer. Preservative: ProClin 300. The controls are at the following concentrations:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TargetConcentration(pmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35-65</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Medium</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>175</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>122.5 -- 227.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>700</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>490 -910</td></tr></table>

The Controls are prepared by adding HE4 Antigen to a diluent to achieve the desired concentrations. After passing Quality Control testing the bulk material is then used to prepare the Low, Medium and High Controls. Each control is prepared by diluting the bulk material with the diluent. After mixing and equilibration, the controls are tested by measuring the RLU of each control as compared to the RLU of the reference controls. Adjustments are made if necessary. When the bulk controls are within specifications, they are aseptically filtered and filled into their final containers. Quality Control testing of the filled controls as bottled components is performed followed by finished goods testing of the packed Control Kit using packaged Reagent Kits, packaged Calibrator Kits. Controls must meet predetermined acceptance criteria.

# ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrator and Control Stability Studies

A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of the ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrator and Control Kits when all bottled components are manually opened and closed. The study was performed to support the package insert claim instructing the end user to tightly close the caps on the bottles after each use and return to $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage. The stability studies for the ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrator and Control material are performed in compliance to the CEN standard, 13640 – Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. Three (3) lots of kit Calibrators and Controls were set up for the study. Sufficient kit Calibrators and Controls are stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and used to evaluate three (3) panels, described below, at monthly time points. All of the bottles were opened and closed at time 0. One calibrator lot is stored inverted. The panels (Panel 1, Panel 2, and Panel 3) consist of 3 HE4 concentrations spanning the calibration range of the Assay. The Panels are pooled serum samples containing either recombinant or native HE4 antigen. The Panels are stored at $\leq - 6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . At time zero and each subsequent time point the following run was or will be performed:

Run 1 – A calibration curve using calibrators in duplicate with 1 replicate of HE4 controls and 2 replicates of samples from panels. Run 2 – HE4 controls in single replicates and panels in 2 replicates.

At each time point, all runs are required to meet predetermined acceptance criteria for the calibration curve, control recovery, and panel recovery. Intended storage data currently supports 9 months dating for kit Calibrators and Controls. This study is ongoing and will be supplemented with additional timepoints.

# Sample stability - fresh serum samples

A study was conducted to determine the stability of HE4 antigen in fresh serum samples stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Serum samples from 10 healthy volunteers were collected. The samples were stored continuously at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Each sample was tested in 2 replicates using the ARCHITECT HE4 assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System and tested at Day 0 (within 8 hours of draw), Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, and Day 5. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each sample tested at Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, and Day 5 was compared to the corresponding mean concentration at Day 0 (control).

The mean of daily percent recoveries across the 10 samples was within $1 0 0 \pm$ $10 \%$ for the study period. As a result, the ARCHITECT HE4 assay meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ of Day 0 value for the daily mean and supports the package insert sample storage claim of up to 4 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Sample Stability – Frozen samples

A study was conducted to determine the stability of HE4 antigen in frozen serum samples. Serum samples from 11 healthy volunteers were collected. Each sample was aliquoted into a minimum of 4 tubes and frozen at $\leq - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . One (1) fresh/unfrozen aliquot was retained as the control (Day 0). The Day 0 control was tested 3 in replicates using the ARCHITECT HE4 assay on 1 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System within 8 hours of draw. The remaining aliquots were stored continuously at $\leq - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested in 3 replicates using the ARCHITECT HE4 assay on the same ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System at Day 4 and Day 5. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 3 replicates of each sample tested at Day 4 and Day 5 was compared to the corresponding mean concentration at Day 0 (control).

All samples recovered within $1 0 0 + / - 1 5 \%$ of Day 0 on Day 4, 5, 6, and 7. Testing supports the package insert recommendations.

# Sample Stability - Room Temperature Sample

A study was conducted to characterize the stability of HE4 antigen in fresh serum samples at room temperature and to support the ARCHITECT HE4 package insert claim for room temperature storage. Serum samples from 10 healthy volunteers were collected. Each sample was tested in 2 replicates using the ARCHITECT HE4 assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System. The samples were stored continuously at $2 5 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and run at Time 0 (within 8 hours of draw), $2 4 \pm 2$ hours and $4 8 \pm 2$ hours. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each sample tested at Time 0 (control) was compared to the corresponding mean concentration at 24 hours and 48 hours.

The range of percent recoveries for each individual sample was between $9 7 \%$ - $1 1 3 \%$ for 24 hours and $9 7 \% - 1 1 4 \%$ for 48 hours. The percent recovery for the mean of all samples was $10 5 \%$ for 24 hours and $106 \%$ for 48 hours. As a result, the ARCHITECT HE4 assay meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 $\pm 1 0 \%$ of Time 0 value and supports the package insert sample storage claim of up to 24 hours at room temperature.

# Sample Stability - Freeze / Thaw

A study was conducted to determine the effects of multiple freeze/thaw cycles on serum samples analyzed with the ARCHITECT HE4 assay. Twelve (12) fresh (less than 36 hours from the time of the draw) serum samples were spiked with native HE4 antigen to values between 125 and $1 1 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ and used for this study. Each sample was aliquoted into 12 tubes. One aliquot was retained as the unfrozen control and the remaining aliquots were subjected to repeated freeze/thaw cycles. The samples were frozen at $\leq - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for a minimum of 30 minutes followed by thawing them at room temperature. At the end of each cycle one vial from each set was removed and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until the assay was ready to run. A total of ten (10) freeze/thaw cycles were completed for each serum sample. For each aliquot, the control and the test sample sets were tested in 2 replicates using the ARCHITECT HE4 assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The recovery of the cycle was determined by comparing the mean test sample value tested against the unfrozen control sample mean value.

The average recovery per cycle for the 12 samples ranged from $93 \%$ to $12 8 \%$ . The percent recoveries for individual results were within $+ / - 1 5 \%$ of the unfrozen control through cycle 6. The data supports a conclusion that samples can be frozen and thawed six (6) times for the ARCHITECT HE4 assay without compromising the assay.

# d. Detection limit:

To characterize the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the ARCHITECT HE4 assay, an experimental protocol was utilized modeled after CLSI guideline EP17-A (“Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline – 2004”).

A Low Level Sample Set was prepared by diluting 2 normal human serum samples in kit calibrator A (0 pmol/L HE4) to obtain HE4 concentrations as shown in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Panel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EndogenousHE4 Levels(pmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Dilution inCalibrator A</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ExpectedValue(pmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>27.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1:201:40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.40.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>34</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1:101:60</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.10.3</td></tr></table>

Calibrator A and Low Level Sample Set were tested in 5 replicates, once per day for three (3) days on 2 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ Systems with $3 \mathrm { k i t }$ reagent lots $( \mathrm { N } =$ $5 \mathrm { x } 3 \mathrm { x } 2 \mathrm { x } 3 = 9 0$ ). Each of the 3 reagent lots were run on both ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ Systems. One lot of kit calibrators and controls was used per instrument system. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity.

To determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), the mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated for each of the runs of the Calibrator A. The total mean and average SD for the Calibrator A is - $\mathrm { . 0 . 1 0 \pm 0 . 0 9 \ p m o l / L }$ . The LoB was 0.05 pmol/L based on equation: $\mathrm { L o B = M e a n + 1 } . 6 4 5 ^ { \ast } \mathrm { S D _ { A C a l } } .$ .

To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), the individual total means and SDs, and the average SD were calculated for each of the runs of the Low Level Sample Set. The results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Panel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EndogenousHE4 Levels(pmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>DilutioninCalibratorA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ExpectedValue(pmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Observedvalue(pmol/l)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>estimatedSD</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>42</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>27.1</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>1:201:40</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>0.30.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.120</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.07</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.44</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.07</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>13</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>20.6</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>1:201:10</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>1.42.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.22</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.07</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.060</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.10</td></tr></table>

The LoD was calculated to be $0 . 1 8 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ based on the following formula: LoD $= \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5$ SDSample $\mathrm { s e t } ^ { = 0 . 0 5 + ( 1 . 6 4 5 * 0 . 0 8 ) }$ .

To determine the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), the mean of the differences between the expected values and measured values was calculated for each replicate of each member of the Low Level Sample Set to determine the total error. The average individual biases and SDs of each member of the Low Level Sample Set were calculated by run. The average bias and average SD for all concentrations in the Low Level Sample set was $- 0 . 1 5 + / - 0 . 0 8 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The Total Error is $0 . 3 1 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ ( $2 8 \%$ of the mean expected value) based on the following equation: Total Error $=$ | Bias $| + 2 ^ { * } \mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { S } } = | - 0 . 1 5 | + ( 2 ^ { * } 0 . 0 8 )$ . The LoQ claimed was $0 . 1 8 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

Since the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and $\%$ bias are a function of the expected concentration, the calculated LoQ should not base on the average total error for the 4 samples. The observed and expected HE4 concentrations with the total biases and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of variation should be individually calculated for the 4 panel set. The following table summarizes the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of variation for each individual expected HE4 concentration, the $\%$ bias from expected HE4 concentration, and the calculated total allowable error for each expected HE4 concentration:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Panel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ExpectedValue</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Observedvalue</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>estimatedSD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%bias</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>allowabletotal error</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>42</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>0.30.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.120</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0700</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>23.3%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-60.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>105.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.44</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0700</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-37.1%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>56.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>13</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>1.42.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.22</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0700</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-12.9%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.060</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.8%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.9%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.2%</td></tr></table>

A plot of the allowable total error vs. the expected HE4 value shows the relationship.

![](images/85d79937b7aa6662d6378d8199fdd4e14a7050eb8bb5312db43428b52df4e030.jpg)

Extrapolating from the smoothed model of the total allowable error for the chosen total error of $30 \%$ , the HE4 concentration is $1 . 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . At this HE4 concentration the observed bias of the observed HE4 concentration from the expected concentration was $- 1 7 . 6 \%$ and the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of the observed HE4 was $7 \%$ . Therefore, the LoQ estimate is $1 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ with $30 \%$ total allowable error. This value is less than the acceptance criteria $( < 2 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L } )$ .

The LoD $( 0 . 2 \mathrm { p m o l / L } )$ , and LoQ $( 1 . 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L } )$ ) meet the sponsor predetermined acceptance criteria of $\mathrm { L o D } < 1 5 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ and $\mathrm { L o Q } < 2 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . These data support the performance claims of the assay.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Lipid interference

To evaluate the potential interference from lipids in the assay, CLSI guideline EP7-A (“Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline”) was used to design the interference experiments. Six (6) human serum samples were used in this study. The endogenous HE4 concentrations of samples 3 through 6 were augmented by the addition of HE4 antigen (recombinant) prepared from a stock solution. Samples 1 and 2 were not spiked with additional HE4 antigen.

Each HE4 serum sample was split into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with a lipids solution to achieve $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ lipid. One aliquot was spiked with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) for use as a control sample. Serum samples were not diluted more than $20 \%$ . The control and the lipid supplemented samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each sample with the added lipids was compared to the mean value of the corresponding control sample without lipids to calculate the percent recovery. The average recovery was $9 8 \%$ ranging from $94 \%$ to $104 \%$ for samples with a $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ lipid concentration. Less than $10 \%$ average interference was observed in the assay with specimens containing an elevated level of lipids. Testing meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of $10 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recovery of all samples. These data support the performance claims of the assay.

# Bilirubin interference

Interference from bilirubin was assessed in a manner similar to lipid interference. Twelve (12) human serum samples with HE4 values distributed across the assay range were supplemented with bilirubin as a potential interfering substance. Each HE4 serum sample was split into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with a bilirubin solution (unconjugated bilirubin in $1 0 \mathrm { m M N a O H } )$ to achieve $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin. One aliquot was spiked with an equal volume of $1 0 \mathrm { m M N a O H }$ for use as a control sample. Serum samples were not diluted more than $5 \%$ . The control and the bilirubin supplemented samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. Percent recoveries were calculated as in lipid interference evaluation. The average recovery was $9 8 \%$ ranging from $92 \%$ to $103 \%$ for samples with a $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin concentration. Less than $1 5 \%$ individual interference and less than $10 \%$ average interference was observed in the assay with specimens containing an elevated level of bilirubin. Testing meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of $10 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recovery of all samples. These data support the performance claims of the assay.

# Hemoglobin interference

Interference from hemoglobin was assessed in a manner similar to lipid interference. Six (6) human serum samples with HE4 values distributed across the assay range were supplemented with hemoglobin as a potential interfering substance. Each HE4 serum sample was split into two (2) aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with a hemoglobin solution to achieve $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin. One aliquot was spiked with an equal volume of PBS for use as a control sample. Serum samples were not diluted more than $5 \%$ . The control and the hemoglobin supplemented samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. Percent recoveries were calculated as in lipid interference evaluation. The average recovery was $10 8 \%$ ranging from $104 \%$ to $1 1 3 \%$ for samples with a $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin concentration. Less than $1 5 \%$ individual interference and less than $10 \%$ average interference was observed in the assay with specimens containing an elevated level of bilirubin. Testing meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of $10 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recovery of all samples. These data support the performance claims of the assay.

# Low and High Protein interference

Interference from high protein concentrations was assessed in a manner similar to lipid interference. Six (6) serum samples were split into four (4) equal aliquots, one (1) aliquot was used as the control and one (1) aliquot was used to measure the protein concentration of the samples. Based on the measured protein concentration for each of the six (6) serum samples, one (1) aliquot was diluted with PBS to obtain $3 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ total protein, and one (1) aliquot was spiked with human serum albumin protein to obtain $1 2 { \mathrm { g / d L } }$ final protein concentration. HE4 was also supplemented to achieve different HE4 concentrations. Serum samples were not diluted more than $5 \%$ by addition of HE4. The control and the protein supplemented samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. Percent recoveries were calculated as in lipid interference evaluation. The average recovery was $103 \%$ ranging from $101 \%$ to $1 0 7 \%$ for samples with a $3 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ protein concentration. The average recovery was $103 \%$ ranging from $101 \%$ to $10 8 \%$ for samples with a $1 2 { \mathrm { g / d L } }$ protein concentration. Less than $1 5 \%$ individual interference and less than $10 \%$ average interference was observed in the assay with specimens containing an elevated level or lowered level of protein. Testing meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of $1 0 0 \pm$ $1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recovery of all samples. These data support the performance claims of the assay.

Human anti-mouse antibody interference

To evaluate the potential interference from Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA) in the assay, CLSI guideline, EP7-A was used to design the interference experiments. Preparation of Test Samples using six (6) HAMA positive human serum samples was as follows:

1. Each HAMA serum sample was split into three (3) equal aliquots.   
2. One (1) aliquot was spiked with approximately $9 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ of recombinant HE4 antigen (spike 1) prepared from a stock solution. No sample was diluted more than $5 \%$ through spiking of the HE4 antigen.   
3. One (1) aliquot was spiked with approximately $4 5 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ of recombinant HE4 antigen (spike 2) prepared from a stock solution. No sample was diluted more than $5 \%$ through spiking of the HE4 antigen.   
4. One (1) aliquot was the unaltered control used to determine the endogenous HE4 concentration in each HAMA sample.

The Expected HE4 Concentrations of HAMA samples spiked with HE4 Antigen were calculated as follows:

$\left[ \left( \mathrm { V } 0 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { C } 0 \right) + \left( \mathrm { V S } \mathrm { x } \mathrm { C S } \right) \right] / \left( \mathrm { V } 0 + \mathrm { V S } \right)$ Where: $\mathrm { V } 0 =$ Volume of unspiked sample $\mathrm { C 0 = }$ Concentration of unspiked sample (control) $\mathrm { V S } =$ Volume of spiking solution $\mathrm { C S = }$ Concentration of spiking solution

The control and the HAMA samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The percent recovery was calculated from the mean Observed HE4 Concentration obtained for each HAMA sample compared to the Expected HE4 Concentration of that sample.

The range of recoveries for the individual samples (HAMA values ranging from 45.4 to $1 5 4 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) was from $91 \%$ to $10 8 \%$ , the average recovery was $102 \%$ . The range of recoveries for each HAMA level tested was from 95 to $106 \%$ . Less than $1 5 \%$ interference for each individual sample tested and less than $10 \%$ average interference for each HAMA level tested was observed in the ARCHITECT HE4 assay. As a result, the testing meets the sponsor’s predetermined acceptance criteria of $10 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recoveries of each HAMA level. These data support the performance claims of the assay.

Rheumatoid arthritis interference

To evaluate the potential interference from rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies in the assay, a design similar to the HAMA interference was performed. Preparation of Test Samples using six (6) HAMA positive human serum samples was as follows:

1. Each RF serum sample was split into three (3) equal aliquots.   
2. One (1) aliquot was spiked with approximately 90 (spike 1) pmol/L of HE4 antigen (recombinant) prepared from a stock solution. No sample was diluted more than $5 \%$ through spiking of the HE4 antigen.   
3. One (1) aliquot was spiked with approximately 450 (spike 2) pmol/L of HE4 antigen (recombinant) prepared from a stock solution. No sample was diluted more than $5 \%$ through spiking of the HE4 antigen.   
4. One (1) aliquot was the unaltered control used to determine the endogenous HE4 concentration in each RF sample.

The Expected HE4 Concentrations of RF samples spiked with HE4 Antigen were calculated similarly to the calculation for HAMA interference. The control and the RF samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The percent recovery was calculated from the mean Observed HE4 Concentration obtained from each RF sample supplemented with HE4 antigen compared to the Expected HE4 Concentration of that sample.

The range of recoveries for the individual samples (RF values ranging from 21 to $4 4 5 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ ) was from $9 8 \%$ to $1 1 1 \%$ ; the average recovery was $103 \%$ . The range of recoveries for each RF level tested was from 100 to $10 8 \%$ . Less than $1 5 \%$ interference for each individual sample tested and less than $10 \%$ average interference for each RF level tested was observed in the assay. As a result, the testing meets the sponsor’s predetermined acceptance criteria of $10 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recoveries of each RF level. These data support the performance claims of the assay.

# Interference from various chemotherapeutic agents

To evaluate the potential interference from several chemotherapeutic agents in the assay, CLSI guideline EP7-A was used to design the interference experiments. Two (2) levels of human serum supplemented with native HE4 antigen were spiked with each chemotherapeutic agent listed below as a potential interfering substance. The various chemotherapeutic substances were prepared for spiking using a particular solvent. Control samples were spiked with an equal volume of each respective solvent without the agent. The control samples and the samples supplemented with chemotherapeutic substances were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each sample with the added therapeutics was compared to the mean value of the corresponding control sample with solvent only to calculate the percent recovery.

The range of the recoveries for all samples tested was $9 6 \%$ to $106 \%$ , the average recovery for each chemotherapeutic agent tested was $9 8 \% - 1 0 4 \%$ . Less than $1 5 \%$ interference for each individual sample tested and less than $10 \%$ average interference for each therapeutic tested was observed in the assay. As a result, testing meets the sponsor’s predetermined acceptance criteria of $10 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recovery of each therapeutic tested. These data support the performance claims of the assay.

# Cross-reactivity from other tumor markers

To evaluate the potential interference from other known tumor markers (such as CA125, CA15-3, CA19-9, CEA, and AFP) in the assay, semi-purified tumor marker solutions were prepared from in-house cultures or obtained from an outside source (CEA and AFP). 100 times, 50 times and 10 times the normal level of the respective tumor marker were added to kit Calibrator A. The target concentrations are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CrossReactant</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100XConcentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50XConcentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10XConcentration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CA 125</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3500 U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1750 U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>350U/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CA15-3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3500U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1750U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>350U/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CA 19-9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3500U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1750 U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>350U/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CEA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1000μg/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500μg/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100μg/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>AFP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>400 μg/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>200 μg/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40 μg/L</td></tr></table>

The samples supplemented with the various tumor markers but lacking added HE4 were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ system analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each sample with the added tumor marker antigen was calculated. The mean results of the replicates are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cross Reactantmarker</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Observed HE4(pmol/L) at 100X</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Observed HE4(pmol/L) at 50X</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Observed HE4(pmol/L) at 10X</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CA 125</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CA 15-3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CA 19-9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CEA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>AFP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr></table>

All individual samples supplemented with the various tumor markers resulted in an HE4 result of $< 1 5 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ (labeling claim for the Limit of Detection). As a result, these data support the performance claims of the assay.

Serum tube type

A study was conducted to evaluate whether commonly used serum collection tubes interfere with the ARCHITECT HE4 assay. Serum samples from 10 healthy volunteers were collected in the following blood collection tube types (BD vacutainer tubes) and tested within eight hours:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Closure</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tube type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Descriptorname</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>With ConventionalStopper</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Red/GrayTop - SSTRed Top Serum(Control)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&quot;SST&quot;&quot;Red Top&quot;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>With HemogardTClosure</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Gold Top SSTRed Top -Serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&quot;Gold&quot;&quot;Red H&quot;</td></tr></table>

Each blood collection tube type for each donor sample was split into 2 aliquots. One aliquot for each of two donor subjects was spiked with HE4 antigen (recombinant) giving 5 different increasingly higher HE4 concentrations. The specimens were not diluted more than $10 \%$ . One (1) aliquot was left un-spiked (neat). The spiked and the non-spiked serum samples for each tube type were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from 2 replicates of each sample tested was compared to the corresponding spike or neat mean concentration for the conventional serum red top tube sample (control).

The range of percent recoveries for each individual sample was between $9 7 \%$ - $10 8 \%$ for non-spiked samples and $9 5 \% - 1 1 3 \%$ for spiked samples. The percent recovery for the mean of all samples was $10 5 \%$ for Red/Gray Top (SST), $101 \%$ for Red Top Hemogard™ (Red H) and $102 \%$ for Gold Top (Gold). The assay meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of $10 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ for individual sample recoveries and $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ for the mean recovery of all samples. Serum collected in serum separator tubes with a conventional or Hemogard closure will not likely cause interference in the assay.

$f .$ Assay cut-off: There is no assay cut-off for monitoring the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer using this marker.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison of HE4 test results for the Architect HE4 assay and the manual HE4 immunoassay was performed with the following objectives:

1. Provide data for method comparison for inclusion in the package insert.   
2. Determine the correlation and agreement of the ARCHITECT HE4 Assay with the HE4 EIA.   
3. Verification of the performance of the quality control (QC) procedures as stated in the proposed ARCHITECT HE4 Package Insert.   
4. Verification of user testing in single replicates

Two sites provided serum specimens for the study. For each site, the minimum number and patient groups were: 60 specimens from apparently healthy females, 60 specimens from women with benign gynecologic disease, and 60 specimens from women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Specimens were obtained from 4 commercial serum vendors. Samples were collected under an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol or considered remnant samples and the IRB concluded that informed consent was not needed. The following inclusion/exclusion criteria were utilized for specimen collection:

Inclusion criteria:

1) Samples must be collected in red top tubes or serum separator tubes (SST)   
2) Sample Information a) Age or Date of Birth b) Gender c) Collection Date d) Menopausal status e) Ethnicity

Exclusion criteria

3) Samples collected in tubes other than red top tubes or SST

4) Stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for more than 3 days or at room temperature for more than 24   
hours   
5) No sample information   
6) ${ > } 5$ Freeze/Thaw Cycles   
7) Obvious microbial contamination

To determine the statistical relationship between the ARCHITECT HE4 Assay and the manual HE4 immunoassay, linear regression, Deming regression, and Passing-Bablok regression analyses were performed at each of the 2 laboratory sites. One site was the manufacturer’s site and 1 external site. A minimum of 180 serum samples were tested at each site. Both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were determined for all comparisons. Ninety-five percent $( 9 5 \% )$ confidence intervals on the regression parameters were calculated. Outliers were evaluated per CLSI EP9-A2.3. Bias plots were generated to assess the agreement between the two assays as per CLSI EP9-A2.3.

The acceptance criteria for samples with HE4 EIA values from 20 to $9 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ are as follows:

a) Passing-Bablok slope: $1 . 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ (i.e., 0.90 to 1.10) b) Correlation Coefficient $\geq 0 . 9 0$

For this study, the sponsor chose to limit one comparison to the common assay range for both assays. The ARCHITECT HE4 assay range is $2 0 - 1 { , } 5 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ and the HE4 EIA assay range is $1 5 - 9 0 0 \mathrm { p M }$ . The common range for the comparison was 20 to $9 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

The ARCHITECT HE4 assay was performed following the instructions for use specified in the proposed package insert. Sample testing was performed on 1 lot of reagents using 1 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ System per site. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study at each site. The kit controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. Sample dilutions for ARCHITECT HE4 values above the range of the assay were diluted using the onboard dilution protocol at a dilution of 1:10.

The manual HE4 immunoassay was run according to the package insert. The samples were tested in 2 replicates at each site. The mean of the 2 replicates was used for the data analyses. Sample dilutions for manual HE4 immunoassay above the range of the assay were diluted manually at a dilution of 1:10 with the exception of 1 sample (EOC74) at the external site which was diluted at dilution of 1:5.

At the sponsor’s testing site, the following samples were included for analysis:

65 samples from apparently healthy females   
65 samples from women with benign gynecologic diseases   
63 samples from women with epithelial ovarian cancer   
193 samples total

Of the 70 subjects with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 7 specimens were excluded from analysis due to HE4 values above $9 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ .

At the external testing site, the following samples were included for analysis:

65 samples from apparently healthy females   
65 samples from women with benign gynecologic diseases

Of the 70 subjects with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 2 specimens were excluded from analysis due to HE4 values above $9 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ and 1 specimen was excluded due to HE4 value below 20 pmol/L.

The patients providing specimens from each site are modestly different. At the external site most normal females were postmenopausal $( 9 2 \% )$ while at the sponsor’s site approximately $50 \%$ were postmenopausal women. At the external site, approximately one-third of women with benign gynecologic disease had diseases other than endometriosis and fibroid disease while at the sponsor’s site all women with benign disease had endometriosis and fibroid disease.

The sponsor compares assay results at each site as well as for all subjects combined. Analysis will concentrate only on combined data from each site.

The racial composition of all study subjects was the following:

All benign disease groups were pooled into a single category.

Of all women, $64 \%$ were post-menopausal and $36 \%$ were pre-menopausal. The median HE4 values by menopausal status are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>HE4 values by Menopausal Status</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Median</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% CI</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>ARCHITECTHE4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Post-Menopausal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>255</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60.40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>53.40 to 66.00</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pre-Menopausal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>145</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42.30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38.80 to45.10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>manual HE4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Post-Menopausal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>255</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60.48</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>56.20 to 65.84</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pre-Menopausal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>145</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>45.86</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42.42 to 50.05</td></tr></table>

Note that the HE4 values for each assay are essentially identical in post-menopausal women. The ARCHITECT HE4 values are lower than the manual HE4 values in premenopausal women. It is not clear if this difference is clinically significant. The median HE4 values by disease group are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=2></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Median</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95% CI</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>ARCHITECTHE4 by Diseasemanual HE4 byDisease</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>benigncancernormal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>130140130</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40.25105.6049.90</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38.20 to 43.7077.50 to 140.2044.40 to 54.10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>benigncancernormal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>130140130</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>44.63112.0551.90</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42.42to 47.2184.65 to 131.1947.60 to 54.72</td></tr></table>

Among cancer and normal subjects, the median HE4 values for each assay (Architect and manual immunoassay) are equivalent. For subjects with benign diseases, the median ARCHITECT HE4 value is lower than the HE4 value using the manual immunoassay. It is not clear if this difference is clinically significant.

The sponsor analyzed for both combined sites different measures of equivalent test results for the Architect HE4 assay and the manual HE4 immunoassay. To assess the bias between assays, the sponsor chose 3 measures of assessment (when selecting the manual HE4 immunoassay concentration range of 20-900 pM). The 3 measures used for this evaluation were:

1. Actual concentration difference (bias) between the 2 assays (defined as bias $=$ ARCHITECT HE4 result – HE4 EIA result),   
2. Percent difference $\%$ bias) between the 2 assays (defined as $\mathrm { \Delta \% b i a s = }$ [(ARCHITECT HE4 result – HE4 EIA result) / HE4 EIA result] $\textbf { x l } 0 0 \%$ ,   
3. Ratio bias between the 2 assays (defined as ratio bias $=$ (ARCHITECT HE4 value) / (HE4 EIA value).

For the concentration range of 20 to $9 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ (manual HE4 assay), the mean difference (bias) in values was determined to be $2 . 2 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the difference 0.1 to 4.3) for 390 subjects. The mean percentage bias relative to the manual assay result was $- 2 . 3 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval from - $3 . 5 \%$ to $- 1 . 1 \%$ ). The ARCHITECT HE4 assay has, on average, a higher value than the manual HE4 assay.

A graphical plot of differences in assay result (Bland-Altman plot) is as follows:

![](images/0dcd0475d387e8860d1b0abb1e4da9268c24071290b0a80131d5b4ff7564060a.jpg)

Based on this plot for HE4 values above $3 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , the ARCHITECT HE4 assay has a proportion of differences greater than $5 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . ARCHITECT HE4 results are more frequently higher than the manual HE4 immunoassay above 300 pmol/L. This difference in HE4 concentration above $3 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ is likely because of HE4 values from ovarian cancer subjects.

The sponsor shows a figure illustrating the relationship between the ARCHITECT HE4 assay values and the HE4 EIA values for the $2 0 { \cdot } 9 0 0 \ \mathrm { p M }$ concentration range as determined by a Passing-Bablok regression analysis. This figure is as follows:

![](images/b32794368cb56a8227e60294d229546f2bdd262ee3ff1730d21583623d16db5b.jpg)

The slope of the best fit line for 390 subjects with manual HE4 immunoassay values between 20 and $9 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ was 1.06 ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval 1.03 to 1.08). The intercept of the best fit line was $- 4 . 4 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ $9 5 \%$ confidence interval -5.5 to $- 3 . 0 )$ . The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.97. The slope result met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a slope between 0.9 and 1.10.

Based on the relationship in the Passing-Bablok regression analysis, the %bias between assay methods is calculated as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>manualHE4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>predictedArchitect HE4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%bias</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>58.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>57.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-2.2%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>102.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>125</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>129.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>150</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>156.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.4%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>175</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>183.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>200</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>210.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.4%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>265.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.1%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>319.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>536.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.3%</td></tr></table>

Note that for values below $1 5 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , the upper limit of the normal range, the $\%$ bias between assays is below $5 \%$ . Above $3 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , the $\%$ bias between assays is $6 . 5 \%$ or slightly above. At HE4 concentrations above $3 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , subjects in the comparison had ovarian cancer. Therefore, it is likely that at $3 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ or higher, a subject would have ovarian cancer and likely would be undergoing serial surveillance monitoring for cancer recurrence or would be receiving therapy. Therefore, the difference is likely not clinically significant.

For the concentration range of ${ > } 2 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ (manual HE4 assay; range of values 20 to ${ \sim } 8 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ ), the mean difference (bias) in values was determined by the sponsor to be $- 4 . 1 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the difference -10.1 to 1.8) for 399 subjects. The mean percentage bias relative to the manual assay result was - $- 2 . 7 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval from $- 3 . 9 \%$ to $\phantom { + } \mathbf { - } 1 . 4 \%$ ). The ARCHITECT HE4 assay has, on average, a lower value than the manual HE4 assay when the manual assay is $> 2 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . A figure is shown illustrating the relationship between the ARCHITECT HE4 assay values and the HE4 EIA values for HE4 values $> 2 0$ $\mathrm { p m o l / L }$ in the manual assay ${ \bf \Pi } _ { \mathrm { n } } = 3 9 9$ ) as determined by a Passing-Bablok regression analysis. The slope of the best fit line with manual HE4 immunoassay values $> 2 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ was 1.04 ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval 1.02 to 1.07). The intercept of the best fit line was $- 3 . 7 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ $9 5 \%$ confidence interval -5.1 to - 2.4). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.97. The slope result met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a slope between 0.9 and 1.10.

The sponsor also sought to show the equivalence of replicates of the same serum sample when tested in the Architect HE4 assay. This was assessed by comparing replicate 1 vs. replicate 2 from the same serum sample on 195 samples less than $1 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The sponsor shows a figure showing the bias between the 1st replicate value and the 2nd replicate value. The overall average bias was $0 . 3 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ Limits of Agreement: $- 9 . 0 \%$ to $9 . 5 \%$ ). The sponsor further indicated the relationship between the 1st replicate value and the 2nd replicate value for the 20 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ concentration range as determined by a Passing-Bablok Regression Analysis. The slope of the best fit line was 1.01 ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval 1.00 to 1.02). The intercept of the line was - $- 0 . 4 5 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval -1.05 to 0.18). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.99. The Passing-Bablok slope and intercept indicate close agreement between replicates since the slope is equivalent with 1.0 and the intercept is equivalent with 0. Thus the results support testing of HE4 serum samples in single replicates.

For all the method comparison studies, the results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

b. Matrix comparison:

No comparison was made with other specimen testing matrices since only human serum is the testing matrix.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

A retrospective clinical study was performed utilizing remnant serial serum samples from 76 subjects diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) after the completion of chemotherapy. The serial serum samples (a minimum of 3 serial draws) were taken from pre- and postmenopausal women 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of EOC who were undergoing serial surveillance

monitoring of cancer progression during clinical follow-up. Subject samples could have been drawn either during therapy, or following the completion of therapy for the treatment of EOC. A clinician assessment was made at each clinical follow-up at which a sample draw from each subject was taken. At each clinical follow-up time, a clinical assessment of each subject at that follow-up time categorized the disease status of subjects into 1 of the following subgroups:

1. No Evidence of Disease – NED: A complete lack of clinical evidence of disease.   
2. Stable Disease: Clinical evidence that the disease has not changed since last assessment.   
3. Progressive Disease: Clinical evidence of growth in the primary tumor or the appearance of new tumors since the last assessment.   
4. Responding Disease: Clinical evidence that there is a shrinking of the primary tumor and no evidence of new tumors

HE4 serum levels for all serum samples were measured at the sponsor’s testing site in single replicates using several kit lots. The assay was performed following the appropriate quality control procedures and manufacturer’s instructions for use specified in the proposed package insert. Sample testing was performed on 1 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ . A single calibration curve was used throughout the study.

For purposes of calculating clinical sensitivity and other performance parameters, the clinical disease status was condensed into 2 categories: progressive disease and non-progressive disease. A percentage change in successive HE4 values $( 1 4 \% )$ was used to categorize the HE4 readings into those that were and were not significantly elevated. The percent change greater than or equal to $14 \%$ categorized an HE4 reading into a positive elevation; while a percent change less than $14 \%$ categorized an HE4 reading into a negative elevation. The two category HE4 test results were cross-tabulated against progression or non-progression in disease.

The clinical sensitivity of the $14 \%$ elevation in HE4 values (from the preceding serum sample) was $5 3 . 5 \%$ (exact binomial $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $4 3 . 2 \%$ to $6 3 . 6 \%$ . Of 99 clinical events categorized as progressive disease, a percent elevation at least $14 \%$ was detected by the assay in 53 events across all subjects. Further details of the study are below.

# $b$ . Clinical specificity:

For the same clinical study summarized in the clinical sensitivity section, the clinical specificity of the $14 \%$ elevation in HE4 values (from the preceding serum sample) was $78 . 5 \%$ (exact binomial $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $7 3 . 7 \%$ to $8 2 . 9 \%$ ). Of 331 clinical events categorized as non-progressive disease, a percent elevation less than $14 \%$ was detected by the assay in 260 events across all subjects. Further details of the study are below.

# c. Other clinical supportive data:

The specific objectives of the study included:

Performance evaluation of ARCHITECT HE4 assay as an aid for monitoring recurrence or progressive disease for patients diagnosed with EOC in a representative patient cohort.   
Performance verification of the quality control procedures as stated in the proposed package insert

# Study design

A retrospective clinical study was performed utilizing remnant serial serum samples from 76 subjects diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) after the completion of chemotherapy. The serial serum samples (a minimum of 3 serial draws) were taken from pre- and postmenopausal women 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of EOC who were undergoing serial surveillance monitoring of cancer progression during clinical follow-up. Subject samples could have been drawn either during therapy or following the completion of therapy for the treatment of EOC. A clinician assessment was made at each clinical follow-up at which a sample draw from each subject was taken. At each clinical follow-up time, a clinical assessment of each subject at that follow-up time categorized the disease status of subjects into 1 of the following subgroups:

1. No Evidence of Disease – NED: A complete lack of clinical evidence of disease.   
2. Stable Disease: Clinical evidence that the disease has not changed since last assessment.   
3. Progressive Disease: Clinical evidence of growth in the primary tumor or the appearance of new tumors since the last assessment.   
4. Responding Disease: Clinical evidence that there is a shrinking of the primary tumor and no evidence of new tumors

HE4 serum levels for all serum samples were measured at the sponsor’s testing site in single replicates using several kit lots. The assay was performed following the appropriate quality control procedures and manufacturer’s instructions for use specified in the proposed package insert. Sample testing was performed on 1 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ . A single calibration curve was used throughout the study.

# Study population

No specific inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed in the clinical study summary. However, subjects were pre- and postmenopausal women 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of EOC. The following inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed in a pre-IDE clinical study outline (I090501) for this study submitted for review:

Inclusion Criteria

• Female, $\tt a g e \geq 1 8$ years   
• Diagnosed with EOC Currently receiving or completed therapy for treatment of EOC A minimum of 3 serial draws available   
• Appropriate clinical data Minimum $0 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$ volume of serum available

Normal appearance of sample Exclusion Criteria • No diagnosis of EOC • Did not undergo therapy for the treatment of EOC • Less than 3 serial draws available • Insufficient sample volume • Multiple freeze-thaw cycles Icteric, lipemic, hemolytic, substantial particulates

These criteria are acceptable and represent the sponsor’s description of the study population. All subjects providing remnant serial serum samples were from a tertiary cancer center through a commercial vendor. Informed consent was noted as obtained utilizing a general Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent form allowing for the subjects’ samples and clinical data to be used for future research purposes. No samples were specifically drawn for this study. The clinical data collected for each subject included the following:

• patient ID   
• date of birth race/ethnicity menopausal status   
• date of EOC diagnosis initial diagnosis method and surgical information (if available)

For each subject sample draw, the following information was collected:

chemotherapeutic treatment information (onset date, end date, regimen) imaging information (date, type, findings) physical exam date and findings • sample draw date Clinical Disease Status additional comments

Sample Size

The sample size was calculated to be approximately 89 subjects with a minimum of 3 draws per subject. The statistical analysis of the sample size was discussed in the clinical study outline (I090501) previously submitted for review.

# Sponsor Statistical Analysis Plan

The object of the trial is to demonstrate that the performance of the ARCHITECT HE4 assay is clinically equivalent to that of the already-cleared HE4 EIA. This will be achieved by verifying the diagnostic performance of the ARCHITECT HE4 assay in differentiating between visits in which patients’ disease status is progressing vs. visits in which the disease is not progressing. The study will be considered successful if the overall concordance is statistically significantly higher than $6 2 . 8 \%$ using a test at the one-sided $2 . 5 \%$ significance level.

Specifically, at each visit, the attending clinician will classify the patient’s status into the 4 categories listed above. These four categories will be reduced to two categories–one class indicating disease progression, and a second class of the above remaining 3 categories indicating lack of disease progression.

The ARCHITECT HE4 will also be categorized into 2 classes. It is anticipated that the total random variability of the assay will be a coefficient of variation of no more than $10 \%$ . If this is the case, the total random variability of the difference between two assays is no more than $14 \%$ corresponding to a difference that was statistically significantly different from zero. Following this categorization, if the assay corresponding to a visit is more than $14 \%$ higher than the assay at the immediately preceding visit, the HE4 will be scored as statistically significantly elevated; otherwise it will be scored as not statistically significantly higher. A $2 \mathbf { x } 2$ cross-tabulation of all follow-up visits will be made.

Diagnostic performance of the ARCHITECT HE4 will be assessed by its positive and negative concordance, and the overall concordance, with clinical progression. ARCHITECT will be considered clinically equivalent in performance to the EIA if its overall concordance is at least $6 2 . 8 \%$ , a figure clinically compatible with that established in the HE4 EIA submission.

Each patient will provide a profile of binary scores for HE4 elevation and clinical progression. These profiles will be analyzed using generalized estimating equation model. The null hypothesis to be tested will be rephrased in terms of the log odds ratio. The target of $6 2 . 8 \%$ concordance corresponds to a log odds ratio of 0.87, and so the analysis will be in terms of a hypothesis test of the log odds ratio.

Writing θ for the log odds ratio for the association between the ARCHITECT HE4 assay and clinical status, this leads to the statistical hypothesis

$\mathrm { H } _ { 0 } \colon \theta \le 0 . 8 7$ which, for success, will have to be rejected in favor of

$$
\mathrm { H } _ { \mathrm { a } } \colon \Theta > 0 . 8 7
$$

Testing will be one-sided at the $2 . 5 \%$ significance level. The $2 \mathbf { x } 2$ cross-tabulation will be used to calculate estimates of the positive, negative and overall concordance. Standard errors and confidence intervals for these quantities will be calculated from the generalized linear model outputs.

# Subject disposition

A total of 525 samples for 80 subjects were initially obtained. Fourteen serum samples from 4 subjects were excluded from analysis because the diagnosis was something other than EOC after further review of the subject’s medical chart. Five samples from 5 subjects were excluded because the disease status was not determined at the time of serum sampling. A total of 506 samples from 76 subjects were used for the analyses.

# Subject Demographics

The mean age of subjects was 54 years old $9 5 \%$ confidence interval from 50.3 to 56.9). The majority of subjects were Caucasian $( 8 4 . 2 \% )$ ; $5 . 3 \%$ were AfricanAmerican. Only 2 $( 2 . 6 \% )$ subjects were premenopausal subjects; the remaining were post-menopausal women. The following table represents the distribution of clinical stages:

There was a total of 506 serum sample draws for the 76 subjects. The mean number of sample draws per subject was 6.7 ranging from 3 to 31 draws. The length of time (in days) over which the subjects were monitored ranged from 36 to 2614 days (median of 368 days). The median interval (in days) between successive visits was 83 ranging from 0 to 1120.

# Statistical analysis

The sponsor calculates the sensitivity and specificity (and their standard errors by jackknife re-sampling) as: Sensitivity $5 3 . 4 \%$ , standard error $4 . 6 \%$ ; Specificity

$78 . 8 \%$ , standard error $1 . 9 \%$ , from which the False positive rate is $2 1 . 2 \%$ , standard error $1 . 9 \%$ .

The difference in sensitivity and the false positive proportion was $3 2 . 2 \%$ $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the difference $2 2 . 4 \%$ to $4 2 . 0 \%$ ). The difference in sensitivity and specificity is significantly greater than zero. The difference in specificity and 1-specificity in this analysis are equivalent. Therefore, the assay is informative with respect to progression/non-progression status.

The sponsor examines the total concordance of progression/non-progression status vs. $\%$ change in HE4 values to test the stated null hypothesis. The sponsor frames the hypothesis by converting the hypothesis into the logarithm of the odds ratio for the $2 \times 2$ table. A generalized linear model with a logistic link and autoregressive error structure was created. The $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for the log odds associated with elevated HE4 was determined to be 0.68 to 1.31 (mean 0.991). A test of the null hypothesis of the logarithm of the odds ratio was significant and the sponsor concludes that the overall percent concordance being less than or equal to $6 2 . 8 \%$ was rejected in favor of the hypothesis that the percent concordance exceeds $6 2 . 8 \%$ . Simple examination of the lower $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the estimated overall agreement in the table above indicates that the total agreement exceeds $6 2 . 8 \%$ (lower limit $6 8 . 3 \%$ with mean concordance $7 2 . 8 \%$ ). Thus the null hypothesis can be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of total agreement greater than $6 2 . 8 \%$ .

The sponsor shows a receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis of the percent change in HE4. The sponsor found that the area under the ROC curve was 0.685 with standard error 0.033; this area is statistically significantly better than the non-association area of 0.5. Analysis of the area and $9 5 \%$ confidence interval was very similar (are $_ { 1 } = 0 . 6 8 4$ ; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval 0.618 to 0.750). The ROC curve is as follows:

The sponsor summarizes the analysis and suggests a series of $\%$ change in HE4 cutoff values with associated sensitivity and specificity performance values. The following table indicates analysis at different cutoff values for $\%$ change in HE4:

Note that for increasing $\%$ change in HE4 cutoff values, the sensitivity decreases and the specificity increases. There is currently no accepted $\%$ change in HE4 value that clinicians have decided is optimal for use. The labeling will present a similar table of differing sensitivity and specificity values at different $\%$ change in HE4 values so clinicians can choose a value that reflects their own preferences in sensitivity or specificity.

The following table shows the median (and $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ and $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ quartile values) $\%$ change in HE4 for each clinical disease state.

The sponsor makes the following conclusions on the median values:

The NED and Stable subjects have very similar summary statistics,   
Over $7 5 \%$ of visits in which the subject was responding to treatment, showed a decrease in HE4,   
Nearly $7 5 \%$ of the subjects showing disease progression had an increase in   
HE4.

It should also be noted that subjects with both NED and stable disease had a median $\%$ change in HE4 equivalent with $0 \%$ change (since the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the median includes $0 \%$ ). Subjects with no evidence of disease (NED) had a $\%$ change in HE4 between $- 1 1 . 7 \%$ in the first quartile and $1 1 . 3 \%$ in the third quartile. This indicates that for $7 5 \%$ of subjects with NED, the $\%$ change in HE4 is less than $\pm 1 4 \%$ and this change in HE4 will not be informative. Subjects with responding disease had a median $\%$ change that was significantly below $0 \%$ change $9 5 \%$ confidence interval does not include 0). Subjects with progression had a median $\%$ change significantly above $0 \%$ change (confidence interval does not include 0). This indicates that the median $\%$ change for subjects with progression, responsive disease, and stable disease categories are related to the disease state of the subject. This difference in median $\%$ change can be generalized to a $3 \times 3$ table of subject counts for all visits where the HE4 concentration is above $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HE4 &gt; 140 pM</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>Disease status</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>responsive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>stable</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Progression</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt; -14%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-14% ≤x≤ 14%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>32</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt; 14%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>57</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>17</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>59</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>114</td></tr></table>

The association of a percent change in HE4 in the 3 assay categories shown with disease status is significant $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { p } } < 0 . 0 0 1$ , Chi square test). The following indicates the sensitivity and specificity of the $\%$ change in HE4 for each disease status:

<table><tr><td colspan="3">Se respondin =</td><td rowspan="2">Sensitivity (1-Specificity) = 43.4% From 18.9%</td><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">To 67.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Sp responding = </td><td>58.8% 84.5%</td><td>± 0.119 ±0.037</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td rowspan="2">Sensitivity </td><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>28.9%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Se stable = Sp stable =</td><td>72.4%</td><td>± 0.074 ± 0.051</td><td>(1-Specificity) = 1.3%</td><td></td><td>From -16.3% To 18.9%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sensitivity -</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Se progression =</td><td>64.4%</td><td>± 0.062</td><td>(1-Specificity) = 29.9% From 12.3%</td><td></td><td></td><td>To 47.4%</td></tr></table>

The informativeness of a decreasing HE4 $( < - 1 4 \%$ while HE4 concentration remains above $1 4 0 \mathrm { p M } )$ for responding disease status is significant since the difference in sensitivity minus 1-specificity is greater than 0 $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the difference from $1 8 . 9 \%$ to $6 7 . 8 \%$ ). The informativeness of an increasing HE4 $( > 1 4 \%$ while HE4 concentration remains above $1 4 0 \ \mathrm { p M } $ ) for progressive disease is significant since the difference in sensitivity minus 1- specificity is greater than 0 ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the difference from $12 . 3 \%$ to $4 7 . 4 \%$ ).

Since $7 5 \%$ of subjects with NED had a $\%$ change in HE4 between $- 1 4 \%$ and $14 \%$ , this percent change in HE4 is not informative. However, a different type of cutoff may be informative in subjects with NED vs subjects without NED (i.e. active disease; progression, stable disease, or responding disease statuses). The median HE4 concentration of subjects with no evidence of disease was $4 9 . 7 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . This median concentration is significantly lower than the median HE4 concentrations of subjects with progressive, stable, or responding disease. Of 183 events where the disease state was categorized as NED, 129 NED events $( 7 0 . 5 \% )$ had HE4 concentrations less than the overall median HE4 concentration of ${ 7 1 . 4 } \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ for all 4 disease states. The median HE4 concentration and the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the median for the 4 disease states are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ClinicalDisease Status</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No. ofevents</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MedianHE4(pmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lower95% CI</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Upper95% CI</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NED</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>183</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>49.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>45.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>53.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Progression</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>99</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>208.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>139.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>398.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Responding</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>61</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>75.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>63.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>104.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Stable</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>87</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>89.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>68.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>177.4</td></tr></table>

The sponsor also notes that comparison of the NED subjects with the active subjects shows that the HE4 level itself differs substantially between the 4 groups, and so may be used within the cancer subject group to differentiate NED from active cancer subjects. A ROC analysis by the sponsor of the Active and NED groups was carried out and showed that the maximum of the sum of sensitivity and specificity occurred if an HE4 level of 140 pmol/L was used to differentiate between the 2 groups.

Since subjects with NED may have low HE4 concentrations, a cutoff of 140 pmol/L HE4 (the upper limit of normal HE4 values) was selected to categorize subjects with and without elevation in HE4. Comparison of these 2 categories with disease status NED or not NED results in the following $2 \times 2$ table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NED</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>not NED</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HE4 ≤ 140</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>179</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>133</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>312</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HE4 &gt; 140</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>114</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>118</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>183</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>247</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>430</td></tr></table>

The sensitivity of HE4 values less than $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ was $9 7 . 8 \%$ . This indicates that $9 8 \%$ of subjects with no evidence of disease will have HE4 concentrations less than $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The specificity of HE4 values at $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ is $4 6 . 2 \%$ . For subjects without NED, $4 6 . 2 \%$ will have HE4 values greater than $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ . The informativeness of HE4 concentrations for subjects with or without NED is statistically significant. Note that of 247 events where the disease state was categorized as not NED, 133 events $( 5 3 . 8 \% )$ had HE4 concentration less than 140 pmol/L. This reflects the proportion of events with a “false positive” result (i.e. $\mathrm { H E } 4 \le 1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { p m o l / L } )$ . The proportion of NED events when the HE4 concentration is less than or equal to $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ was $5 7 . 4 \%$ (179 of 312).

A table of the performance for distinguishing between NED and active disease for some other HE4 cutoffs is as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HE4cutoff</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sensitivity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Specificity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>48%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>88%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>75</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>74%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>66%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>86%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>57%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>125</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>52%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>140</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>98%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>49%</td></tr></table>

The implication from the table is that clinicians may choose a lower HE4 concentration. As a result, the sensitivity will decrease while the specificity will increase. Since there is no clinically accepted HE4 concentration for subjects with no evidence of disease, the clinician may choose from this range of HE4 in order to choose the sensitivity or specificity important to the evaluation of subjects in their care.

The following table combines all subject visits for all disease states and HE4 cutoff values;

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=4>NED     responding</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>stable    progression</td><td rowspan=3 colspan=1>total312</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>HE4 ≤ 140</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>179</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>44</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>49</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>40</td><td rowspan=6 colspan=1>312253261430</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td rowspan=3 colspan=1>HE4 &gt; 140</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;-14%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-14%≤x≤ 14%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt; 14%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=5>total                    183          61           87          99</td></tr></table>

Note from the table that at the majority of subject visits, the HE4 concentration was less than $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , though the 4 disease states were present. Of the 312 subject visits where the HE4 value was less than $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , 179 visits occurred where the clinical state of the subject was NED $( 5 7 . 4 \%$ ; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval based on positive likelihood ratio $5 4 . 5 \%$ to $6 0 . 2 \%$ ). Of 61 subject visits where the %change in HE4 was greater than $14 \%$ and the HE4 concentration remained above $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , 38 visits occurred where the clinical statue of the subject was progression $( 6 2 . 3 \%$ ; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval based on the positive likelihood ratio from $5 0 . 9 \%$ to $7 2 . 5 \%$ ). The association of disease states and changes in HE4 of elevation above or below $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l } / 1$ was significantly more than random association. Thus in the above table the HE4 result (both as a $\%$ change or elevation above 140 pmol/L) is statistically associated with disease states.

The sponsor makes the following conclusions regarding the clinical study:

1. The primary endpoint of the trial was to demonstrate that clinical disease progression is associated with an increase in HE4 from the preceding visit of at least $14 \%$ . The study found that a total concordance probability of at least $6 2 . 8 \%$ demonstrate that an increase in HE4 of at least $14 \%$ is significantly associated with clinical cancer progression, the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for the total concordance being $6 8 . 9 \%$ to $7 6 . 7 \%$ . Clinicians may wish to use other cutoffs to reflect their preferences in the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity; a table of the impact of different cutoffs is given.

2. The HE4 concentration itself provides an indication of whether disease is still present compared to when no evidence of disease is clinically apparent. Nearly all $( 9 8 \% )$ of the subjects with no evidence of disease had HE4 levels below $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ , as opposed to $51 \%$ of those with active disease manifestations. From this analysis, $54 \%$ of subjects without NED (133/247) had HE4 concentration below 140 pmol/l.

The clinical study supports the claimed indication for use of the HE4 assay.

# 4. Clinical cut-off:

There is currently no clinically accepted cut-off for use in monitoring cancer progression in epithelial ovarian cancer subjects with this assay. A cut-off for use in this situation could be a percentage change from a previously determined value and would be expected to correlate with the clinical state at the time of assay and clinical evaluation. The labeling contains various percentage changes in HE4 from a previous value as determined in the clinical study. The assay performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) at each cut-off are indicated for use in a serial surveillance monitoring situation where clinical outcome is categorized as cancer progression/non-progression.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A total of 1626 samples were tested from which results were used to determine the distribution of the ARCHITECT HE4 concentration values in various benign and malignant conditions as well as in apparently healthy women. Apparently healthy women were used to establish the normal and reference ranges for the ARCHITECT HE4 assay. The study was performed on single-point human serum samples obtained from commercial vendors, specimen banks or leftover specimens from a previous sponsor study. These samples were collected under an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol or considered remnant samples and the IRB concluded that informed consent was not needed. The following information was collected when the specimen was obtained:

• Age or Date of Birth   
• Gender   
• Collection Date Menopausal status Ethnicity

Samples were not collected when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for more than 3 days or at room temperature for more than 24 hours; when there was no sample information; when ${ > } 5$

Freeze/Thaw Cycles had been undergone; when obvious microbial contamination was present.

HE4 serum levels were measured in single replicates following the appropriate quality control procedures and manufacturer’s instructions for use specified in the proposed package insert. Sample testing was performed on 1 lot of reagents using 4 ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ Systems. One calibration curve on each instrument was used. The HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. Sample dilutions for HE4 values above the range of the assay were diluted using the on-board instrument dilution protocol at a dilution of 1:10.

The following summarizes the samples tested:   
400 apparently healthy females   
519 women with benign gynecologic diseases   
314 women with epithelial ovarian cancer   
49 women with other benign diseases   
50 women with endometrial cancer   
50 women with bladder cancer   
50 women with gastrointestinal cancer   
50 women with breast cancer   
50 women with lung cancer   
44 women with Congestive Heart Failure   
50 pregnant women   
1626 samples total   
A summary of the specific diagnosis for the “Benign Gynecological Diseases” and

The “Other Benign Gynecological Diseases” category included a total of 80 subjects with the following conditions: abscess (3), adhesions (2), Brenner tumor (2), Candida (1), Chlamydia (9), cervical dysplasia (1), cystic mesothelioma (1), fibrocystic breast (2), HPV (6), hydrosalpinx (7), leiomyomas (10), myomas (6), pelvic inflammatory disease (1), polycystic ovaries (27), and salpingitis (2).

Apparently healthy women were ${ \sim } 9 5 \%$ Caucasian and $50 \%$ premenopausal with a mean age of 49 years (range 14 – 93 years). To determine the upper limit of the normal range for the HE4 assay, calculations of the 95th and 97.5th percentiles were performed for the overall set of apparently healthy females in the study as well as by menopausal status. The pre- and postmenopausal HE4 normal value cutoffs were chosen based on the 95th and 97.5th percentile of the population tested. The sponsor recommends that each laboratory establish its own reference value for the population of interest. The summary values are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cohort</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SampleSize</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>95thPercentile</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>97.5thPercentile</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Apparently HealthyFemales</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>400</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>98.2 pmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>145.2 pmol/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Premenopausal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>210</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>65.3 pmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90.6 pmol/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Postmenopausal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>190</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>125.9 pmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>163.0 pmol/L</td></tr></table>

The sponsor has chosen $7 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ as the upper limit of normal for pre-menopausal women and $1 4 0 \mathrm { p m o l / L }$ for post menopausal women. The data are accurate and appropriate.
