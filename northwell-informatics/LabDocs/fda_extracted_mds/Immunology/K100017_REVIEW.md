# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None.

# L. Test Principle:

Patient samples are diluted 1:10 in PBS-Tween. $2 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each diluted patient sample are added to each reaction field of the reagent tray. Reactions are started by fitting the BIOCHIP slides containing the substrates (glutamate receptor type NMDA transfected cells and non-transfected cells) into the corresponding recesses of the reagent tray and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Specific antibodies attach to the antigens. After incubation the BIOCHIP slides are washed with PBS-Tween to remove unbound antibodies. In the meantime, $2 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of fluorescein–labeled anti–human IgG are added to each reaction field of a clean reagent tray and the BIOCHIP slides placed into the recesses of the tray. After a 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, the BIOCHIP slides are again washed with PBS-Tween to remove any unbound fluorescein-labeled reagent. $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of embedding medium are placed for each reaction field on a cover glass and the BIOCHIP slides, with the BIOCHIPs facing downwards, placed onto the prepared cover glass.

Fluorescence is read with a fluorescence microscope.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

The analytical performance of the assay was assessed using a fluorescence intensity level scale which measures the intensity of the specific fluorescence expressed as a numeric value. These values can vary from $^ { \circ } 0 ^ { \circ }$ (no specific fluorescence) to $\boldsymbol { ^ { \circ } 5 } ^ { \circ }$ (extremely strong specific fluorescence). The evaluation of the fluorescence intensity is performed according to the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intensity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Evaluation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>no specific fluorescence</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>positive reaction, very weak specific reaction visible</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>positive reaction, weak specific reaction visible</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>positive reaction, specific reaction well visible</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>positive reaction, strong specific reaction visible</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>positive reaction, very strong specific reaction visible</td></tr></table>

The samples used in the analytical and clinical studies were coded. Serological results, clinical and patient data were not known to the technician when performing the tests.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Intra-assay reproducibility was performed by 10-fold repeated measurements of 6 characterized positive and negative serum samples (at fluorescence intensity levels of 0, 1, 2, and 3). The variation in fluorescence intensity was within $\pm 1$ intensity level unit for type NMDA glutamate receptor antigen.

Inter-assay reproducibility was performed by repeated measurements of 6 characterized positive and negative samples (fluorescence intensity levels of 0, 2, and 3) at five different times (2 measurements per run). The variation in fluorescence intensity was within $\pm 1$ intensity level unit type NMDA glutamate receptor antigen.

In a second inter-assay reproducibility study, four samples with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) antibodies near the cut-off (1-2 fluorescence intensity units) were tested at five different times (2 measurements per run). Each result was read by three different technicians independently. The variation in fluorescence intensity was within $\pm 1$ intensity level unit for type NMDA glutamate receptor antigen.

Lot-to-lot reproducibility was determined by measurement of 3 characterized positive and negative serum samples (fluorescence intensity levels of 0, 3, and 4) with three different kit lots. The variation in fluorescence intensity was within $\pm 1$ intensity level unit for type NMDA glutamate receptor antigen.

In a second lot-to-lot reproducibility study, four samples with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) antibodies near the cut-off (1-2 fluorescence intensity units) were tested (in duplicate) using three different lots. Each result was read by three different technicians independently. The variation in fluorescence intensity was within $\pm 1$ intensity level unit type NMDA glutamate receptor antigen.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

$c$ . Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): There is no recognized standard or reference material for autoantibodies against glutamate receptor (type NMDA).

# Kit stability:

Accelerated stability studies were performed by storing three different kit lots at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ for 14 days. The kits stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ were used as a reference. The kits were tested using both positive and negative samples. The results showed that the kits were stable for 14 days at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , which translates into 2 years of stability at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ (Deshpande SS (1996) Enzyme Immunoassays from Concept to Product Development, Chapman and Hall, International Thomson Publishing, New York, page 388).

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity:

# Interference:

Three different samples (one negative, one weakly positive, and one positive) were spiked with hemoglobin (up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , triglycerides (up to 2000 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ), and bilirubin (up to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). The deviation in fluorescence intensity due to these spiked samples did not exceed $\pm 1$ fluorescence intensity level unit for rat hippocampus, rat cerebellum, and type NMDA glutamate receptor antigens.

# Cross-reactivity:

To investigate the extent of cross-reactivity of the anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) assay kit, the following patient samples were tested: 9 autoimmune encephalitis, 15 infectious encephalitis, 3 anti-VGKC autoimmune encephalitis, 2 anti-Ma2 autoimmune encephalitis, and one each anti-GluR2, anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis, anti-zic4 cerebellar

degeneration, and anti-recoverin retinopathy. None of these samples exhibited characteristic reactivity against anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA). Some nonspecific fluorescent staining against rat cerebellum and hippocampus was observed with anti-VGKC, anti-GluR2, and anti-zic4 samples.

f. Assay cut-off:

Cut-off was determined using 17 clinically characterized serum samples from patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) autoimmune encephalitis. All samples were found positive at a titer of 1:10 or at higher dilutions. 200 blood samples from healthy blood donors were all found to be negative.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

The diagnostic criteria for anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis included encephalitic signs with psychiatric symptoms (agitation, paranoid thoughts, irritability, or hallucinations), seizures, CSF inflammation, and exclusion of viral/bacterial etiology.

Study 1: 47 serum samples from the US from patients diagnosed with antigluatamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis and controls with other encephalopathies, including anti-VGKC and AMPA receptor encephalitis, were examined. The panel comprised samples from 7 men and 40 women with an average age of 17 years (age range: 5 to 42 years; 1 unknown). In addition, sera of 100 adult healthy blood donors of mixed age and sex from Germany were analyzed. All samples from patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis (29 sera) were tested positive with the transfected cells, while all disease control samples (18 sera) and healthy blood donors (100 sera) were negative.

Study 2: In a retrospective study, 2990 patients were screened for clinical symptoms of encephalitis of unknown origin. 5 of 6 samples fulfilling the criteria (6 women with an average age of 23 years, age range: 18 to 31 years; origin: Germany) were found positive for antibodies against glutamate receptor (type NMDA). The results support the fact that anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis is a very frequent cause among these patients.

Study 3: 8 samples from patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis (origin: Germany) were investigated. The panel comprised samples from 3 men and 5 women with an average age of 25 years (age range: 16 to 39 years). All samples were found positive for anti-glutamate receptor (tpye NMDA).

Study 4: 9 samples from patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis and 13 samples from patients with other encephalopathies (origin: Italy) were investigated. The panel comprised samples from 8 men and 14 women with an average age of 47 years (age range: 9 to 89 years). All

samples from patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis (9 sera) were tested positive with the transfected cells, while all disease control samples (13 sera) were negative.
