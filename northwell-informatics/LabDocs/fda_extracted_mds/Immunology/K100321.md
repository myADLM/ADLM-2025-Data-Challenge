# G.Device Description:

The LOCI CA $1 2 5 | | ^ { \mathrm { \Delta t w } }$ method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI® technology. The $\underset { . } { \dot { \underbrace { \mathbf { \rho } } } } \odot \mathsf { C l } \odot$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-CA 125 monoclonal antibody (M11) fragment. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody (0C 125) and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The use of the M11 antibody in combination with OC 125 defines this method as a second generation CA 125 assay. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-CA 125-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathsf { n m }$ and is a direct function of the CA 125 concentration in the sample.

The kit consists of ten vials, two vials per level (A-E), $2 . 0 m L$ per vial. Description of the manufacturing, value assignment and stability testing process are provided in this submission report.

# H. Intended Use:

The LOCI CA $1 2 5 \ : | | \cdots |$ method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of CA 125 antigen in human serum and lithium heparin and EDTA plasma on the Dimension Vista $\otimes$ System. Measurements of CA 125 are used as an aid in monitoring disease progress or response to therapy or for theruent  ile r patnts wiepithealvaran Serl testg  patin A 125 assay values should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer. It is recommended that the LOCl CA 125 Il method be used in conjunction with signs and symptoms of a clinical evaluation by a physician trained and experienced in the management of gynecological cancers. This assay is not intended for screening or diagnosis of ovarian cancer or for use on any other system.

The LOCI 6 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) and Cancer Antigen1251l (CA125) methods on the Dimension Vista® system.

# I. Substantial Equivalence Information:

The LOCI CA 1251l ™M method is substantially equivalent to other CA125 test systems such as the ADVIA Centaur CA125ll assay (k020828). The LOCl 6 calibrator is substantialy equivalent to other calibrators such as the L0Cl 5 calibrator (k071597 and k071603).
