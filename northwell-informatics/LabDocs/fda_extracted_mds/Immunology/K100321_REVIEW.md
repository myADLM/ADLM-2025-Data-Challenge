# L. Test Principle:

The LOCI CA $1 2 5 \ : \mathrm { I I I M }$ method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-CA 125 monoclonal antibody (M11) fragment. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-CA 125 monoclonal antibody (OC 125) and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The use of the M11 antibody in combination with OC 125 defines this method as a second generation CA 125 assay. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-CA 125-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the

CA 125 concentration in the sample when measured against a calibration curve.

The Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LOCI 6 Calibrator (KC604) is a multi-analyte frozen liquid product packaged as two vials for each of five levels. The matrix is $6 \%$ bovine albumin with buffer and preservatives. The calibrator level A is zero, while levels B to E contain purified CA 125 antigen. Measuring these values on the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ allows for a calibration curve to be established. Patients CA 125 measurements are then compared to the calibration curve to determine serum or plasma CA 125 concentrations.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: i) Assay Precision testing for the LOCI CA 125 method was performed over twenty days according to CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2. Data from 2 Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ lots, 2 calibrator lots and 2 Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 1500 model instruments are included. The test samples consisted of three levels of Bio-Rad Liquichek Tumor Marker control, three serum pools and one to two plasma pools depending on the study. Two of the serum samples and one of the plasma pools (Lithium heparin) were spiked with CA 125 antigen. On each day of testing, each sample was run in duplicate, in two separate runs $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ). The duplicates were run with two separate sample cups. One site used instrument 238, reagent lot09268AE, calibrator lot 9ED083, and QC lot 19830. The second site used instrument 190, reagent lot 09196AD, calibrator lot 9DD099, and QC lot 19830.

The range of samples tested encompassed the analytical measuring range. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP5-A2. This experiment allowed a determination of within-run precision (repeatability), within-day, between days, between runs (within lab) precision for each site and a determination of between site precision.

# ii) Calibrator:

Precision testing for the CA 125 calibrators was performed over twenty days according to CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2. Data from 3 calibrator lots, 2 replicate samples, over 20 days, on 3 Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 1500 model instruments. The test samples consisted of three levels of Bio-Rad Liquichek Tumor Marker control, three serum pools and two plasma pools depending on the study. One of the serum samples and one of the plasma pools (Lithium heparin) were spiked with CA 125 antigen. On each day of testing, each sample was run in duplicate, on three instruments, calibrated from 3 different calibrator lots $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 3 6 0$ ). The duplicates were run with two separate sample cups. This experiment used instruments Vista 145, 190, and 238; calibrator lots 9HD098, 9DD099, 9ED083; and reagent lot09196AD.

The range of samples tested encompassed the analytical measuring range. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP5-A2. This experiment allowed a determination of within-run precision (repeatability), within-day, between days, between runs (within lab) precision for each site and a determination of between site precision.

Data was collected for twenty days, one run per day, two replicates per run, on three separate instruments, using three different calibrator lots on each instrument.

The data was merged to form one data set for analysis and a variance component analysis using the REML method was performed.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

i) The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP06-A. Based on the results of this testing and that from the Limit of Detection Study, the analytical measuring range was established in three matrices: serum, Lithium Heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma.

A low-end linearity studies were performed by diluting mid-level patient samples with water in varying proportions covering the range from $1 { - } 2 8 0 . 8 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ . Dimension Vista Flex assay data correlated with expected sample concentration according to the linear regression formula $( \mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 4 9 4 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 5 5 0 8$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 1$ ).

b. Lithium Heparin Plasma

A study covering the whole assay range was performed using two natural serum samples. One sample with a low CA 125 concentration $( 3 . 2 \mathrm { U / m L } )$ and one with a high CA 125 concentration $( 1 5 7 8 . 5 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L } )$ ), were mixed in varying proportions distributed over the measurement range. Samples were measured in triplicate. When data was limited to plus or minus $30 \%$ of the measuring range, as per CLSI guidelines, Dimension Vista Flex assay data correlated with expected sample

concentration according to the weighted linear regression formula $( \mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 $ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 1 . 0 \bar { 0 }$ ).

c. EDTA Plasma

A study covering the whole assay range was performed using two natural EDTA plasma pools. One sample with a low CA 125 concentration $( 7 . 1 ~ \mathrm { U / m L } )$ and a separate sample spike with CA 125 antigen to a high concentration $1 5 6 2 . 8 \mathrm { U / m L }$ ), were mixed in varying proportions distributed over the measurement range. Samples were measured in triplicate. When data was limited to plus or minus $30 \%$ of the measuring range, as per CLSI guidelines, Dimension Vista Flex assay data correlated with expected sample concentration according to the weighted linear regression formula $\mathrm { ( y = 1 . 0 0 x - 0 . 1 _ { \cdot } }$ $\operatorname { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9$ ).

ii) Spiking and Dilutional Recovery was evaluated.

a. Spiking Recovery Known amounts of CA 125, approximately 35, 70, 140, 560 and 840 $\mathrm { U / m L }$ , were added to serum samples with baseline CA 125 values of $5 . 4 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ or $4 4 . 4 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ ) and to plasma samples with a baseline CA 125 value of $1 6 . 7 \mathrm { U / m L }$ . The CA 125 concentrations were measured and the percent recovery ranged from $7 7 . 9 - 1 0 4 \%$ for serum and 89.2- $1 0 0 . 7 \%$ for EDTA plasma.

iii) High Dose Hook effect

Specimens were prepared by spiking normal human serum with CA 125 antigen from 1233 to $6 6 5 { , } 6 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ . The samples represented a large measurement range and all were above the claimed measurement range. The specimens were tested with one lot each of Flex reagents on two different Vista instruments. No hook effect was observed for CA 125 concentrations up to $6 5 6 { , } 6 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i) Traceability There is no recognized standard for CA 125   
ii) Calibrator Manufacturing Description The Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LOCI 6 Calibrator (KC604) is a multi-analyte frozen liquid product packaged as two vials for each of five levels. The matrix is $6 \%$ bovine albumin with buffer and preservatives. There are five levels (A-E) with target values for CA 125 of 0, 25, 100, 500 and 1050 $\mathrm { U / m L }$ .

a. Value Assignment

An anchor pool of CA 125 is made from highly purified, cell culture derived CA 125 material. Value is assigned to the Anchor pool by comparing it to patient samples assayed by the predicate device. The anchor pool is then diluted into a series of 5 Master pools whose values are determined on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Vista System. The Master pool materials are then aliquoted into the commercial product whose values are confirmed on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Vista System. The five-level calibrators are then used to calibrate the CA 125II method. b. Stability Frozen liquid calibrator stability is 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored unopened at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Thawed liquid calibrator stability is 30 days when stored unopened at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once the vial stopper is punctured, the assigned calibrator values are stable for 30 days on board the Dimension Vista System. LOCI 7 calibrators should not be used on board the instrument once the cap is removed. One lot of control calibrator (reference material stored at $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and three production lots of calibrator were tested. The acceptance criterion was $< 5 \%$ deviation from reference concentration for levels B-E iii) Kit Stability Refer to carton for expiration date of individual unopened reagent cartridges. Sealed wells on the instrument are stable for 30 days. Once opened, reagents are stable for 7 days on-board the instrument. Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real time stability data on file at Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. LOCI CA125II assay cartridges are stable for 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Limits of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were determined using 2 kit lots on 2 instruments (one per lot) using CLSI protocol EP17-A.

i) Serum: Five low CA 125 serum samples were tested using two lots of LOCI CA 125 reagents on two Vista instruments. Tested CA 125 values in Blank serum samples ranged from approximately -1.260 to $- 0 . 3 6 5 \mathrm { U / m L }$ with standard deviation (SD) of 239. Samples ranging from 0.710 to $4 . 5 0 7 \ : \mathrm { U / m L }$ were used to estimate LoD.   
ii) Plasma: Three low CA 125 Lithium Heparin Plasma samples or three EDTA plasma samples were tested using two lots of LOCI CA 125 reagents on two Vista instruments. Tested CA 125 values in Blank plasma samples ranged from approximately -1.3 to $- 0 . 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ with SD of 0.302. Lithium Heparin plasma samples ranging from -0.9 to $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { U / m L }$ with $\mathrm { S D } { = } 0 . 5 9 0$ or EDTA plasma samples ranging from -0.6 to $3 . 6 \ : \mathrm { U / m L }$ with $\mathrm { S D } { = } 0 . 5 7 8$ were used to estimate LoD.   
iii) Acceptance criteria for the LoB, LoD, and Limit of quantitation (LoQ), were described as follows: LoB – highest measurement result which has a $9 5 \%$ probability to be observed for a blank sample. It is the $9 5 \mathrm { t h }$ percentile of a blank distribution. Where Blank values are negative, this is estimated as

$1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ SD of blank values. The data generated here give the highest value of $\operatorname { L o B } \mathrm { = 1 } . 6 4 5 \mathrm { x } \ 0 . 3 0 2 \mathrm { = } 0 . 4 9 7$ which was rounded to LoB $_ { : = 0 . 5 }$ $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ .

LoD – lowest amount of analyte that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability, though not quantified at an exact value. Lo $\scriptstyle \mathrm { \mathrm { ~ \Longrightarrow ~ } } \mathrm { L o B ^ { + } }$ SD x $\mathrm { C _ { \beta } }$ or $0 . 5 +$ $0 . 5 9 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 . 6 5 3 { = } 1 . 4 7 5$ which was rounded to $\mathrm { L o D } { = } 1 . 5 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ .

LoQ – lowest actual amount of analyte that can be reliably detected and at which total error meets lab requirements for accuracy. LoQ was not claimed for the Dimension Vista CA 125 assay.

The results are noted to support a claim for LoB and LoD of less than $1 . 5 \ : \mathrm { U / m L }$ . Therefore, the lowest value for the range of the assay is $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ , based upon Lithium Heparin data.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2 to determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CA 125 assays. For all interferents the percent bias was determined by testing a control serum sample without the interferent and comparing it to the value obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent had been added.

Testing was performed with one lot of Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagents. Hemolytic and icteric interference was tested with two lots of Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagents.

i) Endogenous Substance Interference Testing was performed at two CA 125 concentrations: $4 5 \pm 5 \mathrm { \ : U / m L }$ and $9 7 0 \pm 5 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ $4 5 \pm 5$ and $5 0 0 { - } 1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ for Lipemia, Hemoglobin and Bilirubin testing).

Hemoglobin, triglyceride, bilirubin: The CA 125 method was evaluated for interference according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2.25. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference.

Nine additional endogenous substances include serum proteins were also

tested with bias $< 1 0 \%$ .

ii) Exogenous Substance Interference 61 additional endogenous and exogenous substances were tested for interference including common over-the-counter drugs and cancer drugs. All recorded biases were less than the $10 \%$ acceptance criteria.   
iii) HAMA interference A number of optimized concentrations of HAMA blockers are employed in the reaction, as well as reagents designed to minimize non-specific binding (NSB) interference. Interference from HAMA was evaluated by testing commercially available sera (three replicates) containing up to $3 2 7 . 1 \mathrm { \ m g / m L }$ HAMA. All of the CA 125 results from the 10 samples evaluated were within $10 \%$ of control values or showed ${ < } 1 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ difference from control.

f. Assay cut-off:

The sponsor defined $a \ge 7 0 . 1 \%$ percentage change in CA 125 values as significant. This significant change is the calculated Reference Change Value for the assay. This is a statistical calculation that considers the analytical imprecision of the CA 125 assay on the Dimension Vista instrument as well as the intra-individual biological variation noted for CA 125 levels in a study of healthy females determined by reference. The sponsor chose this value to ensure that the change in CA 125 value is not attributed to assay variation or normal variation. The RCV value also considers a z value for significant change (p,0.05), so that assay results that change by RCV should be within the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval.

The RCV was derived by taking into account the published biological variation and total imprecision for the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LOCI CA 125 assay. In determining the RCV, the analytical variation used was $5 . 2 \%$ (which is the reported total variability (Within laboratory Total $\% \mathrm { C V }$ at $1 1 . 2 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ ). The within-subject biological variation $( 2 4 . 7 \% )$ was obtained from the literature. The RCV for the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LOCI CA 125 method was calculated to be $7 0 . 1 \%$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: One serum sample randomly chosen from each of the 75 women with cervical cancer who were tested for the monitoring of their disease status were combined with 77 excess de-identified serum samples containing measureable CA 125. Each sample was assayed for the observed values (154 samples) using the Dimension Vista $^ { \textregistered }$ CA 125 (Y) assay and compared with the expected values using the ADVIA Centaur® CA 125 (X). Because the Advia device has a different measuring range than the Vista, the results limited to the measuring range of both devices (139 samples) are presented below (Passing & Bablock). The equation represents the relationship between the two techniques. $\mathrm { n } = 1 3 9$ $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 9 \mathrm { X } + 2 . 1 5 \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 4 4 7 8$ $9 5 \%$ Confidence interval for the intercept: -0.62 to 2.89 $9 5 \%$ Confidence interval for the slope: 1.06 to 1.13

Range of samples:

3. Clinical studies:

In a study of frozen specimens from 75 subjects with at least 3 serum samples collected during the course of follow-up surveillance for ovarian cancer progression, 255 visits for each of these 75 patients, following their initial evaluation (330 total CA 125 determinations) were cross-tabulated with a change in Dimension Vista CA 125 concentration of $\geq 7 0 . 1 \%$ at each surveillance visit. Clinical information that details the status of the subject’s disease was required for inclusion of samples in the study.

Patient CA 125 values were compared to disease state on a per visit basis. Patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding, Stable, or No Evidence of Disease (NED) by the attending physician based on the clinical information (medical imaging, physical examination, and other clinical investigations). All 75 patient sets were analyzed to determine the change in disease status per sequential pair $\mathrm { ( n { = } 2 5 5 }$ ). Table below shows the distribution of results when compared to the disease status.

$\mathrm { A } \geq 7 0 . 1 \%$ rise in CA 125 value correlated with clinical progression in $6 2 . 1 2 \%$ of cases. No significant change in CA 125 values correlated with stable disease or no evidence of disease in $6 6 \%$ of cases. $\mathrm { A } \geq 7 0 . 1 \%$ decrease in CA 125 value correlated with clinical response or no evidence of disease in $5 8 . 9 \%$ of cases. Overall expected changes in clinical status corresponded with CA 125 changes in

Per patient visit clinical performance results for the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LOCI CA $1 2 5 \ : \mathrm { I I I M }$ test and predicate devices are given in the following two tables. In this evaluation, disease status was classified as “Progression” and “No Progression” with “No Progression” consisting of responding, stable, and no evidence of disease.

Using a cut-off of $\geq 7 0 . 1 \%$ rise in CA 125 value, $56 . 8 \%$ of subject visits $( 9 5 \%$ confidence interval $4 4 . 7 \%$ to $6 8 . 2 \%$ ) had a rise in CA 125 value when the patient’s disease status was classified as progression. This value represents the positive percent agreement of significant CA 125 rise with a progression disease status.

4. Clinical cut-off:

Clinical Cut-off is based upon a $7 0 . 1 \%$ reference change value (RCV). When the measurement of CA 125 varies by $7 0 . 1 . 8 \%$ of the baseline (either positive or negative) the change is considered significant. The RCV was used to ensure that the change in CA 125 value is not attributed to assay variation or biological variation. This percent variation represents values within the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for real alteration in CA 125 values above system noise.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The distribution of CA 125 values was determined in specimens from healthy individuals $\mathrm { ( n = 1 9 8 }$ ; females) and from patients with nonmalignant or malignant diseases. $9 6 . 5 \%$ of 198 samples from apparently healthy adult females (age 18-64 years) had CA 125 levels less than or equal to $3 5 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

Each laboratory should establish its own reference values for healthy patients’ CA 125 levels as performed on the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System.

Expected values of CA 125 measurements are dependent upon the individual patient’s baseline reading for CA 125. Decreases from baseline value of $7 0 . 1 \%$ or more in any subsequent repeated measurements are indicative of response to therapy or remission. Increases of $7 0 . 1 \%$ or more suggest no response to therapy and correlate with progression of disease.

Estimation and empirical distributions of CA 125 II values in various populations of subjects was performed. The distribution of CA 125 values in 198 healthy individuals, 198 patients with nonmalignant and 370 patients with malignant disease is shown in the attached tables.
