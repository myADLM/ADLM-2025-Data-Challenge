# Predicate Device

# Device Description

The cobas 8000 Modular Analyzer Series is a fully automated system for clinical chemistry analysis intended for the in vitro quantitative/qualitative determination of analytes in body fluids. It is optimized for high throughput workloads in the professional environment using a combination of ion selective electrodes (cobas 8000 ISE module) and photometric analysis modules (cobas c 701 and c 502 modules). The cobas c 701 and c 502 analyzer modules are new members of the Roche / Hitachi family of clinical chemistry analyzers.

The cobas 8000 ISE module is an Ion-selective electrode system for the determination of sodium, potassium and chloride in serum and plasma.

The cobas c 701 module is a fully automated, discreet, computerized instrument for in vitro tests on a wide range of analytes. It is designed to use serum/plasma, urine, CSF supernatant and whole blood sample types. The related sample buffer module offers a random access buffer function for samples.

The cobas c 502 module is analytically identical to the cobas c 501 module (cobas 6000 analyzer series, K060373), but without an integrated ISE module. The related sample buffer module offers a random access buffer function for samples.

The cobas 8000 Data Manager acts as a command/control center between the cobas 8000 instrument and the LIS. The data manager software is installed on a PC. It also provides enhanced sample tracking, test management, result traceability, storage and reporting, quality control and calibration management, has LIS backup functionality and serves as a robust storage location for the instrument.

The control unit uses a graphical user interface to control all instrument functions, and is comprised of a touch screen monitor, keyboard and mouse and a personal computer.

The core unit is comprised of several components that manage conveyance of samples to each assigned analytical module. The actual composition of the core unit depends on the configuration of the analytical modules. Features of the Core Unit include a barcode reader (for racks and samples), automatic tube position if barcode position is misaligned, system power switch and circuit breaker, the sample rack loader/unloader, a STAT port, a water supply and a system interface port.

Intended use / Indications for use

The cobas 8000 Modular Analyzer Series is a fully automated system for clinical chemistry analysis, intended for the in vitro qualitative and quantitative determination of analytes in body fluids. It is optimized for high throughput workloads in the professional environment using a combination of ion selective electrodes (ISE) and a photometric analysis unit. This device is intended for use in conjunction with certain materials to measure a variety of analytes that may be adaptable to the below analyzers depending on the reagents used.

The cobas c701 analyzer is a fully automated, discrete clinical chemistry analyzer intended for the in vitro quantitative/ qualitative determination of analytes in body fluids.

The cobas c502 analyzer is a fully automated discrete clinical chemistry analyzer intended for the in vitro quantitative / qualitative determination of analytes in body fluids.

The cobas 8000 ISE module is a fully automated ion- specific analyzer intended for the in vitro potentiometric determination of chloride, potassium and sodium in serum and plasma using ion-selective electrodes.

Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or conditions involving electrolyte imbalance.

IGA-2 is an in vitro test for the quantitative determination of IgA in human serum and plasma on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems. IgA measurements aid in the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body's lack of ability to resist infectious agents.

The tables below compare the modified device (cobas c 701, cobas c502 and cobas 8000 ISE analyzers with cobas 8000 system software) to the current device (cobas c 501 with cobas 6000 system software)

Reagent Applications: Risk analysis for application of reagents to the cobas 8000 system was conducted by Roche Diagnostics according to internal SOPs.

Based on the risk analysis, application testing done on the cobas c701 and c502, using IgA as a representative assay, included with-in run and between-day precision, linearity, recovery of controls and method comparison to the c501. Sodium, Potassium and Chloride were also tested on the ISE module. Testing included with-in run and betweenday precision, linearity, recovery of controls and method comparison to the c501 as well as to flame for sodium and potassium and coulometry for chloride. All testing met specifications.

Conclusion: The cobas 8000 Modular Analyzer Series is substantially equivalent to the predicate cobas 6000 analyzer series in design, modes of operation, assay performance and intended use.

Dear Mr. Pereira:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market. .
