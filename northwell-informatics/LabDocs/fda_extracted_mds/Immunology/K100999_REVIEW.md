# L. Test Principle:

The allergen of interest covalently coupled to the ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific IgE in the patients plasma/serum sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with the developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgE present in the specimen. To evaluate the rest results, the response for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Since the updated ImmunoCAP allergen f20, Almond is a modified version of the currently cleared device, a limited precision study was performed. To demonstrate lot-to-lot reproducibility of the updated ImmunoCAP allergen f20, Almond, three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond were tested using three positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma). The samples were tested on ImmunoCAP 250. Mean concentration values, concentration quotients, and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated. The concentration quotients between lots based on uptake of positive sample were between 0.88 and 1.18, the concentrations of the negative samples were $< 0 . 0 3 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ , and all $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were less than $6 . 2 \%$ . The results were within Phadia’s assay specifications.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of specific IgE of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond was evaluated by testing three positive samples with concentration at $9 9 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ , $6 3 . 3 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ and $5 0 . 5 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ . Each sample was diluted five times in a 3-fold scheme. The undiluted and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one run on ImmunoCAP 250. One lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond was used. The results were pooled for the regression analysis. The reagent showed dilution linearity for the claimed measuring range to specific IgE to the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond. The provided regression equation is as follows:

$\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 1$ b $\operatorname { \dot { R } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 )$ ) ( $9 5 \%$ CI for slope 0.98 to 1.02 and for intercept -0.075 to 0.095)

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).

The stability studies were performed to demonstrate 24 month stability (at recommended storage temperature of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) of the updated ImmunoCAP

Allergen f20, Almond by an on-going real time stability study and accelerated stability study. The study was planned in accordance with CEN 13640. For real time stability study, three lots of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond were stored at recommended storage temperature, $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Two positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma) were tested in duplicates in one assay at monthly intervals. The mean concentrations were calculated for the positive samples. For accelerated study, one lot of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond was stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 8 weeks. The same lot stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was used as reference. Two positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma) were tested in duplicates in one assay run with the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ after 4 weeks and 8 weeks. The mean concentrations were calculated for each sample at each test occasion. Concentration quotients were calculated for the positive samples as follows: the concentration for the lot stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ was divided with the sample concentration for the reference lot [(mean conc. $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ )/(mean conc. $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ )]. As results, the calculated concentration quotients of positive samples ranged from 1.01-1.06 for 4 weeks and 1.02-1.03 for 8 weeks, while the negative sample remained at ${ < 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } }$ . The results from accelerated stability study meet Phadia’s specification and demonstrate at least 24 months stability from the date of manufacture.

In addition, the stability of calibration curve, real time and on-board stability of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator were evaluated. The results support Phadia’s claims: 1) the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibration curve is valid for 28 days; 2) the shelf life of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators (0, 0.35, 0.7, 3.5, 17.5, and $1 0 0 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ ) is 24 months; 3) the on-board stability for ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators is 28 days during 24 months shelf life.

d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB): In order to demonstrate LoB for the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond, data from comparison study was provided for calculating LoB. In this study, 111 negative samples $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 1 1 1$ ) were tested on ImmunoCAP 250. LoB was estimated as the $9 5 \%$ percentile of the distribution. $\mathrm { L o B = 0 . 0 1 9 5 \ k U _ { A } / L }$ .

Limit of Detection (LoD): 20 samples with low concentration of analyte were tested in 2 replicates $( \mathrm { N } { = } 4 0 , \mathrm { f } { = } 2 0 )$ ). SD was determined and LoD was calculated according to the equation: $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + c _ { \beta } \mathrm { \times S D }$ while $c _ { \beta } =$ $1 . 6 4 5 / [ 1 - 1 / ( 4 \mathrm { { x f } ) ] }$ . $\mathrm { L o D = 0 . 0 6 \ k U _ { A } / L }$ . The claimed LoD is $0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

The inhibition study was designed to verify the immunological specificity of almond allergen solution as bound to the updated ImmunoCAP allergen f20, Almond. The study was planned in accordance with CLSI I/LA20-A. In order to establish the theoretical response level for $100 \%$ inhibition, $( 1 0 0 \% )$ , $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of negative sample was premixed with $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of buffer. This is done to mimic the state where all IgE antibodies are bound by the added soluble inhibitor (allergen) and thus leaving no available IgE antibodies that may be bound to the ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond solid phase.

To establish the maximum response level for $0 \%$ inhibition, $( ^ { 6 4 } 0 \% ^ { 3 3 } )$ , $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of positive sample was premixed with $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ buffer. To show an overall dose dependent inhibition, $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of positive sample was premixed with varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor). The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer. The initial allergen solution dilution factor is dependent on the concentration of the allergen solution at hand. Subsequent dilutions were then adjusted to the 1/10-dilution sequence. The unrelated allergen solutions were not further diluted. Only concentrated solutions are used for the inhibition studies. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for 1 hour before being analyzed with ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond on ImmunoCAP 250 instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was performed in duplicates in one assay run on ImmunoCAP 250. Mean value was calculated. The inhibition $( \% )$ at inhibitor dilution factor (x) was calculated according to the following formula:

Inhibition $( \% ) =$ Response (0% inhibition) – Response (x) × 100 Response (0% inhibition) – Response (100% inhibition)

The results are shown below.

The results indicated that the binding of specific IgE to the ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond is inhibited in an overall dose dependant fashion by increasing amounts of the specific allergen extract. Three unrelated allergens show no significant inhibition.

a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:

To demonstrate that a higher proportion of almond positive patients are detected with the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond and no elevated values of specific IgE on samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical reaction to the allergen, 46 clinical and 111 negative samples were tested with the updated and the currently cleared ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond.
