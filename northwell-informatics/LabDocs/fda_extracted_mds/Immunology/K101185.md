# Device Description

ProsVue ™m is a two-site immunoassay utilizing an assay specific synthetic DNA sequence as a label with a PCR detection method. Calibrators, controls and samples react with a reagent containing a monoclonal PSA-specific antibody labeled with an assay-specific double-stranded DNA sequence. Then a reagent of paramagnetic microparticles coupled to a monoclonal antibody specific for another site on PSA is added and allowed to react to form a specific sandwich complex with PSA. After washing the particles to remove reactants, a reagent containing a heat-stable polymerase, specific primers, nucleotides, and a fluorescent dye is added to the washed microparticles. An Applied Biosystems® (AB) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument is utilized to detect the presence of the monoclonal PSA-specific antibody labeled with an assay specific DNA sequence indicating the levels of PSA in the samples. PSA values of controls anc samples are calculated in pg/mL from a calibrator dose-response plot. ProsVue slope is calculated using ProsVue Software from the

calculated PSA concentrations of three patient samples collected between six weeks and 20 months post radical prostatectomy.

The assay is made up of Reporter Antibody Reagent, Target Capture Reagent, PCR Reagent, Calibrators, Directions for Use (DFU) and ProsVue Software. Wash Reagent, Sample Diluent, and a three-level assayed control set are provided separately. ProsVue users initially receive the DFU and ProsVue software, which provide instructions and quality control support for the process of sample scheduling, collection and storage. When samples are ready for testing, the user contacts Iris Molecular Diagnostics (IMD), and IMD ships the required reagents.

# 5Intended Use

NADiA® ProsVue ™ is an in-vitro diagnostic assay for determining rate of change of serum total prostate specific antigen over a period of time (slope, pg/mL per month). The NADiA® ProsVue ™ assay is performed for patients having less than 0.1 ng/mL serum total PSA values (determined by standard-of-care assays that are FDA approved/cleared) in the first sample collected more than 6 weeks after radical prostatectomy. ProsVue ™ slope is indicated for use as a prognostic marker in conjunction with clinical evaluation as an aid in identifying those patients at reduced risk for recurrence of prostate cancer for the eight year period following prostatectomy.

The NADiA® ProsVue ™ assay is not intended for the diagnosis or for the monitoring of prostate cancer.

# Assay Performance Measuring Interval

From 0.65 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL

# Sensitivity

Limit of blank, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation were determined with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSl) EP17-A guideline.

Limit of Blank (LOB): 0.17 pg/mL Limit of Detection (LOD): 0.27 pg/mL Limit of Quantitation (LOQ): 0.65 pg/mL

# Linearity

Linearity was evaluated in accordance with the CLSI EP06-A guideline. For total PSA by NADiA® ProsVue ™, the method has been demonstrated to be linear from $0 . 6 5 > p g / m L$ to 100 pg/mL with deviation from linearity less than $24 \%$ .

# Precision

Three male serum pools were analyzed in accordance with CLSl EP5- A2. Samples were analyzed in duplicate determinations at two sites, by three operators using two AB 7500 Fast Dx instruments and two reagent lots. Forty assays were performed at the first site by two operators. Each operator performed one run per day, alternating between reagent lots, over a course of 20 days. At the second site, a single operator performed 2 runs a day, one on each reagent lot, for 5 days. The two sites combined yielded a total of 50 assays over a period of 25 non-consecutive days. Two statistical analyses were performed to analyze contribution of components of variation to total variation: one for estimation of within-run, between-run, and betweenday components of variation; and a second for estimation of within-run, between-run, and between-lot components of variation. Additionally, site-specific results were calculated. The following results were obtained:

# 7. Stability of PSA in serum at <100 pg/mL

To demonstrate that low-level PSA samples observed post-RP have a similar stability profile as those with values above $1 0 0 p g / m L$ when stored at $. 7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , serum pools from post prostatectomy patients containing PSA concentrations at ${ \sim } 7$ and $- 1 5 0 p g / m L$ were tested in an accelerated stability study at 4, 20, 30 and $4 0 \circ _ { \mathbb { C } }$ Aliquots of each pool were assayed with NADiA® ProsVue ™ at baseline and at serial time points over 15 days at each incubation temperature. Stability projections indicated that $9 9 . 6 \%$ and $9 9 . 7 \%$ of PSA would remain immunoreactive at 20 years of storage at $- 7 0 \circ _ { \mathsf { C } }$ based on the observed decomposition rates of the low and high serum pools, respectively.

# 8. ProsVue Reagent and Control Stability

ProsVue reagent stability was evaluated for three lots of ProsVue reagents that were stored at the labeled storage temperatures and tested at multiple time points. The kit reagents and wash solution were tested as a kit using in-house controls as test samples. The expiration period was defined as the elapsed time up to the point (the first time point of three successive time points) when the mean control recovery from three consecutive time points fell outside the value-assigned control limits.

ProsVue Sample Diluent stability was evaluated for three lots of sample diluent that were stored at the labeled storage temperature and tested at multiple time points. At each time point the Sample Diluent was used to make a 1:200 dilution of a high PSA control, and the diluted sample was tested with the ProsVue assay. The expiration period was defined as the elapsed time up to the point (the first time point of the successive time points) when the mean recovery from three consecutive time points fell outside the value-assigned range for the 1:200 dilution of the high control.

ProsVue Controls stability was evaluated for three lots of ProsVue controls that were stored at the labeled storage temperature and tested at multiple time points using the ProsVue assay. The control expiration period was defined as the elapsed time up to the point (the first time point of three successive time points) when the mean control recovery from three consecutive time points fell outside the value-assigned limits.

The results of the ProsVue stability testing are summarized in the table below. Additional stability testing will be performed, and expiration dates will be assigned based upon the stability data available. Reagents will be shipped to ProsVue users when the user notifies IMD that samples are available to be tested.

# Clinical Performance

To evaluate the prognostic capability of ProsVue ™M linear slope to identify prostate cancer patients at reduced risk of prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP), 304 patients were selected using a case-cohort study design. Patients meeting the study entry criteria were acquired from four clinical sites where each patient's clinical status ("Stable" or "Recurrence") was documented. Samples used were from men age 41 to 79 years with documented prostate cancer treated via radical prostatectomy with curative intent. Caucasian $( 8 8 . 8 \% )$ , African-American $( 8 . 2 \% )$ , Asian $( 2 . 0 \% )$ and patients of unknown race $( 1 . 0 \% )$ achieving post-RP total PSA values $< 1 0 0 \ p g / m 1$ by standard-of-care assays were followed up to 17.6 years post-prostatectomy with three serum samples per patient acquired at various time points during the 1.5-20 month ProsVue sampling period. The study cohort consisted of 64 patients with "Recurrence" and 240 "Stable" patients. Recurrent patients were followed a median of 4.7 years (range 1.2 - 15.3 years) until "Recurrence" was documented by positive imaging, positive biopsy, or death due to prostate cancer. "Stable" patients were followed for a median of 11.0 years (range 8.0 17.6 years).

Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier plot of probability of stable classification versus years (Solid line indicates patients with ProsVue slope ≤ 2 pg/ml/month $[ n = 2 4 5 ]$ and dashed line indicates patients with ProsVue slope $> 2$ EY pg/ml/month $[ n = 5 9 ]$ xi   
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 8-year probability of "Stable" were $9 5 . 9 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 3 . 4 - 9 8 . 4 \% )$ for the patients with ProsVue Slope ≤ 2

pg/mL/month and $3 7 . 3 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $2 5 . 0 - 4 9 . 6 \% _ { i }$ for the patients with ProsVue Slope $>$ 2 pg/mL/month. Median time to recurrence in the patients with ProsVue slope ≤ 2 pg/ml/month was $>$ 17.6 years versus 4.8 years for patients with ProsVue slope $>$ 2 pg/ml/month.

Further investigation with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis used to evaluate the association between ProsVue linear slope and prostate cancer recurrence status in a univariate analysis (can be interpreted as stand alone performance) indicated that the patients with ProsVue Slope≤2 pg/mL/month were 18.3 times more likely to be "Stable" than those with ProsVue Slope>2 pg/mL/month $( { \mathsf { H R } } = 1 8 . 3$ EY with $9 5 \%$ CI: 10.6 to 31.8; $\mathsf { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ Thus, ProsVue linear slope was a significant predictor of reduced risk for prostate cancer recurrence in this analysis (Table 1).

Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for, prespecified covariates of pre-prostatectomy PSA value, pathologic disease stage and Gleason score was performed with the ProsVue slope term (Table 2). Of the covariates, only the Gleason score variable reached significance $( \mathsf { p } = 0 . 0 0 0 4 )$ . The ProsVue linear slope term was attenuated from the univariate analysis but remained a highly significant and independent predictor of risk for prostate cancer recurrence with a HR of 9.8 $9 5 \%$ Cl: 5.4 to 17.8, $p { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ). The reduced hazard probably reflects that ProsVue slope may be related to the clinical factors but is clearly providing additional information.

The probability of clinical status "Recurrence" for the subjects with Slope>2 pg/mL/month (Positive Predictive Value, PPV) and probability to remain with clinical status "Stable" through at least 8 years for the subjects with slope ≤ 2 pg/mL/month (Negative Predictive Value, NPV) were calculated from the clinical study results $\scriptstyle ( n = 3 0 4 )$ . Table 3 presents a $_ { 2 \times 2 }$ table of the ProsVue classification based on the slope outcome and to the clinical status of patients as "Stable" or "Recurrence" following 8 years (row and column totals are displayed).

Among subjects who had "Recurrence" during 8 years of follow-up, $7 1 . 9 \%$ (46/64) subjects had slope $>$ 2 pg/mL/month and among the subjects who had "Stable" through at least 8 years of follow-up, $9 4 . 6 \%$ (227/240) subjects had slope ≤ 2 pg/mL/month.

Positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was 13.3 with $9 5 \%$ Cl: 7.7 - 23.0 and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) was 0.297 with $9 5 \%$ CI: 0.201 - 0.440.

In these data, probability of "Recurrence" regardless of the values of the ProsVue slope was $2 1 . 0 \%$ (64/304); PPV was $7 8 . 0 \%$ with $9 5 \%$ CI: $6 5 . 3 - 8 7 . 7 \%$ and NPV was $9 2 . 7 \%$ with $9 5 \%$ CI: $8 8 . 6 - 9 5 . 6 \%$ .

Because the estimates of PPV and NPV depend on the probability of Recurrence" among all subjects (prevalence of clinical status "Recurrence"), Table 4 presents estimates of PPV and NPV calculated for various levels of prevalence of "Recurrence".

A subgroup analysis was performed on data from 20 patients with at least one post-RP PSA value $\geq 3 0 0 p g / m L$ , but who remained stable throughout at least 8 years of follow-up. ProsVue slope correctly classified 11 of the 20 patients as "at reduced risk for recurrence" (ProsVue slope ≤ 2 pg/mL/month).

# 9. Software

Software is provided as an accessory to the ProsVue ™ assay kit. Its purpose is to reduce the risk of errors in the use of appropriate serum samples and calculating assay results.

The ProsVue ™ software identifies serum samples with invalid collection intervals and calculates the equation of the calibration line, PSA concentration (pg/mL) of patient samples and assay controls, patient ProsVue slope (pg/mL/month), and patient risk category. ProsVue software generates a report that includes the ProsVue slope (in pg/mL/month) and whether that slope categorizes a patient as being at "reduced risk" or "not at reduced risk" of prostate cancer recurrence.

ProsVue ™ software is an Excel Add-In containing calculation spreadsheets, Userforms, and code modules. Its User Interface consists of Userforms and dialog boxes consistent with those found in standard Excel Add-Ins. The User Interface allows entry and validation of sample identifiers and dates, plate map set-up, selection of a raw data (.csv) file to be analyzed, and viewing/printing of assay results. All sample and assay run requirements, as provided in the ProsVue ™ Directions for Use are applied in the software to ensure valid results.

# Conclusion

NADiA® ProsVue ™ is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the Agendia BV MammaPrint® (k062694). No new issues of safety or effectiveness have been raised.

Indications for Use:

NADiA® ProsVue ™m is an in-vitro diagnostic assay for determining rate of change of serum total prostate specific antigen over a period of time (slope, pg/mL per month). The NADiA® ProsVue ™ assay is performed for patients having less than 0.1 ng/mL serum total PSA values (determined by standard-of-care assays that are FDA approved/cleared) in the first sample collected more than 6 weeks after radical prostatectomy. ProsVue ™ slope is indicated for use as a prognostic marker in conjunction with clinical evaluation as an aid in identifying those patients at reduced risk for recurrence of prostate cancer for the eight year period following prostatectomy.

The NADiA $\textcircled{8}$ ProsVue ™ assay is not intended for the diagnosis or for the monitoring of prostate cancer.
