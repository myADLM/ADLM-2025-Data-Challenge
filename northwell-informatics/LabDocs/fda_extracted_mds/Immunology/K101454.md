# 6. Classification Name

Gene expression profiling test system, for breast cancer prognosis.

7. Common Name Multivariate device for cancer prognosis

# 8. Classification

Class II, regulated under 21 CFR 866.6040, product code NYI

9. Predicate Device Agendia BV's MammaPrint (k081092)

# 10. Device Description

The MammaPrint service is a microarray based gene expression analysis of a tumor. The analysis is based on several processes: isolation of RNA from frozen tumor tissue sections, DNA'se treatment of isolated RNA, linear amplification and labeling of DNA'se treated RNA, cRNA purification, hybridization of the cRNA to the MammaPrint microarray, scanning the MammaPrint microarray and data acquisition (feature extraction), calculation and determination of the risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.

The MammaPrint analysis is designed to determine the gene activity of specific genes in a tissue sample compared to a reference standard. The result is an expression profile, or fingerprint, of the sample.

The correlation of the sample expression profile to a template (the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome) is calculated and the molecular profile of the sample is determined (Low Risk, High Risk).

# 11. Intended Use

MammaPrint is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed in a central laboratory, using the gene expression profile of fresh breast cancer tissue samples to assess a patient's risk for distant metastasis (up to 10 years for patients less than 61 years old, up to 5 years for patients' ≥ 61 years).

The test is performed for breast cancer patients with Stage I or Stage II disease, with tumor size $< = 5 . 0$ cm and who are lymph node negative. The MammaPrint result is indicated for use by physicians as a prognostic marker only, along with other clinicopathological factors.

# 12. Performance Data (non-clinical)

# Analytical performance

MammaPrint analytical (i.e.,non-clinical) performancecharacteristicsinvestigated comprise Precision and Reproducibility compared to the predicate device.

# 1 - Micro Array Scanners

In concordance with experiments performed for an aditional scanner clearance in k080252, experiments were performed.

A selection of 25 slides performed as dual hybridizations from which MammaPrint Indices of the $1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ scan was generated using the FDA cleared scanners (serial US45103019 and US22502555) were used, consisted of approximately 100 samples and 20 times the control samples LRC and HRC.

The samples and controls were analyzed during regular diagnostics. For the scanner validation these same 25 slides were scanned a second time using the new scanners (US810R3210 and US811R3213). Txt files generated as output were used to generate MammaPrint Indices following standard procedures. Subsequently MammaPrint Indices of both scans were compared. The hybridized samples included: three samples with either high, low, borderline results with repeated results were generated per sample. Additionally, control samples LRC and HRC were included. MammaPrint indices were compared between both scans using Passing and Bablok regression analysis and a comparison of the variance per scanner.

The difference between the mean, median and standard deviation for all samples levels between both scanners fall within the accepted variance of the predicate device of $1 . 9 6 ^ { \star } 0 . 0 3 0$ .

# 2 - Bio Analyzers

A selection of about 60 samples that cover the complete RIN measuring range was analyzed on the FDA cleared Bio-analyzers (Serial nr DE24802382 and DE54700497), as well as the new Bio-Analyzers (Serial nr DE72901757 and DE72902838). Depending on the distribution of the data a statistical test was performed to determine if there is a significant difference in RIN measurements between both Bio-analyzers. The RIN measurements of the samples on both Bio-Analyzers were collected. Subsequently the D'Agostino-Pearson test on the RIN differences of both analyzers showed that there a normal distribution $( { \mathsf { p } } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1 )$ .

Therefore a Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used which showed that there was no significant difference in RIN measurements between the FDA cleared and New Bioanalyzers $\mathtt { \mathtt { p } = 0 . 4 6 }$ and $p { = } 0 . 4 7$ respectively).

# 3 - Central Laboratory sites Europe and U.S.

Validation of MammaPrint at the European and U.S. central laboratories was performed in two parts. All experiments were performed using FDA cleared equipment and in compliance with FDA cleared MammaPrint procedures.

# PART 1: RNA ISOLATION

Samples were selected based on sufficient tissue material available for sectioning and isolation at the US laboratory (Lab 2). These samples have previously shown to generate acceptable quality of RNA at the Amsterdam laboratory (Lab 1). After isolation the concentration and RNA quality (RNA integrity number, RIN) was assessed using the Bioanalyzers; all values have to meet the standard quality controls for MammaPrint (RiN>7). Isolations were performed on three different days, twelve samples each day, in total 36 samples.

# PART 2: AMPLIFICATION/LABELING AND HYBRIDIZATION

For validation of the labeling, amplification and hybridization steps of MammaPrint at the US lab (Lab 2), RNA from 99 samples was used. All samples have been previously subjected to a diagnostic MammaPrint test at the Amsterdam Lab (Lab 1). Based on the Amsterdam result the following result distribution was selected:

High risk: $n = 5 4$ $( 5 4 . 5 \% )$ - Low risk: $n = 3 8$ (38.3%) Borderline: $n = 7$ b $( 7 . 1 \% )$ EMPY

RNA was amplified, labeled and hybridized according to standard MammaPrint protocols on FDA cleared MammaPrint Low (HD) 8-pack array.

The 99 samples the standard control samples (Low Risk Control and High Risk Control) were analyzed. To show MammaPrint stability over time and to determine variation in MammaPrint Index, LRC and HRC were analyzed on each labeling day and on additional days resulting in 20 data points per control sample.

Statistical analysis that have been performed on the data are;

Passing and Bablok regression analysis • Bland & Altman analysis   
• McNEMARS TEST   
Analysis on Control Pools: LRC AND HRC

The studies show that there is no significant difference in RNA quality of RIN measurement between Amsterdam (L1) and US lab (L2). All results comply with the predefined validation acceptance criteria as described in the validation plan.

Moreover when comparing of MammaPrint Index and Outcome, it is concluded that there is no significant difference in MammaPrint Indices between European / Dutch (L1) and US / California (L2) lab. All results comply with the predefined validation acceptance criteria as described in the validation plan.

# 14. Conclusion

MammaPrint is a clinically and analytically accurate prognostic marker for providing a risk assessment of distant metastasis of breast cancer when performed in either Agendia's European or US central laboratory.

Dear Mr. Brink:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls.
