# Description of Device

IMMULITE® 2000 3gAllergyTM Specific IgE is a solid-phase, two-step, chemiluminescent immunoassay that exploits liquid phase kinetics in a bead format. '2 (U.S. Patent No. 4,778,751) It represents a significant advance over conventional methods relying on allergens attached to a solid-phase support, such as a paper disk.

The allergens are covalently bound to a soluble polymer/co-polymer matrix, which in turn is labeled with a ligand. The use of an amino acid co-polymer amplifies the amount of allergen that the matrix can support.

Incubation Cycles: $2 \times 3 0$ minutes.

# Indications for Use

For in vitro diagnostic use with the IMMULITE® 2000 Analyzer — for the quantitative measurement of allergen-specific IgE in human serum, as an aid in the clinical diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergic disorders. The test results are to be used in conjunction with clinical findings and other laboratory tests.

# Precision

Precision studies were performed in accordance with Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidance: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Methods; Approved GuidelineSecond Edition. CLSI document EP5-A2 (ISBN 1-56238-542-9). CLSI, 940 West Valley Road, Suite 1400, Wayne, Pennsylvania 19087-1898 USA, 2004, assaying two aliquots of each test

sample in two runs per day on 20 different days (Positives 1-3). Additional studies for Positives 4 were done assaying two aliquots of each test sample in two runs per day on 10 different days. Analysis of variance was used to estimate the within-run and total precision.

Three allergen lots were tested using three positive samples and one negative sample. Intra-assay and inter-assay precision for the positive samples were evaluated by calculating the kU/L dose percnt coefficients of variation (%CV) for each positive sample. Non-pecific binding (NSB) was monitored by testing the negative control sample.

Representative precision claims for each allergen tested are presented below:

# Linearity

For each allergen, two samples were diluted in 2-fold serial dilutions to 5 levels. The undiluted (neat) and diluted samples were tested with the specific allergen to demonstrate linearity at concentrations within the assay limits. Regression statistics for each allergen comparing observed to expected data are presented below.

# Specificity (Inhibition) Studies

Specificity of each allergen was verified through competitive inhibition testing using a single serum sample or pool of sera. A negative sample was used to measure the background response.

To initiate the inhibition experiment, $7 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { L } }$ of undiluted and 3-4 levels of 5-fold serially diluted inhibitor extract were mixed with $2 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample or pool to achieve final inhibitor concentrations of ·1093.75, 218.75, 43.75, 8.75, 1.75, $\mathbf { 0 . 3 5 \mu g / m L }$ This mixture was incubated at room temperature $( 1 5 . 2 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 1 hour allowing the immunological reaction to occur. Each sample mixture containing the inhibitor extract and the appropriate controls was assayed with 1 lot of each allergen. The percent $( \% )$ inhibition was calculated according to the following formula:

Response  os.control os.mple s X 1

The inhibition study demonstrated that the allergens tested are inhibited by the relevant inhibitor extract in a concentration dependent fashion. Also, the target $\%$ inhibition of $50 \%$ was met. These results indicate specificity of the Basil, Cacao, Oregano, Parsley, Pine Nut, and Vanilla allergens.

# Inhibition Using Negative Controls

Additional inhibition studies were conducted to show that the specific allergens are not crossreacting to the unrelated allergens. Procedures were followed according to CLSI ILA20-A, Appendix-D. Testing was performed using one positive sample with three unrelated allergen extracts at $1 ~ \mathrm { m g / m l }$ . A negative sample was used to measure the background response. Results on the following specific allergen(s) were below $1 9 . 3 \%$ for Basil, Cacao, Oregano, Parsley, Pine Nut, and Vanilla

# Clinical Performance Studies

Clinical performance of Basil, Cacao, Oregano, Parsley, Pine Nut, and Vanilla allergens was demonstrated by testing samples from non-atopic individuals and samples from atopic patients with case histories of suspected clinical reactions to the specific allergen or allergy group in the IMMULITE® 2000 3gAllergy Specific IgE assay and comparing results to accompanying clinical information:
