# 6.0 Device Description

The ${ \mathsf { P L A C } } ^ { \otimes }$ Test Reagent Kit consists of separately packaged reagents, calibrators and controls for the measurement of $L P \mathrm { - } P L A _ { 2 }$ in serum or plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

# PLAC® Test Reagent Kit

R1 Buffer solution with protein stabilizers R2 Suspension of polymeric microparticles coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to Lp-PLA2 (2C10 and 4B4).

The PLAC® Test Reagent Kit is based on turbidimetricimmunoassay technology utilizing two Lp-PLA2-specific monoclonal antibodies (2C10 and 4B4) coated to polymeric microparticles. A set of Lp- $P _ { 1 } A _ { 2 }$ calibrators is used to plot a standard curve of absorbance (y-axis) versus Lp- $\cdot P 1 A _ { 2 }$ concentration in ng/mL (x-axis) from which the Lp$\mathsf { P L A } _ { 2 }$ concentration in the test sample can be determined. The concentration of Lp- $\mathsf { \cdot P l } \mathsf { A } _ { 2 }$ in each sample and control is then interpolated from the standard curve using a spline curve fit with appropriate calibration curve fitting software. The kit expiration date and storage conditions are indicated on the package.

# 7.0 Intended Use

REAGENT KIT The $\overline { P L A C } ^ { \otimes }$ Test Reagent Kit is a turbidimetric immunoassay for the quantitative determination of $L _ { P } - P _ { L } A _ { 2 }$ (lipoprotein-associated phospholipase $\mathsf { A } _ { 2 } \mathsf { \Pi }$ in human plasma or serum on automated clinical chemistry analyzers, to be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation and patient risk assessment as an aid in predicting risk for coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis.

Dear Dr. Peled,

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be fnd in Ti1, Codef Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 800 to . In addition, FDA my publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
