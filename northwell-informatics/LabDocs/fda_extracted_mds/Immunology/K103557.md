Description of the Device:

# Clinical Significance

CRP (C-reactive protein) is an acute phase protein whose concentration is seen to increase as a result of the inflammatory process, most notably in response to pneumococcal (bacterial) infectious, histolytic disease and a variety of disease states. Originally discovered by Tillet et al. in 1930 in patient sera with acute infection, CRP has now come to be used as a marker or general diagnostic indicator of infections and inflammation, in addition to serving as a monitor of patient response to therapy and surgery. Furthermore, regular measurements of CRP in infants can be a useful aid in the early diagnosis of infectious disease.

# Assay Principle

Diazyme hsCRP assay is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. When an antigen-antibody reaction occurs between CRP in a sample and anti-CRP which has been sensitized to latex particles, agglutination results. This agglutination is detected as an absorbance change $( 5 7 0 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ , with the magnitude of the change 'being proportional to the quantity of CRP in the sample. The actual concentration is then determined by the interpolation from a calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known concentration.

Diazyme hsCRP Assay calibrator set is intended for use with the Diazyme hsCRP Assay kit. Five calibration levels are needed for each run. Calibrators are treated exactly the same as patient samples.

Diazyme hsCRP Assay 3-point control set is intended for use with the Diazyme hsCRP Assay kit. Controls are treated exactly the same as patient samples. The quality controls assist laboratory users in verification steps ensuring that the assay reagents are functioning correctly.

Users are instructed to verify the calibration curve with the controls and run controls each time a new lot of reagents are received.

# Indications for Use:

The Diazyme high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assay is for the in vitro quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human serum and plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Measurement of CRP is of use for the detection and evaluation of inflammatory disorders and associated diseases, infection and tissue injury. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

The Diazyme hsCRP assay Calibrator set is intended for use in the calibration of the C-reactive protein (CRP) assay. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

The Diazyme hsCRP assay Control set is intended for use as quality controls for the Diazyme hsCRP assay. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

# Performance Testing Summaries:

Method Comparison Study Summary   
Human serum samples were tested with the Diazyme hsCRP Assay and the obtained results were compared to the predicate method. A total of 57 samples (ranging from 0.19 to $1 8 . 9 7 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ of CRP) were tested in both assays. The above described accuracy study showed that the Diazyme hsCRP Assay results correlated well with predicate method with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 with a slope of 1.0133 and 0.0196 y intercept. Precision Study Summary   
The precision of the Diazyme hsCRP Assay was evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP5-A guideline. In the study, three levels of serum based controls containing approximately 0.8, 1.6, and $8 . 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ of CRP, and a serum sample containing approximately 3.6 $\mathrm { { m g / L } }$ of CRP respectively was tested with 2 runs per day in duplicates over 20 working days. An additional serum sample containing approximately $1 5 . 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ of CRP was tested with 2 runs per day in duplicates over 5 days. Results were calculated using the EP Evaluator software precision statistic template and summarized in the following table:
