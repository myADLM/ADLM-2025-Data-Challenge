# Indications for use

The ScanView System is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis system. It is intended for in vir diagnostic use as an aiding tool to the pathologist or cytogeneticist in the detection, classification and enumeration of ces of interest based on color, intensity, size, pattern, and shape.The ScanView is indicated as an accessory to the following FDA cleared/approved devices to detect the following cell types:

1. $\mathrm { C E P } @$ X Spectrum OrangeTM/CEP $\circledast$ Y Spectrum Green 'M DNA Probe Kit and is limited to the analysis of CEP XY probes via high magnification capture and analysis of interphase nuclei. CEP XY is indicated for use to assess the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in opposite-sex transplants.   
2. Human breast cancer containing the HER-2/neu gene labeled in Red and the centromere of chromosome 17 labeled in Green via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens with Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-2 DNA Probe kit. Results from the PathVysion™ Kit are intended for use as an adjunct to existing clinical and pathologic information used as prognostic factors in stage Il, nodeposiive breast cancer patients.The PathVysion™ kit is further indicated as an aid to predict iss n r      oe ccophosphamie, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) cheoherapy.   
3. Ces in urie specimes, stained by furecence in siu hybridizaton (FISH) using Vysis UroVys Bladder Cancer Kit to detect aneuploidy for chromosomes 3, 7, 17, and loss of the $9 \mathsf { p } 2 1$ locus, from persons with hematuria suspected of having bladder cancer. The results are intended for use, in conjunction with and not in lieu of current standard diagnostic procedures, as an aid for initial diagnosis of bladder carcinoma in patients with hematuria and subsequent monitoring for tumor recurrence in patients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer.

The ScanView System is to be used as an adjunctive automated enumeration tool in conjunction with manual visualization.

# Safety & Effectiveness

The device has been designed, verified and validated complying with 21CFR 820.30 regulations. Performance tet data demonstrate that the device meets the required specifications.No adverse affects have been detected.

# Substantial Equivalency

Dear Mr. Laor:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Tile 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
