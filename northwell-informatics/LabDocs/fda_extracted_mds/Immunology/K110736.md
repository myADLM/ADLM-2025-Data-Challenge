# Device Description:

The Ferritin reagents are ready-to-use liquid reagents. They are supplied in two different package sizes: 200 tests/wedge, 4 wedges/kit and 800 tests/wedge, 4 wedges/kit. In the ADVIA Chemistry Ferritin assay, sample is diluted and reacted with a buffer containing latex particles coated with antibody specific for ferritin. The formation of the antibodyantigen complex during the reaction results in an increase in turbidity, the extent of which is measured as the amount of light absorbed at $6 5 8 \ \mathrm { n m }$ By constructing a standard curve from the absorbance of standards, ferritin concentration of a sample can be determined.

ADVIA Chemistry Liquid Specific Protein Calibrator is a multi-analyte, liquid, buffer based product containing multiple analytes derived from human sources. The kit consists of 6 vials each of 6 calibrator levels which are ready for use (no preparation is required).

The constituent concentrations of these Calibrators are present at levels 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.   
Level 1 is a zero level. The volume per viâl is $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ .

Values for the new lots are assigned from a master lot that is referenced to the WHO 3rd International Standard IBSC 94/572

# Intended Use:

The ADVIA Chemistry Ferritin reagent is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative measurements of ferritin in human serum and plasma on the ADVIA Chemistry systems. Measurements of ferritin aid in the diagnosis of diseases affecting iron metabolism, such as hemochromatosis (iron overload) and iron deficiency anemia.

The ADVIA Chemistry Liquid Protein Calibrator is for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry system for the Alpha-Acid-Glycoprotein (AAG), Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT), Anti-streptolysin-O_2 (ASO_2), Complement C3 (C3), Complement C4 (C4), Haptoglobin (HAPT), Ferritin (FRT), Immunoglobulin A_2 (IGA_2), Immunoglobulin G_2 (IGG_2), Immunoglobulin M_2 (IGM_2), Prealbumin (PREALB), Rheumatoid Factor (RF), and Transferrin (TRF) methods

Dear Dr. Gordon:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination thal your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will alow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may oblain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
