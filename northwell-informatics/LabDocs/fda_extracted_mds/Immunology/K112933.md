# Device Name

Trade Name: Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II for use on the Access Immunoassay Systems Common Name: Thyroglobulin Antibody Enzyme Immunoassay Classification Name: Immunochemical, Thyroglobulin Autoantibody

Predicate Device Access Thyroglobulin Antibody Il (k062516) Manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc.

# Device Description

The Access Thyroglobulin Antibody Il reagents, Thyroglobulin Antibody II calibrators, and the Access Immunoassay analyzers comprise the Access Immunoassay System for the quantitative determination of thyroglobulin antibody in human serum and plasma.

# Intended Use

The Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II (TgAb II) assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of thryoglobulin antibody levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. The measurement of thyroid autoantibodies may aid in the diagnosis of Hashimoto's disease, nontoxic goiter, and Graves' disease.

# Summary of Studies

Method ComparisonA comparison of thyroglobulin antibody values from 397 samples, ranging from approximately $< 0 . 9$ to $2 5 0 0 1 0 / m L$ , was run with both the Access Thyroglobulin Antibody Il immunoassay and the predicate Access Thyroglobulin Antibody Il immunoassay. The new method (y-axis) was correrlated with the predicate (x-axis) using Passing-Bablock analysis, the following relationship was observed: new $\asymp$ m(predicate) $1 . 0 \pm 0 . 1 2$ , $R ^ { 2 } \geq 0 . 9 2$ .

Imprecision: Within run imprecision ranged from 3.6 to 5.7 %CV, between run imprecision ranged from 0.0 to 5.2 %CV, and total imprecision ranged from 4.8 to 7.7 %CV at levels between 26.9 and 1889.6 IU/mL. The assay exhibits total imprecision of less than 10% CV for concentrations greater than or equal to 15 IU/mL and $< 1 . 5$ IU/mL SD at concentrations $< 1 5 / | \Delta / / m L$ .

High-dose Hook Effect: The Access Thyroglobulin Antibody Il assay demonstrated no hook to 50,000 IU/mL.

Linearity: The Thyroglobulin Antibody Il assay has demonstrated to be linear across the range of the assay (0.0 to 25001U/mL).

Limit of Blank (LoB): The highest measurement result observed with no analyte present in a sample is 0.9 IU/mL $( n = 2 2 1$ xi

Limit of Detection (LoD): The lowest concentration of analyte in a sample that can be detected with a stated probability (95%) is 0.9 lU/mL.

Analytical Specificity: There is no significant interference from total protein, bilirubin, hemoglobin, or trigycerides. Additionally, samples with autoimmune disease state were tested and showed 100% total agreement.

# Conclusion:

The Access Thyroglobulin Antibody I assay, for use on the Access Immunoassay Systems, is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, Access Thyroglobulin Antibody Il assay (k062516) for the measurement of thyroglobulin antibody.

Dear Ms. Baglien:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450.
