# Device Name

Proprietary names: Tina-Quant Albumin Gen. 2

Common names: Albumin Gen. 2 - cobas c 311 urine assay

Regulation: 21 CFR 866.5040

Classification names: Albumin Immunological Test System

Product codes: DCF

# Device Description

The Tina-quant Albumin Gen. 2  cobas c 31 1 urine assay employs an immunoturbidimetric test in which anti-albumin antibodies react with the antigen in the sample to form antigen/antibody complexes which, following agglutination are determined turbidimetrically.

# Intended use

Immunoturbidimetric assay for the quantitative, in vitro determination of albumin in human urine on the Roche/Hitachi cobas c 311 analyzers.

# Indications for Use

The Tina-quant Albumin Gen. 2 - cobas e 311 urine assay is an immunoturbidimetric assay intended for the quantitative determination of albumin in urine on the Roche/Hitachi cobas e 31 lanalyzers. Measurement of albumin aids in the diagnosis of kidney and intestinal diseases.

The Tina-quant Albumin Gen. 2  cobas c 311 urine assay is substantially equivalent to the Tina-quant Albumin Gen.2 - cobas c 501 urine assay. The cobas c 501 Tina-quant Albumin Gen. 2 assay was cleared under K101203.

Dear Mr. Stimart:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
