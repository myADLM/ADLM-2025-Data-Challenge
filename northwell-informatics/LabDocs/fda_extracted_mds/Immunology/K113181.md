4Predicate device

The predicate device is the CellTracks Analyzer II® (K0601 10, March 16, 2006)

# Device Description

The CELLTRACKS ANALYZER $\operatorname { I I } \circled{ \mathbb { B } }$ is a semi-automated fluorescence microscope, consisting of the analyzer, a dedicated computer with CELLTRACKS $\textcircled{8}$ software, monitor, keyboard, mouse and uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Use of this product requires training and should be used under the supervision of laboratory management.

The CELLTRACKS ANALYZER $\operatorname { I I } ( { \mathfrak { P } }$ is for analysis of rare cells that are isolated from biological fluids including whole blood. It is used in conjunction with the CELLTRACKS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AUTOPREP $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System, which automates and standardizes the sample preparation with specific reagent kits.

Device intended use

The CELLTRACKS ANALYZER $\Pi ^ { \textregistered }$ is a semi-automated fluorescence microscope used to enumerate fluorescently labeled cells that are immunomagnetically selected and aligned. This product is for in vitro diagnostic use when used in tandem with specimen preparation equipment and reagents that are legally marketed for in vitro diagnostic use with this device.

7. Comparison to predicate device

The CellTracks Analyzer $\operatorname { I I } ( { \mathfrak { B } }$ (modified) is substantially equivalent to the CellTracks Analyzer II@ (K0601 10: March 16, 2006). There has been no change to intended use, fundamental scientific technology, mode of operations, or specimen type/identification. All of the algorithms associated with image acquisition, analysis, cell selection, review, reporting and archiving and the logic and interface to the PC remain the same.

Changes from the predicate include:

Upgrade from version 2.4 software to version 2.5.0 software:

The software will include the following design changes:

Dear Ms. Hojnoski:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to v a  n  n  al F, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicatdvice esultn  casifiation or your device nd thus, permits your dev o proceed to the market.
