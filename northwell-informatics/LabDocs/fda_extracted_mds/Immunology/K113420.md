# 10. Device Description - Characteristics

The RNARetain® device consists f an aqueous, hypertonic tissue preservation solution that is provided in a single-use, non-sterile vial intended to serve as the container for the collection, storage, and transport of breast tissue specimens. The ability of the solution formulation to preserve fresh tissue and nucleic acids within the tissue is due to its rapid permeation of tissue to protect cellular nucleic acids from nucleases that would otherwise rapidly degrade the nucleic acids within the specimen. The demonstrated inhibitory effect of the RNARetain® solution on the growth of bacteria, yeast and mold protects the specimen from inadvertent microbial contamination during storage or usage of the device.

The utility of the RNARetain® solution is to maintain high quality cellular RNA for downstream molecular testing. The collection of fresh breast tissue specimens into the RNARetain® device eliminates the need to immediately process these specimens, enabling RNA extraction and molecular testing at a later time and/or transport to a different location. RNARetain® eliminates the need to flash-freeze specimens and to keep specimens frozen throughout storage and transport, a process that is costly and involves manipulation of potentially hazardous agents. It also eliminates the need for formalin fixation, the most common method of clinical tissue preservation, that is both hazardous to work with and known to cross-link and sometimes degrade the nucleic acids rendering them unacceptable for specific downstream molecular applications.

No statistically significant difference in MammaPrint® risk group assignment or MammaPrint® index between the two separate RNA isolations was observed.

$1 3 \ b .$ Stability of MammaPrint® outcomes in RNARetain® (k070675) The effect of shipment of a tumor in RNARetain® on stability of MammaPrint® results was demonstrated in k070675. The tumor was selected from which both immediately snapsimilar tumor cell percentage and similar RNA quality. Both samples were labeled 5 times and hybridized on MammaPrint® microarrays according to standard protocols.

MammaPrint® Indices were compared to determine if samples shipped in RNARetain® have a greater stability than tumor sections which are immediately stored at $\mathbf { - 7 0 \ ^ { \circ } C }$ after excision. Results showed that the incorporation of both Cy5 and Cy3 were significantly higher for samples shipped in RNARetain® (Unpaired T-tests, $\mathsf { p { = } } 0 . 0 1 8$ and $\mathsf { p { = } } 0 . 0 0 1$ respectively). The variance in Mammarint® indices was smaller for samples that were stored in RNARetain compared to the samples that were frozen immediately (Std dev 0.022 vs. 0.042). An unpaired T-test of the MammaPrint® index revealed no significant difference in the actual Mae ARt $( { \mathfrak { p } } { = } 0 . 2 4 )$ .Based on these epments, te abili Mmntide  reat  mpl torAR than in samples that were immediately frozen. The difference in MammaPrint® index between RNARetain® and frozen tissue $( \Delta 0 . 0 2 7 )$ was within the previously determined acceptable limit of index variation.

Method comparison with predicate device (k070675):

The samples for this study were collected in 2003 as a pilot study for the Dutch Raster clinical trial sponsored by the Dutch Health Insurance Council where tissue would be shipped in RNARetain® from 20 hospitals. One set consisted of 33 breast tumor samples of which one part of the sample was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { ^ { o } C } }$ , another part was stored in RNARetain® for 3 to 5 days at room temperature and subsequently removed from the preservation solution, snap frozen and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ Another set comprised of 18 tumors of which two parts were available for research that were immediately snap frozen and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \mathrm { { o } } C } }$ RNA isolation and DNAse treatment were performed in this same period. HE stained sections were re-examined by a pathologist to confirm invasive ductal carcinoma and sufficient tumor cell content. All samples were hybridized on MammaPrint® microarrays, and passed all sample, labeling and hybridization QCs. Analysis was performed using Feature Extraction version 8.5 and XPrint version 1.40. Results of MammaPrint® indices of paired RNARetain® and frozen samples are shown in Figure 2A. The median difference between the RNARetain® preserved and the snap frozen is 0.070. The Pearson correlation (0.94) and regression analysis indicate a high similarity $( \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 0 )$ .

Figure 2: Comparison of MammaPrint Indices between two samplings of the same tumor. A RNARetain®-frozen; $\pmb { B }$ frozen-frozen.

This finding is similar to the results of a series of tumors of which two frozen samples were available and were collected in the same time period (Figure 2B). The median difference in MammaPrint® Index was 0.105. A comparison of the differences in both series (RNARetain®-frozen vs. frozen-frozen) showed no significant difference (t-test, $p { = } 0 . 5 7 )$ indicating no variation is introduced by RNARetain®.

# 13 d. Repeatability and Reproducibility

Ten adjacent pairs of breast tissue were collected by Asuragen from 3 subjects. From each pair, one was stored in RNARetain® at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } C$ for 12 to 18 hours and the other was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored a $u 1 \leq - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C$ The RNARetain® and flash-frozen stored specimens were then shipped overnight on blue ice or dry ice, respectively. The samples were processed immediately upon receipt for RNA purification and RNA analysis. The average yield, integrity, and purity values for each subject (10 replicates), together with their associated standard deviation (SD) are presented in Table 4. There was no significant difference between tissues from various storage methods, indicating that RNA quality from human breast tissue stored in RNARetain® is equivalent to flashfrozen specimens and that the two RNA preservation methods are compatible with downstream molecular analyses.

# Summary of Substantial Equivalence to Predicate

The studies above demonstrate that RNARetain® is safe and effective in the collection, storage and transport of fresh breast tissue; preserving the nucleic acids to allow for high quality RNA isolation and accurate clinical outcome test results with a cleared assay. RNARetain® was compared to the fresh-frozen method for tissue transportation and RNA preservation and determined to be safe, effective, and equivalent to its performance in the Agendia MammaPrint® (k070675) submission.

product), the two devices have the same technology, and principle of operation  that is the collection, preservation, storage and transportation of a specific tissue. Both devices are single-use specimen plastic containers prefilled with preservation solution. The risks are the same, which is risk to the patient for misdiagnosis, delay in diagnosis, or sample recollection due to RNA degradation. As the two devices are specific for different tissues (breast vs. blood), a direct comparison between the two devices was not performed; rather each device was compared to the pre-amendment test method utilized for that specific tissue. RNARetain® was compared to the fresh-frozen method of tissue preservation, transportation and storage and PAXgene® was compared to k2EDTA collected blood in an applicable collection vessel. However, the methods used to evaluate the comparison with the preamendment test methods were similar: RNA yield (A260) and purity (A260/280). Repeatability and reproducibility evaluations also utilizing RNA yield and purity, and finally a functional evaluation of the RNA quality by molecular diagnostic test assays. Both devices met their acceptance criteria demonstrating these two devices can preserve RNA molecules to yield high quality RNA for subsequent RNA isolation and further molecular diagnostic testing.

The differences in the devices are primarily due to the specific tissue type the device is intended for. PAXgene® has a vial closure that is conducive to drawing blood and the collection vial is sterile as this is a critical parameter for blood which coats the vial during collection. RNARetain® has a vial closure that is closer in composition to the vial and can be sealed after the breast tissue is placed in the vial.The vial is non-sterile as the tissue does not coat the vial during collection and the device solution has been shown to protect against microbial growth in anti-microbial challenge studies. The differences in the devices do not impact their similar intended use, technology, or principle of operation.

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
