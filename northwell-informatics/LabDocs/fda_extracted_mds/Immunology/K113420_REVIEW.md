# L. Test Principle:

A breast tissue sample is collected into RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ solution in a single-use, prefilled container and can be stored in reagent for up to 3 days at 35 to $3 9 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , 7 days at 18 to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , 30days at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , or 3 years at -15 to ${ - 3 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ before RNA extraction. Tissue should be submerged in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ for at least 12 hours prior to freezing. The RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ solution can rapidly permeate tissue to protect cellular nucleic acids from nucleases that would otherwise rapidly degrade the nucleic acids within the specimen. RNA can be extracted from preserved breast tissue and utilized in downstream molecular testing.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision and reproducibility of breast tissue specimens preserved using the RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ device was demonstrated using the MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ device in submission $\mathrm { k 0 7 0 6 7 5 }$ . Five previously analyzed tumor samples (one borderline, two high-risk samples, and two low-risk samples) were processed in duplicate for RNA isolation over multiple days according to standard MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ protocols. No statistically significant difference in MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ risk group assignment or MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ index between the two separate RNA isolations was observed.

A subsequent repeatability study compared RNA integrity, purity and yield using breast tissues from each of the 3 subjects that were sectioned into 20 sections with adjacent sections split between storage in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and fresh frozen. Small variations were observed among replicates in RNA purity as determined by $\mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 }$ (1.51 to $6 . 9 6 \%$ CV), quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR) of a housekeeping gene (1.33 to $3 . 9 7 \%$ CV), and RNA integrity as measured by either the ratio of 28S:18S RNA (10.3 to $1 8 . 8 \%$ CV) or RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values. A variation is noted in RNA yield and is likely due to the tissue composition (e.g., the amount of fat and stroma present vs. epithelial tissue).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability of tissues stored in RNARetain®

The effect of shipment of a tumor in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ on stability of MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { { \cdot } } ( { \mathbb { R } } )$ results was demonstrated in k070675. The tumor was selected from which both immediately snap-frozen and RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ preserved sections were available. Both sections of the tumor had a similar tumor cell percentage and similar RNA quality. Both samples were labeled 5 times and hybridized on MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ microarrays according to standard protocols. MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Indices were compared to determine if samples shipped in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ have a greater stability than tumor sections which are immediately stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ after excision. Results showed that the incorporation of both Cy5 and Cy3 were significantly higher for samples shipped in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (Unpaired T-tests, $\mathrm { p { = } } 0 . 0 1 8$ and $\mathrm { p { = } } 0 . 0 0 1$ respectively). The variance in MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ indices was smaller for samples that were stored in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ compared to the samples that were frozen immediately (SDev 0.022 vs. 0.042). An unpaired T-test of the MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ index revealed no significant difference in the actual MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ indices for the RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and frozen samples $( \mathrm { p } { = } 0 . 2 4 )$ . Based on these experiments, the stability in MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ index is greater in samples stored in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ than in samples that were immediately frozen. The difference in MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ index between RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and frozen tissue $( \Delta 0 . 0 2 7 )$ was within the previously determined acceptable limit of index variation.

In another subsequent study, human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were grown and resuspended in RNARetain $^ { \mathrm { \textregistered } } ,$ incubated overnight at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ , then subjected to up to 7 days at 35 to $3 9 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , up to 15 days at 18 to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , up to 60 days at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , and up to 3 years at $- 1 5$ to ${ - 3 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . RNA Yield (A260), Purity (A260/A280), and Integrity (28S:18S ratios) were compared to Fresh Frozen cells. Samples are stable up to 3 days at 35 to $3 9 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , 15 days at 18 to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , 60 days at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and up to 3 years at $- 1 5$ to ${ - 3 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ .

# RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent stability

Stability studies were performed with 3 lots of the $8 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ vial $6 \mathrm { m L }$ volume) up to 20 months with storage at room temperature (18 to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and showed acceptable performance. Additional stability studies with the $6 \mathrm { m L }$ vial $\{ 5 \mathrm { m L }$ volume) and $2 \mathrm { m L }$ vial ( $1 \mathrm { m L }$ volume) configurations were also performed and demonstrated acceptable stability of up to 36 months at room temperature.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ was demonstrated in k070675 based on a comparison to results obtained from fresh frozen tissue using the MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { { \textregistered } }$ device. The samples for this study were collected in 2003 as a pilot study for the Dutch Raster clinical trial sponsored by the Dutch Health Insurance Council where tumor tissue samples were shipped in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ from 20 hospitals. One set consisted of 33 breast tumor samples of which one part of the sample was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , another part was stored in RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ for 3 to 5 days at room temperature and subsequently removed from the preservation solution, snap frozen and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Another set comprised of 18 tumors of which two parts were available for research that were immediately snap frozen and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ . RNA isolation and DNAse treatment were performed in this same period. H&E stained sections were re-examined by a pathologist to confirm invasive ductal carcinoma and sufficient tumor cell content. All samples were hybridized on MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ microarrays, and passed all sample, labeling and hybridization QCs. Analysis was performed using Feature Extraction version 8.5 and XPrint version 1.40. MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ indices of paired RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and frozen samples have a median difference of 0.070. The Pearson correlation (0.94) and regression analysis indicate a high similarity $\mathrm { R } ^ { { 2 } } =$ 0.90). This finding is similar to the results of a series of tumors of which two frozen samples were available and were collected in the same time period. The median difference in MammaPrint $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Index was 0.105. A comparison of the differences in both series (RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ -frozen vs. frozen-frozen) showed no significant difference $\mathit { \Omega } _ { t }$ -test, $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 5 7 }$ ) indicating no variation is introduced by RNARetain $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ .
