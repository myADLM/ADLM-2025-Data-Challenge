# M. Performance Characteristics (where applicable):

1Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was investigated by repeated determinations of different samples covering the whole range of antigens of the EUROLINE Profile Autoimmune Liver Disease 8 Ag (IgG). The samples were tested for intra-assay reproducibility in 20 replicates on one day using the same kit lot. Interassay reproducibility was investigated in 20 different runs, each run performed by the same technician with a single determination on a different day using the same kit lot. Inter-lot reproducibility was tested in 3 different runs using 3 different kit lots, each run performed with a single determination. Reproducibility was found to be sufficient as no positive sample was found negative and vice versa.

To investigate the influence of different individuals reading the intensity of the bands, different samples covering the whole range of antigens were evaluated by three different technicians and under 3 different light conditions (sunlight, Neon light and electric bulb light), each run performed with a single determination. No deviation was observed between the individual readings and from the light conditions.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators or methods):

A recognized standard or reference material for antibodies against AMA-M2, M2-3E, Sp100, PML, gp210, LKM-1, LC-1 and SLA/LP is not available.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity: The quality of the antigen substrates and the antigen source assure a high level of specificity for the EUROLINE Profile Autoimmune Liver Disease 8 Ag (IgG). The test system allows specific detection of IgG class antibodies against AMA-M2, M2-3E, sp100, PML, gp210, LKM-1, LC1 and SLA/LP. Cross reactivity was investigated using serologically characterized panels from the following groups: Autoantibodies against granulocyte cytoplasm (ANCA; $n = 1 0 )$ ,autoantibodies against thyroid gland antigens $( n = 1 0 )$ and autoantibodies against islet cell antigens (ICA; ${ \bar { \mathsf { n } } } = { \mathsf { 1 0 } } _ { \varepsilon } ^ { \prime }$ autoantibodies against cardiolipin/anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS; $n = 5$ )and the CDC ANA reference panel $( n = 1 2 )$ as well as clinical panels from the following groups: Autoimmune hepatitis type 1 (AIH $\cdot \uparrow$ ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 8 4$ . primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; $n = 1 9$ systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; ${ \mathsf n } = { \mathsf 1 } 0 )$ , rheumatoid arthritis (RA; $n = 5 0$ , celiac disease $( n = 7 )$ non-alcoholic steatohepatitis $( n = 3 0 )$ and viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV; $n = 3 9$ .Only 9 samples of these 286 total samples were found positive with the EUROLINE Profile Autoimmune Liver Disease 8 Ag (IgG) for a few antigens only.

3 AIH tested positive for SLALP these three samples should not be considered cross-reactive as SLA/LP is associated with AIH-1.

Interference: Different samples were spiked with potential interfering substances in 3 different concentrations. No interference was observed with haemolytic, lipaemic or icteric samples for concentrations of up to $5 0 0 m g / d$ for haemoglobin, 2000 mg/dl for triglycerides and $4 0 m g / d 1$ for bilirubin.

f. Assay cut-off:

The cut-off intensity is defined as the lowest limit of a clearly visible band.

2Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A clinical study was performed with 295 clinically characterized samples (99 from patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AlH), 104 from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis as well as 42 from patients with viral hepatitis and 50 from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) obtained from different sources. AlH cases were defined on the criteria of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (AIHG) and the recent recommendations for AlH issued by the American Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases (AASLD). PBC cases were defined on the basis of the consensus statements of both, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL): the presence of disease-related autoantibodies, more specifically AMA, is one of three criteria required for a definite diagnosis of PBC.

The samples were tested with the EUROlMMUN EUROLINE Profile Autoimmune Liver Disease $8 A 9$ (gG) and with the Inova ELISA kits as the predicate devices. To investigate the range close to the cut-off , 6 to 29 artificial samples for each antigen were created by mixing positive samples with negative samples of the same matrix as diluent these samples were tested with the relevant reference ELiAs only, resulting in different total numbers. The results of the study are shown in the table below. Borderline results (Inova) were not included in the agreement calculations. $9 5 \%$ C.I.'s were calculated by the exact method.

The EUROLINE was slightly more sensitive for the detection of gp210 than the predicate assay assay. The predicate assay uses a synthetic peptide corresponding to a 25 amino acid stretch in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of gp210. In contrast, the EUROLINE utilizes a recombinant polypeptide corresponding to the 15 kDa C-terminal portion of the perinuclear domain fused to the whole cytosolic domain of gp210. The "discrepant" samples in the comparison study are mainly from PBC patients.

b. Matrix comparison:

The use of EDTA, heparin (Li) and citrate plasma samples was confirmed for each antigen band by a correlation of 8 to 11 sample pairs of serum and corresponding plasma. The sample pairs were selected to cover.the complete range of results (negative, positive and close to cut-ff. The results of the plasma samples and the corresponding serum sample were compared and found to be sufficient as no positive sample was found negative and vice versa.
