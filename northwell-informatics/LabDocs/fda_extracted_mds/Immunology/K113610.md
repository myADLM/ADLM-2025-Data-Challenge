The BioPlex 2200 Medical Decision Support Software (MDSS), used in conjunction with the ANA Screen, is an optional laboratory tool that associates patient antibody results from the ANA Screen with predefined MDSS profiles that have been correlated with the following systemic autoimmune diseases: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD), Sjögren's Syndrome (SS), Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis) and Polymyositis.

# Device Description

The ANA Screen detects the presence of clinically relevant circulating autoantibodies in serum or plasma. These autoantibodies may be useful as an aid in the diagnosis of systemic rheumatic diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD), Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD), Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis), Dermatomyositis, Polymyositis, Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), CREST Syndrome, and Raynaud's Phenomenon. Bio-Rad's ANA Screen uses a comprehensive group of autoantigens. Beads are individually coated with individual antigens, so that the presence of each antinuclear and autoimmune antibody can be individually determined. Fluorescence detection facilitates the differentiation of normal and abnormal antibody concentrations.

The ANA Screen uses multiplex flow immunoassay, a methodology that resembles traditional EIA, but permits simultaneous detection and identification of many antibodies in a single tube. Thirteen (13) different populations of dyed beads are coated with antigens associated with systemic autoimmune disease (dsDNA, Chromatin, Ribosomal Protein, SS-A 60, SS-A 52, SS-B, Sm, SmRNP, RNP A, RNP 68, Scl-70, Jo-1 and Centromere $\mathrm { B } ) ^ { * }$ . The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent into a reaction vessel. The mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ . After a wash cycle, murine monoclonal anti-human IgG antibody, conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads and this mixture is incubated at $3 7 \%$ The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer.

The bead mixture is suspended in sheath fluid and then passes through the detector and the identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes. Individually dyed with combinations of two different fluorescent dyes (red and orange), a bead may have one of many possible levels of classifier dye fluorescent intensities. Based on it's fluorescent signature, each bead is classified to it's own unique region. Bio-Rad has used the various combinations of dyes to create 25 uniquely color-coded regions that are associated with 25 unique sets of beads (more can be added if needed). The detector measures at least 200 beads for each analyte, per specimen. The BioPlex 2200 ANA Screen utilizes one of these regions for each of the 13 analytes it detects. Three additional regions are assigned to beads used for quality control purposes. The bead regions used by the BioPlex 2200 ANA Screen are defined in the table below.

While the identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the attached PE. Raw data is calculated in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) and fluorescence ratio (FR).

Three additional dyed beads, Internal Standard Bead (ISB), Serum Verification Bead (SVB) and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction vessel and the absence of significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma. Refer to the BioPlex 2200 System Operation Manual for more information. The instrument is calibrated using a calibrator set, supplied separately by Bio-Rad Laboratories. For dsDNA, six (6) different levels of antibody concentrations are used for quantitative calibration, and results for patient samples are expressed in $\mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ Results of $\leq 4 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ are negative, $5 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 9 \mathrm { ~ I U / m L }$ are indeterminate, and results of $1 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ or higher are considered positive for dsDNA antibody. For the other twelve (12) beads, four (4) vials representing four (4) different antibody concentrations are used for semi-quantitative calibration. The result for each of

Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc Special 510(k): Device Modification BioPlex 2200 ANA Screen with MDSS

these antibodies is expressed as an antibody index (AI). An AI of 1.0 indicates an antibody cut-off concentration that corresponds to approximately the 99th percentile of values obtained from a non-diseased population; results of 1.0 or higher are reported as positive. Results of $< 1 . 0$ are reported as negative.

\* In cases where either SS-A 60 and/or SS-A 52 are positive, results are reported as positive for SS-A, and when either RNP A and/or RNP 68 are positive, results are reported as positive for RNP.

The BioPlex 2200 Medical Decision Support Software (MDSS) is a pattern recognition algorithm that can enhance the performance of the ANA Screen by identifying associated diagnostic patterns among its multiple assay results. The MDSS can suggest one or more possible disease associations after identifying patterns from the eleven (1 1) individual antibody results. The MDSS is based on the principles of the $\mathbf { \hat { \mu } } ^ { \mathbf { 6 6 } } \mathbf { k } .$ -nearest neighbor"ll (kNN) statistical technique. Each "unknown" is compared to a pre-established database that contains the results for over 1,400 characterized sera/plasma. Results of MDSS analysis fall into one of the following general outcomes; Negative, No Association, or Association with Disease. When the results of the MDSS analysis fall into the Association with Disease category, the MDSS software will propose a maximum of two disease classifications based upon the similarity of the current analysis to the stored results. The MDSS output can also aid in determining appropriate additional autoimmune serological testing. A description of the BioPlex 2200 ANA Screen with MDSS is included in the pre-market notification submission k043341.

# Summary of Design Control Activities

A Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) was used to facilitate, capture, and quantify potential impacts of false positive or negative patient results. The Risk Priority Number (RPN) is a quantitative measure of the combined effects of severity, occurrence, and detection of potential risks. Specific mitigations are recommended that may include changes to the design or formulation if the RPN score exceeds a chosen threshold.

The Design Control Activities include Risk Analysis method to identify the verification and validation activities required, test used and acceptance criteria.

Based on the conclusion of the risk management report, the modified QC procedure fulfills the requirements of the specifications of the design control process. Therefore, the performance of the modified QC test frequency is substantially equivalent to the current
