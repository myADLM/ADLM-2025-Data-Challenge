# L. Test Principle:

The concentration of the soluble antigen is assessed by turbidimetry. The test sample is added to a solution containing the appropriate antibody in a reaction cuvette. A beam of light is passed through the cuvette and is increasingly scattered by the formation of insoluble immune complexes. Light scatter is monitored by measuring the decrease in intensity of the incident beam of light. The antibody in the cuvette is in excess so the amount of immune complex formed is proportional to the antigen concentration. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed to produce a calibration curve of measured light scatter versus antigen concentration. Samples of unknown antigen concentration can then be assayed and the results read from the calibration curve. The polyclonal sheep anti-free light chain antibody is coated onto polystyrene latex in order to increase the relative light-scattering signal of the antigen-antibody complexes, and thereby increase the sensitivity of the assay.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study was performed according to CLSI EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition. Three urine samples with low, medium and high concentrations of the measuring range were tested over 21 days with 2 runs per day and each sample in duplicate per run. One lot of reagents and three analyzers were used. The acceptance criterion of total precision $C V \leq 1 5 \%$ was met.

A lot-to-lot variability study was also performed. Two urine samples with low and medium concentrations of the measuring range were tested over 21 days with 2 runs per day and each sample in duplicate per run. Three lots of reagents and three analyzers were used. The acceptance criterion of total precision $\leq 1 5 \%$ was met.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted based on CLSI EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of the Quantitative Measurement Procedure: A Statistical Approach;

Approved Guideline. Linear ranges were established using a dilution series of 9-11 concentrations $\mathrm { ( k a p p a 1 . 1 0 - 3 2 4 . 4 9 3 \ m g / L ) }$ . An unprocessed urine sample with high analyte concentration was diluted with instrument diluent. Clinical samples were monoclonal samples from myeloma patients. The acceptance criteria for each concentration were met (i.e., mean recovery $\pm 2 0 \%$ and $\% \mathrm { C V } < 1 0 \%$ ).

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Kappa</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range (mg/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.10-324.49</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.44-14.36</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99(0.9, 1.01)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.96(0.93, 1.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y-intercept(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.75(-2.82, 4.33)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.36(-0.68, -0.04)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{}$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9977</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9914</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Recovery</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90.6-117.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>87.1-100</td></tr></table>

The measuring ranges when using the standard 1:10 dilution are $4 . 0 { - } 1 8 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ for kappa free light chains. This is consistent with previously cleared submission for serum (k062372).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

There are no reference analytes or standards for this method. A calibrator set and two controls are provided in each kit. No changes were made from the previous cleared submissions (k062372 and k040009).

Kit Stability: No change from previous cleared submission.

Urine Stability: The stability of free light chains in urine was evaluated. A high and a low sample were evaluated at three time points: day 0, two weeks, and one month. Each sample was divided into two lots; one was stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and the other at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The difference in results compared to the initial time point (day 0) was determined, and a difference $\leq 2 0 \%$ was considered acceptable. Kit controls were processed in each run as a quality control measure. From the results below, it was concluded that free light chains are stable in urine at $4 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ for at least 28 days.

# d. Detection limit:

A study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. Instrument diluent (saline) was used as the blank sample, and diluted urine samples of known low analyte concentrations were used to determine the limit of detection. The limit of detection was below the measuring range.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Testing was conducted according to CLSI EP7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition. High concentrations of hemoglobin, bilirubin, ascorbic acid and albumin were spiked into urine samples (containing approximately 32 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ kappa) and compared to matched samples without interferent. For albumin, a concentration series up to $5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L }$ was evaluated, and the maximum level of acceptable interference $( \leq 1 5 \% )$ was observed at 1.25 $\mathrm { g / L }$ .

ii. Antigen Excess: Antigen excess was studied previously for serum samples (under k062372). The suitability of the previously determined prozone limits was assessed for urine samples. A series of four high concentration monoclonal urine samples with analyte levels from $3 9 0 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ to 16249 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ were tested at 1/10 dilution. All samples were correctly flagged as antigen excess by the $\mathrm { S P A } _ { \mathrm { P L U S } }$ analyzer. The product insert warns that the amino acid composition of monoclonal free light chains may influence the level at which a sample may show antigen excess. Antigen excess for polyclonal serum samples remains unchanged.

iii. Cross Reactivity: Cross reactivity to whole immunoglobulins was previously carried out with serum samples.

f. Assay cut-off: See Expected values.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Results from the Freelite $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ kits evaluated on the SPAPLUS analyzer were compared to results obtained with the kits on the Hitachi Modular $\mathrm { P }$ analyzer (predicate). Clinical samples (myeloma) were obtained from a medical school in the UK and normal samples were obtained from adult donors in the UK. All samples were tested within 14 days of collection and stored at $4 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . 121 samples were evaluated (concentrations ranging from $0 . 8 8 \mathrm { m g / L }$ to 87110 $\mathrm { m g / L ) }$ ; one sample was a within method outlier with insufficient volume for reanalysis. Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis was performed with the following results:

Regression equation $\mathbf { y } { = } 1 . 0 4 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 9 2$ The $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for the slope are 0.99 – 1.07.   
The upper limit of the reference range is $3 2 . 7 1 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .   
The bias is $2 . 1 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ at the upper limit of the reference range $6 . 5 \%$ bias).   
The bias is $1 4 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ at $4 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ $3 . 7 \%$ bias).
