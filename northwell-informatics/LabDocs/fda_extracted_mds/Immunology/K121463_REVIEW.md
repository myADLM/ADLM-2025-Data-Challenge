# L. Test Principle:

The allergen of interest covalently coupled to the ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific IgE in the patients plasma/serum sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with the developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgE present in the specimen. To evaluate the rest results, the response for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

i. Within-Lot Imprecision:

Imprecision of the allergen was evaluated by using two positive plasma samples, including a low range sample $( 0 . 3 5 \pm 2 5 \% )$ and a high range sample $( \ge 0 . 7 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } )$ . Each sample was tested in 4 replicates in 1 assay run per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using Phadia 250. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance $( \% C V )$ were calculated for each component and each sample separately. The results are summarized in the following tables:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity was assessed following the CLSI/LA20-A2 guidelines using one lot of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use using instrument Phadia 250. The working range for ImmunoCAP Specific Total IgE is LoD to $1 0 0 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ .

Three positive samples were each diluted in negative sample generating at least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions (the highest level tested was 147.54 $\mathrm { k U _ { A } / L ) }$ . Undiluted and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run. The results of the replicates from all three samples for each level were pooled. The observed values were graphed against the expected values and linear regression was performed. The provided regression equation is as follows:

$\mathrm { y = 0 } . 9 8 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 1$ $( \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 )$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI for slope 0.97 to 0.98 and for intercept 0.00 to 0.03)

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the 2nd International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).

# Stability:

The real time stability study was performed to demonstrate 24-month stability of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex at recommended storage temperature of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The study was planned in accordance with CEN 13640 (Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents). Three lots of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen $\mathbf { k } 8 2$ , Latex were stored at recommended storage temperature, $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use, using Phadia 250. Two positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma) were tested in duplicates in one assay at different time intervals (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 25 months). The mean concentrations were calculated for each sample at each test occasion. The results were compared to the results of the same samples tested at time 0. The results support the manufacture’s claim of 24 months stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The stability of the calibration curve, real time, and on-board stability of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator are detailed in k100999.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex on the Phadia 250 in alignment with CLSI EP17-A. The LoB was based on single determinations of 100 negative samples (blank samples) and was estimated as the $9 5 \%$ percentile of the distribution. LoD was calculated according to the equation: $\mathrm { L o D = L o B + }$ $\mathbf { c } _ { \mathrm {  B } } \bullet \mathbf { S } \mathbf { D }$ where SD, the standard deviation, was based on 20 determinations of 3 low positive samples, in total 60 determinations. The results are shown in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Allergen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB (kUA/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD (kUA/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>k82, Latex</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.041</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.051</td></tr></table>

# e. Analytical specificity:

Immunological specificity of latex allergen solution as bound to the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex was verified through competitive inhibition. The study was planned in accordance with CLSI I/LA20-A2.

The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose dependent inhibition. A positive sample with the specific IgE concentration at $1 0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ was used in the study. Equal volumes of the positive sample and varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor) were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for 1 hour before being analyzed with ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex on Phadia 250 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was performed in duplicates in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.

The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in $\%$ , calculated according to the formula below:

$\left( 1 - \left( \frac { r - b } { t - b } \right) \right) \times 1 0 0 = \dot { 1 } \%$ $\mathbf { r } =$ response [RU] ${ \mathfrak { b } } =$ background response ( $100 \%$ inhibition) [RU] $\mathbf { t } =$ total response $0 \%$ inhibition) [RU] $\mathrm { i } =$ inhibition

Any negative inhibition $\%$ -values are shown as $0 \%$ inhibition.

The results of inhibitions study showed that about $50 \%$ inhibition was achieved with related inhibitor (k82, Latex) at a final inhibitor concentration of ${ \sim } 3 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three from unrelated groups (Aspergillus terreus, Storage mite, and Sunflower) and one from the related/same group (k84, Sunflower seed) did not show any significant inhibition at $3 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ inhibitor concentration. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.

# $f .$ Assay cut-off:

Limit of Quantitation for ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is $0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ . All results ${ > } 0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ are interpreted as being analytically positive.
