# Executive Summary

Detailed performance characteristics and comparison analysis are given in this filing that demonstrates substantial equivalence of the hsCRP POC Assay Kit to predicate device that is currently being marketed. The performance characteristics of the hsCRP POC Assay Kit are substantially similar to that of the approved predicate device (K103557). Performance data and risk analysis indicates that differences should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the hsCRP POC Assay and offers POL users an in vitro diagnostic device system to measure CRP in human venous whole blood samples.

# Intended Use:

The Diazyme high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) POC Test Kit is for the in vitro quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human venous whole blood on SMART analyzers. Measurement of CRP is of use for the detection and evaluation of inflammatory disorders and associated diseases, infection and tissue injury. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

The Diazyme hsCRP POC Control set is intended for use as quality controls for the Diazyme hsCRP POC Test Kit. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

Device Description:

# Clinical Significance

CRP (C-reactive protein) is an acute phase protein whose concentration is seen to increase as a result of the inflammatory process, most notably in response to pneumococcal (bacterial) infectious, histolytic disease and a variety of disease states. Originally discovered by Tillet et al. in 1930 in patient sera with acute infection, CRP has now come to be used as a marker or general diagnostic indicator of infections and inflammation, in addition to serving as a monitor of patient response to therapy and surgery. Furthermore, regular measurements of CRP in infants can be a useful aid in the early diagnosis of infectious disease.

# Assay Principle

Diazyme's hsCRP POC Test Kit is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay on Diazyme's SMART analyzer. Agglutination occurs when an antigen-antibody reaction occurs between CRP in a sample and anti-CRP which has been sensitized to latex particles. This agglutination is detected as an absorbance change $( 7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m } )$ , with the magnitude of the change being proportional to the quantity of CRP in the sample. The instrument calculates the CRP concentration of patient specimen by use of a lot specific calibration curve that is stored in an RFID card provided with each hsCRP POC kit. The RFID card is inserted in the SMART analyzer and is needed for every single run.

Diazyme hsCRP POC Control Kit is intended for use as quality controls for the Diazyme hsCRP POC Test Kit and is packaged separately. The quality controls assist laboratory users in verification steps ensuring that the assay reagents are functioning correctly. QC materials are run exactly as samples. Users are instructed to verify the calibration curve with the controls and run controls each time a new lot of reagents are received. If QC materials fall outside laboratory acceptable range, users are instructed to re-test and call manufacturer customer service if problem persists.

SMART Analyzer (K092911) is a compact cuvette based spectrophotometer (10 inches x 5.5 inches $\tt { x 5 . 5 }$ inches) machine for point-of-care testing designed to analyze readings from single use reagent cuvette. The instrument only uses the Diazyme Reagent System (DRS) cuvette and caps and performs assay with a preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card. The DRS cuvette is supplied prefilled with Reagent 1 (R1) and the DRS cap is supplied prefilled with Re

agent 2 (R2). The DRS cuvette and caps are kept separate until use. Users are instructed (see proposed labeling) to add $2 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of sample to the DRS cuvette prefilled with R1 containing proper amount of detergent for whole blood lysis. Users are then instructed to snap in place DRS cap and insert into analyzer. The instrument warms the cuvette to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and after a predefined period adds the reagent R2 found in the DRS cap. The reagents and samples are mixed magnetically and absorbance readings are taken at $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .The lot specific RFID card contains reagent addition time, mixing time, reading time and calibration curve.

The Diazyme hsCRP POC Test Kit system thus consists of the following:

hsCRP POC Test Kit. Reagents are provided in prefilled tubes, cuvettes and cuvette caps. The DRS cuvette and cuvette caps can only work with the SMART analyzer.   
hsCRP POC Control Kit. Controls are provided for quality control of the hsCRP POC Assay.

# Expected value/Reference range

Previously established for predicate devices

To verify the transferability of the reference interval from the predicate device, whole blood samples from 150 apparently healthy individuals were tested using the Diazyme hsCRP POC Test according to CLSI C28-A3 guideline. The 150 whole blood samples were from apparently healthy male and female adults $\geq 1 8$ years of age. The expected normal range is verified: $< 5 . 0$ EY $\mathrm { { \ m g / L } }$ in $9 5 \%$ of the population tested.
