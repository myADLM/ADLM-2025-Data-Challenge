# L. Test Principle:

Diazyme’s hsCRP POC Test Kit is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay on Diazyme’s SMART analyzer. (The SMART Analyzer was cleared under k092911). When an antigen-antibody reaction occurs between CRP in a sample and anti-CRP which has been sensitized to latex particles agglutination results. This agglutination is detected as an absorbance change $( 7 0 0 \mathrm { n m } )$ , with the magnitude of the change being proportional to the quantity of CRP in the sample. The instrument calculates the CRP concentration of patient specimen by use of a lot specific calibration curve that is stored in an RFID card provided with each hsCRP POC kit. The RFID card is inserted in the SMART analyzer and is needed for every single run.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

A set of eleven levels of linearity materials were prepared by diluting a whole blood sample containing $2 8 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ of C Reactive Protein (CRP) with saline according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP6- A and were tested with the Diazyme C Reactive Protein POC Test in triplicate on the SMART Analyzer. Testing included samples with concentrations near the LoQ. Conclusion: Linearity data and the LOQ data support Analytical Measuring Range (AMR) of $0 . 4 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ to 23.00 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ .

The regression equation yielded slope of 0.996; intercept of -0.0065 and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ of 0.9999.

The package insert recommends diluting samples with $\mathrm { C R P } > 2 3 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ 1:1 with saline. To demonstrate validity, 3 whole blood samples (spiked) containing CRP near the upper detection limit of $2 6 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP were diluted 1:1 with saline and tested on the SMART analyzer. Recoveries based on dilutions were all within $9 5 \%$ of the expected concentrations.

No high does hook effect was observed for samples with concentrations up to $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Calibrator

The instrument calculates the CRP concentration of patient specimen by use of a lot specific calibration curve that is stored in an RFID card provided with each hsCRP POC kit. The RFID card is inserted in the SMART analyzer and is needed for every single run.

The hsCRP POC assay calibration is traceable to Diazyme CRP calibrators (k103557) which are in turn traceable to IFCC International Reference Preparation for C Reactive Protein in the human serum reference material ERM®-DA472/IFCC.

# Control material

Control material target values are assigned based on the mean of replicate values on the SMART analyzer. The range is assigned as the mean $+ / - 1 5 \%$ . Stability protocols and criteria were included within the 510(k).

Stability testing was provided to support the claim of 1 month at 2-8 degrees C for opened vials, and 12 month shelf life. Real-time stability studies are ongoing.

# d. Detection limit:

LOB and LOD were calculated based on CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation using whole blood samples (except for true blanks which were phosphate buffered saline. Based on this analysis:

LoB was estimated as $0 . 0 5 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . LoD was estimated as $0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$

To calculate the LoQ of the Diazyme hsCRP POC Test, five patient whole blood samples were diluted to concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ . The diluted samples were tested with the Diazyme hsCRP POC Test on SMART analyzers for 20 replicates over 5 days. At the claimed LoQ of 0.47 (CV observed in this evaluation was $1 7 \%$ and observed bias was $8 . 4 \%$ .

The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is $0 . 4 7 - 2 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Common endogenous substance interference Potential interferents were evaluated using whole blood samples containing “low” (near $1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ CRP) and “high” $4 - 5 \log / \mathrm { d L }$ CRP) C Reactive Protein spiked with various concentrations of substances according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP7-A “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry”: dose-response guidelines. Each sample spiked with interference substances was tested in triplicates and compared to control samples without potential interferents.

The interference substances examined and their concentrations tested are listed in the following table:
