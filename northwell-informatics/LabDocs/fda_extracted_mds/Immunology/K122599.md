# G. Intended Use:

The ADVIA® Chemistry Myoglobin assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative measurement of myoglobin in human serum or plasma on the ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Chemistry systems. Measurement of myoglobin aids in the rapid diagnosis of heart or renal disease.

The ADVIA Chemistry Myoglobin calibrator is for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of ADVIA® Chemistry system for Myoglobin assay.

# H. Device Description:

The Myoglobin reagents are ready-to-use liquid reagents packaged for use on the automated ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system. They are supplied as a 100 tests/wedge, 2 wedges/kit. ADVIA Chemistry Myoglobin calibrator is a single analyte, human serum based product containing myoglobin derived from human heart source. The kit consists of 1 vial each of 4 calibrator levels which are lyophilized. The target concentrations of these calibrators are 50, 100, 200, and 720 ng/mL. The volume per vial (after reconstitution with deionized water) is $1 . 0 \mathsf { m L }$ . Deionized water is recommended to be used as a zero calibrator.

# 1. Test Principle:

In the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry Myoglobin assay, sample is diluted and then mixed with the R1 reagent (a buffer), followed by an addition of the R2 reagent (which contains latex particles coated with antibodies specific for myoglobin). The formation of the

antibody-antigen complex during the reaction results in an increase in turbidity, which is measured at 571 nm. By constructing a standard curve from the absorbance of standards, myoglobin concentration of sample can be determined.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Reference

Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second Edition (CLSI EP07-A2)   
Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline (CLSI EP17-A)   
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline-Second Edition (CLSI EP05-A2)

# L. Performance Characteristics

Substantial equivalence was demonstrated by testing several performance characteristics including imprecision, method comparison, interfering substances and analytical range. All of the evaluation studies gave acceptable results when compared to the predicate device. These studies support that the ADVIA $\circled{8}$ 1650 Chemistry Myoglobin Assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

# I. Precision

Within run and Total Precision were established by assaying serum sample pools and serum based controls. Each sample was assayed 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day, for at least 20 days (Serum Pool 1 was assayed over a period of 5 days in a separate study). Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline.

# II. Linearity/assay reportable range

A linearity study across the entire measuring range was assessed using low and high serum pools. The low and high pools were mixed to make nine (9) intermediate levels and additional 2 levels at the low end of the assay. All samples were tested on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry analyzer. The range of samples tested was from 13-817 ng/mL. The observed values were compared to the expected values. Linear/measuring range of the assay is 22 to 680 ng/mL. The low end of the assay range is calculated based on the Limit of Quantitation. The high end of the assay range is based on lowest possible value of the high calibrator and linearity calculations.

# III. Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection, Limit of Quantitation

The estimations of the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were performed according to CLSI guideline EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation, by running 160 replicates of "zero" serum pool and several serum pools with myoglobin concentration up to $4 \times \mathsf { L O D }$ level. Data supports the following claims: LoB $\lneq$ 12 ng/mL, $L \circ \mathsf { D } = 2 1$ E $\mathsf { n g / m L . L o Q } = 2 2 \mathsf { n g / m L }$ EP

# IV. Method and matrix comparison with predicate device

The performance of the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry Myoglobin assay (y) for serum samples was compared with the performance of ADVIA Centaur Myoglobin assay (x). Seventyone serum samples were tested. One sample was removed from calculations for being out of assay range. The sample results ranged from 19.9 - 684.0 ng/mL myoglobin $( \boldsymbol { \mathsf { x } } )$ and gave a correlation coefficient of 0.99. The results calculated using least squares linear regression ( $1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ replicate) are as follows:

ADVIA 1650 Chemistry Myoglobin $= 0 . 9 6$ (predicate device) $^ +$ 12.5 ng/mL   
Slope $9 5 \% 0$ : 0.95 - 0.98   
Intercept $9 5 \%$ CI: 8.3- 16.7

# V. Matrix comparison with predicate device

The performance of the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry assay (y) for plasma samples on ADVIA 1650 was compared with the performance of ADVIA Centaur Myoglobin assay (x). Sixty four plasma samples were tested; the sample results ranged from 18.9 - 624.1 ng/mL myoglobin $( { \pmb x } )$ , and gave a correlation coefficient of 0.99. The results calculated using linear regression $1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ replicate) are as follows:

ADVIA 1650 Chemistry Myoglobin $= 0 . 9 8$ (predicate device) $^ +$ 14.1 ng/mL   
Slope 95%CI: 0.96 - 1.00   
Intercept $9 5 \%$ CI: 8.1 -20.1

# VI. Analytical specificity

Interferences from icterus, lipemia, hemolysis, total protein and rheumatoid factor were evaluated in the Myoglobin assay using a significance criterion of $> 1 0 \%$ variance from the control. No significant interference was found at unconjugated bilirubin levels from 0-60 mg/dL in 50, 100, and 400 ng/mL myoglobin samples. No significant interference was found at conjugated bilirubin levels from 0-60 mg/dL in 50, 100, and 400 ng/mL myoglobin samples. No significant lipemia interference was found at Intralipid levels from $0 { \cdot } 1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in a 100 and 400 ng/mL myoglobin samples, and at Intralipid levels from $0 { \cdot } 7 5 0 \mathrm { m } 9 / \mathrm { d L }$ in a 50 ng/mL myoglobin sample. No significant hemoglobin interference was found at hemoglobin levels from 0-1000 mg/dL in a 400 ng/mL myoglobin sample, at hemoglobin levels from 0-500 mg/dL in a 100 ng/mL myoglobin sample, and at hemoglobin levels from 0-250 mg/dL in a 50 ng/mL myoglobin sample. Hemolysed samples should not be used. No significant interference was found at total protein levels from $0 . 1 3 9 / \mathrm { d L }$ in a 50, 100, and $4 0 0 \approx 1 0 0 / m L$ myoglobin samples. No significant interference was found at RF levels from $0 { - } 8 0 0 \cup { } \mathrm { { U / L } }$ in a 50, 100, and 400 ng/mL myoglobin samples.

# VII. Reference Range

The reference range for the assay is $\mathrm { < 1 1 0 . 0 \ n g / m L }$ $( < 1 1 0 . 0 \mu \mathfrak { g } / \ L )$ . Results above 110 ng/mL( $1 1 0 . 0 \mu \mathfrak { g } / \mathfrak { m } \mu )$ are highly suggestive of an early onset of myocardial necrosis. The reference range was established previously for the predicate device. ADVIA Chemistry Myoglobin reference range is based on substantial equivalence to the predicate device (method comparison studies and the normal range verification study). Siemens provides this information for reference. As with all in vitro diagnostic assays, each laboratory should determine its own reference ranges for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.
