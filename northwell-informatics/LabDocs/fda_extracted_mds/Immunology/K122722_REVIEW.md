M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

All studies were performed on the cobas c 501 Analyzer

# 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Assay within lot precision was determined according to CLSI EP5-A2 with a study that measured pooled human sera samples (7.0, 16.1, 30.9 and 79.4 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ and plasma-based control samples using one lot of reagent in two aliquots per run and 2 runs per day for 21 days.

The 20 day results for the single site are summarized below as sample overall mean Lp(a) concentration in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , computed SDs and $\% C V s$ for within run precision and total precision between runs and between days.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity of this $\operatorname { L p } ( { \mathsf { a } } )$ assay for pooled human sera and pooled human plasma samples was assessed according to CLSI EP6- A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach, in one run using one lot of reagents with each sample tested in triplicate. Two separate dilution series of 9 samples each from high to low concentration Lp(a) were prepared by adding $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl to pooled human sera and to pooled human plasma that contained Lp(a) at a concentration above the measuring range. This yielded linearity samples with Lp(a) levels that spanned a range from 1.3 to $9 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis that included unweighted regression models. Nonlinearity did not deviate more than $10 \%$ from linearity for serum samples. Nonlinearity did not deviate more than $2 \%$ from linearity for plasma samples.

A linear regression line and second and third order polynomials were fitted to the data. Sponsor evaluated results and significance of the second and third order polynomials by comparing to in-house acceptance criteria for deviation from linearity.

The fitted linear models are:

Serum: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 0 0 0 8 + 1 . 0 0 0 0 \mathbf { x }$

Plasma: $\mathbf { y } = - 0 . 2 8 9 6 + 1 . 0 0 3 9 \mathbf { x }$ where $\mathrm { y } = \mathrm { L p } ( \mathrm { a } ) \left( \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } \right)$ and $\mathbf { X } =$ theoretical concentration.

The sponsor demonstrated linearity across the claimed measuring range of the device from $6 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (from assay LoQ to upper limit).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Preciset Lp(a) Gen.2 calibrators are a set of five lyophilized pooled plasma standards that are value assigned to an in-house primary reference standard known as Standard Human Lp(a) and secondary in house standard via a commercially available method. For routine calibrator lots, samples are assayed in triplicate and value assigned according to the secondary in house reference material and checked per value assigned controls.

PreciControl Lp(a) Gen.2 controls are lyophilized pooled human plasma and set to low $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and high $( 4 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) Lp(a) levels. These Lp(a) controls are value assigned to the secondary in-house reference material by assaying in triplicate on the cobas c 501 Analyzer.

Stability:

Reagent, calibrator and control stability is based on shelf-life and open on board stability studies and includes studies with storage at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 150 hrs to mimic transport. The proposed protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.

# d. Detection limit:

LoB, LoD and LoQ studies were performed based upon CLSI EP-17A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation (LoQ).

# LoB Test Protocol

One (1) blank sample was tested on two (2) cobas c 501 analyzers with three (3) reagent lots for six runs of 5 replicates each run yielding 60 measurements per lot.

LoB was defined as the concentration at which there is a $9 5 \%$ probability that the sample is analyte-free and was calculated as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of 60 runs which was the average of the $5 7 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and the $5 8 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ value.

# LoD Test Protocol

Five samples with low analyte concentration (up to 4X LOB) were measured on two (2) cobas c 501 analyzers with three (3) reagent lots for six runs of singlicates for each run yielding 60 measurements per lot.

LoD was calculated using equation 3 from CLSI Document EP17-A (page 17) $\mathrm { L O D } = \mathrm { c } \beta \mathrm { S D s }$ .

# LoQ Test Protocol

A low level sample set of six was measured in singlicate using 3 reagent lots on two (2) cobas c 501 analyzers for 3 days with 2 runs per day. The LoQ sample was observed to have $\leq 1 9 . 9 \%$ total error between the measured value and the calculated value.

$\mathrm { L o B } = 3 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $\mathrm { L o D } = 4 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $\mathrm { L o Q } = 6 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ e. Analytical specificity:

i. Interference from endogenous substances/cross reactants.

Testing was performed to determine whether the presence of endogenous substances such as hemoglobin, lipids (using intralipid as a mimic), rheumatoid factor, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin may interfere with assay results.

Two human serum samples were used with $\operatorname { L p } ( { \mathfrak { a } } )$ concentrations of $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample level was spiked with varying levels of interferent for a total of 11 dilution steps per interferent (8 for RF, 5 for plasminogen and apolipoprotein B). The two sets of samples were tested in triplicate and median values used to calculate $\%$ recovery (measured concentration compared to Lp(a) concentration with zero interferent). Observed maximum interference was $5 \%$ at the following levels of interferent:

# ii. Interference from common drugs

Two human serum samples were used with Lp(a) concentrations of $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $4 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample pool was divided into 17 aliquots. One aliquot was not spiked with any drugs and was used as the reference sample. The remaining samples were spiked with the respective amount of drug. Then the concentration of Lp(a) was determined in triplicate and compared to the reference aliquot. Lp(a) recovery was within $\pm 5 \%$ for the tested analyte concentrations.

No intereference was found at therapeutic concentration of any of the following drugs: acetylcysteine, ampicillin-Na, ascorbic acid, cyclosporine, cefoxitin, heparin, levodopa, methyldopa, metronidazole, doxycycline, acetylsalicylic acid, rifampicin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, theophylline.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

g. Additional studies Dilution study to validate re-run function.

One sample each at the lower end, middle and the upper end of the extended measuring range was diluted manually and automatically (1:3). The manually and automatically diluted and the neat samples were measured with 3-fold dilutions. All results were within $10 \%$ .

High dose hook effect studies.

Two samples with high concentrations of $\operatorname { L p } ( { \mathsf { a } } )$ (higher than the measuring range claim of $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were diluted with native serum with an Lp(a) concentration of about $1 { - } 2 \ \mathrm { m g / d L \ L p ( a ) }$ . These samples are diluted in 11 steps. Each dilution was measured in triplicate.

No hook effect was seen up to $1 9 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

To demonstrate substantial equivalence, a method comparison study was performed on 159 human serum samples ranging from 6 to $7 9 . 9 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Lp(a) were tested by the Roche cobas c 501 Tina-quant Lp(a) assay (expressed as $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ and predicate on the Hitachi 917 (expressed as $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). The method comparison study was performed according to CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. Samples were tested in singlicate and no spiked or diluted samples were included.

Lp(a) Passing Bablok Regression $( \mathrm { n } = 1 5 9 )$ ) with $9 5 \%$ CI indicated in parentheses.

slope $= 0 . 9 6 7$ (0.948 – .983) y-intercept $= - 0 . 1 0 5$ (-0.392 to -0.218) $\mathrm { \dot { r } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 \mathrm { \dot { 5 } }$

The sponsor provided additional method comparison data to support that Roche Tina-Quant Lp(a) assay was not sensitive to the size heterogeneity of protein (a) isoforms. Experiments were done using samples with Lp(a) concentrations that covered the measuring range and compared to an ELISA method that was standardized via Western Blot analysis to known protein(a) isoforms.

slope $= 0 . 9 8 1$   
y-intercept $= - 0 . 5 5 1$   
$\dot { \mathrm { \bf ~ r } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 \dot { 5 } 0$

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

The following sample types can be used for the cobas c Tina-quant Lipoprotein (a) Gen.2 assay: Serum, Gel separated Serum, Lithium heparin plasma, K2EDTA Plasma, K3EDTA Plasma. To demonstrate that gel separation serum, lithium heparin plasma, K2EDTA plasma, and K3EDTA plasma are supported for use with this assay, matrix comparison studies were run using serum as the comparator. Samples were tested in singlicate.

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor provides the following information in the package insert.

The defined threshold of Lp(a) concentration at which individuals can be classified as being at increased risk varies greatly among studies, ranging from 20 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A Lp(a) concentration of $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , corresponding to the $7 5 ^ { \mathrm { { \bar { t h } } } }$ percentile in a male Caucasian reference population is widely used as cut-off

point or threshold value.1,2

The European Atherosclerosis Society recommends screening for elevated Lp(a) in those at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk and defines a desirable Lp(a) level $\leq 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .3

Different Lp(a) levels can be found in different racial/ethnicity groups.4,5

Since Lp(a) levels are largely influenced by hereditary factors, they vary with ethnic populations. Therefore, reference ranges have not been established for this assay for different ethnic populations or disease states. The sponsor states that each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if necessary determine its own reference range.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
