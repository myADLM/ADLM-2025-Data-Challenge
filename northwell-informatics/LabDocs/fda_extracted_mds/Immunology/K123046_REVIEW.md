# L. Test Principle:

In the ADVIA Chemistry Lipoprotein(a) assay, sample is diluted and then mixed with the R1 reagent (a buffer), followed by an addition of the R2 reagent (which contains latex particles coated with antibodies specific for Lipoprotein (a). The formation of the antibody-antigen complex during the reaction results in an increase in turbidity. This turbidity is measured at $6 9 4 \mathrm { n m }$ .

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): All studies were performed on the ADVIA 1650 Analyzer

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the Siemens $\operatorname { L p } ( { \mathsf { a } } )$ assay was evaluated according to CLSI document EP05-A2. In this study, 2 human serum pools spiked with Lp(a) to final concentrations 50 and $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 3 samples of a serum-based control material with approximate Lp(a) concentrations 7, 13 and $1 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were assayed 2 times per run at 2 runs a day for 20 days. Experiments were performed using two reagent lots on two ADVIA 1650 Analyzers . The sponsor provided representative results from a single lot that are included in the table below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor assessed linearity with one run using one lot of reagents with each sample tested in triplicate. Nine diluted samples with Lp(a) concentrations evenly distributed were prepared by mixing a high Lp(a) concentration serum pool and a low Lp(a) concentration serum pool in varying amounts. This yielded linearity samples with Lp(a) levels that spanned a range from 7.75 to $1 0 2 . 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The sponsor calculated linear regressions from mean observed versus expected value using an unweighted regression model and observed maximum $\%$ difference from observed values versus linear fit of $4 \%$ .

The fitted linear model is:

Serum: $\mathbf { y } = - 0 . 1 8 + 0 . 9 9 \mathbf { x }$

where $\mathrm { y } = \mathrm { L p } ( \mathrm { a } ) \left( \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } \right)$ and $\mathbf { X } =$ expected concentration.

The studies supported the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 10 – 85 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# High Dose Hook Effect

Sponsor performed additional hook effect studies and demonstrated no hook effect up to Lp(a) concentrations of $4 9 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrators are traceable to in-house Master Lot calibrators of human Lp(a) prepared volumetrically in human serum and value assigned via method comparison to a commercially available device.

Each lot of calibrators is then traceable to the Master Lot via the ADVIA

Lp(a) assay tested in multiple replicates. Newly value assigned lot calibrators are then confirmed through use in the Lp(a) assay by creating a calibration curve and then testing Master Lot, calibrators and controls against this calibration curve.

Reagent shelf life and on board stability protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found acceptable.

Calibrators are the same material as cleared in k011568. The claimed shelf life (closed) is 36 months. The sponsor demonstrated open vial stability of 14 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

LoB, LoD and LoQ studies were performed based upon CLSI EP-17A.

LoB Test Protocol

One blank sample was tested on two analyzers with 2 reagent lots for 4 replicates per run at 2 runs per day for 5 days yielding a total of 40 measurements per lot/analyzer.

LoB was defined as the concentration at which there is a $9 5 \%$ probability that the sample is analyte-free and was calculated as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of 40 runs.

# LoD Test Protocol

Five samples of the LoB pool were spiked with Lp(a) to yield samples with low analyte concentrations of 3.6, 4.8, 7.2 and $9 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were measured on 2 analyzers using 2 reagent lots for 4 replicates per run at 2 runs per day for 5 days yielding a total of 40 measurements per lot/analyzer.

LoD was then calculated nonparametrically as the lowest level material in which the $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile equals or exceeds the LoB.

# LoQ Test Protocol

LoQ was determined from the same 40 point data set used to generate LoD with an observed bias of $1 2 . 4 \%$ . Sponsor provided data to support $\mathrm { L o Q = }$ LoD.

Based on linearity studies and detection limit studies the sponsor provided data to support the following claims:

$\mathrm { L o B } = 6 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $\mathrm { L o D = 9 . 0 \ m g / d L }$ $\mathrm { L O Q } = 1 0 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ e. Analytical specificity:

Testing was performed according to CLSI EP07- to determine whether the presence of hemoglobin, triglycerides (using Intralipid as a mimic), conjugated and unconjugated Bilirubin may interfere with assay results.

Three human sera samples were used with Lp(a) concentrations of 15, 30 and $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample level was spiked with increasing amounts of interferents for a total of 5 samples with interferent with controls samples at each level that were not spiked. Then the spiked and unspiked samples were tested in duplicate and used to calculate $\%$ recovery (measured concentration compared to Lp(a) concentration with zero interferent). Lp(a) recovery of $\pm 1 0 \%$ of reference value was defined as acceptable by the sponsor.

The sponsor provided information that the apo(a) isoforms that are heterogenous with respect to size do not interfere with the assay. The assay gives an accurate test result for Lp(a) across apo(a) isoforms. The sponsor also provided information that plasminogen and apolipoprotein B do not interfere with the assay up to concentrations of $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ respectively.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

To characterize correlation to the predicate, a method comparison study was performed with 68 human sera samples with concentrations ranging from $1 1 -$ $8 1 . 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested by the Siemens ADVIA Lp(a) Assay (expressed as $\mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) and predicate on the Hitachi 717 (expressed as $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Samples were tested in duplicate and the first replicate analyzed by linear regression.

Data were analyzed by least squares linear regression with $9 5 \%$ CI indicated in parentheses:

slope $= 1 . 0 1$ (1.00 – 1.02) intercep $= - \ 1 . 0 2 \ ( - 1 . 4 7 - 0 . 5 7 )$ $\Gamma = 0 . 9 9$

b. Matrix comparison

To characterize correlation to the predicate for lithium heparin plasma, a method comparison study was performed with 44 human plasma samples with Lp(a) concentrations ranging from $1 2 - 8 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ tested by the Siemens ADVIA Lp(a) Assay (expressed as $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and the predicate device on the Hitachi 717 (expressed as $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Samples were tested in duplicate and the first replicate analyzed by linear regression.

Data were analyzed by least squares linear regression with $9 5 \%$ CI indicated in parentheses:

slope $= 1 . 0 1$ (0.99 – 1.02) intercept $= - 0 . 9 8 ( - 1 . 4 9 - - 0 . 4 7 ) ,$ $\Gamma = 0 . 9 9$ .

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor states the individual concentration of Lp(a) in the serum depends on genetic factors. The range of variation in a population is relatively large.1 Lp(a) values are known to vary with ethnicity. The sponsor recommends a cutoff for this assay of $< 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , however this is to be considered as a guideline. It is also recommended that each laboratory should determine its own reference ranges for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.
