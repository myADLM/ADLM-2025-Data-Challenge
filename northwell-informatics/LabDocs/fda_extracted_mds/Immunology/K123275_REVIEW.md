# L. Test Principle:

The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP, reacts with the specific IgE in the patient sample. After washing away non-specific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the responses for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

i) Within-Lot imprecision:

Imprecision of the individual allergen components was evaluated by using two positive plasma samples, including a low range sample $( 0 . 3 5 \pm 2 5 \% )$ and a high range sample $( \ge 0 . 7 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } )$ . Each sample was tested in 4 replicates in 1 assay run per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using Phadia 250. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance $( \% C V )$ were calculated for each component and each sample separately.

# ii) Lot-to-lot imprecision:

For each allergen, three different ImmunoCAP Allergen Component lots were tested using two positive plasma samples $0 . 3 5 \pm 2 5 \%$ and $\ge 0 . 7 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ ) and one negative plasma sample $( < 0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L ) }$ . For each lot the samples were tested in 12 replicates in one assay run. Each lot represented a different preparation of the allergen from routine production. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use using Phadia 250. Mean concentration values, $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and concentration quotients between lots were calculated for the positive samples.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the 2 individual allergens was assessed following the CLSI I/LA20- A2 guidelines. For each allergen component, three positive plasma samples were each diluted in negative plasma generating at least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions. Undiluted and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use using instrument Phadia 250. For each product one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was used. ImmunoCAP Specific Total IgE working range is LoD to100 $\mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ .

For each allergen, results of the replicates from all three samples were pooled and analyzed for linearity. Regression statistics for each allergen comparing the observed results to expected results are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i) Traceability:

The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the 2nd International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).

ii) Kit Stability:

Real-time and Accelerated stability: The stability studies were performed in accordance with EN 13640 (Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents) to demonstrate 24 month unopened shelf-life stability (at recommended storage temperature of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) of the ImmunoCAP Allergen i3 and i4 by an on-going real time stability study and accelerated stability study. For real time stability study, three lots of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component i3 and i4 were stored at recommended storage temperature, $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Two positive plasma samples (2.8 and $7 . 8 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ ) and one negative plasma sample $( { < } 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } )$ ) were tested at different occasions according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use, using Phadia 250. The study is ongoing. For accelerated study, three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen Components i3 and i4 were stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 8 weeks. The same lot stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was used as reference. They were tested after 4 and 8 weeks when stored in $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , using two positive plasma samples and one negative plasma sample. The results support the manufacture’s claim of 24 months.

The stability of the calibration curve, real time, and on-board stability of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator are detailed in k100999.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for each allergen component on the Phadia 250 in alignment with CLSI EP17-A. The LoB was based on single determinations of 100 negative samples (blank samples) and was estimated as the $9 5 \%$ percentile of the distribution. LoD was calculated according to the equation: $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + \mathrm { c B } \bullet \mathrm { S D }$ where SD, the standard deviation, was based on 20 determinations of 3 low positive samples, in total 60 determinations. LoQ for allergen specific IgE antibodies was determined to be $0 . 1 1 \mathrm { k U A / L }$ according to CLSI EP 17-A (see k051218). The results are shown in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Allergen component</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>i3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.028</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.035</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>i4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.031</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.038</td></tr></table>

# i) Inhibition studies:

Immunological specificity of the allergen components was verified through competitive inhibition. The studies were planned in accordance with CLSI I/LA20-A2. The specific IgE concentration for the positive samples is shown in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Allergen component</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>kUA/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>i3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>i4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.0</td></tr></table>

The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose dependent inhibition. Equal volumes of a positive sample and varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor) were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for 1 hour before being analyzed with the corresponding ImmunoCAP Allergen Component on ImmunoCAP instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was performed in duplicates in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.

The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in $\%$ , calculated according to the formula below:

$$
\left( 1 - \left( \frac { r - b } { t - b } \right) \right) \times 1 0 0 = \dot { 1 } \%
$$

$\mathbf { r } =$ response [RU]   
${ \mathfrak { b } } =$ background response ( $100 \%$ inhibition) [RU]   
$\mathbf { t } =$ total response $0 \%$ inhibition) [RU]   
$\mathrm { i } =$ inhibition

Any negative inhibition $\%$ -values are shown as $0 \%$ inhibition.

The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution and the unrelated inhibitors indicate that the 2 modified allergens contain the immunologically relevant allergen as shown below:

ImmunoCAP Allergen i3, Common wasp venom (Yellow jacket)

The Allergen i3, Common wasp venom (Yellow jacket) Inhibition study showed that $5 5 0 \%$ inhibition was achieved with related inhibitor (i3 solution allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration of $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The inhibition studies using six unrelated inhibitors, three from unrelated groups (f428 Hazel nut, g6 Timothy grass, and t3 Birch tree) and three from the related/same group (i206 Cockroach, i1 Honey bee venom and i205 Bumble bee venom) did not show any significant inhibition at $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ . The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen i3, Common wasp venom (Yellow jacket) solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.

The Allergen i4 Paper wasp venom Inhibition study showed that $5 5 0 \%$ inhibition was achieved with related inhibitor (i4 solution allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration of $0 . 0 7 5 \mathrm { \ m g / m L }$ . The inhibition studies using six unrelated inhibitors, three from unrelated groups (f428 Hazel nut, g6 Timothy grass, and t3 Birch tree) and three from the related/same group (i206 Cockroach, i1 Honey bee venom and i205 Bumble bee venom) did not show any significant inhibition at a final inhibitor concentration of $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ . The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen i4, Paper wasp venom solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.

# ii) Interference:

# a) Endogenous Substance Interference:

In order to show that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assay using representative allergens, Bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } ]$ , Bilirubin F (fc 19 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ , Hemoglobin (fc $4 8 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and Chyle (fc 1,440 Formazine Turbidity Units) were spiked into 2 samples per allergen. The allergens tested were e228 rFel d 4 Cat, f351 rPen a 1 Tropomyosin Shrimp, f354 rBer e 1 Brazil nut, f420 rPru p 3 LTP Peach and w231 nArt v 1 Mugwort. The design of the studies was in general alignment with CLSI EP7-A2 Guideline. The results demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affects the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE.

# b) Exogenous Substance Interference:

Two literature references were provided supporting that commonly prescribed "allergy medications" do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE (omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox et al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 2008; 101:580-592.

# b. Matrix comparison:

The "Proof of Principle" study that different matrix samples (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) are interchangeable for ImmunoCAP Allergen Components was provided in k101251. Serum, sodium heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma samples were collected from four patients with clinical history of known specific allergies and four non-atopic patients. The samples contained specific IgE antibodies for one or more of the allergen components tested. ·All sample matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) from each patient were tested with ImmunoCAP Allergen Components in 2 replicates in one assay run. Mean concentration values for each

sample matrix were calculated. Mean logarithmic ratios for 17 results were -0.022 (Plasma heparin/Serum) and 0.054 (Plasma EDTA/Serum). The results from the study show that samples of different matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) are interchangeable for ImmunoCAP Allergen Components.

3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:

The performance of the two modified individual allergen components was compared to a clinical diagnosis of allergy. The clinical studies were performed using thirtyone (31) atopic samples for ImmunoCAP Allergen i3, Common wasp venom (Yellow jacket) and thirty (30) atopic samples for ImmunoCAP Allergen i4, Paper wasp venom. The clinical serum samples in these studies were from individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the allergen, as diagnosed by a physician. Information about clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. 100 negative samples used in these studies were from healthy non-atopic donors.
