# Device (1) and (2) description:

The QUANTA Flash Sm and RNP assays are designed to run on the BIO-FLASH instrument. This platform is a fully automated closed system with continuous load and random access capabilities that auatically processes the samples, rns the assay an reports the results. Itcludes liquidhan hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA Flash Sm and RNP assays utilize a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-FLASH instrument:

Native Sm or RNP antigen that is purified from calf thymus is coated onto paramagnetic beads. The bead suspension  lyophilized and stored n the bead tube. Prior to use n the BIO-LASH system, the ealed reagent tubes are pierced with the reagent cartridge lid and the beads are rehydrated and resuspended using resuspension bufer by pipetting up and down with a transfer pipette. The reagent cartridgeis then loaded onto the BIO-FLASHinstrument. Samples are also loaded onto the instrument in sample racks. A patient serum sample is prediluted by the BIO-LASH with system rinse in a small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay. buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ The beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ The beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized whenTrigger 1 (Fe(ll)coproporphyrin in sodium hydroxide solution) and Trigger 2 (urea-hydrogen peroxide in sodium chloride solution) are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the human IgG, which is in.turn proportional to the amount of anti-RNP antibodies bound to the Sm or RNP on the beads.

For quantitation, the QUANTA Flash Sm and RNP assays utilize a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated before frst use with the QUANTA Flash Sm and RNP Calibrators. Basd on the results obtained with the two Calibrators included in the Calibrator Set sold separately), an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which is used to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained for each sample.

# Value assignment and traceability of Calibrators and Controls

The QuANTA Flash Sm and RNP Calibrators and Controls are manufactured by diluting human serum that contains high titer of anti-Sm or anti-RNP antibodies with a buffer containing stabilizers and preservative. The human serum is obtained from commercial sources and it is tested for markers of infectious substances.

The target CU is achieved through trial dilutions on small scale. Once a dilution is selected, the Calibrators and Control are bulked, tested, and adjusted. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are tested on at least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in replicates of 10 to determine final value assignment.

There are currently no recognized international standards for the measurement of anti-Sm and antiRNP antibodies.

Calibrator and Control values are directly traceable to n-house Standards that are used to creat the Master Curve for the QUANTA Flash Sm and QUANTA Flash RNP assays.

# Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection

# QUANTA Flash Sm:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the QUANTA Flash Sm assay is 803 RLU, which is below the analytical measuring range of the assay. It was determined consistent with CLSI EP17-A guideline with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (beta) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 140 determinations, with 60 measurements on blank samples and 80 measurements of low level samples. The LoB is 540 RLU. Because the curve ends at 3.3 RLU (which is equal to approximately 2430 RLU), it was not possible to calculate the LoB (540 RLU) and LoD ( 803 RLU) in CUs, only in RLUs (instrument signal).

# QUANTA Flash RNP:

The Limit f Detection (LoD) of the QUANTA Flash RNP assay is 1128.8 RLU, which is below the analytical measuring range of the assay. It was determined consistent with CLSI EP17-A guideline with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (beta) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 140 determinations, with 60 measurements on blank samples and 80 measurements of low level samples. The LoB is 713 RLU. Because the curve ends at 3.5 RLU (which is equal to approximately 3450 RLU), it was not possible to calculate the LoB (713 RLU) and LoD (1128.8 RLU) in CUs, only in RLUs (instrument signal).

# Analytical Measuring Range

# QUANTA Flash Sm:

The analytical measuring range (AMR) of the assay (determined by the lowest and highest points of the Masr Curve)is 3.3 CU to 63.5 CU, which corresponds to the lnear range of the assay. If a patient result is less than $3 . 3 \ \mathsf { C U }$ , the BIO-FLASH system will report it as $" < 3 . 3 \subset \mathsf { U } ^ { \prime \prime }$ .Since this is less than 20 CU, consiere a negative result. I a patint result s greater than 693.5 CU, the BIO-FLASH syst will report it as $^ { \prime \prime } { > } 6 9 3 . 5 \mathsf { C U } ^ { \prime \prime }$ . This is considered a positive result. The BIO-FLASH software has an Auto-Rerun opton available (see description and validation in the next paragraph). If this option is selected, the instrument will automatically rerun any sample that has a result of $> 6 9 3 . 5$ CU after additional 10 fold dilution, thereby bringing the measured value within the AMR.

The linearity of the AMR was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP-A, Evaluation of the Lineariy Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. Five serum samples with various Sm antibody concentrations were diluted with a low negative serum to obtain values that covered a range approximately $20 \%$ wider than the AMR. All specimens showed dilution linearity individually, and the combined data yielded the following results with linear regression:

QUANTA Flash RNP:

The analytical measuring range (AMR) of the assay (determined by the lowest and highest points of the Master Curve) is $3 . 5 \ \mathsf { C U }$ to 643.8 CU, which corresponds to the linear range of the assay. If a patient result is less than 3.5 CU, the BIO-FLASH system will report it as $" < 3 . 5 \mathsf { C U } ^ { \prime \prime }$ . Since this is less than 20 CU, it is considered a negative result. If a patient result is greater than $6 4 3 . 8 ~ \mathsf { C U }$ , the BIO-FLASH system will report it as $^ { \prime \prime } { > } 6 4 3 . 8 \mathsf { C U } ^ { \prime \prime }$ .This is considered a positive result. The BIO-FLASH software has an Auto-Rerun opton available (see description and validation in the next paragraph). If this option is selected, the instrument will automatically rerun any sample that has a result of ${ \tt > } 6 4 3 . 8 $ CU after additional 10 fold dilution, thereby bringing the measured value within the AMR.

The linearity f the AMR was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP-A, Evaluation f the Lineariy Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. Five serum samples with various anti-RNP concentrations were diluted with a low negative serum to obtain values that covered a range approximately $20 \%$ wider than the AMR.

# Auto-rerun function

T IO-FLASH wa as u tn availabl.  hptn  elec es will automatically rerun any sample that has a result of $> 6 9 3 . 5$ CU for Sm and $> 6 4 3 . 8$ CU for RNP after aitinal  old dilution, therey bringing the measured value within the AMR.The ia result will e calculated by the software. As the highest value that can be measured is 693.5 CU for Sm and 643.8 CU for RNP, the highest value that can be reported is 6935 CU and 6438 CU, respectively.

T validate the Auto-erun functon, fe (Sm) and ix (RNP) high positive specimens with results above t analytical measuring range were seleced for the Sm and the RNP assays, respectively.The saples were run with the Auto-rerun function enabled on the BIO-FLASH. Then the specimens were manually diluted the same way s it happens inhe Auto-rerun function (0 old dilution), andtested on he BIOFASH. The results wee within the nalyticlmeasrig n terautoerun  anualilution rll specimens. The $\%$ recovery values for results obtained with the auto-rerun results compared to the results obtained by manual dilution were between $8 7 . 6 \%$ and $9 7 . 7 \%$ for $\sin$ (average $9 1 . 5 \% )$ , and between $8 2 . 5 \%$ and $1 0 2 . 2 \%$ for RNP (average $9 6 . 3 \%$ , respectively (within the $\pm 2 0 \%$ acceptance limit).

# Interference

# QUANTA Flash Sm:

The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second Edition. Three specimens were tested (negative: 16.3 CU; arund the cutoff weak positive: 28.6 CU; high positive: 190.7 CU).Interfering substances were spiked into every specimen at three different concentrations in $10 \%$ of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicates with the Sm assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. Acceptance criteria for the interference studies were $8 5 \% - 1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or $\pm 4$ CU difference, whichever is greater.

No interference was detected with bilirubin up to $1 0 m g / d L$ (recovery: $103 \%$ to $108 \%$ or within $\pm 4$ CU), hemoglobin up to $2 0 0 m \theta / \alpha L$ (recovery: $9 7 \%$ to $108 \%$ or within $\pm 4$ CU), triglycerides up to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (recovery: $105 \%$ to $1 1 1 \%$ or within ± 4 CU), cholesterol up to $2 2 4 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ (recovery: $105 \%$ to $1 1 1 \%$ or within ± 4 CU), and RF $| \ g M \ u p$ to $5 0 0 \mid \downarrow \mid / m \mid$ (recovery: $8 5 \%$ to $9 5 \%$ or within ± 4 CU).

# QUANTA Flash RNP:

The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second Edition. Three specimens were tested (negative: 8.8 CU; weak pive: 55.5 C; high positive: 280. Interferig substans were spiked into every specimen at thee different concentrations in $10 \%$ of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicates with the RNP assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. Acceptance criteria for the interference studies were $85 \%$ - $1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or ± 4 CU difference, whichever is greater.

No interference was detected with bilirubin up to $1 0 \ m g / \mathrm d L$ (recovery: $9 6 \%$ to $1 1 2 \%$ , hemoglobin up to $2 0 0 m g / d L$ (recovery: $8 8 \%$ to $10 8 \%$ , triglycerides up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (recovery: $86 \%$ to $109 \%$ cholesterol up to $2 2 4 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (recovery: $86 \%$ to $109 \%$ ), and RF IgM up to 500 IU/mL (recovery: $8 8 \%$ to $1 1 3 \% )$ .

# High concentration hook effect

To assess hook effect, the easurement sgal (relative light unit, RLU) was examinefo the samples that wee used o validat he Auto-ern ncon v  an i high positive species), bee and after automatic or manual dilution. Al sera produced significantly higher RLU values (above the AMR) when used "as is" compared to the manually or automatically diluted ones, thereby confirming that high positive specimens above the analytical measuring range do not show hook effect up to 2429 CU in the Sm assay and up to 3140 CU in the RNP assay (the highest concentrations tested).

# Cross-reactivity

QUANTA Flash Sm:

To test potential cross-reactivity with autoantibodies and infection-induced antibodies, 233 patient samples with various antibodies to autoimmune or infectious disease markers were tested. Three samples from patients with scleroderma, one sample with HIV antibodies, and one sample with MCTD/primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) overlap were positive on the QUANTA Flash Sm.

# Stability

# Shelf life

To establish the initial claim for shelf life, accelerated stability studies were performed.

Accelerated stability testing was performed on each of the following sealed components in the QuANTA Flas Snd RNP toestabli niial tabily claim:he beas, the twocalirators and he eati positive controls. Each week a new sealed component was placed in the incubator, and all components were tested at the end of the experiment together with the one that was stored at $5 9 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ The recovery of the measured values was calculated for each time point (compared to those obtained with $5 9 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } C$ stored reagent). All calculations were performed by comparing results of sealed components stored at $5 9 ^ { \prime } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \complement$ (control) to those stored at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } C$ (test) for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, where one week is equal to six months at $5 9 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } C$ Linear regression analysis was performed between recovery values and the number of days in those cases when at least 3 data points were available at each time point; otherwise, individual data points were analyzed.

Acceptance criteria for one year preliminary expiration dating were:

- Controls and Calibrators:

a) if regression analysis is used, the lower $9 5 \%$ CI interval of the regression line is $\geq 9 0 \%$ at 2 weeks, and no individual data point has $\leq 8 0 \%$ recovery,   
If individual data points are analyzed, recovery values are $> 9 0 \%$ at day 14.   
- Microparticles:   
with regression analysis, the lower $9 5 \%$ Cl interval of the regression line is $\geq 8 5 \%$ at 2 weeks, and no individual data point has $\leq 7 5 \%$ recovery.

Sm beads, RNP beads, Sm Calibrators, RNP Calibrators, Sm Controls and RNP Controls each fulfilled the acceptance criteria above, so one year expiration dating was assigned to each component.

In-use (onboard) stability

Sm Calibrators

During assessing on-board stability, Calibrators were placed, uncapped, onboard the instrument, and calibration was performed altogether five times, then a panel of characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve.

Actance crita wer:Calirators re considere tabll fcalirations peformen . hour period are successful, and Calibrator RLU recovery values are between $90 \%$ and $1 1 0 \%$ compared to the first use.

A total of 5 successful calibrations were performed over an 8.5 hour period: Calibrator RLU values remained within the $9 0 \substack { - 1 1 0 \% }$ range. Moreover, all patient panel samples ran within their expected ranThis supprts the claim that calirators can beused for up to 4 caliratins over an 8 hour p.

Sm Controls

During assessing on-board stability, Controls were assayed twice each day over10 days, fr a total  20 runs. The controls were left uncapped, onboard the instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls were capped, and stored at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } C$ .

Acceptance criteria: Controls are considered stable when all replicates run within their established range, moreover, and the linear regression line obtained by plotting %recovery values against the number of runs stays between $85 \%$ and $1 1 5 \%$ at day run 15.

Both controls ran within their respective acceptable range for all 20 runs, resulting in a $\% c v$ of $5 . 9 \%$ for the Negative Control and $4 . 8 \%$ for the Positive Control. These results support the claim that controls can be used for 15 times, up to 2.5 hours total.

Sm Reagent Cartridge

Todetermine the in-use stability of the QuANTA Flash Sm reagent pack, three lots of cartridges were tested by using five serum specimens (with different reactivity levels). The specimens were tested periodically up to 48 days, twice a day. Recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values, and linear regression analysis was performed. The claim was established using the following criteria (using the one that is fulfilled first):

a)The stability claim is established at the day where the lower $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line reaches $8 5 \%$ recovery, or   
When $2 \%$ or more of the recovery data is $\leq 7 5 \%$ .

The onboard stability results of the three lots are the following:

RP0005: 33 days RP0006: 40 days 121005: 39 days

Using these criteria, the in-use (onboard) stability of the Sm reagent cartridge was set at 33 days.

The claim was established using the following criteria (using the one that is fulfilled first):

a)The stability claim is established at the day where the lower $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line reaches $8 5 \%$ recovery, or   
When $2 \%$ or more of the recovery data is $\leq 7 5 \%$ .   
The onboard stability results of the three lots are the following:   
111001: 28 days   
121002: 28 days   
121003: 31 days

Using these criteria, the in-use (onboard) stability of the RNP reagent cartridge was set at 28 days.

The Stability Claims are tabulated below or easy review. The 1 year helf ie begins from the date o manufacture.
