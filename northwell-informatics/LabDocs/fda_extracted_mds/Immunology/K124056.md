# Intended Use:

The FRENDTM PSA Plus performed on the FRENDTM system, is a quantitative in vitro diagnostic test which measures total Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) in human serum and plasma. The NanoEnTek FRENDTM PSA Plus is designed for in vitro DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY for the quantitative measurement of total Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) in human serum, heparinized plasma, and EDTA plasma using the FRENDTM System. This device is indicated for the serial measurement of total PSA in serum, heparinized plasma and EDTA plasma to be used as an aid in the management of patients with prostate cancer.

The FRENDTM PSA Plus is indicated for use in clinical laboratories upon prescription by the attending physician as an aid to clinicians in managing patients with prostate cancer.

The information provided from this test may supplement decision-making and should only be used in conjunction with routine monitoring by a physician and the use of other diagnostic procedures. Because of the variability in the effects of various medications used in the treatment of prostate cancer, clinicians should use professional judgment in the interpretation of PSA results as an indicator of disease status.

# Technological Characteristics:

The FRENDTM PSA Plus is a rapid fluorescence immunoassay that measures prostate specific antigen (PSA) in human serum and in lithium heparin and EDTA plasma using the FRENDTM system. The FRENDTM PSA Plus is intended for use as an aid for prostate cancer management. The FRENDTM PSA Plus Test is a single use fluorescence immunoassay designed to quantify the concentration of total PSA in serum and lithium heparin and EDTA plasma samples. The specimen is added by the operator to the sample inlet with a transfer pipet, allowing the appropriate volume of sample $( 3 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ to be delivered into the FRENDTM PSA Plus Test Cartridge. The Cartridge is then placed into the FRENDTM System, which is programmed to begin analysis once the sample has reacted with the reagents. The reaction and analysis time is approximately 6 minutes. The PSA quantification is based on the amount of fluorescence detected by the FRENDTM System at the FRENDTM PSA Plus Test Cartridge window. A higher level of fluorescence is indicative of a higher PSA concentration. In other words, the magnitude of the fluorescent signal is directly proportional to the amount of total PSA in the sample.

Material Provided - FRENDTM PSA Plus - Catalog Number FRPS 025

25 FRENDTM PSA Plus cartridges - The Test Cartridge is a disposable plastic device that houses the reagents and contains an opening where the sample is applied. Once the sample is applied, it will mix with the reagents and travel towards the detection area via capillary action. The sample is dropped into the specimen inlet located on the top left corner of the Test Cartridge. Sample and reagents interact before being analyzed by the FREND System fluorescence reader. The shelf-life of FREND PSA Plus cartridges is 12 months. One Cartridge contains:

Monoclonal anti-PSA1 $4 8 \pm 9 . 6 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ Monoclonal anti-PSA2 $1 4 4 \pm 2 8 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ Fluorescent particle $2 . 4 \pm 0 . 4 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$

30 Disposable pipette tips (micro-pipettor optional) 1 FRENDTM PSA Plus Code Chip - The QC Code Chip contains data to ensure the performance of the FREND System's power, optical, and software systems when the QC Cartridge is inserted into the System. The QC Code Chip is inserted into the code chip port at the rear of the System. Each QC Code Chip is specific to its accompanying QC Cartridge. Each time a new lot is used, the PSA Code Chip that corresponds to that new lot must be inserted into the instrument and the previous PSA Code Chip must be removed.. If the PSA Code Chip and the PSA Cartridge are not from the same lot, an error message will appear.

# Performance Data Summary - Analytical Testing

To determine the analytical validity of the FRENDTM PSA Plus, a series of studies have been performed as described below.

1. Estimates of imprecision: intra-assay, inter-assay and complex imprecision analyses were generated at three sites including the NanoEnTek, Inc. facility as well as at CLlA licensed facilities in the US. Imprecision was found to be acceptable at all three sites on all three lot numbers. The magnitude of the imprecision is not significantly different than that seen with other devices of this type.

Precision data was determined as described in the CLSI protocol EP5-A2. Three clinical samples were assayed in replicates of two at two separated times per day for twenty days using a single lot cartridge. Results are shown below in table format. All elements of this testing process met the specifications set. Repeatability and Within-laboratory precision on samples with measured concentrations from 0.1 to $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was less than $1 5 \%$ . At concentrations ${ > } 1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ but $< 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , Repeatability and Within-laboratory precision was less than $1 0 \%$ .

Three different lots of FRENDTM PSA Plus were evaluated at three geographically diverse sites. Four replicates each of Material A, Material B, and Material C and two replicates of QC 1, QC 2 and QC 3 were evaluated in each of two runs performed for five days at each site. A total of 40 results on each material were generated at each of the three sites yielding a grand total of 120 replicates of each material. The data was analyzed using a CLSI format from EP5-A2 for an ANOVA analysis. Instrument-to-Instrument is the same as Site-to-Site in this scenario. As can be seen from the table below, the largest source of variation is the cartridge which would be the expected result. The FRENDTm PSA Plus cartridge is a'single use cartridge that contains all the reagents within the cartridge necessary to support the reactions.

# Dilution Linearity & Recovery:

To demonstrate the linearity of the assay, a serum sample pool with an elevated total PSA $( 3 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ was diluted to a total of seven levels according to the dilution protocol outlined in CLSI-EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. In addition, a "neat" sample (no dilution) and a "zero" sample were also be run. At each dilution level, the samples were tested in 6 replicates to determine the observed value of PSA. Percent recovery was calculated by comparing the observed PSA result with the expected value. Recoveries within $+ 1 0 \%$ of the expected results for the overall mean recovery at concentrations above $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m ! } }$ for each sample were considered acceptable proof of this performance goal.

3. Spiked Recovery: a serum pool from females (initial tPSA concentration $< 0 . 0 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ was spiked with three (3) different known levels of PSA across the range of the assay (0.1 to $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ . After spiking, samples were assayed during the same run before and after spiking. The percentage of tPSA recovered was compared to the theoretical amount spiked into the samples. Recoveries within $10 \%$ of the expected result for the overall mean recovery for a given sample were considered acceptable proof of this performance goal.

The percentage recovery ranged from $9 2 . 3 \%$ to $10 5 . 4 \%$ The results are within the acceptance region.

4Analytical Sensitivity (Limits of Detection or LOD/LOQ): Determination of the limit of detection/limit of quantitation was performed according to procedures outlined in CLSI-EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. In the determination, 5 samples without PSA (blank samples) and 5 samples with a low PSA concentration were tested in the assay in 12 replicates for each sample. The $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile value for the blank samples was $\boldsymbol { 0 . 0 4 \ n g / \mathrm { m L } }$ The $5 ^ { \mathfrak { t h } }$ percentile value for the low PSA samples was $0 . 0 5 5 ~ \mathrm { \mathfrak { n g / m L } }$ At a PSA value of $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , there were no blank samples (without PSA) labeled as detected by the assay and $50 \%$ of low PSA sample values (LOD samples) had a PSA value below $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The LOD/LOQ limit as determined by this testing is 0.1 ng/mL PSA.

5.High Dose Hook Effect Testing (Prozone Detection): The presence of high dose hook effect was tested by analyzing a concentrated sample of purified PSA antigen both neat and on dilution. No High Dose Hook effect was seen in samples with a PSA concentration as high as $1 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

Interfering Substances and Assay Specificity: Prostatic acid phosphatase and kallikrein (not otherwise described) were evaluated for potential cross-reactivity with the FREND PSA Plus at $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ respectively utilizing the instructions recommended by CLSI protocol EP7-A. No significant cross-reactivity was found.

Interference studies on endogenous serum substances were performed using the FREND PSA Plus according to the recommendations in the CLSI protocol EP7-A. Interference is defined to be recovery outside of $1 5 \%$ of the known specimen mean concentration. Lack of interference (recovery from $8 5 \%$ to $1 1 5 \%$ of the expected) is considered acceptable performance. The following describes the interferents tested and the maximum concentration without interference at the total PSA concentrations evaluated:

Added hemoglobin (up to $\mathsf { 5 0 0 m g / d L }$ does not interfere with the assay. Average recovery when added to serum containing tPSA at 1.0 and $4 . 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ was $9 7 . 2 5 \%$

Added conjugated bilirubin (up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ does not interfere with the assay. Average recovery when added to serum containing tPSA at 1.0 and $4 . 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ was EY $9 8 . 2 \%$ .

•Added gamma globulin (Total Protein) up to 5.0 g/dL does not interfere with the assay. Average recovery when added to serum containing tPSA at 1.0 and 4.0 ng/mL was $1 0 6 . 3 \%$ . Added triglyceride up to 3 grams/dL does not interfere with this assay. Average recover when added to serum containing tPSA at 1.0 and 4.0 ng/mL was 101.5%.

No interference was found from endogenous materials such as bilirubin, triglycerides, hemoglobin, or added protein at a level above what is found in the usual clinical laboratory specimen.

Drugs commonly given to patients with prostate cancer and some common over-thecounter medications were also tested using CLSI protocol EP7-A. .

No interference outside the acceptable recovery range ( $10 0 \pm 1 5 \% )$ was found.

7. Method comparison: Comparison studies were done in the DOCRO, Inc. laboratory testing facility, Orion Laboratory, Inc., at the time the clinical samples enrolled for this study were evaluated. The predicate device and the FRENDTM system were run at the same time, side-by-side on the bench so samples were tested simultaneously using the same aliquot of sample. Regression analysis was performed on the data pairs obtained from prostate cancer samples taken at a single point (n = 85) and the earliest sample from 75 subjects undergoing serial monitoring for prostate cancer. Any samples reading above either of the linearity limits of the predicate or proposed assay was diluted and the final result determined by multiplying the dilution factor by the answer obtained on that dilution. Statistics were generated on the samples from prostate cancer subjects $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 6 0 )$ . For those results whose tPSA was less than 25 ng/mL, the linearity limit of the FRENDTM PSA Plus assay, comparison was performed using Passing-Bablok regression analysis.

![](images/7b132fc7244267595bc0e84ad582d2278337fd8dbac9acfe6d3be65d48287ace.jpg)

The two methods compared well within the specifications usually accepted in the clinical laboratory.

8. Sample Matrix Comparison Study: The FRENDTM PSA Plus designates multiple matrices as being acceptable sample types. Lithium heparin and EDTA plasma are specified in addition to serum as appropriate sample types. Matrix comparison studies were performed in which the various matrices above plus sodium citrate were compared with respect to the PSA result in a serum matrix. Deming regression and Passing-Bablok were performed. Concentrations of PSA across the measuring range were used. 36 matched sets were collected, aliquoted, frozen and then run once all collections were completed.

To determine the statistical relationship between the PSA concentrations of the plasma specimens and that of the serum specimen, linear regression and Passing-Bablok regression analyses were performed. Equivalence of repeatability in duplicate runs for all matrices and equivalence of variance between serum and each of three different plasma matrices in three partitions were also evaluated. An assessment of the repeatability of variance for each matrix type was performed to ensure that variation in serum samples was equivalent to variation in each plasma type. Analysis showed that EDTA heparin, lithium heparin and serum are all acceptable matrices. Sodium citrate showed unacceptable performance.

Reagent Stability Studies: Real time stability studies of the FREND PSA Plus Test Cartridge were conducted over 15 months on three different lots. The Test Cartridges were either stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or at room temperature. At each of three month intervals, the Test Cartridge was assayed with five standard specimens. The results using both the refrigerated and the room temperature stored cartridges for the five standard specimens yielded results with a $\% C V$ of less than $10 \%$ meeting the acceptance criteria. Reagent studies showed that the cartridges for FRENDTm PSA Plus are good for at least one year from date of manufacturer if stored appropriately as directed.

# 10. Performance Data Summary - Clinical Testing

A total of 1219 evaluable clinical serum samples were assessed during this study. Results were obtained on both the FRENDTM PSA Plus and the predicate device. Sample distributions across various cohorts of samples: Normal, Benign and Malignant, were studied. Testing of ambulatory male subjects fifty years old and older who reported themselves as healthy without any known illnesses, diseases or conditions was performed. The cohorts shown in the following table were assembled to determine the distribution of values in benign diseases that may be co-existent in patients with confirmed prostate cancer. Prospectively collected stored samples were utilized for this study.

\*Treated and untreated subjects \*\*Serial samples are not included in this cohort.

Performance between the two assay systems did not show any clinically significant differences

Serially monitored subjects: As an important part of the clinical studies performed to characterize the FRENDTM PSA Plus, serial samples collected longitudinally from patients previously diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated in a variety of ways over the clinical course of their disease (including prostatectomy, radioactive seeds, external beam radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy alone or in combination) were assayed for tPSA with the FRENDTM PSA Plus on the FRENDTM system. The same samples were also measured for tPSA by the predicate PSA method.

For each point to point in a sample serial set, the change in the tPSA concentration was compared to the change in the clinical status of the patients as measured by other laboratory tests, patient interviews, physical examinations, and imaging studies of a variety of types.

These changes in the tPSA marker concentration were defined as significant or not by multiplying the overall $\% \mathbf { C V }$ of the assay at the midrange (as determined by the test imprecision study) by a factor of 2.5 to define a percentage change difference higher than would be expected because of assay imprecision. For the FRENDTM PSA Plus assay with an overall mid-range $\% C V$ of $8 \%$ , significance was set at a change in excess of $20 \%$ Any increase in value from one time period to the next that did not exceed $20 \%$ was logged as $\leq 2 0 \%$ Change. For the predicate method, significant percentage change was set at a change $> 8 . 5 \%$ .This was calculated using that method's published overall mid-range CV of $3 . 4 \% \times 2 . 5$ .

Disease status for the patients was determined by the physician. This Disease Status was used to determine Progression or No Progression from a clinical perspective. The first table below shows the progressions and non-progressions as determined for the FRENDTM PSA Plus results for all seventy five subjects compared to the Clinical Status changes. The second table shows the same comparison for the other FDA cleared assay. There are a total of 236 such determinations for each assay.

\*Confidence Intervals are based on 10,000 resamples of the patient data

Based on the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals, there are no differences between the concordances for the FRENDTM PSA Plus assay and TOSOH ST AIA-PACKTM PSA assay. Positive, negative and overall concordances determined on the serial sets of samples for the two methods showed no significant difference in the ability of the-assay to mirror the patient clinical status.

# Substantial Equivalence

The FREND™M PSA Plus is as safe and effective as the "Predicate Device", the TOSOH ST AIAPACK PA assay. FRENDTM PSA Plus has a similar Intended Use and Indications for Use for monitoring of prostate cancer patients, similar technological and performance characteristics, and principles of operation as its predicate device. The differences between the FRENDTM PSA Plus and its predicate device raise no new. issues of safety or effectiveness. Performance data, analytical and clinical, demonstrate that the FRENDrm PSA Plus is as safe and effective as the "Predicate Device".
