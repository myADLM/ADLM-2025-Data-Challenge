Dear Mr. Locke:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Recommendations for Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) Test System Premarket (510(k)) Submissions (January 22, 2009)

Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents; Approved Guideline. CLSI document EP25-A.   
Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; September 2009.

# L. Test Principle:

The procedure follows the EUROLINE technique that was cleared previously via the FDA 510(k) processes under 510(k) No. k113439. The assay can be evaluated visually or by means of the EUROLineScan software which was cleared under the k113439 process.

The EUROLINE uses different purified and recombinant antigens that have been coated and applied in easy to read lines onto a membrane. Antibodies are detected via a secondary antibody linked to an enzyme. The principle of the EUROLINE is that of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a membrane as the solid phase instead of microtiter wells.

Patient samples are diluted 1:101 in sample buffer, $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of diluted patient sample are added to the test strip lying in the incubation channel and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. After incubation the test strips are washed with wash buffer to remove unbound antibodies and $1 . 5 \mathrm { m l }$ of the anti-human IgG enzyme conjugate reagent is added to each channel. After an additional 30-minutes incubation at room temperature, the test strips are again washed with wash buffer to remove any unbound enzyme conjugate and $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of the substrate solution is added. The strips are incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature and then aspirated and washed with dist. water. The test strips can be evaluated visually by comparison of the band intensity with the reaction control card or they can be digitized by use of a flatbet scanner and evaluated with the computer software EUROLineScan.

The control band on the strips contains (non-specific) anti-human IgG, which reacts with the sample IgG to show a strong color reaction if the incubation was performed correctly and so represents a function test on each single strip. If the control band is negative, the test is invalid and should be repeated.

The positive control contains a mixture of the targeted antibodies which bind to the antigen coated on the blot strips. A strip incubated with the positive control shows a positive result. If the positive control is negative, the test results are invalid and should be repeated.

The qualitative results are reported for each individual antibody separately. The interpretation of the test results does not include a combined score or diagnosis.

# M. Performance Characteristics (where applicable):

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility

Reproducibility was investigated by repeated determinations of different samples covering the whole range of antigens of the EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG).

 Intra-Assay Reproducibility was investigated in 20 replicates on one day using the same kit lot.   
 Inter-Assay Reproducibility was investigated in 5 different runs, each run on a different day with 3 replicates per run, using the same kit lot.   
Inter-Lot Reproducibility was tested in 6 different runs using different kit lots. Each run was performed in duplicates according to the package insert. Inter-Observer Reproducibility was investigated by determinations of different samples covering the whole range of antigens of the EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG). The samples were tested in 6 different runs. Each run was performed in duplicates according to the package insert and visually evaluated by two different technicians independently.

Reproducibility was found to be sufficient as no positive sample was found negative and vice versa.

b. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range:

Not Applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators or Methods):

A recognized standard or reference material for antibodies against nRNP/Sm, Sm, SS-A, Ro-52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, CENP B, dsDNA, nucleosomes, histones and ribosomal P-proteins is not available.

Stability studies were conducted in accordance with the international standard DIN EN 13640:2002: Stability testing of in vitro diagnostics reagents (which was aligned by CLSI EP25-A). A real-time stability study was performed on original sealed and opened products to establish the shelf life claim and opened reagent stability claims. An accelerated stability study was performed for preliminary claims and transportation simulation at elevated temperatures. Another transportation simulation under freeze conditions was also performed. Three production lots of the EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG) and an additional production lot for testing under “freeze” conditions were tested with three samples per antigen band. Acceptance criterium was that the results do not differ more than one result level from the reference run (real-time study: day 0; accelerated study and transportation simulation: $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ stored sample). The studies support a minimum shelf life claim of 18 months for original sealed components and a stability claim of 12 months for opened components.

d. Detection Limit:

Not Applicable.

e. Analytical Specificity:

Cross-Reactivity: The reactivity of the EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG) was verified using the CDC ANA reference panel. All samples were found in line with the CDC characterization.

Interference: Different samples were spiked with potential interfering substances in 3 different concentrations. No interference was observed with hemolytic, lipemic or icteric samples for concentrations of up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d l }$ for haemoglobin, $2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d l }$ for triglycerides and $4 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d l }$ for bilirubin.

f. Assay Cut-off:

The cut-off intensity is defined as the lowest limit of a clearly visible band.

# 2. Analytical Performance:

a. Method Comparison

A comparison study was performed with clinically characterized samples obtained from different sources. The samples were tested with the EUROIMMUN EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG) and with the ELISA kits (k123261or k063565) as the predicate devices. For each parameter the same clinical disease groups were included as for the respective predicate ELISA. The results of the study are shown in the tables below. $9 5 \%$ C.I.’s were calculated by the exact method.

3. Clinical Studies:

a. Sensitivity & Specificity:

Clinical studies were performed in cooperation with different sites (see below). In total 1279 clinically characterized samples were investigated for antibodies against nRNP/Sm, Sm, SS-A, Ro-52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, CENP B and ribosomal P-proteins (IgG). The results obtained with the EUROIMMUN EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG) are shown in the tables below. $9 5 \%$ C.I. are calculated by the exact method.

4. Clinical Cut-off:

See Assay Cut-off.

5. Expected Values/Reference Range:

To establish the reference range of antibodies against nRNP/Sm, Sm, SS-A, Ro-52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, CENP B and ribosomal P-proteins (IgG), 173 samples from US asymptomatic blood donors (79 men, 94 women, mean age 38.3 y, age range 19-50 y) were tested with the EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG). The prevalence of the assay in the healthy group was $2 . 9 \%$ .

# N. Performance Characteristics (where applicable):

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Performance Characteristics (where applicable):

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
