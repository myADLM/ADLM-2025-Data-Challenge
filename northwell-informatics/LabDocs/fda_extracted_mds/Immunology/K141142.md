# II. Device

Name of Device: MammaPrint® FFPE   
Common or Usual Name: Multivariate device for cancer prognosis   
Classification Name: Gene expression profiling test system, for breast cancer prognosis (21 CFR   
866.6040)   
Regulatory Class: Class II   
Product Code: NYI

III. Predicate Device Agendia NV’s MammaPrint (k101454)

# IV. Device Description

The MammaPrint® FFPE test is a microarray based gene expression analysis of a tumor. The analysis is based on several processes: isolation of RNA from FFPE breast cancer tissue sections; elimination of gDNA, reverse transcription of RNA resulting in cDNA; amplification of the cDNA, purification and labeling of cDNA; hybridization of the amplified and labeled cDNA to the diagnostic microarray; washing and scanning the diagnostic microarray and data acquisition (feature extraction); calculation and determination of the risk of recurrence.

The MammaPrint® FFPE analysis is designed to determine the expression of specific genes in a tissue sample. The result is an expression profile, or “fingerprint”, of the sample. Using this expression profile, the MammaPrint® FFPE Index is calculated and the molecular prognosis profile of the sample is determined (Low Risk, High Risk).

# V. Intended Use

MammaPrint® FFPE is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test, performed in a central laboratory, using the gene expression profile obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissue samples to assess a patient’s risk for distant metastasis within 5 years.

The test is performed for breast cancer patients, with Stage I or Stage II disease, with tumor size $\le 5 . 0$ cm and lymph node negative. The MammaPrint® FFPE result is indicated for use by physicians as a prognostic marker only, along with other clinico-pathological factors.

# VI Comparison of technological characteristics with the predicate device

MammaPrint FFPE shares the same principles of operation, overall technical and functional capabilities as the predicate device covered under k101454. The only difference concerns the pre-analytical sample preparation; the use of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast tumor tissue in addition to fresh breast tumor tissue as is used in the predicate device.

# VII. Performance Testing (Bench)

# Analytical performance

MammaPrint analytical (i.e., non-clinical) performance characteristics investigated comprise concordance between FFPE tissue samples and Fresh as well as Precision and Reproducibility performance assessment. Also inter-laboratory and microarray scanner comparisons are included.

# 1 - Concordance FFPE tissue samples and Fresh

First independent validation: n=122

In order to extend the intended use of MammaPrint to FFPE samples as well as Fresh a concordance comparison was performed. A selection of 122 tumor samples was used from which one section of the tumor was preserved as Fresh and a second part as FFPE. The Fresh section of the tumor was subjected to latest design controlled version (internal version US09.1 / EU09.1) of the latest FDA cleared MammaPrint assay (k101454) and the FFPE sections were subjected to MammaPrint FFPE (internal version US01.1 / EU01.1). The MammaPrint results from Fresh and FFPE sections for each sample were compared.

The overall concordance in outcome between MammaPrint Fresh and FFPE is $8 9 . 3 4 \ \%$ . If only the true positives and negatives are considered (non-borderline samples), there is a concordance of $9 2 . 7 \%$ . For this comparison the NPA is equal to $8 8 . 4 \%$ $9 5 \% C |$ : 80.5 to 95) and the PPA was $90 . 6 \%$ $9 5 \% C |$ : 79.8 to 95.9).

# Second independent validation: $\mathtt { n = 3 4 5 }$ (Raster study)

A second concordance comparison between MammaPrint Fresh and FFPE was performed using the Raster study. A selection of 345 samples was used from which Fresh RNA as well as FFPE tissue was available. The Fresh RNA was subjected to MammaPrint Fresh version US09.1/EU09.1 and the FFPE tissues were subjected to MammaPrint FFPE version US01.1/EU01.1.

The concordance in this Raster sample set was $8 9 . 2 8 \%$ . If only the true positives and negatives (nonborderlines) are considered the concordance is equal to $9 3 . 5 \%$ . For this comparison the NPA is equal to $91 . 5 \%$ ( $9 5 \% C |$ : 86.7 to 94.7) and the PPA was $8 6 . 6 \%$ ( $9 5 \% C 1$ : 80.4 to 91.1).

# 2 - Test Performance

Test performance of MammaPrint FFPE was assessed on different levels.

I. Reproducibility was assessed on multiple isolations from the same sample (report VR-TR206a). For 30 FFPE samples four isolations were performed: I1, I2, I3 and I4. All 4 isolations were further processed to generate MammaPrint FFPE results.

A repeated Measurements ANOVA was used to determine if there was a difference in MammaPrint Indices over all four isolations. The results show that there is no significant difference $\scriptstyle ( p = 0 . 9 9 4 )$ .

A Cochran’s Q test was used to assess the difference in MammaPrint Outcome over the four isolations. The results of this test show that there is no significant difference in MammaPrint Outcome over the different isolations $\scriptstyle ( p = 0 . 2 9 0 )$ .

II. Reproducibility was assessed on multiple labeling/hybridizations by measuring FFPE control samples overtime (report VR-TR-233a):

PHTR: Paraffin, High risk  PLEP: Paraffin, Low risk

PHHE: Paraffin, High risk

This was performed on a daily basis in order to obtain overtime MammaPrint FFPE results for all three controls. The standard deviations passed the predefined acceptance criteria (stdevs: PHTR $= 0 . 0 4 5$ $\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 5 4$ ), PLEP $= 0 . 0 5 6$ $\mathtt { ( n = 5 2 ) }$ ), PHHE $= 0 . 0 7 2$ $( n = 5 2 )$ ).

III A Precision and Evaluation (P&E) experiment (NCCLS, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement methods, EP5-A2) was performed to determine the Repeatability and Method Precision of MammaPrint FFPE test (report VR-TR-223a).

This experiment set up consists of repeated runs over 20 days in which all test outcome levels are represented by one test sample. After collecting the data from 20 successive days, statistical analysis was performed to determine the repeatability and within-lab precision per sample level:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=2></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Repeatability(Within-Run)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Method Precision (within-Laboratory)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample ID</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample level: outcome</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard deviation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Variance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard deviation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Variance</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11003290</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High Risk</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.036</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0013</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.044</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0019</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11003347</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High Risk</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.046</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0021</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.057</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0033</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11003810</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low Risk</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.042</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0018</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.050</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0025</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11003860</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low Risk - Borderline</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.049</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0024</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.066</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0044</td></tr></table>

The P&E results for Repeatability and Method Precision meet the predefined acceptance criteria.

# 3 - Inter-laboratory comparison of MammaPrint FFPE between Irvine and Amsterdam laboratories

For this validation 25 FFPE samples were selected from which MammaPrint FFPE results were previously generated using standard FFPE protocols in Amsterdam. From these samples sections were taken and processed from isolation onwards by the diagnostic departments in both Agendia Irvine and Amsterdam according to standard protocols.

The MammaPrint FFPE results generated for these 25 samples at Irvine and Amsterdam locations were compared to the previously generated results. These results meet the predefined acceptance criteria (Irvine: Kappa score $= 0 . 9 0$ , Amsterdam: Kappa Score $= 0 . 9$ ).

Furthermore, the Passing and Bablok regression analysis also showed that there is high agreement in MammaPrint Index within this inter-laboratory comparison of Amsterdam and Irvine Operations. For both locations the intercept is close to zero and the slope is close to 1.

# 4 - Validation of use of multiple microarray scanners for MammaPrint FFPE Irvine and Amsterdam

For the validation of both micro-array scanners in central lab in Amsterdam, 25 samples were hybridized two times; first on the originally validated scanner, serial number US810R3210 and in addition using the scanner with serial number US22502555. MammaPrint Indices were compared between both scanners. The comparison of MammaPrint indices between both scanners meet the predefined acceptance criteria (Pearson correlation $\mathbf { \Lambda } = \ \mathbf { \Lambda } \mathcal { 1 . O } )$ . Also the comparison of MammaPrint Outcome meet the predefined acceptance criteria (Kappa score $= 1 . 0$ , $N P A = 1 0 0 \%$ (95%CI: 67.6 to 100), $P P A = 1 0 0 \%$ $9 5 \% C l { : } 8 1 . 6$ to 99.0)).

Furthermore, the Passing and Bablok regression analysis also showed that there is high agreement in MammaPrint Index between both scanners located in Amsterdam. For this comparison the intercept is close to zero and the slope is close to 1.

For the validation of both micro-array scanners in central lab in Irvine, 27 samples were hybridized two times; first on the originally validated scanner, serial number US811R3213 and in addition using the scanner with serial number US45103019. MammaPrint Indices were compared between both scanners.

The comparison of MammaPrint indices between both scanners meet the predefined acceptance criteria (Pearson correlation $\mathbf { \Lambda } = \ \mathbf { \Lambda } \mathcal { 1 . O } )$ . Also the comparison of MammaPrint Outcome meet the predefined acceptance criteria (Kappa score $= 1 . 0 ~ N P A = 1 0 0 \%$ ( $9 5 \% C I$ : 77.2 to 100), $P P A = 1 0 0 \%$ $( 9 5 \% C I ; 7 8 . 5$ to 100)).

Furthermore, the Passing and Bablok regression analysis also showed that there is high agreement in MammaPrint Index between both scanners located in Irvine. For this comparison the intercept is close to zero and the slope is close to 1.

# 5 – Determine minimum input in hybridization of MammaPrint FFPE

A dilution study was performed to determine the minimum input of labeled cDNA in a hybridization of MammaPrint FFPE. In this dilution study three samples as well as three MammaPrint FFPE control samples were each labeled five times and per sample to generate sufficient amount of labeled material. Samples were then diluted in 8 steps with water to reach the specific yield (ng),in which step 8 reflects a hybridization with no labeled material.

MammaPrint FFPE results were compared over the different dilution and showed very stable results even at low input of cDNA.

# VIII. Performance testing-Clinical

As part of this submission of MammaPrint FFPE the clinical performance of MammaPrint FFPE was compared to MammaPrint Fresh. For this comparison samples were used that were part of the Raster study that were processed on MammaPrint Fresh between 2004 and 2007 and currently have a clinical follow-up of 5 years. For the clinical performance evaluation of MammaPrint FFPE on RASTER FFPE samples, endpoints were defined as Distant Recurrence Free Interval (DRFI) as presented for the Raster study1 as well as the 5 year Distant Metastasis as first event (DM1st).

# Comparison based on DRFI

For both the Fresh version of MammaPrint as well as the FFPE version, Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference in DRFI the Low and High Risk groups LogRank $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 0 0 1 }$ ) (Figure 5.1 A and B respectively).

Based on the results shown MammaPrint FFPE is clinically equivalent to the predicate device MammaPrint Fresh (k101454).

# Comparison based on DM 1st

The 5-year DM1st survival of both MammaPrint Fresh and FFPE is shown below. The performance of MammaPrint FFPE falls within the $9 5 \%$ CI of MammaPrint Fresh and therefore complies with the predefined acceptance criteria.

Prognostic assessment of MammaPrint® FFPE was further investigated using a univariate and multivariate analysis. In the univariate analysis MammaPrint FFPE is significantly associated with risk recurrence. Multivariate analysis did not conclusively demonstrate prognostic significance for MammaPrint FFPE beyond that of other clinicopathological factors. This is attributable to the RASTER study design, in which MammaPrint result was included along with all relevant clinic-pathological factors, and treatment decisions were guided by assessed prognostic risk and the standard of practice. In this real–world context, the overall cohort experienced a low event rate which, despite the favorable trend, diminishes independent contribution of MammaPrint.

# IX. Conclusion

MammaPrint FFPE and its predicate device MammaPrint Fresh (K101454) are a clinically and analytically accurate prognostic marker for providing a risk assessment of distant metastasis of breast cancer when performed in either Agendia’s European or US central laboratory.
