# Predicate device:

QUANTA Lite® SS-A 52 ELISA, 510(k) number: K063565

# Device description

The QUANTA Flash Ro52 assay is designed to run on the BIO-FLASH® instrument. This platform is a fully automated closed system with continuous load and random access capabilities that automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid handling hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA Flash Ro52 assay utilizes a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-FLASH instrument.

Purified recombinant Ro52 antigen is coated onto paramagnetic beads. The bead suspension is lyophilized and stored in the bead tube. Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH system, the sealed reagent tubes are pierced with the reagent cartridge lid and the beads are rehydrated and resuspended using resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a transfer pipette. The reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH instrument. Samples are also loaded onto the instrument in sample racks. Serum samples are prediluted by the BIO-FLASH with system rinse in a small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . The beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } .$ . The beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1 (Fe(III)coproporphyrin in sodium hydroxide solution) and Trigger 2 (ureahydrogen peroxide in sodium chloride solution) are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the human IgG, which is in turn proportional to the amount of anti-Ro52 antibodies bound to the corresponding beads.

For quantitation, the QUANTA Flash Ro52 assay utilizes a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. Every new lot number of reagent cartridge must be calibrated before first use, with the QUANTA Flash Ro52 Calibrators. Based on the results obtained with the two Calibrators included in the Calibrator Set (sold separately), an instrument specific Working Curve is created, which is used to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained for each sample.

The QUANTA Flash Ro52 kit contains the following materials:

One (1) QUANTA Flash Ro52 Reagent Cartridge One (1) vial of Resuspension buffer One (1) Transfer pipette

The QUANTA Flash Ro52 reagent cartridge contains the following reagents for 50 determinations:

a. Ro52 antigen coated paramagnetic beads, lyophilized.   
b. Assay buffer – colored pink, containing Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20, protein stabilizers and preservatives.   
c. Tracer IgG – Isoluminol labeled anti-human IgG antibodies in buffer, containing protein stabilizers and preservative.

The QUANTA Flash Ro52 Calibrators kit contains two vials of Calibrator 1 and two vials of Calibrator 2:

QUANTA Flash Ro52 Calibrators:

QUANTA Flash Ro52 Calibrator 1: Two (2) barcode labeled tubes containing $0 . 3 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ prediluted, ready to use reagent. Calibrators contain human antibodies to Ro52 in buffer, protein stabilizer and preservative. QUANTA Flash Ro52 Calibrator 2: Two (2) barcode labeled tubes containing $0 . 3 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ prediluted, ready to use reagent. Calibrators contain human antibodies to Ro52 in buffer, protein stabilizer and preservative.

The QUANTA Flash Ro52 Controls kit contains two vials of Negative Control and two vials of Positive Control:

QUANTA Flash Ro52 Controls:

# Analytical performance characteristics

# Value assignment and traceability of Calibrators and Controls

There is currently no recognized international standard for the measurement of Ro52 antibodies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ANA reference serum #2 (IS2073 - IIF ANA [speckled pattern]; anti-SS-B/La), #7 (IS2105 - Anti-SS-A/Ro), and #10 (IS2187 - Anti-Jo1) were tested for Ro52 and produced the following results:

CDC ANA #2: 40.7 CU CDC ANA #7: 32.4 CU CDC ANA #10: 443.7 CU

The QUANTA Flash Ro52 Calibrators and Controls are manufactured by diluting human serum that contains high titer of anti-Ro52 antibodies with buffer, containing protein stabilizer and preservative. The human serum is obtained from commercial sources and it is tested for markers of infectious substances.

The target CU is achieved through trial dilutions on small scale. Once a dilution is selected, the Calibrators and Control are bulked, tested, and adjusted. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, the Calibrators and Controls are tested on at least two instruments, on at least two lots of reagent cartridge, in replicates of 10 to determine final value assignment.

Calibrator and Control values are directly traceable to in-house Standards that are used to create the Master Curves for the QUANTA Flash Ro52 assay.

# Reproducibility

Three samples were tested on two different reagent lots, using two different lots of Calibrators, by two operators. Samples were run in quadruplicates, two times a day, for 10 days, to generate 80 data points per sample. Production reagent lots 131006 and 141007, and Calibrator and Control lots 131005 and 131006 were used for the studies. Data were analyzed with the Analyse-it for Excel method evaluation software, and within run, between reagent lots, between calibrator lots, between operators and total precision were calculated.

# Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD)

The LoD of the QUANTA Flash Ro52 assay is 402 RLU, which is below the analytical measuring range of the assay. It was determined consistent with CLSI EP17-A2 guideline with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (beta) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 120 determinations, with 60 measurements on blank samples and 60 measurements of low level samples, per reagent lot.

For determining the LoB, 4 blank samples (System Rinse) from two different lots were run in replicates of five on two reagent lots, once per day, for 3 days. Production reagent lots 131006 and 141007 were used for the studies. Sixty data points were generated on each lot.

The LoB was determined on each lot separately with the Analyse-it for Excel software’s Reference Interval function, at the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile, using the non-parametric method, as the dataset showed nonnormal distribution (p values at 0.0068 and $< 0 . 0 0 0 1$ , for each lot, respectively). The LoB for lot 131006 was determined as 308 RLU, and for lot 141007 as 319 RLU. The final LoB value is 319 RLU.

For determining the LoD, 4 low level samples (prepared by diluting anti-Ro52 positive samples with System Rinse) were run in replicates of five on two reagent lots, once per day, for 3 days. Production reagent lots 131006 and 141007 were used for the studies. Sixty data points were generated on each lot.

The LoD was determined separately on each lot according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The limit of detection for lot 131006 was determined as 400 RLU, and for lot 141007 as 402 RLU. The final LoD value is 402 RLU.

These values are below the value of the lowest QUANTA Flash Ro52 Master Curve standard, i.e. below the Analytical Measuring Range.

# Analytical Measuring Range (AMR)

QUANTA Flash Ro52: 2.3 CU – 1685.3 CU

The AMR is defined by the values of the lowest and highest Master Curve Standards.

# Auto-rerun function and reportable results

The BIO-FLASH software has an Auto-rerun option available. If this option is selected, the instrument will automatically rerun any sample that has a result of ${ > } 1 6 8 5 . 3$ by further diluting it by 35 fold, thereby bringing the measured value within the AMR. The final result will be calculated by the software by taking into account the additional dilution factor. As the highest value that can be measured is 1685.3 CU, the highest value that can be reported is 58985 CU.

# High concentration hook effect

To assess hook effect, measurement signal (relative light units, RLU) was examined for five high positive samples (results above the AMR) before and after automatic or manual dilution. All sera produced significantly higher RLU values (above the AMR) when used "as is" compared to the manually or automatically diluted ones (that were within the AMR), thereby confirming that high positive specimens above the analytical measuring range do not show hook effect up to 23005 CU in the Ro52 assay (the highest concentration that was tested).

# Linearity

The linearity of the AMR was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. Production reagent lot 131006 was used for the study. Four serum samples with various Ro52 antibody concentrations were diluted in $10 \%$ increments (from $0 \%$ to $90 \%$ diluent) to obtain values that cover the AMR. The dilutions were assayed in duplicates. Percent recovery of obtained results was calculated compared to the expected results (based on the dilution factor). Moreover, obtained values were plotted against expected values, and linear regression analysis was performed. Only results within the AMR were included in the regression analysis.

Acceptance criteria:

- Recovery is between $8 0 - 1 2 0 \%$ , $) \mathsf r \pm 4 \mathsf C \mathsf U$ , whichever is greater. - For linear regression analysis, slope is between 0.9-1.1, and $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } \mathsf { i } s \geq 0 . 9 5$

All four specimens showed dilution linearity individually.

# Interference

The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second Edition. Three specimens were tested (negative: 16.5 CU; at the cutoff: 21.9 CU; positive: 64.9 CU). Interfering substances were spiked into every specimen at three different concentrations in $10 \%$ of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicates with the Ro52 assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents ( $10 \%$ of total). Acceptance criteria for the interference studies were $8 5 \% - 1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or $\pm 4$ CU difference, whichever is greater.

No interference was detected with bilirubin up to $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (recovery: $87 \%$ to $1 0 7 \%$ ), hemoglobin up to $2 0 0 \ : \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ (recovery: $89 \%$ to $1 0 7 \%$ ), triglycerides up to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ (recovery: $91 \%$ to $1 1 2 \%$ , cholesterol up to $2 2 4 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (recovery: $91 \%$ to $1 1 2 \%$ ), and RF IgM up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { | U / m L }$ (recovery: $92 \%$ to $10 8 \%$ ).

# Cross-reactivity

To test potential cross-reactivity with autoantibodies and infection-induced antibodies, results obtained on 199 of the total 233 control samples that were included in the clinical validation study were assessed. These samples were from patients with autoimmune diseases that are characterized with disease specific autoantibodies, or from patients with positive infectious disease serology.

# Lot to lot comparison

Twenty unique samples and the Positive and Negative Controls (altogether 22 specimens) with various reactivity levels were tested in triplicates with three different reagent lots: 121005, 131006 and 141007. The samples covered the total analytical measuring range of the assay. Results were processed by linear

regression analysis and bias calculation according to CLSI EP09-A2, Method Comparison and Bias Calculation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline - Second Edition.

Pair-wise comparisons were performed between lot 121005 vs 131006, lot 121005 vs 141007 and lot 131006 vs 141007, considering individual replicates instead of the mean of replicates.

# Stability

# Shelf life

To establish the initial claim for shelf life, accelerated stability studies were performed for 4 weeks at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ where one week is equal to six months at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ .

Accelerated stability testing was performed on each of the following sealed components of the QUANTA Flash Ro52 to establish initial stability claim: the beads, the two Calibrators, and the negative and positive Controls. Each week a new sealed component was placed in the incubator, and all components were tested at the end of the experiment together with the one that was stored at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ . The recovery of the measured values was calculated for each time point (compared to those obtained with $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ stored reagent). All calculations were performed by comparing results of sealed components stored at 5 $\pm 3 \%$ (control) to those stored at $3 7 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ (test) for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, where one week is equal to six months at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } .$ . Linear regression analysis was performed between recovery values and the number of days.

Acceptance criteria for one year preliminary expiration dating:

- Beads:

With regression analysis, the lower $9 5 \%$ CI interval of the regression line is $\ge 8 5 \%$ at 2 weeks, and no individual data point has $\leq 7 5 \%$ recovery at 2 weeks.

- Controls and Calibrators:

With regression analysis, the lower $9 5 \%$ CI interval of the regression line is $\geq 9 0 \%$ at 2 weeks, and no individual data point has $\leq 8 0 \%$ recovery at 2 weeks.

Beads

Testing was performed on three lots of Ro52 coupled beads using up to 6 characterized samples with various reactivity levels.

All three lots of beads retained $> 8 5 \%$ reactivity (considering the $9 5 \% \thinspace { \mathsf { C l } }$ ) after two weeks at $3 7 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ and therefore pass the acceptance criteria for one year expiration date.

# Calibrators and Controls

Testing was performed on three lots of Ro52 Calibrators and Controls. All Calibrators and Controls maintained $> 9 0 \%$ reactivity (considering the $9 5 \%$ CI) when sored at $3 7 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ for 2 weeks, and therefore pass the acceptance criteria for one year expiration dating.

# In-use (onboard) stability

Calibrators

Onboard stability claim: 4 calibrations, or 8 hours onboard

During assessing on-board stability, Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard the instrument, and calibration was performed altogether five times over 8.5 hours. Controls and a panel of characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve.

Calibrators are considered stable if all five calibrations performed in the 8.5 hour period are successful, and average Calibrator RLU recovery values are between $90 \%$ and $110 \%$ compared to the first use.

A total of 5 successful calibrations were performed over an 8.5 hour period. Calibrator RLU values remained within the $9 0 – 1 1 0 \%$ range. Moreover, all Controls and patient panel samples ran within their expected range. This supports the claim that calibrators can be used for up to 4 calibrations over an 8 hour period.

# Controls

Onboard stability claim: up to 15 uses, at 10 minutes onboard per use

During assessing on-board stability, 2 vials of each Control were assayed twice a day for a total of 20 runs. The first run (each vial run in duplicate) was used to establish baseline value, and then additional 19 runs (each vial run in singleton) were performed. During runs, the Controls were left uncapped, onboard the instrument for 15 minutes per run. When not in use, the controls were capped, and stored at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ .

Percent recovery of each value was calculated against the mean of duplicates of each vial from the first run. Controls are considered stable when all values run within their established range, and the linear regression line obtained by plotting %recovery values against the number of runs stays between $85 \%$ and $1 1 5 \%$ at run 15.

All controls ran within their respective acceptable ranges for all runs. Moreover, the regression line remained between $85 \%$ and $1 1 5 \%$ at run 15 for both Controls. These results support the claim that controls can be used for up to 15 times, at 10 minutes per use.

Reagent Cartridge

To establish the in-use stability of the QUANTA Flash Ro52 reagent cartridge, three lots of cartridges were tested with up to 4 serum specimens (with different reactivity levels) along with the Negative and Positive Controls. The specimens were tested periodically up to 49 days. Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values, and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting %recovery against the number of days. The claim was established using the following criteria (using the one that is fulfilled first):

- The stability claim is established at the actual measurement day preceding the day when the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line reaches $85 \%$ or $1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or

- At the actual measurement day preceding the day when 2 data points or $22 \%$ of the recovery data (whichever is greater) is $\leq 7 5 \%$ or $\ge 1 2 5 \%$ recovery.

The onboard stability results of the three lots are as follows:

RP0002: 36 days

121005: 36 days

141007: 42 days

Using these criteria, the in-use (onboard) stability of Ro52 reagent cartridge was set at 36 days.

# Real time stability

Real time stability testing was performed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 and 18 months on the Calibrators and Controls, to support the one year expiration, and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months on one lot of reagent cartridge, and at 0 and 19 months on another lot of reagent cartridge.

Each control was tested in triplicates at each time point.

- Acceptance criteria: results should fall within their acceptable ranges as it was established at the release of the controls.

Calibrators were tested in triplicates at each time point as it is done during calibration. Averages of the triplicates were compared to the value that was assigned to the Calibrators at release.

- Acceptance criteria: $\%$ recovery of the average of the triplicates is between $85 \%$ and $1 1 5 \%$ , and $\% { \mathsf { C V } }$ of the triplicates is $< 1 0 \%$

For reagent cartridge, QC panel samples (with target results) were tested at each time point. This QC panel is used by the QC Department for reagent release and QC.   
- Acceptance criteria: results should fall within their respective QC ranges.

All results were within the acceptance limits.

# Cut-off, reference range

QUANTA Flash Ro52: Negative <20 CU

Positive ≥20 CU

The reference population for establishing the reference interval for the Ro52 assay consisted of 155 subjects:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample Group</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Apparently healthy blood donors</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>115</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Viral hepatitis positive samples</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>HIV positive samples</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Syphilis positive samples</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Rheumatoid arthritis patients</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22</td></tr></table>

All specimens were the same matrix (serum) as specified in the Intended Use. All specimens were unaltered. The cut-off was established in accordance to CLSI C28-A3c: Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline - Third Edition. The Analyseit for Excel software was used to make the calculations. The distribution of the results was non-normal (Saphiro-Wilk ${ \mathsf { p } } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ), so the non-parametric percentile method was used. The 97th percentile of the obtained values calculated as 9655.6 RLU.

The cutoff was set to 10000 RLU. Three apparently healthy blood donors and one rheumatoid arthritis sample tested positive at this cutoff level.

# Clinical performance characteristics

# Clinical sensitivity, specificity

A cohort of characterized samples, none of which were used for establishing the reference range, was used to validate the clinical performance of the QUANTA Flash Ro52. A total of 600 characterized samples were included in the Validation Set for the QUANTA Flash Ro52. All samples were run on the QUANTA Flash Ro52.

# Expected values

The expected value in the normal population is “negative”. Anti-Ro52 autoantibody levels were analyzed in a cohort of 111 apparently healthy blood donors (90 females and 21 males, ages 17 to 60 years, with an average age of 32.6 years and median age of 31 years) using the QUANTA Flash Ro52. This patient population was different from the one that was used to establish the cutoff, and was only used to assess expected values. With the cut-off of 20 CU, none of the samples were positive on the QUANTA Flash Ro52. The mean concentration was 8 CU, and the values ranged from $< 2 . 3$ to 19.3 CU.

# Comparison with predicate device

Samples for method comparison analysis included 319 samples from the clinical validation study, along with 27 additional samples characterized as having a speckled pattern on HEp-2 by ANA IIF. From the total sample size of 346, results for 283 samples were within the reportable range of the assay. These samples were tested on both the QUANTA Flash Ro52 and on the predicate ELISA. The data are presented in the following tables:
