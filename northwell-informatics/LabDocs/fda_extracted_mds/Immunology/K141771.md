# I. Device Description:

The required components for the Prosigna™M Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay include the RNA Isolation kit (manufactured by Roche), Prosigna reagents (Reference Sample, CodeSet, Prep Pack, Cartridge(s) and Prep Plate) and the instruments that comprise the nCounter Dx Analysis System; the Prep Station and Digital Analyzer.

The assay requires microdissection of tumor from FFPE biopsies, isolation of RNA using a Roche RNA isolation kit, transfer of RNA to PCR tubes for hybridization before placing onto the prep station. Two sets of probes specific to each of 58 RNAs are added to the hybridization reaction. These consist of biotin-labeled magnetic probes to purify the RNAs and capture them on the assay cartridge and fluorescent "barcode" probes to detect and quantify individual RNAs. The patient sample and probes are pipetted automatically into the Prosigna test cartridge by the Prep Station. The prep station uses magnetic bead capture and washing to remove excess RNA and un-hybridized probes. The isolated and hybridized RNA species are then bound via biotin on the capture probe randomly to streptavidin on the cartridge. The fluorescent molecules are then aligned on the cartridge by addition of an electric current. The cartridge is then transferred to the Digital Analyzer where the cartridge is scanned and digital analysis software is used to count the number of each RNA species present. The amount of each RNA is then put into a proprietary algorithm to produce a Prosigna score.

The test output is a patient specific report which includes a Prosigna score (0-100) and risk category (low/intermediate/high).

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: "Gene Expression Profiling Test System for Breast Cancer Prognosis, issued on May 9, 2007"

# L. Test Principle:

Used together, the ProsignaT Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay and nCounter Dx Analysis System are a nucleic acid hybridization, visualization and image analysis system based upon coded probes designed to detect the messenger RNA transcribed from 58 genes. The test input is purified RNA from FFPE breast tumor specimens which are acquired from surgical resection. The Prosigna assay uses gene-specific probe pairs that hybridize directly to the mRNA transcripts in solution. The nCounter Dx Analysis System delivers direct, multiplexed measurements of gene expression through digital readouts of the relative abundance of the mRNA transcripts.

Specifications are included as part of the Prosigna Assay to control for sample quality, RNA quality, and process quality. The Prosigna assay utilizes prototypical expression profiles (centroids) for breast cancer. Patients RNA signatures are categorized into one of four centroids (not reported) based upon how close their gene expression pattern is to each of the centroids. The software algorithm produces a Prosigna score based on the similarity of the expression profile to each centroid, as well as the pathological tumor size and a proliferation score computed from a subset of genes. Three risk categories (low, intermediate and high) were defined based on a study with over 1007 patient samples associating Prosigna score with long-term outcome, defined by distance recurrence free survival at 10 years (DRFS) (Table 2).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

See Predicate Device K130010 for Analytical Performance Data.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison of Prosigna Scores was conducted using the two available configurations of the kit (4 sample and 10 sample kits). Forty samples of RNA previously extracted from FFPE breast tissue, covering a range of Prosigna scores were tested with both configurations and the data plotted using Deming regression (Figure 1 below).

![](images/01e16dcfc6c53c626b574129d252fb8f224f5f0f739811500d3c31ecbd7168e8.jpg)  
4 sample

The data was linear over the range of the assay with no outliers between the two methods indicating that the 4-kit and 10-kit assays produce substantially equivalent results.

No value deviated by more than 2 units from the average score when run using either configuration.

![](images/93fc9d3478874018839c6aaba8b8f664af17e47d5de425496e7d892143ca3d59.jpg)  
Figure 3: Bland-Altman comparison plo: of ROR scores obtained from each kit contiguration for the analysis data set (40 samples).

Bland Altman Analysis (above) showed that variations in data using the 4-kit versus the 10-kit configuration did not bias results and no changes in risk categorization occurred.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable. FFPE tissue is the only matrix indicated for this device.

3.Clinical studies: See Predicate Device K130010 for Clinical Performance Data

4. Clinical cut-off: Same as assay cut-off

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

Risk assessment is reported as Low Risk, Intermediate Risk, or High Risk for node negative patients or as Low Risk or High Risk for Node positive patients (see Table 3).

# N. Instrument Name:

The nCounter Dx Analysis System consists of a liquid handling robot Prep Station 5s and an epifluorescent scanner Digital Analyzer 5s.

O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Automated

# 2. Software:

The Digital Analyzer measures and sorts multiple signals (reporter probes bound to mRNA transcript) from the clinical sample to establish an indicator (Prosigna score and risk category) to aid in determining patient prognosis. The Prep Station automates posthybridization sample processing while the Digital Analyzer includes signal reading, raw data storage, data acquisition software and software to process the detected targets (algorithm).

The Software is a Visual ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { + + } }$ web-based application developed by Nanostring.

The current version of the Software is v1.3 and includes validation for the 4-test kit configuration in a dual IVD/RUO mode.

Yes _x _or No

3. Specimen Identification: Specimen identifying information is entered into a computer application manually.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Samples are handled individually until RNA is extracted from FFPE tissue. RNA samples are then handled in batches of 6 or12 on the instrument. These include 2 control samples and either 4 or 10 test samples, depending upon the configuration of reagent plates used.

5. Calibration:

Installation, calibration and preventative maintenance of instrumentation are performed by the instrument manufacturer. No user calibration required.

Quality Control:

Quality control includes testing of the mixed Reporter CodeSet and Capture ProbeSet for the following performance characteristics:

Signal level of the geometric mean of housekeeping gene probes   
Signal levels of each of the 50 classifier genes   
Background level of the negative controls   
Linearity of positive controls   
Probe cross-contamination

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The "Performance Characteristics" Section above:

# None

Q. Proposed Labeling:

1. Labeling was modified to reflect

the new software version, to indicate the presence of the 4-test kit configuration to include acceptable specifications for low volume spectrophotometers to be used with the assay to alert physicians to a trend in the data noted by post-hoc analysis whereby most distant recurrence appears to occur after 5 years.

2. The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.

S. Other Supportive Device and Instrument Information:

1.See predicate device K130010 for additional information concerning device performance.   
2. Sponsor also included an update to the specifications for spectrophotometers that may be used to prepare RNA for the Prosigna device. The data revealed that at least two low volume spectrophotometers would provide acceptable quantitation of RNA for later use in the Prosigna assay.

3.Additional Clinical Claims

a. Sponsor originally sought additional claims, through changes to the patient Case Report Form in order to claim the Prosigna device could distinguish risk groups by risk of early recurrence versus late recurrence. That is to say that breast cancer that is expected to recur within a 10 year period, but that had a higher risk of arising within 5 years after surgery could be distinguished from those at higher risk of arising between 5 and 10 years after surgery. The Sponsor's calculations and pre-defined acceptance criteria only included those patients in the 5-10 year (late) recurrence group and did not take into account the early recurrence group.   
b. Sponsor indicated that this information was provided to avoid confusion and were only included for "descriptive" purposes. FDA noted that the Sponsor provided precise calculations of data that had overlapping confidence intervals and was not statistically significant.   
c. FDA noted to Sponsor that the information that they intended to convey was already present in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves presented on the case report forms and that a textual instructions to take care in the interpretation of survival was truthful and accurate without being false or misleading.   
d. Sponsor removed charts of early v. late recurrence from the patient case report form.   
e. Sponsor has altered the final version of labeling to remove a specific claim of early v. late recurrence.   
f. Sponsor did include a text description of the 0-5 year early versus 5-10 year late recurrence and presented the Kaplan-Meier curve for this population

4 Additional Stability Claims

a. Sponsor took a retrospective look at their stability data that was based upon reduction of signal of the control material geomean value once the stability study was completed.   
b. Sponsor noted that if the lot release criteria for the control material were increased from a geomean value of 2289 to 3308, the stability data previously collected would support a stability claim of 1 1 months.   
c. FDA noted that while this hypothesis was scientifically sound, it was not properly

validated as the new lot release criteria was neither specified, nor in place when the stability testing began. As such, the stability remains established at 8 months, as was established via an add to file for the original 510(k): K130010..

5Additional Labeling Changes

a. Sponsor validated a new software package that allowed the nCounter elements instrument run in two modes. The first is the cleared "IVD" mode. The other was variously described as "non-IVD" or "life Sciences" mode.   
b. FDA indicated to Sponsor that the change in software was acceptable but that all labeling and software must indicate that the FLEX device configuration is acceptable for IVD use only when used in "IVD" mode.
