# L. Test Principle:

Lumipulse G CA125II is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents, for the quantitative measurement of CA125 in specimens based on CLEIA technology by a two-step sandwich immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE G System. CA125 in specimens specifically binds to anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody (mouse) on the particles, and antigenantibody immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP: calf)-labeled anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody (mouse) specifically binds to CA125 of the immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate Solution is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of 477 nm) is generated by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent signal reflects the amount of CA125.

One human serum specimen pool and one K2 EDTA plasma specimen pool with high CA125 levels were diluted with one human serum specimen pool and one K2 EDTA plasma specimen pool with low CA125 levels throughout the range of the assay. The linearity was found in the range of 2.5 to $1 0 0 0 \ : \mathrm { U / m L }$ . Lumipulse G CA125II correlated with expected concentrations according to the linear regression formulas:

Serum: $y = 0 . 9 9 7 3 ( \times ) + 1 . 5 0 1 7$ ; R-squared: 0.9999   
Plasma: $y = 1 . 0 1 4 7 ( \times ) + 3 . 9 6 5 3$ ; R-squared: 0.9996

Lumipulse G CA125II recovery on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System is $1 0 0 \pm 1 5 \%$ , ranging from $9 7 \%$ to $1 1 5 \%$ . A study was performed where known concentrations of OC125 defined antigen were added to human serum and K2 EDTA plasma samples with low endogenous CA125 levels. The concentration of CA125 was determined using the Lumipulse G CA125II and the resulting percent recovery was calculated.

High dose hook is a phenomenon whereby very high level specimens may read within the dynamic range of the assay. For Lumipulse G CA125II, no high dose hook effect was observed for samples containing up to 200,000 U/mL of OC125 defined antigen on the LUMIPULSE G1200 system. However, values above $2 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ should be interpreted with caution because reading may be inaccurate above this concentration.

Lumipulse G CA125II Calibrators are for use in the calibration of the LUMIPULSE G System when used for the quantitative measurement of CA125 in serum or plasma (dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, and sodium heparin). 2 Bottles ( $1 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ each) are supplied for the Lumipulse G CA125II Calibrators. Preservatives: Sodium Azide. The calibrators are at the following concentrations:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Calibrator</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration(U/mL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CAL 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CAL 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1000</td></tr></table>

There is currently no known internationally recognized consensus reference method or reference material for standardization. Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA125II values are expressed as $\cup / \mathsf { m L }$ . This value is related to a Fujirebio Diagnostics maintained reference preparation. Calibration of the Lumipulse G CA125II is traceable to in-house reference calibrators, whose values have been assigned to correlate to Fujirebio Diagnostics’ CA125II RIA.

The real time stability (including open use) has been demonstrated on the LUMIPULSE G1200 system for 10 months. The instrument cartridge and calibrators were found to be stable under simulated transport conditions. Shelf life assignment for the Lumipulse G CA125II Immunoreaction Cartridges and Calibrators is 10 months at $2 { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of LUMIPULSE G CA125II on the LUMIPULSE G1200 system is $\leq 2 . 0 \ \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ .

1) LoB and LoD   
The LoB for Lumipulse G CA125II was $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ .   
The LoD for Lumipulse G CA125II on the LUMIPULSE G1200 system was $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ , determined consistent with the CLSI guideline EP17-A. Seven low level specimens were tested over 3 days using two LUMIPULSE G1200 Systems and two Lumipulse G CA125II lots giving 120 determinations for each panel.

# 2) LoQ

The LoQ for Lumipulse G CA125II on the LUMIPULSE G1200 system was $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ , determined consistent with the guidelines in the CLSI guideline EP17-A. Since the percent total error in all cases is less than $30 \%$ , LoQ equals LoD.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The Lumipulse G CA125II on the LUMIPULSE G1200 system demonstrated an average interference of $\leq 1 0 \%$ (for each compound) in a study consistent with the guidelines in the CLSI guideline EP7-A2. Human serum and K2 EDTA plasma specimen pools were supplemented with potentially interfering compounds. The following compounds were tested and found not to interfere with the test.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method Comparison

Lumipulse G CA125II method comparison study was performed on the LUMIPULSE G1200 system using specimens consistent with CLSI guideline EP9-A3 using the weighted Deming regression method to compare Lumipulse G CA125II to ADVIA Centaur CA 125II. The ADVIA Centaur CA 125II has a different measuring range than the Lumipulse G CA125II therefore the results limited to the measurement range of both devices (102 samples). The samples tested ranged from 15.5–822.2 U/mL. The data are summarized in the following table.

Monitoring of Disease status in Patients Diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer The effectiveness of Lumipulse G CA125II on the LUMIPULSE G1200 system as an aid in monitoring of disease status in ovarian cancer patients was determined by assessing changes in CA125 levels in serial serum samples from 59 patients compared to changes in disease status. A study involving a total of 289 pairs of observations was undertaken with an average number of 5.9 observations per patient. A positive change in CA125 was defined as an increase in the value that was at least $20 \%$ greater than the previous value of the test. This level of change takes into account the variability of the assay. Sixty-seven percent $( 6 7 \% )$ or 35/52 of the patient samples with a positive change correlated with the disease progression while seventy-six percent $( 7 6 \% )$ or 180/237 of the patient serial samples with no significant change in CA125 value correlated with no progression. The total concordance was seventy-four percent $7 4 \%$ or 215/289).
