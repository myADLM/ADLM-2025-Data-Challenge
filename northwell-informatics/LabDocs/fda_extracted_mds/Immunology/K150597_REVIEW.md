# L. Test Principle:

The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP, reacts with the specific IgE in the patient sample. After washing away non-specific IgE, enzyme labeled antibodies against IgE is added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzymeanti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the responses for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

i. Within-Lot Imprecision

Imprecision of the allergen component was evaluated by using two positive plasma samples including a low range sample $( 0 . 3 5 \pm 2 5 \% \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L ) }$ and a high range sample $( \geq 0 . 7 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } )$ , each tested in four replicates in one assay run per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using Phadia 250 instrument. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance $( \% C V )$ were calculated. Results of the study are presented below and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ values were all within the acceptance criteria $( < 1 5 \% )$ :

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity was assessed following the CLSI I/LA20-A2 guidelines. For this study, three positive plasma samples were each diluted in negative plasma generating at least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions. Undiluted samples were tested in 12 replicates and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use using Phadia 250 instrument. One lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was used. ImmunoCAP Specific IgE working range is LoD to $1 0 0 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# i. Traceability

The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 of Human Serum

Immunoglobulin from World Health Organization (WHO).

# ii. Kit Stability

Real-time and Accelerated stability: The stability studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A: Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. Accelerated stability studies demonstrated 24 months unopened shelflife stability of d202, rDer p 1 dust mite allergen. For real-time stability study, three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component d202 were stored at recommended storage temperature, $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Two positive plasma samples (0.8 and $1 . 2 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } )$ and one negative plasma sample $( { < } 0 . 1 \mathrm { { k U } _ { A } / L ) }$ were tested at different occasions according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use, using Phadia 250 instrument. The study is ongoing.

Accelerated stability was assessed with three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component d202 stored at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested after four and eight weeks using two positive plasma samples and one negative plasma sample. The same lots stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ were used as reference. The results support the manufacturer’s claim of 24 months.

The stability of the calibration curve, real time and on-board stability of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators are detailed in K100999.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for d202, rDer p 1 allergen component on the Phadia 250 instrument according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. The LoB was based on single determinations of 100 negative samples (blank samples) and was estimated as the 95th percentile of the distribution. LoD was calculated according to the equation: $\mathrm { L o D = L o B + c _ { \beta \textrm { x } } }$ SD where SD, the standard deviation, was based on 20 determinations of three low positive samples, in total 60 determinations (20 determinations of three low positive samples). The results are shown in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ImmunoCAPAllergen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB (kUA/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD (kUA/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>d202, rDer p 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0210</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0340</td></tr></table>

e. Analytical specificity:

# i. Inhibition studies

Immunological specificity of the allergen component was verified through competitive inhibition studies in accordance with CLSI I/LA20-A2. The specific IgE concentration for the positive sample is shown in the table below.

<table><tr><td>ImmunoCAP Allergen</td><td>(kUA/L)</td></tr><tr><td>d202, rDer p 1</td><td>9.4</td></tr></table>

The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose dependent inhibition. The unrelated allergen solutions were not further diluted. Equal volumes of a positive sample and varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor) were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for one hour before being analyzed with the corresponding ImmunoCAP Allergen Component on Phadia 250 instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was performed in duplicate in one assay run and mean values were calculated.

The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in $\%$ , calculated according to the formula below:

${ \bf r } =$ response [RU]   
${ \mathfrak { b } } =$ background response ( $100 \%$ inhibition) [RU]   
$\mathbf { t } =$ total response $0 \%$ inhibition) [RU]   
$\dot { 1 } =$ inhibition

The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution and the unrelated inhibitors indicate that ImmunoCAP Allergen d202; Allergen component rDer p 1, House dust mite contains the immunologically relevant allergen as shown below:

The House dust mite d202, rDer p 1 allergen inhibition study showed that $\ge 8 5 \%$ inhibition was achieved with the related inhibitor (rDer p1 allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration of $4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The inhibition studies using three unrelated inhibitors, including three from unrelated groups (rPla l 1, Plantain; rPla a 1, London Plane; and rFel d 2, Cat) and one from the related/same group (rDer ${ \tt p 2 }$ , House dust mite) did not show any significant inhibition at the highest inhibitor concentration of $0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ . The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen d202, rDer p1, House dust mite solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.

# ii. Interference

# a. Endogenous Substance Interference

In order to demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assays using representative allergens, bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } ]$ , bilirubin F (fc $1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), hemoglobin (fc $4 8 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and chyle (1,440 Formazine Turbidity Units) were spiked and analyzed in duplicate in one assay run using Phadia 250. The results demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assays.

# b. Exogenous Substance Interference

Two literature references were provided to support that commonly prescribed "allergy medications" do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE (omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759– 766, and (ii) Linda Cox et al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 2008; 101:580–592.

# f. Assay cut-off

Limit of Quantitation for ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ . All results $> 0 . 1$ $\mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ are interpreted as being analytically positive.

2. Comparison Studies a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Refer to clinical studies b. Matrix comparison:

Demonstration that different sample matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) are interchangeable for representative ImmunoCAP Allergen Components was provided in the clearance for K101251. Serum, sodium heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma samples were collected from four patients with known clinical history of specific allergies and four non-atopic patients. The samples contained specific IgE antibodies for one or more of the allergen components tested. All sample matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) from each patient were tested with ImmunoCAP Allergen Components in two replicates in one assay run using Phadia 250 instrument. Mean concentration values for each sample matrix were calculated. Mean logarithmic ratios for 17 results were -0.022 (Plasma heparin/Serum) and 0.054 (Plasma EDTA/Serum). The results from the study show that samples of different matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) are interchangeable for ImmunoCAP Allergen Components.

3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:

The performance of ImmunoCAP allergen d202 components, rDer p 1 and nDer p 1, was compared. The objective of this study was $( i )$ to demonstrate that the rDer p 1 Allergen Component d202 performs as well as the currently cleared product using samples with clinical information of house dust mite allergy, and (ii) to demonstrate that samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical reaction to the allergen have undetectable or very low levels of specific IgE to the rDer p1 component of ImmunoCAP Allergen d202. At least 35 clinical serum samples (atopic) from individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the allergen, as diagnosed by a physician, were used in the study. Information about clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. A total of 100 negative (non-atopic) samples $( < 0 . 3 5 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L ) }$ from healthy non-atopic donors with no reported clinical reaction to the allergen were also tested. The assay was performed according to ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using Phadia 250 instrument. Results are presented in the table below:
