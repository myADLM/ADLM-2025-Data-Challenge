ImmuLisa™ Enhanced Centromere Antibody ELISA Centromere Antibody ELISA LJM, Antinuclear Antibody (Enzyme‐Labeled), Antigen, Controls INOVA QUANTA Lite™ Centromere ELISA

General Description: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) occur in sera of patients with various connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), systemic sclerosis / scleroderma (SSc), polymyositis and Sjögren’s syndrome. These ANA are directed against nuclear antigens, including DNA, nucleohistone and various extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) such as RNP, Sm, SS‐A (Ro), SS‐B (La), Centromere, Scl‐70 (topoisomerase I) and Jo‐1.

The anti‐centromere antibody produces a discrete speckled pattern in HEp‐2 immunofluorescence assays, and has been observed in $3 8 \mathrm { - } 6 4 \%$ of patients with the limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) or CREST syndrome variant of systemic sclerosis or scleroderma. Centromere antibodies bind the kinetochore of mitotic chromosomes and the pre‐kinetochore of interphase cells. Immunoblotting analysis indicates that centromere antibodies recognize at least six epitopes on three chromosomal proteins: CENP‐A (17‐19kD), CENP‐B (80kD), and CENP‐C (140kD). CENP‐A and CENP‐B have been cloned and while CENP‐B is thought to be the primary autoantigen, it appears that assays incorporating both antigens produce results with greater sensitivity and more comparable to immunofluorescence.

This test is performed as a solid phase immunoassay. Microwells are coated with recombinant purified CENP‐A and CENP‐B centromere antigens. Controls, calibrators and patient sera are incubated in the antigen coated wells to allow specific antibodies present in the serum to bind to the centromere antigen. Bound antibodies are detected by adding an enzyme labeled anti‐human IgG conjugate. Specific enzyme substrate (TMB) is then added and the presence of antibodies is detected by a color change that is read by a spectrophotometer at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . Results are expressed in ELISA units per milliliter $( \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l } )$ and reported as positive or negative.

Intended Use: An enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the qualitative or semi‐quantitative detection of anti‐centromere IgG antibodies in human serum as an aid in diagnosis of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis / CREST in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.

Similarities and Differences: Both kits use recombinant CENP‐A and CENP‐B coated on 96 well plates to detect IgG Centromere antibody with HRP anti‐human IgG conjugate and TMB substrate. The IMMCO kit utilizes a 5 point calibrator curve with a borderline/indeterminate range of 20‐25EU/ml; while the INOVA kit uses a single low positive sample as a calibrator and has a cutoff of 20 units with no borderline range.

# Non‐clinical Tests:

Method Comparison: Both kits were tested with well‐characterized lcSSc / CREST subjects and disease controls.

# Reproducibility

Qualitative reproducibility was tested with 80 runs of samples in the negative range, $\sim 2 0 \%$ below cutoff, $\sim 2 0 \%$ above cutoff, in the moderate positive range of the assay and near the cutoff using the qualitative analysis method. Samples were tested in duplicate twice per day for 20 days be two different operators / equipment sets.   Assay results for the cutoff specimen produced $6 2 . 5 \%$ qualitative (positive) agreement. Assay results for the $\sim 2 0 \%$ above cutoff specimens produced $9 8 . 8 \%$ qualitative agreement. All other specimens produced $100 \%$ qualitative agreement.

# Limit of Detection

The limit of detection (LoD) was determined based on 60 replicates of the blank and 10 replicates each of 6 low‐level (NHS) samples. LoD was determined to be $3 . 9 \ : \mathrm { E U / m } |$ .

# Linearity and Recovery

Linearity and recovery were tested by diluting positive specimens through the assay range in equidistant dilutions and comparing actual vs. expected results. The linear range of the assay was determined be 3.9 (LoD) – 160 EU/ml. Results are summarized below:

To assess hook effect, dilutions of high positive specimens with results above the $1 6 0 ~ \mathsf { E U / m } |$ measuring range were tested. Hook effect was not demonstrated in dilution samples with theoretical levels of $2 5 3 1 . 3 \ : \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ for testing within OD range of the microplate reader $( \sim 3 . 5 0 \mathsf { D } )$ .

Clinical Tests: Sets of clinical samples were tested on the IMMCO Centromere ELISA. By testing 124 lcSSc/CREST samples the sensitivity was determined to be $5 3 . 2 \%$ . By testing 865 autoimmune and infectious disease controls the specificity was determined to be $9 5 . 5 \%$ .
