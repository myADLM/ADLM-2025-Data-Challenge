# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantification, Approved Guideline.

# L. Test Principle:

The EliA™ test wells are coated with a human thyroglobulin protein, or a human recombinant thyroid peroxidase protein. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to TG or TPO bind to their specific antigen. After washing away nonbound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The claimed linear range for anti-TPO is 4 – 1542 IU/mL

Hook Effect/Over the Range Results:

Hook effect was investigated by using five serum samples above the upper limit of the measuring range. Five high positive samples were diluted and the dilutions were measured in two replicates and compared to the upper limit of the technical measuring range (4794 IU/ml for EliA anti-TG and 1542 IU/ml for TPO EliA anti-TPO).

EliA anti-TG Immunoassay:

No hook effect was observed when analyzing five high positive samples that had concentrations up to 27.7 times above the upper limit of the technical measuring range.

EliA anti-TPO Immunoassay:

No hook effect was observed when analyzing five high positive samples that had concentrations up to 13.4 times above the upper limit of the technical measuring range.

Results above the upper limit of the measuring range are reported as “above”. No recommendations are made for dilution of samples outside measuring range in the Package Insert.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

The IgG calibrators are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. New batches of IgG calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.

The instrument measures specific IgG concentrations in $\mu \ g / \mathsf { L }$ . By using a conversion factor given by the lot-specific code of the EliA™ test well, the results are automatically converted to IU/mL for EliA anti-TG and EliA anti-TPO.

# Stability:

The EliA IgG system reagents and the EliA IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control are already FDA cleared under k063775 and k072393, respectively.

# Shelf life:

An accelerated study was done to determine the shelf life for EliA anti-TG wells and EliA anti-TPO wells and it was determined to be 18 months. The real time stability test confirmed the determined shelf life.

# On-board stability:

The on-board stability EliA anti-TG and EliA anti-TPO carriers (containing the antigen coated wells) was tested over 4 weeks using 3 positive and 2 negative samples only on the Phadia 250 instrument. As the storage conditions in the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument are similar the results can also be used for stability claims for the Phadia 2500/5000. The on-board stability for the Phadia 250 instrument was determined to be 28 days at ${ 2 } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .

Open Stability:

Stability of the foilbag containing the EliA anti-TG and EliA anti-TPO wells after first opening was tested and determined to be 9 months at ${ 2 } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were done on both Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500/5000. Four different analyte-free samples and four blood donor samples with low antibody concentration were measured in six replicates in each of six runs at six different days (6 replicates x 6 runs $= 3 6$ replicates per sample). For both instrument types (Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500/5000), each sample was run in a total of six runs on two instruments (3 runs on instrument 1 and 3 runs on instrument 2) with two lots of wells and reagents. The results are summarized in the tables below:

e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous Interference: A study was run to investigate whether high concentrations of potentially interfering substances in serum, like bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipemic factor, rheumatoid factor, thyroxine and iodide adversely affect the results of the new device. Three serum samples were prediluted in EliA Sample Diluent and spiked with the different interfering substances or their respective blank solutions, and analyzed in triplicates. A calibration curve was run in duplicate. The runs were repeated twice. One batch of EliA antigen wells and one batch of system reagents were used throughout the studies.

One negative sample, one sample with concentration around the cut-off and one high positive sample were tested. The ratio of blank/spiked for equivocal and positive samples was 0.94 – 1.09 for EliA anti-TG and 0.93 – 1.05 for EliA anti-TPO. No interference was observed up to the concentrations listed in the table below:

Carry-over: A study was carried out on a Phadia 250 instrument using the test EliA Ro, cleared under k082759. A serum sample was diluted 1:2 and 1:20 using instrument dilution and manual dilution. A lower dilution factor than the default one (1:100) was chosen to challenge the system. Only a few RUs difference compared to the reference pipetting could be seen, which is too low to be expressed in U/mL. The observed carry over effect is therefore negligible without any influence to assay results.

Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate is impossible.

# f. Assay cut-off:

A study was done on 604 apparently healthy blood donor samples from Caucasian, African American, Hispanic and Asian individuals almost equally distributed by sex and age in order to evaluate expected values for each of the antigens in the submission in the normal population and to confirm the defined cut-off. The samples were measured on the Phadia 250 instrument for EliA anti-TG and EliA anti-TPO. The ${ 9 0 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the 604 samples were calculated and the $9 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile was taken into account for setting the cut-off. The following values were selected for the cut-off:

b. Matrix comparison:

Serum, lithium heparin plasma and EDTA plasma were collected from the same patients $( \mathsf { n } = 5 7 )$ ) to demonstrate that the plasma results do not deviate from the corresponding serum results and are within the pre-defined specifications. Most samples were spiked with serum samples of high antibody titer to cover the measuring range; samples within the equivocal range were neat samples. Samples were tested in duplicates. Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed using the first replicate only and by plotting the concentration observed from the control tube (serum) versus the concentration for each test collection tube. The corresponding slopes of regression and coefficient determination are summarized in the tables below:
