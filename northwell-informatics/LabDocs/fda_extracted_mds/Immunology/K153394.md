# DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE

# Clinical Significance

Normal immunoglobulins are composed of smaller units called heavy chains and light chains. There are five types of heavy chains (alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu), and two types of light chains (kappa and lambda). The heavy and light chains are produced separately within plasma cells and are assembled to form a whole (“intact”) immunoglobulin. When the light chains are attached to the heavy chains they are called bound, and when they are not attached they are called free. Kappa Free Light Chain (FLC) is a $2 2 \mathrm { k D }$ protein while Lambda FLC is usually a dimer of $4 4 \mathrm { k D }$ as presented in the serum. Elevated levels of Kappa or Lambda FLC are associated with plasma cell disorders such as multiple myeloma, lymphocytic neoplasms, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, AL amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease and connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

# Assay Principle

Human Kappa (κ) Free Light Chain Assay is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Kappa FLC in the sample binds to specific anti-Kappa FLC antibody, which is coated on latex particles, and causes agglutination. The degree of the turbidity caused by agglutination can be measured optically and is proportional to the amount of Kappa FLC in the sample. The instrument calculates the Kappa FLC concentration by interpolation of obtained signal of a 6- point calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known concentrations.

The Diazyme Human Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Lambda FLC in the sample binds to specific anti-Lambda FLC antibody, which is coated on latex particles, and causes agglutination. The degree of the turbidity caused by agglutination can be measured optically and is proportional to the amount of Lambda FLC in the sample. The instrument calculates the Kappa FLC concentration by interpolation of obtained signal of a 6-point calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known concentrations.

# Detailed Device Description

Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) /Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay System consists of the following items:

1. Diazyme Human Kappa $( \kappa )$ Free Light Chain Assay: containing reagent R1 and Reagent R2. Reagent 1 contains $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ tris buffer, and $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide Reagent 2 containing anti-human Kappa Free Light Chain Ig fraction coated on polystyrene beads and $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide.   
2. Diazyme Human Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay: containing reagent R1 and Reagent R2. Reagent 1 contains $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ tris buffer, and $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide Reagent 2 containing anti-human Lambda Free Light Chain Ig fraction coated on polystyrene beads and $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide.   
3. Diazyme Kappa and Lambda FLC Calibrator Set: 5 levels, serum based, liquid stable format, intended for use in establishing the calibration curve for the Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) and Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay.   
4. Diazyme Kappa and Lambda FLC Control Set: 2 levels, serum based, liquid stable format, intended for use in monitoring the quality control of results obtained with the Diazyme Human Kappa $( \kappa )$ and Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay.

Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) /Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assays are run on clinical chemistry analyzers such as Roche Hitachi 917 analyzer (K023009). They never come into direct contact with patients. The patient’s venous blood sample is first collected by a phlebotomist and then submitted for determination of Kappa and Lambda FLC concentration using Diazyme Human Kappa $( \kappa )$ and Lambda $( \lambda )$ FLC Assay by trained professionals.

The Control Unit of the Roche Hitachi 917 analyzer uses a graphical interface to control all instrument functions. The computer, keyboard, and touchscreen monitor allows users to navigate through the software, enter assay, calibrator, and control information, and make test selections. The Diazyme Kappa and Lambda FLC Hitachi 917 application parameters provided are programmed into the Hitachi 917 analyzer. The reagents, calibrators and controls are loaded into the analyzer. The Roche Hitachi 917 stores Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) /Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay reagents in a refrigerated compartment. Reagent and sample pipettes automatically aspirate and dispense specified amounts of reagent or calibrators, controls, and sample into reaction cells. The change in absorbance is measured at specified wavelengths.

See Reaction Scheme.

After a 6-point calibration, spline-fitting is used to smoothly fit polynomial functions through mean values of the response for calibrators of known concentrations. The Roche Hitachi 917 calculates the kappa and lambda FLC concentration of a patient sample by interpolation of the obtained signal to a stored 6-point calibration curve.

Precision for Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) FLC Assay

The precision of the Assay was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A guideline. In the study, eight levels of serum specimens containing kappa FLC spanning AMR and two levels of serum based kappa FLC controls were tested with 2 runs per day with duplicates over 20 working days using multiple lots of the reagents on multiple analyzers.

# Rationale for Considering the Device Substantially Equivalent to Devices Approved for Inter-State Commerce

Freelite $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Human Kappa Free Kit/ Freelite $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Human Lambda Free Kit was selected for method comparison with Diazyme Human Kappa(κ)/Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay. The reagents used for the Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) and Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay are similar to the predicate and were used to develop the application for the Hitachi 917 analyzer. The similarities and differences between the predicate reagent and the Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) and Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay are given in the table above. Detailed performance characteristics and comparison analysis are given in the filing and demonstrate substantial equivalence to predicate device.

The performance characteristics of the Diazyme Human Kappa $( \kappa )$ and Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay are substantially similar to that of the approved predicate test. Performance data and risk analysis indicates that differences should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Diazyme Human Kappa $( \kappa )$ and Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay and offers users an in vitro diagnostic device system to measure Human Kappa (κ) and Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain in human serum.

# Conclusion

Detailed method comparison analysis presented in this $5 1 0 \mathrm { k }$ submission, together with linearity, precision and interference studies, demonstrates that the Diazyme Human Kappa(κ)/Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay performance is acceptable, safe and effective. There is no significant deviations between the results obtained by Diazyme Human Kappa (κ) and Lambda $( \lambda )$ Free Light Chain Assay and the legally marketed predicate device Freelite $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Human Kappa Free Kit/ Freelite $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Human Lambda Free Kit (k023009, k023131, k040009) when testing clinical patient samples and is thus substantially similar.
