# 12. Device description

The NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) and ANCA (Formalin) Kits are indirect immunofluorescence assays for the qualitative detection and semi-quantitative determination of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies of IgG isotypes in human serum

 ANCA (Formalin Fixed Human Neutrophils) Slides; 12 wells/slide, with desiccant, or ANCA (Ethanol Fixed Human Neutrophils) Slides; 12 wells/slide, with desiccant   
 FITC IgG Conjugate with DAPI, containing $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide; ready to use.   
 Positive Controls: cANCA and pANCA; human serum with antibodies to PR3 and MPO antigen, containing $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide; pre-diluted, ready to use.   
 Negative Control: IFA System Negative Control, diluted human serum with no ANCA present, containing $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide; pre-diluted, ready to use.   
 PBS II (40x) Concentrate, sufficient for making $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ of 1x PBS II. Mounting Medium, containing $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide   
 Coverslips

# 13. Principle of the method and summary of the procedure

Samples are diluted 1:20 in PBS and incubated with the antigen substrate (human neutrophil granulocytes fixed on glass microscope slides). After incubation, unbound antibodies are washed off. The substrate is then incubated with anti-human IgG-FITC conjugate. The conjugate contains a DNAbinding blue fluorescent dye, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) that is required for NOVA View use. The blue dye is not visible by traditional flurescence microscope at the wavelength where FITC fluorescence is viewed. Unbound reagent is washed off, and the slides are coverslipped. Stained slides are read by manual fluorescence microscopy, or scanned with the NOVA View Automated Fluorescence Microscope. The resulting digital images are reviewed and interpreted from the computer monitor.

<table><tr><td>NOVA Lite® DAPI ANCA Ethanol and Formalin</td><td>Page 7 of 45</td></tr></table>

ANCA positive samples exhibit an apple green fluorescence corresponding to areas of the cell where autoantibody has bound.

# Manual interpretation

Ethanol ANCA:

The two major patterns on ethanol fixed substrate are cytoplasmic or C-ANCA, and perinuclear or PANCA.

C-ANCA: Coarse speckled cytoplasmic fluorescence, often with accentuated staining between the nuclear lobes. This pattern is characteristic for antibodies reacting with Proteinase 3 (PR3).

P-ANCA: P-ANCA samples present as perinuclear staining with or without nuclear extension. This pattern is usually characteristic for antibodies reacting with Myeloperoxidase (MPO).

ANA positive samples, primarily those containing anti-DNA/histones, usually react with the nuclei of ethanol-fixed neutrophils, causing nuclear staining, and may mask or mimic P-ANCA pattern.

Moreover, antibodies to other granule antigens, such as elastase, BPI, cathepsin G, lactoferrin and others may also produce a perinuclear staining on ethanol fixed neutrophil substrate (sometimes referred to as Atypical ANCA). Atypical ANCA and ANA usually become negative on formalin fixed substrate.

Formalin ANCA:

On formalin fixed substrate, both MPO and PR3 antibodies appear as coarse cytoplasmic granular staining with interlobular accentuation.

Formalin fixation also destroys/modifies most of the nuclear antigens, and as a result, ANA positive samples usually become negative, or show greatly reduced fluorescence.

# NOVA View interpretation

When slides are analyzed by NOVA View, digital images of representative fields of view of the well are captured. These digital images must be reviewed and interpreted from the computer monitor by a trained operator. At the same time when digital images are taken, NOVA View measures the FITC light intensity of the cells that are included in the region. NOVA View reports the measured fluorescence intensity in units of Light Intensity Units (LIU).

NOVA View provides the trained operator with the acquired digital images and the following supportive information:

• LIU value • Negative/positive classification • Pattern information

NOVA View Single Well Titer

The Single Well Titer (SWT) is a software application that estimates the endpoint titer (i.e. the highest dilution that produces positive result) for wells with a positive reaction with Ethanol ANCA, based on the obtained LIU and pattern.

# 14. Analytical performance characteristics

# 14.1 Nomenclature used in the studies

All studies have been performed by interpreting the results with both manual microscopy and with the NOVA View system.

“Manual” and “Manual reading” refers to results obtained by reading the slides with traditional fluorescence microscope.

“NOVA View” refers to software reported results obtained with the NOVA View Automated Fluorescence Microscope, such as Light Intensity Units (LIU), positive/negative classification and pattern information.

“Digital”, “Digital reading” and “Digital image” refers to results obtained by reading NOVA View generated images on the computer monitor.

For statistical calculations, a positive result is presented as $" 1 "$ , and a negative result is presented as $" 0 ^ { \prime \prime }$ . Intensity of the staining is expressed in reactivity grades. Grade 0 is negative; grades 1-4 are weak to strong positive.

$^ { 4 + }$ Brilliant apple green fluorescence   
$^ { 3 + }$ Bright apple green fluorescence   
$^ { 2 + }$ Clearly distinguishable positive fluorescence   
$^ { 1 + }$ Lowest specific fluorescence that enables the nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining to be clearly differentiated from the background fluorescence

Pattern nomenclature: See Principle of method and summary of the procedure

# 14.2 Precision performance

# 14.2.1 Within laboratory imprecision

To assess the precision performance of the NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin Kit results, a study was performed by processing 3 negative and 13 positive samples: 7 anti-MPO and 6 antiPR3 positive samples with various ANCA intensities, in three replicates, in 10 runs (2 runs per day),

<table><tr><td>NOVA Lite® DAPI ANCA Ethanol and Formalin</td><td>Page 9 of 45</td></tr></table>

resulting in 30 data points for each sample. The slides were read with NOVA View, and digital images were interpreted by the operator. Moreover, slides were read with manual microscope, too; i.e. three set of results were generated: NOVA View software interpretation, digital image reading results and manual reading results. Results were generated for within-run, between-day and total imprecision. Acceptance criteria: Difference between reactivity grades within one run (between replicates) are within ± one reactivity grade. Average reactivity grade difference between any runs is within ± one reactivity grade.

Results: For both digital image reading and manual reading, grades were within ± one reactivity grade within one run (within triplicates), and the average grade was no more than one reactivity grade different between runs.

The results of the above precision study are summarized in the Tables below.

# 14.2.3 Between sites/instruments reproducibility

The same 287 clinically characterized samples were tested with both Ethanol ANCA and Formalin ANCA at three testing sites, using three different NOVA View instruments: in Inova’s laboratory, and two external US clinical laboratories. The two external sites each also tested 100 routine clinical samples that ANCA testing was requested from. The composition of the sample cohorts and the results obtained by the three sites are shown below:

Five specimens were tested (one negative, one low anti-MPO positive, one strong anti-MPO positive, one low anti-PR3 positive, one strong anti-PR3 positive). Interfering substances (see tables above) were spiked into every specimen at three different concentrations (see tables above) in $10 \%$ of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicates according to the standard protocol (diluted in 1:20 and processed on Ethanol ANCA and Formalin ANCA slides). The concentrations shown above are final (testing) concentrations in the sample after spiking. To assess interference with rheumatoid factor (RF), $10 \%$ , $30 \%$ and $50 \%$ (volume) RF positive sample was added to the test samples. All samples were processed with NOVA Lite DAPI ANA kit, and read with NOVA View. Digital images were interpreted and confirmed. Moreover, all slides were read by the same operator with manual microscopy. Appropriate controls were made by adding $10 \%$ (volume) sample diluent to the same samples and for testing for RF interference, adding $1 0 \%$ , $30 \%$ and $50 \%$ (volume) sample diluent to the samples.

It is known that ANA and other anti-cell antibodies may interfere with ANCA detection by causing nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining. It is assumed that the main cause of interference shown in the population above is the result of ANA or in the samples.

Therefore cross-reactivity caused by known ANA positive samples was examined by testing 25 analytically characterized samples, and cross reactivity was found with $76 \%$ , $80 \%$ and $80 \%$ of ANA positive samples on Ethanol-fixed slides with NOVA View software interpretation, manual interpretation and digital image interpretation, and $24 \%$ , $32 \%$ and $24 \%$ cross-reactivity was shown on Formalin-fixed slides, respectively:

The following statements were added to the package insert of the kits under “Limitations of the Procedure”:

Ethanol ANCA:

ANA positive samples may react with the nuclei of ethanol-fixed neutrophils, masking or mimicking ANCA. Positive IIF results should be confirmed by antigen specific solid phase assay for anti-MPO and anti-PR3.   
Formalin ANCA:

<table><tr><td>NOVA Lite® DAPI ANCA Ethanol and Formalin</td><td>Page 34 of 45</td></tr></table>

ANA positive samples may show weak nuclear fluorescence on formalin fixed neutrophil granulocytes.

# 15. Cutoff

The serum dilution of 1:20 was selected to provide optimal clinical sensitivity and specificity, and it is the same as that of the predicate device.

Sera from 90 apparently healthy subjects (44 females, 46 males) and from 20 patients with infectious diseases (10 females, 5 males, 5 unknown) were tested. The number of positive results is shown in the Table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NOVA View softwareinterpretation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Manual reading</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Digital reading</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ethanol ANCA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Formalin ANCA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr></table>

The performance of this serum dilution has been validated as described in sections “Clinical performance” and “Expected values”.

# 16. Comparison with the predicate device

# 16.1 Conjugate comparison

The conjugate (P/N 508102) is the same that is used in the NOVA Lite DAPI ANA Kit (k 155055). It is the same conjugate as that of the predicate device (P/N 508113), but with blue fluorescent dye DAPI (4',6- diamidino-2-phenylindole) added.

To demonstrate the equivalent performance of the conjugate with and without DAPI, a comparison study was performed.

Comparison was performed on 36 specimens (analytically characterized serum samples and controls), in addition to a diluent blank, with FITC IgG Conjugate (508113) and FITC IgG Conjugate with DAPI (508102), using ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin reagents. Results were manually interpreted.

Acceptance criteria:

Qualitative agreement: $\geq 9 0 \%$ Grade agreement: $\geq 9 0 \%$ within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ reactivity grade

Moreover, endpoint titration was performed on 6 positive samples with both FITC IgG Conjugate (508113) and FITC IgG Conjugate with DAPI (508102).

Acceptance criteria:

• The endpoint dilution is within $\pm 1$ dilution step between the two conjugates

The qualitative agreement and the grade agreement between the result obtained with the predicate and the new conjugate was $100 \%$ on both Ethanol and Formalin ANCA slides.

# 16.2 Method comparison

Results that were obtained with the NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit by NOVA View software interpretation, digital image reading and manual reading were compared to those obtained with the manual interpretation of the predicate device. Study includes 100 samples (50 P-ANCA and 50 C-ANCA) and disease control groups (infectious disease, Systemic Lupus Erythemtosus, Progressive Systemic Sclerosis, Rheumatoid arthritis and Chronic Kidney Disease) Qualitative agreement, pattern agreement and grade agreement were calculated between NOVA View software interpretation, manual reading and digital image reading.

<table><tr><td>NOVA Lite® DAPI ANCA Ethanol and Formalin</td><td>Page 36 of 45</td></tr></table>

Acceptance criteria:

Qualitative agreement: $\ge 8 0 \%$ (this acceptance criteria only applies to manual and digital because NOVA View always has to be confirmed by digital interpretation) Grade agreement: $\geq 9 0 \%$ within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ reactivity grade Pattern agreement: $\ge 8 0 \%$ between manual and digital interpretation.

# 17.1 Clinical sensitivity and specificity

To assess clinical performance, a clinical study was performed by Inova Diagnostics on 653 clinically or analytically characterized serum samples. 59 samples were analytically characterized (anti-MPO/PR3 positive) samples and 89 samples were derived from healthy individuals; these samples were excluded from the sensitivity and specificity calculations.

Additionally, 287 clinically or analytically characterized serum samples were tested at Inova (Site#1) and at two external clinical sites (Site#2 and Site #3) with both Ethanol and Formalin ANCA, as described in section “Between sites/instruments reproducibility”. The cohort contained 49 analytically characterized samples that were excluded from the sensitivity and specificity calculations (clinical cohort $\mathtt { n } = 2 3 8$ ). The composition of the combined clinical cohort $\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 6 5 3$ ) is described in the table in the “Clinical Performance” section.

Sensitivity (on ANCA-associated vasculitis – AAV) and specificity, calculated on the combined population, are shown below.

The reason for the low specificity of Ethanol ANCA testing is assumed to be the consequence of ANA interference/cross-reactivity, as many of the control groups (rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, celiac disease, etc.) are known to have an ANA prevalence above that of the healthy population. As ANCA is tested in 1:20 serum dilution, this effect is augmented. However, it is also known that ANA becomes negative, or shows a highly decreased staining intensity on Formalin fixed ANCA slides. Therefore the relationship between Ethanol and Formalin ANCA results was assessed on the control population of the between sites reproducibility study $\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 1 5 8 )$ .

The vast majority of Ethanol ANCA positive samples became negative on Formalin ANCA, as shown in the Tables below (only Inova data are shown):

# 17.2 Expected values

Expected values were analyzed on 89 samples from apparently healthy subjects: 29 females, 54 males, 6 with unknown gender, with mean age of 45.7 years (range of 18-68).

With Ethanol ANCA, there were 4 positive results with NOVA View software interpretation, 8 with manual interpretation, and 4 with digital interpretation.

There were no positive results with Formalin ANCA testing, by any interpretation method.

# 18. System description

# 18.1 NOVA View Automated Fluorescence Microscope and Software

# 18.1.1 NOVA View Automated Fluorescence Microscope

NOVA View® Automated Fluorescence Microscope is an automated system consisting of a fluorescence microscope and software that acquires, analyzes, stores and displays digital images of stained indirect immunofluorescent slides. It is intended as an aid in the detection and classification of certain antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence technology. The device can only be used with cleared or approved in vitro diagnostic assays that are indicated for use with the device. A trained operator must confirm results generated with the device.

The NOVA View device has been cleared by the FDA in DEN140039. Subsequently, the use of NOVA View with AUTOLoader has been cleared in k153150.

Device description and Principle of Operation were described in DEN140039 and k153150, and remained unchanged for this submission.

# 18.1.2 Software

Level of Concern: Moderate.

The NOVA View software version in this submission contains the following changes compared to the version in k153150:

Addition of ANCA module, containing ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin applications, and ANCA SWT application.

When ANCA slides are analyzed by NOVA View, digital images of representative fields of view of the well are captured. At the same time when digital images are taken, NOVA View measures the FITC light intensity of the cells that are included in the region. NOVA View reports the measured fluorescence intensity in units of Light Intensity Units (LIU).

NOVA View provides the trained operator with the acquired digital images and the following supportive information:

# NOVA View Ethanol ANCA Single Well Titer (SWT)

The SWT is a software application that estimates the endpoint titer (e.g., the highest dilution that gives positive result) for wells with a positive reaction with Ethanol ANCA, based on the obtained fluorescence intensity and pattern. The highest titer that can be differentiated is 1:1280 for both P-ANCA and CANCA. Above this value the NOVA View reports $\ge 1 2 8 0$ titer.

The SWT function was established on 10 anti-MPO (P-ANCA) and 10 anti-PR3 (C-ANCA) positive samples, containing various levels of antibodies. Two-fold serial dilutions were made from each sample, starting from 1:20, up to 1:10,240. Each dilution was processed on ANCA Ethanol slides, and the results were interpreted by NOVA View and by manual reading. Based on the results that were generated on these samples, P-ANCA and C-ANCA specific LIU curves were established based on 4-PL logistic curve fitting. NOVA View uses these built-in curves for titer determination.

The validation of the SWT function was performed on altogether 24 anti-MPO (P-ANCA) and 23 anti-PR3 (C-ANCA) positive samples. All samples were serially diluted and manually titrated, and also run on the NOVA View. SWT was determined for all samples.

Acceptance criteria:

SWT is within $\pm 2$ dilution steps of that of the manual titer and the digital titer.

Based on 47 samples, $7 6 . 6 \%$ of SWT results were within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ dilution step of that of the manual titer, and $91 . 5 \%$ were within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ dilution step of that of the digital titer, and $9 7 . 7 \%$ of SWT results were within $\pm 2$ dilution steps of that of both the manual titer and digital titer.

Additionally, SWT validation was part of the between sites reproducibility study.

Seven positive samples were assayed by all three testing sites (including Inova). $8 5 . 7 \%$ (12 out of 14) of SWT results at the two external sites were within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ dilution step of that of the manual titer, and $9 2 . 9 \%$ (13 out of 14) were within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ dilution step of that of the digital titer; $100 \%$ of SWT results were within $\pm$ 2 dilution steps of that of both the manual titer and digital titer.
