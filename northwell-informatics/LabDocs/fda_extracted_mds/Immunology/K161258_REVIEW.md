2. Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry (CLSI EP07-A2)

3. Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples (CLSI EP09-A3)

# L. Test Principle:

Samples are diluted 1:20 in PBS and incubated with the antigen substrate (human neutrophil granulocytes fixed on glass microscope slides). After incubation, unbound antibodies are washed off. The substrate is then incubated with anti-human IgG-FITC conjugate. The conjugate contains the DNA-binding blue fluorescent dye, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) that is required for NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope use. The blue dye is not visible by traditional fluorescence microscope at the wavelength where FITC fluorescence is viewed. Unbound reagent is washed off, and the slides are coverslipped. Stained slides are read by manual fluorescence microscopy, or scanned with the NOVA View Automated Fluorescence Microscope. The resulting digital images are reviewed and interpreted from the computer monitor. ANCA positive samples exhibit an apple green fluorescence corresponding to areas of the cell where autoantibody has bound.

Manual interpretation of NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit:

The two major patterns on ethanol-fixed substrate are cytoplasmic or C-ANCA, and perinuclear or P-ANCA.

C-ANCA: C-ANCA samples present as coarse speckled cytoplasmic fluorescence, often with accentuated staining between the nuclear lobes. This pattern is characteristic for antibodies reacting with PR3.

P-ANCA: P-ANCA samples present as perinuclear staining with or without nuclear extension. This pattern is usually characteristic for antibodies reacting with MPO.

Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive samples, primarily those containing antiDNA/histones, usually react with the nuclei of ethanol-fixed neutrophils, causing nuclear staining, and may mask or mimic the P-ANCA pattern(s). Moreover, antibodies to other granule antigens, such as elastase, BPI, cathepsin G, lactoferrin and others may also produce a perinuclear staining on ethanol-fixed neutrophil substrate (sometimes referred to as Atypical ANCA). Atypical ANCA and ANA usually become negative on formalin fixed substrate.

# Manual interpretation of NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit:

On formalin fixed substrate, both MPO and PR3 antibodies appear as coarse cytoplasmic granular staining with interlobular accentuation. Formalin fixation also destroys/modifies most of the nuclear antigens, and as a result, ANA positive samples usually become negative, or show greatly reduced fluorescence.

NOVA View $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope interpretation of NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit:

When slides are analyzed by NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope, digital images of representative fields of view of the well are captured. These digital images must be reviewed and interpreted from the computer monitor by a trained operator. At the same time when digital images are taken, NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope measures the FITC light intensity of the cells that are included in the region. NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope reports the measured fluorescence intensity in units of Light Intensity Units (LIU). NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope provides the trained operator with the acquired digital images and the following supportive information:

# Software principle:

IFA fluorescence microscopy digital images are taken by a camera and stored on the computer system. All images are taken through a DAPI and a FITC filter. FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) is a green fluorescent dye that is chemically bound to the anti-human IgG conjugate. DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is a blue fluorescent dye added to the

assay conjugate. DAPI strongly binds to DNA; therefore, it stains cell nuclei, regardless of antibody and conjugate binding. The NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope software is capable of storing and managing the digital images, including retrieving, displaying on computer monitor, enlarging, and overlaying DAPI and FITC images. At the same time when digital images are taken, the software measures FITC light intensity of the cells that are included in the region, and reports the measured fluorescence intensity. An assay specific software algorithm provides pattern recognition. The software includes a Single Well Titer (SWT) application that estimates the endpoint titer (e.g., the highest dilution that gives positive result) for wells with a positive reaction with Ethanol ANCA, based on the obtained fluorescence intensity and pattern.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

Nomenclature used in the studies:

All studies have been performed by interpreting the results with both manual microscopy and with the NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope system.   
“Manual” and “Manual reading” refers to results obtained by reading the slides with a traditional fluorescence microscope.   
“NOVA View” refers to software reported results obtained with the NOVA View Automated Fluorescence Microscope, such as LIU, positive/negative classification and pattern information.   
“Digital”, “Digital reading” and “Digital image” refers to results obtained by reading   
NOVA View $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope generated images on the computer monitor.   
Intensity of the staining is expressed in reactivity grades. Grade 0 is negative; grades 1–4 are weak to strong positive: $\bigcirc$ $1 +$ Lowest specific fluorescence that enables the nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining to be clearly differentiated from the background fluorescence $\bigcirc$ $^ { 2 + }$ Clearly distinguishable positive fluorescence $\bigcirc$ $^ { 3 + }$ Bright apple green fluorescence $\bigcirc$ $^ { 4 + }$ Brilliant apple green fluorescence

For all studies presented here, all results met the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-Lab Precision:

To assess the precision performance of the NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) and ANCA (Formalin) Kit results, a study was performed by processing three negative and 13 positive samples: seven anti-MPO and six anti-PR3 positive samples with various ANCA intensities, in three replicates, in ten runs, two runs per day, resulting in 30 data points for each sample. The slides were read with NOVA View $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope, and digital images were interpreted by one operator. Additionally, slides were read with a manual microscope. Three set of results were generated: NOVA View $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope software interpretation, digital image reading results and manual reading results.

Results: For both digital image reading and manual reading, grades were within $\pm$ one reactivity grade within one run (within triplicates), and the average grade was no more than one reactivity grade different between runs. Results are presented in the table below:

# Between site reproducibility:

The same 287 clinically-characterized samples were tested with both NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit at three testing sites, using three different NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope instruments: in Inova’s laboratory, and two external US clinical

laboratories. The two external sites each also tested 100 routine clinical samples that were submitted for ANCA testing. The composition of the sample cohorts included patients with ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) and a number of autoimmune and infectious diseases. The results obtained by the three sites are shown below:

Between-Operator Agreement:

Ten native clinical samples from patients with AAV and controls were selected to include two negative, four P-ANCA positive, and four C-ANCA positive samples. These samples were tested at each site for five days in five replicates (25 data points per sample). Manual and digital reading was performed by two operators at each site. Operator-to-operator reproducibility was assessed within each site and is presented below as overall agreement.

Five specimens were tested (one low anti-MPO positive, one strong anti-MPO positive, one low anti-PR3 positive, one strong anti-PR3 positive and one negative) in triplicate for each level of interferent. Interfering substances were spiked into every specimen at three different concentrations in $10 \%$ of total specimen volume resulting in the final interferant concentrations indicated in the table above. To assess interference with RF, $10 \%$ , $30 \%$ and $50 \%$ RF positive sample by volume was added to the test samples. Appropriate controls were made by adding $10 \%$ sample diluent to the same samples. All samples were processed with NOVA Lite® DAPI ANA kit,

and read with NOVA View $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope. Digital images were interpreted and confirmed. All slides were also read by the same operator with manual microscopy.

Reactivity grades of samples containing the interfering substance were within $\pm$ one grade of the control samples with both manual and digital reading. No interference was detected with the tested substances, up to the maximal concentrations indicated above.

The following statements were added to the package insert of the kits under “Limitations of the Procedure”:

NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit:

# Positive IIF results should be confirmed by antigen (MPO and PR3)-specific solid phase assays.

ANA positive samples may react with the nuclei of ethanol-fixed neutrophils, masking or mimicking ANCA.

Any report of positive neutrophil fluorescence issued before the ELISA results are available should indicate that positive fluorescence alone is not specific for the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).

Decision about treatment should not be based solely on the ANCA results

NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit:

Positive IIF results should be confirmed by antigen (MPO and PR3)-specific solid phase assays5.

High-titer ANCA is suggestive of ANCA-associated vasculitis, but should not be considered diagnostic by itself. The ANCA result should be considered in combination with other serological results as well as the overall clinical history including signs and symptoms of the patient.

ANCA Formalin is not intended to be used by itself, but together with ANCA Ethanol test.

ANA positive samples may show weak nuclear fluorescence on formalin-fixed neutrophil granulocytes.

ANA positive samples may show weak nuclear fluorescence on formalin fixed neutrophil granulocytes.

Any report of positive neutrophil fluorescence issued before the ELISA results are available should indicate that positive fluorescence alone is not specific for the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).

Decisions about treatment should not be based solely on the ANCA results.

f. Assay cut-off:

The assay cutoffs were established by testing 110 reference samples $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = 9 0 }$ healthy subjects and $\mathrm { n } { = } 2 0$ samples from patients with infections) at a 1:20 dilution. These were read by NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope and manually. Manual results were used as the reference. Based on this study the established cutoffs are 20 LIU for NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and 30 LIU for NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit. The above cut-off values were verified on an independent cohort, consisting of 89 samples from apparently healthy individuals. On this cohort, there were 4 positive results with NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscopesoftware interpretation, eight with manual interpretation, and four with digital interpretation with NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit, and no positive results with any interpretation method with NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit.

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The method comparison study included 267 samples comprised of MPO/PR3 positive specimens and disease control groups. Qualitative agreement, pattern agreement and grade agreement were calculated between NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope software interpretation, manual reading and digital image reading, each comparing the candidate device to the predicate device, at one internal site.

Conjugate comparison:

The NOVA Lite® DAPI ANCA Ethanol and Formalin Kits contain the same conjugate as that of the predicate device, but with blue fluorescent dye DAPI (4',6- diamidino-2-phenylindole) added. To adapt the assay for use on NOVA View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Automated Fluorescence Microscope, the blue fluorescent dye DAPI (4',6-diamidino2-phenylindole) that binds strongly to A-T rich regions in DNA, was added to the conjugate.

To demonstrate the equivalent performance of the conjugate with and without DAPI, a comparison study has been performed on clinical samples.

Thirty-six individual serum samples have been tested (analytically characterized serum samples and controls), in addition to a diluent blank, with FITC IgG Conjugate (508113) and FITC IgG Conjugate with DAPI (508102), using NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit reagents. Two sets of slides were stained: one with the conjugate without DAPI (the predicate

device), the other with the conjugate using NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Ethanol) Kit and NOVA Lite DAPI ANCA (Formalin) Kit reagents. Results were manually interpreted.

3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

To assess clinical performance, a clinical study was performed on 653 clinically or analytically characterized serum samples. Fifty nine samples were analytically characterized (anti-MPO/PR3 positive), and 89 were healthy controls (these samples were excluded from the sensitivity and specificity calculations).

Additionally, 287 clinically or analytically characterized serum samples were tested at a sponsor lab (Site#1) and at two external clinical sites (Site#2 and Site #3) with both Ethanol and Formalin ANCA. The cohort contained 49 analytically characterized samples that were excluded from the sensitivity and specificity

calculations (clinical cohort $\mathrm { n } { = } 2 3 8$ ).

The composition of the combined clinical cohort $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 6 5 3$ ) is described in the “Method comparison” section.

Patients were diagnosed according to current classification criteria 1,2,3 and ANCA testing. Sensitivity (on AAV) and specificity, calculated on the combined population, are shown below. The AAV classification group typically includesGPA, MPA, andeGPA. Where the specific diagnosis was identified, results were presented for each condition separately as well as for the specimens for which the AAV diagnostic subsets (GPA, eGPA or MPA) were not specified
