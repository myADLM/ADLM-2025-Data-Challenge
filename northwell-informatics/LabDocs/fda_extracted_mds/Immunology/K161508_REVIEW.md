# L. Test Principle:

Ceruloplasmin in the specimen reacts with rabbit anti-human ceruloplasmin antibody to form immune complexes in solution. The formed insoluble complexes scatter light in proportion to their size, shape and concentration. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the concentration of ceruloplasmin in the specimen. Ceruloplasmin concentrations are automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance: The results presented below were within the sponsor’s predetermined acceptance criteria for each study.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision: The precision of the ceruloplasmin assay was evaluated on six pooled human serum samples containing various concentrations of ceruloplasmin. Each sample was run in duplicate, two runs per day, for 20 days $( \mathtt { n } = 8 0 )$ by multiple operators using one lot of reagent on one AU5800 analyzer. Data were analyzed for within run, between run, between day and total precision. The results are summarized in the table below.

Lot-to-lot Reproducibility: To evaluate lot-to-lot reproducibility, three samples with ceruloplasmin concentration at low, medium and high levels were tested. Each sample was tested in replicates of five per run, one run a day for five days on one AU5800 analyzer with three difference lots of reagent $\mathrm { N } = 7 5$ per sample). Mean and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for each sample were calculated. The results are summarized in the table below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity: The linearity across the assay’s analytical measuring grange was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Eleven serially diluted samples with ceruloplasmin concentrations ranging from 17.37 to $2 1 9 7 . 3 3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ were prepared by mixing high positive serum samples with analyte depleted serum. Each dilution was tested in quadruplicate on the AU5800 analyzer using one lot of reagent. The weighted linear regression analysis resulted in the following equation:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range (mg/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Bias</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>17.372039.70</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.03 (1.021.04)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.49 (1.029.96)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.826.36</td></tr></table>

The data support the linearity of the claimed measuring range of the Ceruloplasmin: $6 0 { - } 2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

Auto-Dilution: A study was performed to evaluate whether the analyzer dilutes the sample correctly using pre-dilution settings when a sample has a concentration above the assay range. Deionized water or saline were tested as diluents. A sample with a concentration within the range of $2 0 0 0 { - } 3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ was prepared by spiking with Level 5 of Serum Protein multi-calibrator (ODR3023) or an in-house serum pool. The sample was tested using the 1:5 automatic dilution setting on one AU5800 analyzer and the diluted sample was run in replicates of 20 using one lot of reagent. The same sample prepared manually with a 1:5 fold dilution was used as the reference. The $\%$ bias for the results obtained with the auto-dilution compared to the results obtained with the manual dilution was $2 . 3 \%$ when deionized water was used as a diluent, and $5 . 8 \%$ when saline was used as a diluent.

Hook Effect: Hook effect was evaluated by using a spiked human serum sample with ceruloplasmin concentration of $3 4 7 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The sample was diluted to multiple levels and the diluted samples were measured in triplicate using one lot of reagent on one AU5800 analyzer. No hook effect was observed for the sample with concentration up to $3 4 7 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The calibration material is traceable to IFCC International Reference Preparation CRM470 (RPPHS).

Value assignment: The calibrator used for the Ceruloplasmin is Serum Protein Multicalibrator 2 which was cleared under K992086.

Stability:

Kit stability (unopened): A real-time stability study was performed using three lots of reagents stored under the recommended temperature at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The data were collected at different time points up to 19 months. The results support stability of the kits under the recommended storage of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 18 months.

On-board (In-use) stability: On-board stability was tested using one lot of reagent and one lot of calibrator. The reagent was calibrated and placed in the refrigerated compartment $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ of the analyzer. The data were collected at different time points up to 90 days. The results support that the on-board reagent stability is up to 90 days and the calibration stability is up to 14 days.

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying four blank samples ( $5 \%$ BSA in $0 . 9 \%$ saline) with three replicates per sample over five days with three different reagent lots . A total of 60 data points per lot were generated. LoB for each lot was calculated separately as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile value. The LoB for three lots was determined to be $5 . 5 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ , $5 . 7 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $6 . 2 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The claimed LoB value is $6 . 2 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying four human serum pools that were diluted with $0 . 9 \%$ Saline/BSA to achieve low analyte values. Each sample was tested in triplicate across five days with three different reagent lots. The LoD value was calculated as the $\mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { S D }$ of the replicates for the low level samples. The LoD for three lots was determined to be $1 2 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ , $1 1 . 5 6 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ and $1 1 . 8 4 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The claimed LoD is $1 2 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

The Limit of Quantitation $\underline { { ( \mathrm { L o Q } ) } }$ was determined based on the analysis of total imprecision of the LoD study with a total error goal of $20 \%$ . The LoQ was determined using seven pooled human serum samples that were diluted to have analyte concentrations between 2.00 to $4 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Each sample was measured in triplicate over the course of five days with three different reagent lots. The LoQ for three lots was determined to be $2 2 . 5 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , $2 2 . 0 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $2 0 . 8 3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The claimed LoQ is $2 2 . 5 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous Interference: Interferences were assessed following CLSI EP7-A2 by testing two human serum pools with low concentration $\mathrm { ( 1 5 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ m g / L ) }$ and intermediate concentration $( 5 0 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L } )$ of ceruloplasmin. Each sample was spiked with the interfering substances and tested in replicates of four on one AU5800 analyzer using one lot of reagent. The sample without spiking the interfering

substances was used as reference. The $\%$ recovery of the results from the sample with the interference substance compared to the reference was calculated and no interference was detected in the samples up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
