# Device Description:

The Xpert TV Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of genomic DNA from Trichomonas vaginalis. The Xpert TV Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis.

The Xpert TV Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity80 systems). The GeneXpert Instrument System platform automates sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems require the use of single-use, disposable cartridges (the Xpert TV cartridges) that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

The Xpert TV Assay cartridges contain reagents for the detection of genomic DNA from T. vaginalis for use with the following specimens collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals: female and male urine, endocervical swab and patientcollected vaginal swab (collected in a clinical setting). A Sample Processing Control (SPC), Sample Adequacy Control (SAC), and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System platform. The SPC, SAC, and PCC are controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System platform. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target trichomonads and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the real-time PCR reaction to reduce the possibility of false negative results. The SAC reagents detect the presence of a single copy human gene and monitor whether the specimen contains human cells. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time PCR for the detection of genomic DNA from T. vaginalis in 70 minutes or less. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert Infinity Systems, have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores1 , and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.

The swab and/or urine specimens are collected from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients and placed into a specimen transport tube containing preservative. The specimen is transferred to the sample chamber of the disposable fluidic cartridge (the Xpert TV cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument platform, which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex PCR for detection of DNA. The results are automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.

The ancillary specimen collection kits for use with the Xpert TV Assay are the Cepheid Xpert Vaginal/Endocervical Specimen Collection Kit and the Cepheid Xpert Urine Specimen Collection Kit.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Xpert TV Assay is substantially equivalent to the cleared Cepheid Xpert TV Assay [510(k) #K151565]. The assays are identical in reagents and formulation and use the same real-time PCR technology and GeneXpert instruments. The performance of the Xpert TV Assay was evaluated in a multi-site clinical study in which the performance of the Xpert TV Assay was compared to a patient-infected status (PIS). The results of the study demonstrated that the performance of the Xpert TV Assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Table 5-1 shows the similarities and differences between the Xpert TV Assay and the predicate device.

Non-Clinical Studies:

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)

The analytical sensitivity or limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert TV Assay was assessed using two Trichomonas vaginalis strains, one metronidazole susceptible ( $T .$ vaginalis $\mathrm { A T C C } ^ { \mathrm { g } } 3 0 0 0 1 ^ { \mathrm { r w } } )$ , and one metronidazole resistant ( $T .$ vaginalis ATCC® $3 0 2 3 8 ^ { \mathrm { m } }$ ). The strains were tested individually in clinical $T .$ vaginalis-negative pooled urine matrix in Cepheid Xpert Urine Transport Reagent and clinical T. vaginalisnegative pooled vaginal swab matrix (VS) in Cepheid Xpert Swab Transport Reagent.

$T .$ vaginalis was cultured and incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Visual examination of the cultures for white precipitate (indicating growth) was conducted every 24 hours for 3 to 5 days. Cell pellets were resuspended in growth medium and enumerated visually using light microscopy. The concentration of isolates was expressed as the number of cells per milliliter (cells/mL). Cultures were diluted in culture medium to $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mathrm { m L }$ and stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ . Cells were thawed on ice for use in the study.

The LoD was estimated by testing replicates of 20 at five concentrations for each strain and sample type over three days. The LoD for each strain was estimated by probit analysis. The claimed LoDs were confirmed by analyzing at least 20 replicates with $T .$ . vaginalis cells diluted to the estimated LoD concentrations. The LoD is defined as the lowest number of cells/mL that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. The study was performed with two different lots of Xpert TV reagents and the claimed LoD for each strain is the higher of the two determinations (Table 5- 3). The claimed LoD for T. vaginalis strains ATCC 30001 and ATCC 30238 in vaginal swab matrix is 2 cells/mL. The claimed LoD for T. vaginalis strain ATCC 30001 in urine matrix is 3 cells/mL. The claimed LoD for T. vaginalis strain ATCC 30238 in

urine matrix is 2 cells/mL.

The LoD point estimates and confirmed LoD for each strain tested are summarized in Table 5-3.

# Analytical Specificity (Cross-reactivity and Competitive Interference)

A panel of 124 microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses commonly found in the urogenital tract, as well as other protozoans closely related to $T .$ vaginalis were tested with the Xpert TV Assay. The microorganisms were tested in the presence (competitive interference) and absence (cross-reactivity) of 3X LoD T. vaginalis ATCC 30001 cells. The microorganisms were seeded into either pooled Trichomonas vaginalis-negative urine matrix (patient urine added to Cepheid Urine Transport Reagent) or pooled Trichomonas vaginalis-negative vaginal swab matrix (vaginal swabs collected into Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent).

Each bacterial or fungal strain was tested at $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ or greater or at $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ genomes/mL. Viral strains were tested at $1 \mathrm { \Delta x 1 0 ^ { 5 } T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ or $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ genomes $/ \mathrm { m L }$ or greater. Protozoans were cultured in growth media, visually enumerated by light microscopy and tested at $1 \mathrm { \ x \ 1 0 ^ { 5 } \ c e l l s / m L }$ or greater or $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ genomes/mL. All microorganisms were tested in triplicate. Positive and negative controls were included in the study. One organism, Trichomonas tenax, demonstrated cross-reactivity (result of TV DETECTED in the absence of TV) at $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } \mathrm { i 0 } ^ { 5 } \mathrm { c e l l s / m L }$ for the urine and vaginal swab matrix samples. Trichomonas tenax was subjected to repeat analysis at various other concentrations until a result of TV NOT DETECTED was obtained (at $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 2 }$ cells/mL). This is addressed in Limitations in the package insert. For the other 123 microorganisms, all TV positive samples remained positive and all TV negative samples remained negative, indicating that there was no interference or cross-reactivity with the results of the Xpert TV Assay for these microorganisms. Results are shown in Table 5-4 and Table 5-5 for urine and vaginal swab matrix, respectively.

# Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

The analytical inclusivity of the Xpert TV Assay was evaluated by testing 17 T. vaginalis strains diluted in either negative pooled vaginal swab matrix in Cepheid Xpert Swab Transport Reagent or negative pooled urine in Cepheid Xpert Urine Transport Reagent. All $T .$ vaginalis strains were tested in triplicate at a concentration of 3X the analytical LoD for the respective specimen type (6 cells/mL for vaginal swabs and 7.5 cells/mL for urine). All strains tested were reported as TV DETECTED. Results are shown in Table 5-7. Positive and negative controls were included in the study. The inclusivity for the $1 7 T .$ vaginalis strains tested was $100 \%$ .

# Interfering Substances Study

The performance of the Xpert TV Assay was evaluated with potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in the urogenital tract.

All substances were tested in the presence and absence of 3X LoD T. vaginalis (ATCC strain 30001) to determine if there was interference with the Xpert TV Assay. Substances were individually diluted into either pooled Trichomonas vaginalisnegative urine matrix (patient urine added to Cepheid Urine Transport Reagent) or pooled Trichomonas vaginalis-negative vaginal swab matrix (vaginal swabs collected into Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent). Positive and negative controls were included in the study.

For each interfering substance, eight replicates were tested for each set of samples (either T. vaginalis negative or $T .$ . vaginalis positive in clinical matrix). Tables 5-8 and 5-9 show the substances that were tested, the test concentrations, and the matrix in which they were diluted. One substance, blood at $> 6 0 \%$ v/v demonstrated interference (result of TV NOT DETECTED in the presence of TV) in the vaginal swab matrix samples. Blood was subjected to repeat analysis at various lower concentrations until a result of TV

DETECTED was obtained $( 5 0 \% \mathrm { v / v } )$ . For the other conditions and substances tested, all TV positive samples remained positive and all TV negative samples remained negative, indicating that there was no interference causing false negative or false positive results with the Xpert TV Assay for these substances.

a. In tests with substances diluted into pooled $T .$ vaginalis-positive swab matrix, assay interference was observed in tests with blood at $6 0 \% \ \mathrm { v / v }$ . No assay interference was observed in tests with blood at $5 0 \% \mathrm { v } / \mathrm { v }$ . This is addressed in Limitations in the package insert.

# Carry-Over Contamination

This study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative samples run after very high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. A negative sample ( $T .$ vaginalis negative vaginal swabs in Cepheid Xpert Swab Transport Reagent) was run followed by 20 rounds of high positive sample (T. vaginalis ATCC 30001 at $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { c e l l s / m L }$ diluted in vaginal swab matrix) alternating with a negative sample in two separate GeneXpert modules for a total of 40 high positive and 42 negative samples for each module. This testing scheme resulted in a total of 82 runs (40 positive $+ 4 2$ negative single-use samples). There was no evidence of carry-over contamination as all 40 positive samples were correctly reported as TV DETECTED and all 42 negative samples were correctly reported as TV NOT DETECTED.

Clinical Studies

# Clinical Performance

Performance characteristics of the Xpert TV Assay were determined in a multi-site prospective investigational study by comparing the results from the Xpert TV Assay to a patient infected status (PIS) algorithm comprised of culture and validated bidirectional sequencing (primary sequencing) for male urine, or an FDA cleared NAAT test and culture for female specimen types.

Study participants included consenting asymptomatic and symptomatic, sexually active males and females seen at locations including, but not limited to: OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD), and family planning clinics. The average age among eligible female study participants was 33.5 years (range $= 1 8$ to 78 years). The average age among eligible male study participants was 36.2 years (range $= 1 6$ to 78 years).

The study specimens consisted of prospectively collected male urine, female urine, endocervical swabs, and patient-collected vaginal swabs (collected in a clinical setting). Clinician-collected vaginal swabs were collected for testing by the reference NAAT test and culture. Samples were collected from 17 clinical sites and tested at 11 sites. Reference testing was performed at 3 central laboratories.

A study participant was considered to be infected by PIS if either of the two reference test results were positive. The subject was considered to be not infected by PIS when both reference test results were negative.

Performance of the Xpert TV Assay was calculated relative to the PIS for each of the three female specimen types (endocervical swabs, patient-collected vaginal swabs and urine) or to the PIS for male urine, respectively.

Specimens with discrepant results between the Xpert TV Assay and the PIS were analyzed by validated bi-directional Sanger sequencing and results are footnoted in Table 5-10 for informational purposes only.

Among the 10,017 tests performed, 190 had initial ERROR, INVALID, or NO RESULT outcomes ( $1 . 9 0 \%$ , $9 5 \%$ CI 1.65-2.18). Of those, 167 specimens yielded valid results upon repeat assay (7 specimens were not retested). The overall valid reporting rate of the assay was $9 9 . 8 \%$ (9994/10,017).

Results of the Xpert TV Assay were compared to the PIS for determination of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Sensitivity and specificity for TV by specimen type and symptom status are presented in Table 5-10.

# Reproducibility Study

Intra-site reproducibility of the Xpert TV Assay was evaluated at three sites (two external, one in-house). Site 1 used an Infinity-80 instrument. Sites 2 and 3 used GeneXpert Dx instruments. Specimens were created by spiking Trichomonas vaginalis $( \mathrm { A T C C } ^ { \mathrm { \bullet } } 3 0 0 0 1 ^ { \mathrm { r m } } )$ into pooled, Trichomonas vaginalis negative urine (patient urine added to Cepheid Urine Transport Reagent) or vaginal swab matrix (vaginal swabs collected into Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent). The specimens were prepared at concentration levels representing high negative (below LoD), LoD ( ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { X }$ LoD), moderate positive $( { \sim } 3 \mathrm { X } \mathrm { L o D } )$ , and negative (Trichomonas vaginalis negative clinical matrix). A panel of 8 specimens (4 in urine and 4 in vaginal swab matrix) was tested twice per day, on 12 different days, by two different operators, at each of three sites (8 specimens x 2 replicates $\textbf { x } 1 2$ days $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators $\textbf { X } 3$ sites $= 1 , 1 5 2$ observations total). Three lots of Xpert TV Assay cartridges were used at each of the 3 testing sites, with each lot used for 4 days of testing. Positive and negative controls were included in the study. The Xpert TV Assay was performed according to the Xpert TV Assay procedure. The rate of agreement with expected results is shown by site in Table 5-11.

# Instrument System Precision

An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the GeneXpert Dx and the GeneXpert Infinity Instrument Systems using specimens comprised of Trichomonas vaginalis $( \mathbf { A } \mathbf { \bar { T C C } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } 3 0 0 0 1 ^ { \mathbf { r v } } )$ spiked into negative urine (patient urine added to Cepheid Urine Transport Reagent) or vaginal swab matrix (vaginal swabs collected into Cepheid Swab Transport Reagent). The specimens were prepared at concentration levels representing high negative (below LoD), LoD $( \mathord { \sim } 1 \mathrm { X }$ LoD), moderate positive $\left( \sim 3 X \mathrm { L o D } \right)$ , and negative (Trichomonas vaginalis negative clinical matrix). A panel of 8 specimens (4 in urine matrix and 4 in vaginal swab matrix) was tested on 12 different days by two operators. Each operator conducted four runs of each panel specimen per day on each of the three instrument systems (8 specimens x 4 times/day x 12 days x 2 operators $\textbf { X } 3$ instrument systems $= 2 { , } 3 0 4$ observations total). Three lots of Xpert TV Assay cartridges were used for the study, with each lot used for 4 days of testing. Positive and negative controls were included in the study. The Xpert TV Assay was performed according to the Xpert TV Assay procedure. The rate of agreement with expected results is shown by instrument in Table 5-13.
