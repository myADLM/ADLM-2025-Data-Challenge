# I. Device Description:

The Xpert TV Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of genomic DNA from Trichomonas vaginalis. The Xpert TV Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis.

The Xpert TV Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert $^ \mathrm { { \textregistered } }$ Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems). The GeneXpert Instrument System consists of an instrument, personal computer, and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The GeneXpert Instrument System requires single-use, disposable cartridges (the Xpert TV cartridges) that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. The cartridges are self-contained, so specimens never come into contact with the working parts of the instrument.

A Sample Processing Control (SPC), Sample Adequacy Control (SAC), and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target trichomonads and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the real-time PCR reaction to reduce the possibility of false negative results. The SAC reagents detect the presence of a single copy human gene and monitor whether the specimen contains human cells. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The ancillary specimen collection kits for use with the Xpert TV Assay are the Cepheid Xpert Vaginal/Endocervical Specimen Collection Kit and the Cepheid Xpert Urine Specimen Collection Kit. The swab and/or urine specimens are collected from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients and placed into a specimen transport tube containing preservative. After transferring the specimen to the sample chamber of the Xpert TV cartridge, the user initiates a test, and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System. Results are automatically generated by the instrument at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

The clinical performance of the Xpert TV assay on female urine, endocervical swabs, and patient collected vaginal swabs has been previously reviewed under K151565.

To assess the clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert TV assay on male urine, a multicenter prospective study was performed to collect urine specimens from asymptomatic males and males presenting with symptoms potentially associated with TV infection. The performance of the Xpert TV Assay was evaluated relative to a Patient Infected Status (PIS) algorithm. The designation of a subject as being infected was based on the results of the reference tests, which consisted of InPouch TV culture and validated bi-directional sequencing. A positive result from either of these two reference tests signified a TV positive subject. The subject was considered to be not infected when both reference test results were negative.

The clinical study was performed between August 2014 and January 2015 and enrolled both male and female subjects. The clinical performance of the Xpert TV assay on the female specimen types (urine, endocervical swabs and patient-collected vaginal swabs) was previously reviewed and cleared in K151565. For the collection of male urine specimens, a total of 4465 male subjects were enrolled, of which 4458 were eligible for inclusion. The seven ineligible subjects included one subject with improper or incomplete informed consent, two subjects previously enrolled in the study, two subjects who had been treated with antibiotics within 21 days prior to study enrollment, one subject who was not sexually active, and one subject who was ${ < } 1 4$ years of age.

The clinical study was extended for male subjects only between October 2015 and March 2016 at three of the original study sites. The inclusion/exclusion criteria, study procedures, enrollment, assay procedures, quality control, bias elimination, data collection and sample size calculations were the same as described in K151565. A total of 333 additional male subjects were enrolled and eligible for inclusion.

A total of 4791 eligible male subjects (4458 from the original study and 333 subjects from the extended study) were enrolled. Of these, 165 were excluded due to 96 sample shipping delays, 36 samples tested more than 72 hours after collection, 21 Xpert modules out of calibration, and 12 samples not tested. This resulted in a total of 4626 specimens from eligible male subjects that were tested with the Xpert TV assay. Xpert TV results for $9 7 . 7 \%$ (4521/4626) of samples were successful on the first attempt; 105 results were indeterminate. One hundred of the 105 indeterminate samples were retested, and 90 of those cases yielded valid results. The overall rate of assay success was $9 9 . 7 \%$ (4611/4626).

In total, 4611 specimens from male subjects were included in the clinical performance analysis (4626 eligible specimens tested minus 15 indeterminate results). Of these, 1088 were symptomatic and 3523 were asymptomatic. The average age of the male subjects was 36.2 years old, and the average age among symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects was 32.6 years and 37.4 years, respectively.

The clinical performance of the Xpert TV assay was assessed for the original and supplemental studies both separately and combined. Analysis was performed using Fisher’s Exact p-value to ensure that no statistical difference was found between the results generated in the original and supplemental studies. The combined sensitivity for the urine specimen type was $8 7 . 5 \%$ and $9 0 . 3 \%$ for symptomatic and asymptomatic males, respectively. The overall sensitivity (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects) was $8 9 . 6 \%$ . The combined specificity was $9 9 . 8 \%$ and $9 9 . 2 \%$ for symptomatic and asymptomatic males, respectively. The overall specificity (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects) was $9 9 . 3 \%$ . The clinical performance data is reported in Table 2.
