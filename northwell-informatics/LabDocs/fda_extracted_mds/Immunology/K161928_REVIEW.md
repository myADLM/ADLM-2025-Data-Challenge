1. Intended use(s):

# CAPI 3 Immunotyping using CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument:

The CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit is designed for the qualitative detection and characterization of monoclonal proteins (immunotyping) in human serum with the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument, SEBIA, for capillary electrophoresis. It is used in conjunction with CAPI 3 PROTEIN(E) 6 kit, SEBIA, designed for protein separation into 6 major fractions in alkaline buffer $\left( \mathsf { p H } 9 . 9 \right)$ .

The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument performs all procedural sequences   
automatically to obtain a protein profile for qualitative analysis. Each serum sample is mixed with individual antisera that are specific against gamma $( \mathrm { I g ~ G } )$ , alpha (Ig A) and mu $( \mathrm { I g ~ M } )$ heavy chains, and kappa (free and bound) light chains and lambda (free and bound) light chains, respectively.   
The proteins, separated in silica capillaries, are directly detected by their   
absorbance at $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The electrophoregrams are evaluated visually to detect the presence of specific reactions with the suspect monoclonal proteins.   
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

# IT/IF Control:

The IT/IF Control is designed to quality control the qualitative detection and characterization of human monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, Kappa and Lambda) with the electrophoresis methods:

Immunotyping performed using capillary electrophoresis on SEBIA   
CAPILLARYS 2, CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING and CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instruments and on SEBIA MINICAP instrument,   
Immunofixation methods: SEBIA HYDRAGEL IF, HYDRAGEL IF Penta, HYDRAGEL BENCE JONES (Standard mask and Dynamic mask)

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced:

None Provided.

# L. Test Principle:

The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument electrophoresis system uses the principle of capillary electrophoresis in liquid medium. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their electrophoretic mobility in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation also occurs according to the electrolyte $\mathsf { p H }$ and electroosmotic flow. The CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument has silica capillaries functioning in parallel allowing 12 simultaneous analyses.

In immunotyping, a sample dilution is prepared and injected at the anodic end of six capillaries. The reference pattern (ELP pattern), which is a complete electrophoretic pattern of the sample’s proteins, is obtained by mixing the sample with the ELP solution and injecting it into the first capillary. The antisera patterns are obtained by sample aspiration into the five subsequent capillaries. Previously diluted samples are mixed with specific antisera against gamma (IgG), alpha (IgA), mu (IgM) heavy chains, and free and bound Kappa and Lambda light chains. Protein separation is performed in a high voltage electrical field. The separated proteins are detected using absorbance at $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ at the cathodic end of the capillary. After the analysis, the capillaries are immediately washed with a wash solution and filled with buffer which prepares the capillaries for the next analysis.

The immunotyping is performed in four automated steps:

1. Dilution of serum samples with a specific diluent in the pre-dilution well of the reagent cup. This dilution is made according to the sample's immunoglobulin concentration.   
2. Mixing diluted serum sample with specific antisera. The antigen-antibody complex is formed rapidly in liquid medium.   
3. Injection of the prepared samples with simultaneous aspiration into six capillaries at the anodic end. Protein separation occurs when a high-voltage field is applied to the alkaline buffer. The separated proteins are detected using absorbance at $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ at the cathodic end of the capillary   
4. Overlay of the ELP pattern on the antisera patterns (IgG, IgA, IgM, Kappa and Lambda light chains) allows the qualitative characterization and result interpretation of suspected monoclonal component.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

All results met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.

Within-run and between-capillary precision:

Six different serum samples (five pathological samples with monoclonal proteins and one normal sample) were qualitatively tested 12 times in two runs using the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING on 12 capillaries on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument. One lot of the CAPI 3 IMMUNOTYPING was used. Each sample was anaylzed with each reagent: ELP solution, anti-IgG, anti-IgA, anti-IgM, anti-kappa and anti-lambda antisera. For each tested reagent, all samples gave concordant results within-run and between-capillaries.

Within-run reproducibility of IT/IF Control:

Three IT/IF control lots were run six times within a run and the run was repeated with three different immunotyping antisera lot numbers on the CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument. The IT/IF controls were comprised of one monoclonal IgGL, one IgAL, and one IgMK. According to the identified monoclonal protein, concordant and reproducible within-run results were obtained.

Between-run and between-lot reproducibility of CAPILLARYS 3 IMMUNOTYPING and IT/IF Control on three CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument:

Five pathological and one normal serum sample were analyzed three times and repeated in three different runs (with a total of 18 runs) over five working days. The tests were performed with three different CAPILLARYS 3 IMMUNOTYPING kit lot numbers, three different IT/IF Control lots, and three different CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instruments. According to the identified monoclonal protein characterization, concordant and reproducible results were obtained for both pathological and normal serum samples on all lots and instruments.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

No reference standards and methods available. Controls are internally manufactured by the manufacturer from myeloma serum samples with representative IgGK, IgAK, and IgML monoclonal proteins, and are validated by both Immunofixation Gel Electrophoresis and Capillary Electrophoresis methods.

Stability: The manufacturer provided data to support real-time stability of 18 months and on-board stability of two months for the CAPI 3 IT Kit.

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of detection was performed on three pathological samples: IgA Kappa, IgG Lambda and IgM Kappa with concentration levels of $3 . 4 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ , $3 . 9 6 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ and $1 . 6 0 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ , respectively. These three samples were serially diluted at 1:2 down to 1:512 dilution for IgG Lambda and IgM Kappa and down to 1:1024 dilution for IgA Kappa to obtain the variable monoclonal component concentration. The testing was performed on both the Capillarys on Capillarys 2 Flex-Piercing predicate device and CAPI $3 \ \mathrm { I T }$ on CAP 3 TERA new device. The new device met the acceptance criteria and the Limit of detection results using CAPI $3 \ \mathrm { I T }$ on CAPILLARY 3 TERA are listed below:
