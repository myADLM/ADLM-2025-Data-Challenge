Dear Ms. Samuels:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls.

# L. Test Principle:

The determination of soluble antigen (CRP) concentration by turbidimetric methods involves the reaction with specific antiserum (anti-CRP) to form insoluble complexes. When light is passed through the suspension formed a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a photodiode by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample. Concentrations are automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The studies were based on CLSI EP5-A2, where 4 sera samples (targeted to $6 . 0 2 5 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ , 8.643mg/L, 21.342mg/L and $6 5 . 1 6 5 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L } )$ were tested in 2 runs per day (each of the 2 runs in duplicate) over 21 days using 1 reagent lot on 3 analysers.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i) Traceability:

The calibration of the assay is traceable to the international reference standard ERMDA474.

ii) Kit Stability:

Real-time stability – A study to establish shelf-life stability (from the date of manufacture when stored at recommended temperature $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ of the SPAPLUS CRP Kit is on-going. Currently available data supports a 5-month stabilityclaim.

Open-vial stability - The SPAPLUS CRP Kit reagents can be stored, opened at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 3 months.

On-board stability – The SPAPLUS CRP Kit reagents can be stored on-board the Optilite Analyser for at least 30 days.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was based on 60 determinations of a blank sample and was estimated as the $9 5 \%$ percentile of the distribution. The LoQ study was carried out on two reagent lots. The highest LoQ from the results of the two reagent lots was used as the overall LoQ result. The highest LoD calculated from the two LoQ studies was used as the overall LoD.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated for both reagent lots according to the equation: the $\mathsf { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5 \times$ SD where SD was based on the standard deviation of the sample used for the LoQ claim.

The LoQ was calculated and the total error $\%$ $( 1 2 \% )$ was within the maximum allowable total error.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interferences were assessed according to CLSI EP7-A2 by testing serum samples with CRP concentrations falling above (elevated) (target $6 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ or close to the limits of the reference interval (target 5mg/L). Each sample was spiked with interfering substances and tested in replicates of 3. For non-interference to be claimed, the mean results from the spiked samples must be within $10 \%$ of the mean of the control samples.

Haemoglobin, Bilirubin and RF results: The data demonstrated that the assay was not affected by high levels of the following substances: haemoglobin $( 5 9 / \mathsf { L } )$ , bilirubin $( 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) (2417IU/mL).
