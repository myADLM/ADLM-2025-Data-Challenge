Dear Mr. Lauder:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

# L. Test Principle:

The determination of soluble antigen concentration by turbidimetric methods involves the reaction with specific antiserum to form insoluble complexes. When light is passed through the suspension formed a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a photodiode by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample. Concentrations are automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The studies were based on CLSI EP5-A2, where 5 sample preparations were tested in 2 runs per day (each of the 2 runs in duplicate) over 21 days using 3 analysers. Acceptance criteria were total precision $( \% 0 0 \% 0 \% 0 \% 0 \% )$ , within-run precision $( \% 0 0 \% 0 \% 0 )$ , between-run precision $( \% 0 0 \% 0 \% 0 \% )$ , and between-day precision $( \% 0 0 \% 0 \% 0 \% )$ . A summary of the results is shown below. All results are in IU/mL.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The studies followed CLSI EP6-A, whereby linearity was assessed across the curve width at the standard sample dilution $( 1 + 0 )$ . The acceptance criteria were that the $\% 0 \%$ for each sample should be ${ \leq } 8 \%$ and the allowable nonlinearity was $\pm 1 0 \%$ or $10 \%$ of the medical decision point.

A dilution series comprising a high pool and low pool was tested in 3 replicates.

Weighted Linear Regression analysis was performed by plotting the $\%$ High Pool against the observed concentration, from which a weighted linear fit was generated for each point in the dilution series. This was then compared with the observed result and the difference calculated. Observed nonlinearity was less than $10 \%$ , or $10 \%$ of the medical decision point.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i) Traceability:

The calibration of the assay is traceable to the International Reference Preparation of Rheumatoid Arthritis Serum WHO 64/2.

ii) Kit Stability:

Real-time stability – Reagents are identical to those in the predicate device (K972220). Additional real time stability was therefore not assessed. The shelf life of the reagents is 12 months.

Open-vial stability - The RF Reagent, Calibrator and Controls can be stored, opened at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ for up to 3 months.

On-board stability – The RF Reagent can be stored on-board the Optilite Analyser for up to 30 days.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was based on 60 determinations of a blank sample and was estimated as the $9 5 \%$ percentile of the distribution. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated according to the equation $\mathsf { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { ~ \times ~ }$ SDs where SDs, the standard deviation, was based on 6 determinations of 4 samples with analyte levels near the lower limit of the reportable range. Total error at LoQ was within the maximum allowable total error.

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) for this assay is defined as the bottom of the measuring range, 7 IU/mL. The LoQ validation study was based on CLSI EP17-A Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interferences were assessed according to CLSI EP7-A2 by testing samples at different RF concentrations. Each sample was spiked with interfering substances and tested. For noninterference to be claimed, the mean results from the spiked samples must be within $10 \%$ of the mean of the control samples. The data demonstrated that the assay was not affected by the following substances at the concentrations given below.
