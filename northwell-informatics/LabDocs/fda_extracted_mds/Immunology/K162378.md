The NanoEnTek FREND™ PSA Plus is designed for in vitro DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY for the quantitative measurement of total Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) in human serum, Li-heparinized plasma, and ${ \sf K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma using the FREND™ System. This device is indicated for the serial measurement of total PSA to be used as an aid in the management of patients with prostate cancer.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: NanoEnTek FRENDTM System

# I. Device Description

The FREND™ PSA Plus is a rapid fluorescence immunoassay that measures prostate specific antigen (PSA) in human serum and in lithium heparin and ${ \sf K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma using the FREND™ system. The FREND™ PSA Plus is intended for use as an aid for prostate cancer management.

The FREND™ PSA Plus Test is a single use fluorescence immunoassay designed to quantify the concentration of total PSA in serum and lithium heparin and ${ \sf K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma samples. The specimen is added by the operator to the sample inlet with a transfer pipet, allowing the appropriate volume of sample $( 3 5 \mu \mathsf { L } )$ to be delivered into the FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge. The Cartridge is then placed into the FREND™ System, which is programmed to begin analysis once the sample has reacted with the reagents. The reaction and analysis time is approximately 4 minutes. The PSA quantification is based on the amount of fluorescence detected by the FREND™ System at the FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge window. A higher level of fluorescence is indicative of a higher PSA concentration. In other words, the magnitude of the fluorescent signal is directly proportional to the amount of total PSA in the sample.

The total PSA detection range of the FRENDTM PSA Plus Test System is 0.08 to 25 ng/mL. Results are determined via a lot-specific calibration curve which is generated by the manufacturer using a six-point calibration determined from values averaged from five replicates at each level. The established curve is uploaded to the FRENDTM via the PSA Plus Code-chip and is valid until the lot expiration date. The established curve is saved in the code-chip and valid until the expiration date of the test cartridge lot.

The FRENDTM PSA Plus Test cartridge is a disposable plastic device that houses the reagents and contains a port or opening (inlet) where the sample is applied. Once the sample is applied, it will mix with the reagents and travel towards the detection area via capillary action.

The FRENDTM System is a portable, automated FRENDTM cartridge reader. The FRENDTM System is based on quantitative immunoassay technology capable of quantifying single or multiple analytes by measuring laser-induced fluorescence in a single-use disposable reagent cartridge. The FRENDTM cartridge utilizes micro-fluidics lateral flow technology where the analyte of interest in the sample forms immune complexes while moving through the fluidics pathway in the cartridge. The

concentration of the analyte of interest in an unknown sample is calculated using the ratio of the fluorescent intensity of the test zone and the reference zone.

FREND™ System is a bench top fluorescence reader containing a touchscreen user interface. The System has a slot that accepts the sample loaded FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge, and is programmed to analyze the Test when the sample has fully reacted with the on-board in cartridge reagents. Results of the test are displayed on the screen and can be printed on an optional printer.

The FRENDTM System software controls the graphical user interface, communication with hardware, database management and data analysis. The software also controls the functions of the mechanical components including the motor, laser, printer control and acquisition of data from the sensor. The user can set the time and date and enter patient ID through the graphic user interface. The user cannot make any changes to the software.

The FRENDTM PSA Plus includes the following in the kit:

25 FREND™ PSA Plus cartridges  30 Disposable pipette tips  1 FREND™ PSA Plus Code Chip 1 FREND™ PSA Plus Package Insert

The FREND™ System (previously cleared in K124056, K131928, K152422, K153577, and K162754) is not provided with the kit but is required for the use of the FRENDTM PSA Plus test cartridge.

# c. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A study was done to demonstrate the linearity of the assay according to the dilution protocol outlined in CLSI EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. At each dilution level, the samples were tested in quadruplicate or quintuplicate to determine the measured value of tPSA. Linearity was demonstrated across a range of $0 . 0 5 \sim 2 5 . 5 3 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , in support of the FRENDTM PSA Plus reportable range of 0.08 ng/mL $\sim$ 25 ng/mL.

# d. Traceability and Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The FREND™ PSA Plus assay is traceable to the WHO International Standard Prostate Specific Antigen (90:10) NIBSC code: 96/670. The internal standard is manufactured by gravimetric methods based on the PSA Ag ACT complex (Scripps P0624-90010) or WHO standard material (NIBSC 96/670). At each concentration level, the PSA levels of calibrators are confirmed by measurement on ARCHITECT i total PSA assay (P910007) or TOSOH AIA ST PA Test (P910065). There is no need for calibration by the operator as the calibration information is coded in the individual cartridge.

# e. Stability

Real-time stability testing for the total PSA reagent kit was performed for the previous submission (K124056) according to CLSI EP25-A, Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. No additional stability studies were submitted for this submission. Reagent stability studies based on procedures and criteria in the NanoEnTek quality system showed that the cartridges for FRENDTM PSA Plus are good for at least one year from the date of manufacture if stored refrigerated appropriately as directed.

# f. Detection Limit:

The limit of Detection (LoD) for the FRENDTM PSA Plus was established at 0.03 ng/mL according to the CLSI EP17-A2 protocol. The LoQ of the FRENDTM PSA Plus was established at 0.08 ng/mL.

g. High Dose Hook Effect Testing (Prozone Detection): The presence of high dose hook effect was tested by analyzing a concentrated sample of purified PSA antigen both neat and on dilution. No High Dose Hook effect was seen in samples with a PSA concentration as high as $1 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# h. Analytical Specificity (Interference studies)

Interference is defined to be recovery outside of $1 5 \%$ of the known specimen mean concentration. Lack of interference (recovery from $85 \%$ to $1 1 5 \%$ of the expected) is considered acceptable performance. Results are summarized in the table below.

The matrix comparison study was performed at the NanoEnTek laboratory according to CLSI EP14-A3. Total PSA concentrations in 40 sample pairs, each with serum, lithium heparin plasma and ${ \sf K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma aliquots, were measured using the FRENDTM PSA Plus. The range tested is $0 . 0 8 - 2 3 . 5 9 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with serum samples. Passing-Bablok regression analysis of serum results $( \mathsf { x } )$ compared to lithium heparin

plasma or ${ \sf K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma results (y) yielded the following results, indicating FRENDTM PSA Plus can be measured equally well in serum, lithium heparin plasma and ${ \sf K } _ { 3 } .$ -EDTA plasma. The results are summarized in the table below.

c. Other studies:

Comparison studies were done in a CLIA-certified laboratory testing facility (CentraState Medical Center). Samples were validated simultaneously using the same aliquot of sample. If that was not practical, two separate aliquots of each sample, freshly defrosted prior to analysis, were used – one for each method. The instrument reagent system used for additional comparison study was the Abbott ARCHITECT total PSA assay (P910007) run on the Abbott ARCHITECT I System. Total number of sample tested for method comparison was 207. Results generated using the FRENDTM PSA Plus on FRENDTM System (y) were compared to those obtained using a previously FDA approved ARCHITECT total PSA assay (x) by Passing-Bablok regression analysis.

Comparability using CLSI guideline EP09-A3, shows that the difference in concentration between what was measured by the test device and the expected concentration is less than the allowable difference and the two methods compare favorably.

Serially monitored subjects:

As an important part of the clinical studies performed to characterize the FREND™ PSA Plus, serial samples collected longitudinally from patients previously diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated in a variety of ways over the clinical course of their disease (including prostatectomy, cryoablation, lymph node resection, TURP, chemotherapy, hormone therapy alone or in combination) were assayed for tPSA with the FREND™ PSA Plus on the FREND™ system (modified). The same samples were also measured for tPSA by the predicate PSA method (FRENDTM PSA Plus, K124056).

For each point to point in a sample serial set, the change in the tPSA concentration was compared to the change in the clinical status of the patients as measured by other laboratory tests, patient interviews, physical examinations, and imaging studies of a variety of types. There were a total of 194 such determinations for each assay.

These changes in the tPSA marker concentration were defined as significant or not by multiplying the overall $\% 0 \%$ of the assay at the midrange (as determined by the test imprecision study) by a factor of 2.5 to define a percentage change difference higher than would be expected because of assay imprecision. For both modified and predicate FREND™ PSA Plus assays with an overall mid-range $\% 0 \%$ of $8 \%$ , significance was set at a change in excess of $20 \%$ . Any increase in value from one time period to the next that did not exceed $20 \%$ was logged as ≤ $20 \%$ Change. For the low range of the assays $( < 1 \mathrm { \ n g / m L } )$ , the difference bigger than $0 . 2 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was considered a significant change.

Disease status for the patients falls into one of four different categories by the physician - NED (no evidence of disease), Responding, Stable and Progression. The table below shows each disease status as determined for the (modified) FREND™ PSA Plus results for all subjects compared to the Clinical Status changes.

For both modified and predicate FRENDTM PSA Plus assays with an overall med-range $\% 0 \%$ of $8 \%$ , significance was set at a change in excess of $20 \%$ . Any increase in value from one time period to the next that did not exceed $20 \%$ was logged as ≤ $20 \%$ change. For the low range of the assays $( < 1 \ \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L } )$ , the difference bigger than 0.2 ng/mL was considered a significant change. Positive, negative and overall concordances determined on the serial sets of samples for the two methods showed no significant difference in the ability of the assay to mirror the patient clinical status.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

According to CLSI C28-A3, serum samples from a total of 121 normal, apparently healthy adult individuals with $\ge 5 0$ years of age were assayed on 3 lots of the FRENDTM PSA Plus assay using a single FRENDTM System to establish a reference interval. The newly established reference limits of the FRENDTM PSA Plus are 2.92 ng/mL $( 9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile) and $4 . 5 9 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile).

# L. Proposed Labeling

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR §809.10.

# M. Conclusion

The modified FREND™ PSA Plus is as safe and effective as the “Predicate Device”, - the previously cleared FRENDTM PSA Plus assay. FREND™ PSA Plus has a similar Intended Use and Indications for Use for monitoring of prostate cancer patients, similar technological and performance characteristics, and principles of operation as its predicate device. The differences between the FREND™ PSA Plus and its predicate devices raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Performance data, analytical and clinical, demonstrate that the modified FREND™ PSA Plus is as safe and effective as the “Predicate Device”.
