General Description: Antiphospholipid antibodies are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies against negatively charged phospholipids.1 They are detected primarily by the anti-cardiolipin antibody (ACA) test, the biological false positive test for syphilis or the lupus anticoagulant test. These three tests detect related, but not necessarily identical antibodies. Thus, more than one of these tests may be necessary to identify antiphospholipid antibodies.

Of the various tests for the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies, the anti-cardiolipin antibody test performed by ELISA is the most sensitive.2 The presence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies helps to identify patients at risk of venous and/or arterial thrombosis often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, a syndrome referred to as antiphospholipid syndrome.1-12 It most commonly occurs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or lupus-like diseases where the criteria for SLE are not fulfilled.5-7 High levels of anti-cardiolipin antibodies occur in thrombosis, fetal loss, thrombocytopenia and several other disorders.1-15 Anti-cardiolipin antibodies are routinely detected by ELISA, using cardiolipin as the antigen. Recent observations have indicated that $5 0 \mathsf { k } \mathsf { D }$ serum factor is necessary for ACA to bind to cardiolipin. This co-factor was later identified as beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (B2GP1) or synonymously apolipoprotein H.16-18 Though the function of B2GP1 remains unclear, it is certain that the presence of B2GP1 facilitates the binding of the ACA to cardiolipin. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies, especially at low levels are found in a variety of clinical disorders unrelated to anti-phospholipid syndrome. ACA present in sera of patients with SLE and other autoimmune disorders are immunologically distinct from sera of patients with syphilis. The use of B2GP1 protein as a replacement for cardiolipin antigen on the solid matrix helps to make this distinction. Furthermore, anti-B2GP1 antibodies are very specific for anti-phospholipid syndrome

The test is performed as a solid phase immunoassay (ELISA) in B2GP1 coated microwells. Controls, Calibrators and patient serum samples are incubated in the antigen coated microwells to allow antibodies present in the serum to bind. Unbound antibody and other serum proteins are removed by washing the microwells. Antibodies bound to the microwells are detected by adding an enzyme labeled anti-human IgA, IgG, IgM or IgA/IgG/IgM conjugate to the microwells. These enzyme conjugated antibodies bind specifically to the human immunoglobulin of the appropriate class. Unbound enzyme-labeled conjugate is removed by washing. Specific enzyme substrate (TMB) is then added to the wells and the presence of antibodies is detected by a color change produced by the conversion of the TMB substrate. The reaction is stopped and the intensity of color change, which is proportional to the concentration of antibody, is read by a spectrophotometer at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . Results are expressed in ELISA units per milliliter $( \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l } )$ .

Intended Use: ImmuLisa Enhanced™ B2GP1 IgA Antibody ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative or semi-quantitative detection of β2-GPI IgA antibodies in human serum to aid in diagnosis of autoimmune thrombotic disorders associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and APS with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical findings.

ImmuLisa Enhanced™ B2GP1 IgA/IgG/IGM Antibody ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative detection of β2-GPI IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies in human serum to aid in diagnosis of autoimmune thrombotic disorders associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and APS with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical findings.

ImmuLisa Enhanced™ B2GP1 IgM Antibody ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative or semiquantitative detection of β2-GPI IgM antibodies in human serum to aid in diagnosis of autoimmune thrombotic disorders associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and APS with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical findings.

ImmuLisa Enhanced™ B2GP1 IgG Antibody ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative or semiquantitative detection of β2-GPI IgG antibodies in human serum to aid in diagnosis of autoimmune thrombotic disorders associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and APS with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical findings.

Similarities and Differences: Both sets of kits detect antibodies to beta 2 glycoprotein 1antigen coated on 96 well plates to detect with HRP anti-human IgG conjugate and TMB substrate. Both sets of IgA, IgG and IgM kits utilize a 5 point calibrator curve, however, Immco uses a borderline/indeterminate range of 20-25EU/ml, while INOVA does not use a borderline/indeterminate range. The Immco IgA/IgG/IGM kit uses a single calibrator set at $3 0 \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ , has a cutoff of 20 units with no borderline range and incorporates a combined IgA/IgG/IgM conjugate.

# Interference

Interference was studied by mixing sera with known B2GP1 levels for each assay with potentially interfering serum samples and studying deviation from expected results. No significant interference was demonstrated for the following substances at the levels indicated: Hemoglobin $( 2 \ g / \ L )$ , Bilirubin $( 3 4 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { L } )$ ), Rheumatoid Factor $( 1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l } )$ , Triglycerides $\{ 3 7 \ : \mathrm { m m o l / L } \}$ , Cholesterol (13 mmol/L), Heparin (3000 $\cup / \lfloor \rfloor$ , Acetylsalicylic Acid $( 3 . 6 2 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , Prednisone $( 0 . 8 4 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , Warfarin $( 3 2 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ ), Hydroxychloroquine $( 1 4 8 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } } )$ , Rituximab (75 $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathsf { m l } )$ , and Atorvastatin $( 6 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathsf { E } 0 / \mathsf { L } )$ .

# Precision

Precision was tested with positive specimens selected throughout the range of the assay. Seven patients were run in 13 assays with 6 replicates of each sample over a period of 4 weeks. An additional assay of 12 replicates was run to determine repeatability ( $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n = 9 0 }$ replicates per sample). Assays were run by two operators on two different sets of equipment.

# Reproducibility

Qualitative reproducibility was tested with 90 replicates of samples in the negative range, $\sim 2 0 \%$ below cutoff, $\sim 2 0 \%$ above cutoff, in the moderate positive range of the assay and near the cutoff using the qualitative analysis method. Samples were tested by two different operators / equipment sets. The cutoff samples produced $7 6 . 7 \%$ (positive), $7 6 . 7 \%$ (positive) and $6 1 . 1 \%$ (negative) qualitative agreement for IgA, IgG and IgM, respectively. Results for the ${ \mathsf { I g M } }$ cutoff $- 2 0 \%$ specimen produced $9 6 . 7 \%$ (negative) qualitative agreement. Assay results for all other specimens produced $100 \%$ qualitative agreement. For the $\mathsf { I g A } / \mathsf { I g G } / \mathsf { I g M }$ assay results of the $\sim 2 0 \%$ below cutoff specimen produced $9 7 . 8 \%$ qualitative agreement (negative). The cutoff sample produced $50 \%$ positive and $50 \%$ negative qualitative agreement. Results for all other specimens produced $100 \%$ qualitative agreement.

# Limit of Detection

The limits of detection (LoD) for these assays were determined to be $3 . 6 \ : \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ for IgA, $3 . 1 \ : \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ for IgG , $2 . 3 \ : \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ for IgM, and $2 . 7 \ : \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ for IgA/IgG/IgM based on 60 replicates of the blank and 10 replicates each of 5 low-level (normal blood donor) samples. .

# Linearity and Recovery

For the individual IgA, IgG and IgM kits, linearity and recovery were tested by diluting positive specimens through the assay range in equidistant dilutions and comparing actual vs. expected results. The linear range of the IgA assay was determined to be $3 . 6 { - } 1 6 0 ~ \mathsf { E U / m l }$ .

To assess hook effect, dilutions of high positive specimens with results above the $1 6 0 ~ \mathsf { E U / m l }$ measuring range were tested. Hook effect was not demonstrated in dilution samples as high as $2 2 8 . 6 \ : \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ for IgA, $5 9 7 . 6 \ : \mathrm { E U } / \mathrm { m l }$ for IgG, and $6 0 5 . 5 \ : \mathrm { E U } / \mathrm { m l }$ for IgM testing within OD range of the microplate reader $( \sim 3 . 5 0 \mathsf { D } )$ .

Clinical Tests: Sets of clinical samples were tested to assess sensitivity and specificity for APS, APS with SLE and SLE. Results are summarized below.
