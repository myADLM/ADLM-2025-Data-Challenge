ImmuLisa Enhanced™ Anti-Mitochondria IgG Antibody (AMA) ELISA   
Anti-Mitochondria IgG Antibody (AMA) ELISA   
Antimitochondrial antibody, indirect immunofluorescent, antigen, control [DBM]   
INOVA QUANTA Lite™ M2 EP (MIT3)

General Description: Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a disease of the liver characterized by inflammatory obliteration of the intrahepatic bile ducts. PBC is characterized by the presence of anti-mitochondria antibodies (AMA). AMA detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) occur in approximately $90 \%$ of patients with PBC and in $2 - 5 \%$ of patients with autoimmune hepatitis as well as in certain other disorders such as syphilis and drug induced hepatitis. As many as nine different staining reactions have been described by indirect IF, but only one, the M2 reaction is specific for PBC. Inability to easily distinguish different AMA reactions compromises the utility of indirect IF test methods for diagnosing PBC. Biochemical and immunochemical studies have identified the E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2) to be the immunodominant PBC specific mitochondria antigen. Other significant autoantibody markers for PBC are the E2 subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC-E2) and the E2 subunit of the branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC-E2). Anti-M2 mitochondrial antibodies are typically detected by IgG; however, literature reports a number of cases with elevated levels of IgA and/or IgM isotype antibodies rather than IgG. A combination of individual anti-mitochondrial antigens are coated in one well to facilitate immunoassay sensitivity and specificity for the detection of AMA associated with PBC.

This test is performed as a solid phase immunoassay. Microwells are coated with recombinant Mitochondrial antigen. Controls, calibrators and patient sera are incubated in the antigen coated wells to allow specific antibodies present in the serum to bind to the Mitochondria antigen. Bound antibodies are detected by adding an enzyme labeled anti-human $1 \tt g G$ or IgA/IgG/IgM conjugate. Specific enzyme substrate (TMB) is then added and the presence of antibodies is detected by a color change that is read by a spectrophotometer at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . Results are expressed in ELISA units per milliliter $( \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l } )$ and reported as positive or negative.

Intended Use: An enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the qualitative or semi-quantitative detection of anti-mitochondria IgG antibodies in human serum to aid in the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical findings.

Similarities and Differences: Both kits use mitochondrial antigen coated on 96 well plates to detect mitochondria IgG antibodies with HRP anti-human conjugate and TMB substrate. Both kits test human serum. The IMMCO kit utilizes a 5 point calibrator curve for semiquantitative results while the predicate kit utilizes a single calibrator. The Immco semi-quantitative results are reported in $\mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m } |$ while the Inova kit results are expressed in units. Both kits use a borderline/indeterminate range of $2 0 { - } 2 5 \mathsf { E } \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m } |$ .

# Non-clinical Tests:

Method Comparison: Both kits were tested with well-characterized primary biliary cirrhosis subjects and disease controls.

# Reproducibility

80 replicates of samples in the low negative range, near the cutoff, in the moderate positive range, high positive range and approximately $+ / .$ - $20 \%$ of the assay cutoffs for each AMA isotype were performed to determine qualitative reproducibility. Assay results for low negative, $+ 2 0 \%$ , moderate positive and high positive specimens produced $100 \%$ qualitative agreement. $- 2 0 \%$ specimens produced $9 8 \%$ qualitative agreement. Approximate cutoff specimens produced $6 3 \%$ qualitative agreement.

# Limit of Detection

Based on 60 replicates of the blank and 10 replicates each of 6 low-level (NHS) samples the limits of detection (LoD) for AMA antibodies ere determined to be $3 . 3 \ : \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ .

# Linearity and Recovery

Studies were performed using equidistant dilution series of positive samples with values throughout the calibrator range to determine linea range of the assay. The linear range of the assay was determined to be 3.3 to $1 6 0 \ : \mathsf { E U / m l }$ . Results are summarized below.

To assess hook effect, dilutions of high positive specimens with results above the 160 EU/ml measuring range were tested. Hook effec was not demonstrated in dilution samples as high as \~15,356.8 EU/ml within OD range of the microplate reader $( \sim 3 . 5 0 \mathsf { D } )$ .

# Interference

Interference was studied by mixing sera with known AMA levels for each isotype with potentially interfering serum substances and studying deviation from expected results. No significant interference was demonstrated for the following substances at the levels indicated: Hemoglobin $( 2 ~ \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { L } )$ , Bilirubin $( 3 4 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , Rheumatoid Factor (100 EU/ml), Triglycerides (37 mmol/L).

Clinical Study: Sets of clinical samples were tested on the IMMCO Mitochondria ELISA. This included 193 primary biliary cirrhosis and 898 autoimmune and infectious disease controls.

Primary biliary cirrhosis Clinical Sensitivity: $8 5 . 5 \%$ $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C l } 7 9 . 5 - 9 0 . 0 )$ Primary biliary cirrhosis Clinical Specificity: $9 9 . 0 \%$ $( 9 5 \% 0 0 1 9 8 . 0 - 9 9 . 5 )$

Indeterminate samples for these studies were considered positive. NHS were excluded in sensitivity/specificity calculations.

To assess hook effect, dilutions of high positive specimens with results above the $1 6 0 ~ \mathsf { E U / m l }$ measuring range were tested. Hook effect was no demonstrated in dilution samples as high as $\sim 1 7 , 9 1 5 . 7 \ : \mathrm { E U / m l }$ within OD range of the microplate reader $( \sim 3 . 5 0 \mathsf { D } )$ .

# Interference

Interference was studied by mixing sera with known AMA levels with potentially interfering serum substances and studying deviation from expected results. No significant interference was demonstrated for the following substances at the levels indicated: Hemoglobin $( 2 ~ \mathfrak { g } / \mathbb { L } )$ Bilirubin $( 3 4 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , Rheumatoid Factor (100 EU/ml), Triglycerides (37 mmol/L), and Cholesterol (13 mmol/L).

Clinical Study: Sets of clinical samples were tested on the IMMCO Mitochondria ELISA. This included 193 primary biliary cirrhosis and 898 autoimmune and infectious disease controls.

Primary biliary cirrhosis Clinical Sensitivity: $8 7 . 0 \%$ (95%CI 81.3 - 91.3)

Primary biliary cirrhosis Clinical Specificity: $9 8 . 5 \%$ (95%CI 97.2 - 99.0)

Indeterminate samples for these studies were considered positive. NHS were excluded in sensitivity/specificity calculations.
