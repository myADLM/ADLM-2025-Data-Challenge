# L. Test Principle:

The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific IgE in the patient sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzymeanti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the responses for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

All analytical performance met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

i) Comparison with predicate:

Imprecision of this updated device was evaluated by using four positive samples with the following concentration ranges: $0 . 1 { - } 0 . 2 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ , ${ \leq } 1 . 5 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ , 10-20 $\mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ , and ${ \geq } 5 0 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ ). Each sample was tested in 4 replicates in one assay run per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using the Phadia 250 instrument. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance $( \% C V \mathrm { s } )$ were calculated for each sample separately. Results of $C V \%$ are shown below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of this updated allergen was assessed following the CLSI guideline I/LA20-A2 guideline. For this study, three positive samples were each diluted in sample diluent generating at least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions. Undiluted samples were tested in 12 replicates and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using the Phadia 250 instrument. For this updated product, one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was used.

For this allergen, results of the replicates for the three samples were analyzed for linearity. Regression statistics comparing the observed results to expected results are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i) Traceability:

The IgE calibrators are traceable to the equivalent $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ International Standard 11/234 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).

# ii) Kit Stability:

Real-time and accelerated stability: The stability studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A (Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents). The results demonstrated 24-month unopened shelf-life stability from the date of manufacture when stored at the recommended storage temperature of $2 -$ $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . using three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen w1 (Common ragweed). Both an ongoing real-time stability study and an accelerated stability study were performed. The accelerated stability data supports the manufacturer’s claim of 24 months, while available real-time stability data supports 7 months stability.

The stability of the calibration curve, real-time, and on-board stability of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator are detailed in K100999.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for this updated allergen on the Phadia 250 following the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.

LoB was determined by testing five blank plasma samples with five replicates in three runs and was estimated as the $9 5 \%$ percentile of the $\mathrm { n } = 7 5$ negative results. The maximum LoB of two lots was used in the calculation of the LoD according to the equation: $\scriptstyle { L o D = L o B + c \beta \mathrm {  ~ x ~ } S D }$ where SD is the pooled SD of measuerments for each of the five low positive samples (0.135, 0.159, 0.158, 0.186 and $0 . 2 0 9 \mathrm { k U } _ { \mathrm { A } } / \mathrm { L } )$ , in total $\mathrm { n } = 7 5$ measurements. Claimed LoB is $0 . 0 2 7 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ and LoD is $0 . 0 5 8 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

i) Inhibition studies:

Immunological specificity of the allergen components was verified through competitive inhibition. The studies were planned in accordance with CLSI guideline I/LA20-A2. The specific IgE concentration for the positive sample is $6 . 2 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ .

The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dosedependent inhibition. Equal volumes of a positive sample and varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor) were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for two hours before being analyzed on the Phadia 250 instrument according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use. The testing was performed in duplicate in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.

The inhibition test was evaluated by calculating percent inhibition according to the formula below:

$$
\left( 1 - \left( { \frac { r - b } { t - b } } \right) \right) \times 1 0 0 = i \%
$$

$\mathbf { r } =$ response [RU]   
${ \mathfrak { b } } =$ background response ( $100 \%$ inhibition) [RU]   
$\mathbf { t } =$ total response $0 \%$ inhibition) [RU]   
$\mathrm { i } =$ inhibition

Any negative inhibition $\%$ -values were reported as $0 \%$ inhibition.

The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution and the unrelated inhibitors indicated that the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen contains the immunologically relevant allergen as described below:

The w1 Common ragweed allergen inhibition study showed that $5 5 0 \%$ inhibition was achieved with the related inhibitor at a final inhibitor concentration of 25 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

The inhibition studies using three unrelated inhibitors (Timothy grass, g6;

Cottonwood, t14 and Sesame seed, f10) and one from the related/same group (Goosefoot, w10) did not show any significant inhibition at an inhibitor concentration of $1 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ .

Results from the inhibition studies indicated that the ImmunoCAP Allergen w1, Common weed solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.

# ii) Interference:

# a) Endogenous Substance Interference:

In order to show that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results of the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assay using the updated ragweed allergen, Bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } ]$ , Bilirubin F (fc $1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), Hemoglobin (fc $4 8 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and Chyle (fc 1,440 Formazine Turbidity Units) were spiked into two samples and were analyzed in duplicates in one assay run using Phadia 250. The results demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE as has been shown in previous submissions, e.g., K113841.

# b) Exogenous Substance Interference:

Two literature references were provided supporting that commonly prescribed "allergy medications" do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assays. The references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE (omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox et. al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 2008:580-592.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison:

In order to show that different sample matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) are interchangeable for this allergen, serum, Na-heparin-plasma, and EDTAplasma samples were collected from patients with clinical history of known specific allergies and four non-atopic patients. The samples contained specific IgE antibodies for the allergen tested. All sample matrices (Na-heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) from each patient were tested with this allergen in two replicates in one assay run. The results from the study demonstrate that samples of different matrices (Naheparin plasma, EDTA plasma and serum) are interchangeable for allergen as has been shown in previous submissions, e.g. K101251.

3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

The performance of the updated allergen was compared to a clinical diagnosis of allergy. The objectives of this study were: $( i )$ to show the linkage between specific IgE antibodies to the allergen using clinical samples, and $( i i )$ to demonstrate that samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical reaction to the allergen have undetectable or very low levels of specific IgE to the allergen. A total of 50 clinical serum samples from individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the allergen as diagnosed by a physician were used in the study. Information about clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. Negative samples $( < 0 . 3 5 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } )$ from 100 healthy non-atopic donors were also tested.
