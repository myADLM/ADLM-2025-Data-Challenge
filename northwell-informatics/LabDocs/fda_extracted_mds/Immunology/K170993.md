# Predicate device

Calprest NG (QUANTA Lite® Calprotectin Extended Range ELISA), 510(k) number: k160447. Date declared: November 10, 2016.

# Device description

The principle of the assay is chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, a variation of solid phase immunoassay. The QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin assay is designed to run on the BIO-FLASH® instrument. This platform is a fully automated closed system with continuous load and random access capabilities that automatically processes the samples, runs the assay and reports the results. It includes liquid handling hardware, luminometer and computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin assay utilizes a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-FLASH® instrument.

Calprotectin-specific capture antibodies are coated on to paramagnetic beads, which are stored in the reagent cartridge under conditions that preserve the antibody in its reactive state. Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH® system, the reagent pack containing all the necessary assay reagents is mixed thoroughly by being inverted several times. The sealed reagent tubes are pierced with the reagent cartridge lid, and the reagent cartridge is loaded onto the instrument. Reagents are calibrated when the lot is first used. A patient extracted stool sample is prediluted by the BIO-FLASH® with sample buffer in a disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts of the diluted patient extracted stool, the beads, and the assay buffer are all combined into a second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . The beads are magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated monoclonal anti-calprotectin antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . The beads are magnetized and washed repeatedly. The isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when Trigger 1 (Fe(III)coproporphyrin in sodium hydroxide solution) and Trigger 2 (urea-hydrogen peroxide in sodium chloride solution) are added to the cuvette, and the flash of light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH® optical system. The measured RLU is proportional to the amount of bound isoluminol conjugate, which is in turn proportional to the amount of calprotectin antigen captured by the antibodies (anti-calprotectin polyclonal antibodies in this case) on the beads. For quantitation, the QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin will utilize a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge barcode. The Master Curve is generated by Inova Diagnostics for each reagent pack lot with in-house Standards with assigned unit values $( \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L } )$ . The RLU and assigned $\mathsf { n g / m l }$ values of the Standards are used to create a 4 parameter logistic curve. These four parameters are embedded in the reagent pack barcode. When the lot is used the first time, the Calibrators are run, and based on the results obtained on the Calibrators, an instrument specific Working Curve is created; The Working Curve is used to calculate units $( \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L } )$ based on RLU values obtained on each sample. The obtained $\mathsf { n g / m l }$ values will be converted to $\sf m g / k g$ by a calculation that takes into account the dilution of the samples. This unit conversion is calculated automatically by the software.

# Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The LoD of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay is $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ , which is below the analytical measuring range of the assay. It was determined by using two reagent lots, consistent with CLSI EP17-A2 guideline with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (beta) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 240 determinations, with 60 measurements on blank samples and 60 measurements of low level samples, per reagent lot. The LoB is $0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / k g }$ (513 RLU).

Two low level samples were tested in replicates of five on two reagent lots, once per day, for 3 days, obtaining 30 data points per sample to generate data used to calculate the LoQ for the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay. The LoQ was determined by calculating the total imprecision of each sample. Acceptance criteria: Total imprecision $C V \% < 2 0 \%$ .

The results obtained are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>LoQ Precision</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Total Imprecision</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample ID</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean (mg/kg)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD (mg/kg)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>17.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.6%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14.7%</td></tr></table>

The LoQ for the assay has been found to be at $1 4 . 1 \ \mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ which has been set as the lower limit of the analytical measuring range.

Even though the LoQ has been found to be at $1 4 . 1 \ \mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ the AMR of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin will start at $1 6 . 1 \mathrm { m g / k g }$ .

# Analytical Measuring Range (AMR)

QUANTA Flash Calprotectin: 16.1 mg/kg – 3,500.0 mg/kg

# Auto-rerun function and reportable results

The BIO-FLASH software has an auto-rerun option available. If this option is selected, the instrument will automatically rerun any sample that has a result of $> 3 , 5 0 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / k g }$ after further diluting it by 10 fold,

thereby bringing the measured value within the AMR. The final result will be calculated by the software by taking into account the additional dilution factor. As the highest value that can be directly measured is $3 , 5 0 0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ , the highest value that can be reported is 3 $5 , 0 0 0 . 0 \mathsf { m g / k g } .$

# High concentration hook effect

To assess hook effect, measurement signal in relative light units (RLU) was examined by performing serial dilutions of two high positive samples (with results above the AMR when tested as neat samples). RLU values showed increase with increasing antibody concentrations above the AMR, thereby confirming that high positive specimens above the AMR do not show hook effect up to $2 1 , 7 5 3 . 6 \ \mathrm { m g / k g }$ (theoretical value calculated using the highest value in the AMR and its dilution factor) in the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay.

# Linearity

The linearity of the AMR of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. The linearity was evaluated in two ways: using extracted stool samples and using recombinant antigen samples. Three extracted stool samples with various calprotectin antigen concentrations were combined with another extracted stool sample containing low levels of calprotectin antigen in $10 \%$ increments (from $0 \%$ to $90 \%$ of low sample) to obtain values that cover the entire AMR. Additionally, three samples made by diluting recombinant antigen in buffer containing stabilizers and preservatives (same buffer used to make controls and calibrators) containing various calprotectin recombinant antigen concentrations were diluted in buffer in $10 \%$ increments (from $0 \%$ to $90 \%$ of buffer) to obtain values that cover the entire AMR. The dilutions were assayed in duplicates. Results were analyzed according to the guideline performing regression analysis and identifying the best fitting polynomial.

Acceptance criteria:

- Best fitting polynomial is a linear one, otherwise, the difference between the best-fitting nonlinear and linear polynomial is less than $1 5 \%$ (allowable nonlinearity).

All samples (3 stool samples and 3 recombinant antigen samples) have been found that the best fitting polynomial is a linear one except rAg Sample 2, where the best fitting polynomial found was a second order polynomial. The nonlinearity for rAg sample 2 ranged from $- 1 3 . 0 \%$ to $2 . 1 \%$ , fulfilling the acceptance criteria.

# Recovery

The recovery of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay has been evaluated using seven extracted stool samples containing various concentrations of calprotectin antigen covering the AMR of the assay. Samples were spiked with calibrator material and then tested to calculate recovery results. For the samples with calprotectin concentrations lower than $2 0 0 \mathrm { \ m g / k g } ,$ Calibrator 2 was used as spiking material, while for samples with concentrations higher than $2 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ Calibrator 3 was used. Each sample was mixed with their correspondent calibrator material in a proportion 9:1. Each sample, calibrator and spiked sample was tested in duplicate and recovery values were calculated.

Acceptance criteria: Percent Recovery must be between $8 8 \%$ and $1 1 2 \%$

All recovery results fulfilled the acceptance criteria and ranged from $9 4 . 7 \%$ to $1 0 9 . 8 \%$ and are summarized in the table below:

# Interference

The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second Edition. Six human stool specimens, one high positive (1365.1 $\sf m g / k g )$ , one moderately positive $( 6 6 4 . 7 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g } )$ , one low positive $( 2 1 5 . 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g } )$ , one near the cutoff $\langle 1 2 3 . 0 \mathrm { m g / k g } \rangle$ , one in the indeterminate rage $( 6 2 . 2 \mathrm { m g / k g } )$ and one negative $( 2 2 . 1 \mathrm { m g / k g ) }$ , samples were tested. Interfering substances (Hemoglobin, mesalamine, prednisone, vancomycin, gamma-tocopherol, tacrolimus, beta-carotene, ciprofloxacin, cholecalciferol, lansoprazole, and ascorbic acid, along with bacterial cultures: Yersinia ruckeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli) were spiked into every specimen in $10 \%$ of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicates with the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents ( $10 \%$ of total sample volume). Acceptance criteria for the interference studies were $8 5 \% - 1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or ± $1 5 \%$ of the low indeterminate range $\lvert \pm 7 . 5 \mathrm { \ m g } / \mathrm { k g } \rvert$ difference, whichever is greater.

No interference was detected in the results of the QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin at the concentrations tested (hemoglobin 5.56mg/50mg stool, mesalamine 1.33mg/50mg stool, prednisone 0.01mg/50mg stool, vancomycin $0 . 6 7 \mathrm { m g } / 5 0 \mathrm { m g }$ stool, gamma-tocopherol 0.0010mg/50mg stool, tacrolimus $0 . 0 7 \mathrm { m g } / 5 0 \mathrm { m g }$ stool, beta-carotene $0 . 0 0 4 8 \mathrm { m g } / 5 0 \mathrm { m g }$ stool, ciproflaxin $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { m g } / 5 0 \mathrm { m g }$ stool, cholecalciferol $0 . 2 7 5 \mathsf { n g } / 5 0 \mathsf { m g }$ stool, lansoprazole $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g } / 5 0 \mathrm { m g }$ stool, ascorbic acid $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m g } / 5 0 \mathrm { m g }$ stool respectively for drugs and nutrients and $1 . 5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { c f u / m L }$ for each individual bacterial cultures).

# Sample Stability and Handling

Eight extracted human stool samples, encompassing negative $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 )$ , in the indeterminate range $( n = 2 )$ , around the cut-off $\scriptstyle ( \mathsf { n } = 1 )$ ), and positive samples $\scriptstyle ( { \mathsf { n } } = 4 )$ were tested in duplicates for up to 24 days while stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ up to 73 hours while stored at room temperature, and after repeated freeze/thaw cycles up to 5 cycles.

Additionally, three extracted stool samples in the indeterminate range $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 )$ , around the cut-off $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 )$ and high positive $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 )$ were tested in triplicates for up to 91 days while frozen at $- 2 0 { \pm } 4 ^ { \circ } C$ .

Results were compared to those obtained on control samples (time zero / zero cycles).

Acceptance criteria: $8 0 - 1 2 0 \%$ average recovery.

All samples fulfilled the acceptance criteria at each time point for each condition. Based on these result, we recommend that extracted samples are stored up to 72 hours at room temperature, up to 21 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ up to 3 months frozen at $- 2 0 \pm 5 ^ { \circ } C$ and can be subjected to up to 4 freeze/thaw cycles.

# Reagent Stability

# Shelf life

To establish the initial claim for shelf life, accelerated stability studies were performed for 3 weeks at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ where one week is equal to six months at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ .

Accelerated stability testing was performed on each of the following sealed components of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin to establish initial stability claim:

Calprotectin beads (3 Lots)

Calprotectin tracer (3 Lots)

Calibrators 1, 2 and 3 (3 Lots)

• Low and High controls (3 Lots)

Extraction Buffer (3 Lots)

• Special Wash (3 Lots)

Each week a new sealed component was placed in the incubator, and all components were tested at the end of the experiment together with the one that was stored at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } .$ . The recovery of the measured values was calculated for each time point (compared to those obtained with $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ stored reagent). All calculations were performed by comparing results of sealed components stored at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ (control) to those stored at $3 7 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ (test) for 1, 2 and 3 weeks, where one week is equal to six months at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ . Linear regression analysis was performed between recovery values and the number of days.

Acceptance criteria for one year preliminary expiration dating:

With regression analysis, the lower and upper $9 5 \%$ Cl interval of the regression line is between $80 \%$ and $120 \%$ recovery at day 14.

All components tested fulfilled the acceptance criteria above, so one year expiration dating was assigned to each component

# In-use (onboard) stability

# Calibrators

Onboard stability claim: 4 calibrations, or 8 hours onboard.

During assessing onboard stability, Calibrators were placed uncapped, onboard the instrument, and calibration was performed altogether five times over 9 hours. Controls and a panel of characterized patient specimens were run on each calibration curve.

Calibrators are considered stable if all four calibrations performed in the 8 hour period are successful, mean Calibrator RLU recovery values for the first 4 calibrations are between $90 \%$ and $110 \%$ compared to the first use, and Control/patient panel $\mathsf { n g / m l }$ recovery values are between $85 \%$ and $1 1 5 \%$ of those obtained on the first calibration curve.

The first four calibrations performed in the 8 hour period were considered valid by the software. The calibrators yielded average RLU recovery values ranging from $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ to $1 0 7 . 1 \%$ . The Control/patient panel ng/mL recovery ranged from $8 9 . 1 \% 1 0 5 . 2 \%$ . This supports the claim that calibrators can be used for up to 4 calibrations over an 8 hour period.

# Controls

Onboard stability claim: up to 15 uses, at 10 minutes onboard per use.

During assessing on-board stability, 2 vials of each Control were assayed once a day during 20 days for a total of 20 runs. The first run was used to establish baseline value, by running each vial in duplicate, and then additional 19 runs were performed, by running each vial in singleton. During runs, the Controls were left uncapped, onboard the instrument for $1 5 { \pm } 1$ minutes per run. When not in use, the controls were capped, and stored at $5 { \pm } 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ .

Percent recovery of each value was calculated compared to the baseline value. Controls are considered stable when all values run within their established range, and the linear regression line obtained by plotting percent recovery values against the number of runs stays between $85 \%$ and $1 1 5 \%$ at run 15.

All controls ran within their respective acceptable ranges for all runs. Moreover, the regression line remained between $85 \%$ and $1 1 5 \%$ at run 15 for both Controls. These results support the claim that controls can be used for up to 15 times, at 10 minutes per use.

# Reagent Cartridge

To establish the in-use stability of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin reagent cartridge, one lot of reagent cartridge was tested with 4 extracted stool specimens (with different reactivity levels) along with the 2 controls made of recombinant antigen for a total of 6 samples. The specimens were tested periodically for of 97 days. Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values, and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting percent recovery against the number of days. The claim was established using the following criteria (using the one that is fulfilled first):

- The stability claim is established at the actual measurement day proceeding the day when the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line reaches $85 \%$ or $1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or

- At the actual measurement day preceding the day when $22 \%$ of the recovery data, (3 data points) is $\leq 7 5 \%$ or $2 1 2 5 \%$ recovery.

The onboard stability results are as follows:

Lot 160002: 97 days

Using these criteria, the in-use (onboard) stability of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin reagent cartridge was set at 90 days.

# Extraction Buffer

To establish the in-use stability of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin Extraction Buffer, a bottle of buffer was diluted to a final concentration of 1X and kept at $2 - 8 \%$ . After 91 days, another bottle of buffer of the same lot was diluted to 1X. Each 1X Calprotectin Extraction Buffer was used to extract 22 stool samples spanning the analytical measuring range (AMR) of the assay. All samples were run in duplicate on calibrated QUANTA Flash® Calprotectin Reagents.

A scatter plot with a linear fit was created by plotting the mean values obtained with the Day 91 1X Calprotectin Extraction Buffer against those obtained with the Day 0 1X Calprotectin Extraction Buffer, using the Weighted Least Squares function.

Acceptance criteria:

• $r { \ge } 0 . 9 7 5$ Intercept of the regression line: $\pm 1 5 \%$ of cut-off (±18mg/kg) Slope of the regression line: 0.9-1.1 Weighted S y/x: ≤0.5 Predicted bias at cut-off: $\leq 1 5 \%$ (18mg/kg) $9 5 \%$ CI of the bias: does not exceed medically significant difference, $20 \%$ of cut-off $( 2 4 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { k g } )$

All acceptance criteria were met at 91 days, with weighted r value of 0.999, intercept of the regression line at $3 . 8 7 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ slope of the regression line equal 0.9877, weighted $\mathsf { S } \mathsf { y } / \mathsf { x }$ of 0.10, predicted bias at the cut-off of $2 . 3 9 \mathrm { m g / k g }$ and the $9 5 \%$ CI of the bias at $- 2 . 8 1 \mathrm { - } 7 . 5 9 \mathrm { m g / k g } .$ .

The Calprotectin Extraction Buffer diluted at 1X is stable for 90 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ .

# Special Wash

To establish the onboard stability of the QUANTA Flash Special Wash, a bottle of Special Wash was placed uncapped, onboard the instrument for 32 continuous days. During this time, four samples, including three extracted stool samples and one sample made of recombinant antigen spanning the analytical measuring range of the assay, were tested in triplicates at different time points on the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin assay. Upon completion, the Special Wash bottle was taken off the instrument and kept capped, at room temperature until day 91 from the original opening date, when it was placed again onboard the instrument, uncapped, and tested again.

Percent recovery was calculated for each replicate of each sample against the data from day 0 testing. Percent recovery values were plotted against the number of days of the Special Wash onboard the instrument, and linear regression analysis with $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) was performed.

Acceptance criteria (using the one that is fulfilled first):

• The stability claim is established at the actual measurement day proceeding the day when the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line reaches $85 \%$ or $1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or At the actual measurement day preceding the day when $22 \%$ of the recovery data, (2 data points) is $\leq 7 5 \%$ or $2 1 2 5 \%$ recovery.

All acceptance criteria were met at 91 days, the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line for the QUANTA Flash Special Wash is between $9 7 . 9 \%$ and $1 0 5 . 5 \%$ . The results support the QUANTA Flash Special wash onboard (in-use) stability claim of 30 days uncapped continuous use, or 720 hours distributed over 90 days onboard of the instrument.

# Real time stability

Real time stability testing has been scheduled to be performed every three or six months on the reagent cartridge, Calibrators, Controls and Extraction Buffer kits, to verify the one year expiration that was assigned based on accelerated stability studies. At the time of the submission, results were available up to 6 months for Reagent Cartridge, Calibrators and Controls. Data is not available for the Extraction Buffer at the time of the submission.

For reagent cartridge, a negative sample (Negative Control), a sample around the cut-off, a low positive sample (Positive Control), a moderate positive sample and a high positive sample were tested in replicates of 6 (replicates of 9 at time zero) at each time point.

- Acceptance criteria: results should fall within their respective ranges.

Calibrators were tested in triplicates on a calibrated cartridge at each time point. Averages of the triplicates were compared to the value that was assigned to the Calibrators at release. - Acceptance criteria: $\%$ recovery of the average of the triplicates is between $85 \%$ and $1 1 5 \%$ , and $\% 0 \%$ of the triplicates is $< 1 0 \%$ .

Controls were tested in triplicates on a calibrated cartridge at each time point. Individual values were compared to the values that were assigned to the Controls at release.   
- Acceptance criteria: results should fall within their acceptable ranges as were established at the release of the Controls.

All results to date were within the acceptance limits.

# Cut-off, reference range

QUANTA Flash Calprotectin:

Negative <50 mg/kg Indeterminate $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / k g }$ to <120 mg/kg Positive $2 1 2 0 \mathrm { m g / k g }$

The reference population for establishing the reference interval for the Calprotectin assay consisted of 61 subjects:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample Group</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Apparently healthy donors</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>53</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SquamousCellCarcinoma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glandular Polyp</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hyperplastic Polyp</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Adenoma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td></tr></table>

All specimens were the same matrix (human stool) as specified in the Intended Use. All specimens were unaltered. The cut-off was established in accordance to CLSI EP28-A3c: Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline - Third Edition. The Analyseit for Excel software was used to make the calculations. The distribution of the results was non-normal (Shapiro-Wilk ${ \mathsf { p } } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ), so the non-parametric percentile method was used. The 95th percentile of the remaining obtained values was calculated as $1 3 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g } \ ( 9 0 \% \subset \mathrm { l } , 1 2 5 . 0 - 1 4 8 . 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g } )$ .

Additionally, thirty-one diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient specimens were assayed to aid in the determination of the cutoff. Based on the distribution of result values in these (known) positive samples, the cutoff was established at $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g }$ to ensure optimal differentiation between negatives and positives and minimize risk of false negative samples. It was found that none of the IBD samples reported results $< 1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g }$ .

# Clinical performance characteristics

# Clinical sensitivity, specificity

A cohort of characterized samples, none of which were used for establishing the reference range, was used to validate the clinical performance of the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin. A total of 165 characterized samples were included in the Validation Set for the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin. Samples came from studies performed at two different sites. Samples with ID number from 1 to 107 belong to site A, while samples with ID number from 108 to 175 belong to site B.

The remaining samples came from a commercial source.

For site A:

Inclusion criteria: samples suspected to suffer from IBD and that a calprotectin test was requested. Samples were consecutive and recruited over a period of 6 months. To allow accurate diagnostic, all patients underwent ileocolonoscopy.

Exclusion criteria: unclear diagnosis (e.g. indeterminate colitis), inability to collect enough fecal samples and age younger of 14 years. Also patients that previously had been diagnosed IBD or had not received ileocolonoscopy were excluded.

IBD diagnostic criteria: diagnostic work-up included physical examination and case history, endoscopic and histologic analysis, radiologic work-up and laboratory tests including ileocolonoscopy. Senior gastroenterologists performed all endoscopies and findings were documented in a computer-based database. The final diagnosis of IBD (i.e. CD and UC) was independently made by a pathologist or gastroenterologist who was blinded for calprotectin results.

For site B: Inclusion criteria: Sixty-eight consecutive samples requested for a calprotectin determination test by a gastroenterologist who had not had a calprotectin level measured before.

Exclusion criteria: samples with excessive mucous, unclear diagnosis, patients who had not received colonoscopy.

IBD diagnostic criteria: Patients were diagnosed after exclusion of organic pathology on the basis of routine blood tests, thyroid function tests, serological screening for coeliac disease, stool examination for bacteria and parasites, ultrasound examination, and eventually colonoscopy using the ROME III criteria. The diagnosis of IBD was made upon clinical, endoscopic and histological findings as described in J Crohn Colitis 2012:6: 965-990 (ulcerative colitis) and J Crohn Colitis 2010:4:7-27 (Crohn’s disease).

All samples were run on the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin. The distribution of the cohort and the calprotectin indeterminate and positivity rate is in the Table below:

# Expected values

The expected result for normal population is negative. Calprotectin levels were analyzed using the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin on a panel of 164 apparently healthy stool donors (94 females/70 males, ages from 17 to 89 years, with an average and median age of 44.9 and 42.0 years respectively). With a cut-off of $1 2 0 \mathrm { { \ m g / k g } , }$ all samples were negative with the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin. The mean concentration was $1 9 . 0 \mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ and the values ranged from $< 1 6 . 1$ to $4 9 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / k g }$ .

# Comparison with predicate device

Samples for method comparison analysis included 137/165 samples from the clinical validation study. These samples were tested on both the QUANTA Flash Calprotectin and on the predicate ELISA. Of the 137 samples tested, 77 samples fell within the AMR of both assays.
