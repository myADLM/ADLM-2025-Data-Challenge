Indication for use: Same as Intended Use

Special Conditions for Use Statement: For prescription use only

Special instrument requirements: The MESO SECTOR S 700

# Device Description

The MSD CRP Assay Kit is a quantitative in-vitro diagnostic assay for conventional measurement of C-reactive protein in human serum. The CRP Assay Kit is designed for use with the MESO SECTOR $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ S 700 Instrument. The kit components include the 96-well CRP assay plate, CRP calibrator, CRP detection antibody, CRP diluent and CRP read buffer. The assay in the MSD CRP Kit is a sandwich immunoassay employing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection. In the instrument, a voltage is applied to the plate electrodes causing the captured labels to emit light. The instrument measures the intensity of emitted light from each spot to provide a quantitative measure of analyte in the sample.

# Test Principle:

The assay in the MSD CRP Kit is a sandwich immunoassay employing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection. This assay is carried out in a 96-well plate consumable that has integrated carbon ink electrodes screen-printed on the bottom of each well. The plate is provided pre-coated with capture antibody on a single, welldefined region of the electrode surface. The user adds the calibrator or sample and a solution containing detection antibody conjugated with electrochemiluminescent labels over the course of two incubation periods. Analyte in the sample binds to the capture antibodies immobilized on the electrode surface; recruitment of the detection antibodies by the bound analyte completes the sandwich. The user adds a buffer that creates the appropriate chemical environment for the electrochemiluminescent signal and loads the plate into an MSD MESO SECTOR S 700 instrument. In the instrument, a voltage is applied to the plate electrodes causing the captured labels to emit light. The instrument measures the intensity of emitted light to provide a quantitative measure of analyte in the sample.

# Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance: All results for analytical performance met the sponsor’s predetermined acceptance criteria for each study.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision and reproducibility of the assay were calculated by testing five serum samples containing various concentrations of CRP. Each sample was run in duplicate, two runs per day, for 20 days with one assay kit lot at three testing sites $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 2 4 0$ replicates per sample). The results are summarized in the two tables below.

$^ { * 5 }$ Outliers (from a total of 1199 measurements) were removed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity: Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI guideline EP06-A. “Low” and “High” CRP serum pools were created by mixing individual samples. Materials from the High and Low CRP pools were combined to create a total of eleven (11) serial dilutions. A total of four (4) replicate runs were performed on each dilution sample using a single MSD CRP Assay Kit lot. The results of the regression analysis are summarized as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Test Range(mg/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R{2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Recovery</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.627201</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.942 (0.926  0.958)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0296 (-0.0389 — 0.0982)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-8.9% 0.0%</td></tr></table>

The assay is linear from $3 - 1 6 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

1601 Research Boulevard, Rockville, MO 20850-3126  Phone: 240.314.2600  Fax: 240.632.2219

Hook effect: The assay was tested for prozone or hook effect up to a CRP concentration of $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . No prozone effect was observed within the linear range of the assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The calibrators used to calibrate the assay are traceable to the CRM474 reference material.

Value assignment: A reference lot is created by diluting bulk calibration material. It is assigned using 4 dilutions across the quantitation range; CRM474 is utilized as the calibration standard. Production lots of kit calibrator are created by diluting the bulk calibration material in CRP Diluent to the nominal highest calibration level used in the assay. The concentration of each lot of kit calibrator is assigned using 4 dilutions across the quantitation range, using the reference lot as the calibration standard.

Stability: The real-time stability for un-opened components was performed using multiple kit lots. The results support a kit shelf life of 7 months. Storage temperatures for each kit component are found on the component labels and in the product insert.

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by testing one hundred twenty (120) blank replicates created using MSD CRP Diluent without addition of the MSD CRP Calibrator. Samples were run on multiple kit lots and the statistical method for determining LoB for each kit lot was based on whether the data distribution was Non-Gaussian or Gaussian in accordance with CLSI guideline EP17-A2. The LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for all tested kit lots.

Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by testing one hundred twenty (120) low-level CRP samples created by testing twenty (20) replicates of six (6) lowlevel serum pools prepared by mixing MSD CRP Calibrator and MSD CRP Diluent in varying proportions. Samples were run on multiple kit lots and the LoD was calculated according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2 to be 0.039, 0.048 and $0 . 0 4 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for each of the tested kit lots.

Limit of Quantification $\underline { { ( \mathrm { L o Q } ) } }$ was validated by testing eight (8) replicates of six (6) low-level CRP pools that were prepared by mixing the MSD CRP Calibrator and the MSD CRP Diluent in varying proportions close to the lower limit of the reportable range. CLSI guideline EP17-A2 defines LoQ as the lowest concentration of the analyte that can be reported with a Total Error (TE) $< 2 0 \%$ . The test results support the claimed LoQ of $3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous/Drug Interference: Five serum samples were spiked with potential endogenous interferents or drugs, respectively. The control samples were prepared for each substance/agent by spiking with the same volume of MSD CRP Diluent. Each sample was measured in five replicates across three reagent lots. The percent difference was calculated for each reagent lot by comparing to a corresponding control sample. The average $\%$ difference $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 5 )$ ) for all substances was less than $10 \%$ , indicating that interference from the following substances was not significant at the concentration tested.
