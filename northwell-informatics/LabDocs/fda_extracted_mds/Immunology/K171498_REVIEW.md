# L. Test Principle:

The assay in the MSD CRP Kit is a sandwich immunoassay employing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection. This assay is carried out in a 96-well plate that has integrated carbon ink electrodes screen-printed on the bottom of each well. The plate is provided pre-coated with capture antibody on a single, well-defined region of the electrode surface. The user adds the calibrator or sample and a solution containing detection antibody conjugated with electrochemiluminescent labels over the course of two incubation periods. Analyte in the sample binds to the capture antibodies immobilized on the electrode surface; recruitment of the detection antibodies by the bound analyte completes the sandwich. The user adds a buffer that creates the appropriate chemical environment for the electrochemiluminescent signal and loads the plate into an MSD MESO SECTOR S 700 instrument. In the instrument, a voltage is applied to the plate electrodes causing the captured labels to emit light. The instrument measures the intensity of emitted light to provide a quantitative measure of analyte in the sample.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity: The linearity across the measuring range of the assay was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP6-A. Eleven serially diluted sampels were prepared by mixing “low” $( 0 . 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP) and “high” $2 1 4 \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP) pooled serum samples. Each dilution sample was tested in a single replicate per plate. A total of four plates/replicate were tested. Each plate was run using three lots of MSD CRP Assay kits. This yielded a total of twelve runs. Linear regression results of this analysis are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TestRange(mg/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept (95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R^{}$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Recovery</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.627-201</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.942 (0.9260.958)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0296 (-0.04 - 0.98)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.997</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-8.9% - 0.0%</td></tr></table>

The manufacturer is reporting that the assay is linear from 3 to $1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ .

# Hook effect (antigen excess):

The assay was tested for prozone or hook effect up to a CRP concentration of 800 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ . No prozone effect was observed.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The calibrators used to calibrate the MSD CRP test are traceable to the ERM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ -DA 474 reference material.

Value assignment: A reference lot is created by diluting bulk calibration material. It is assigned using four dilutions across the quantitation range; CRM474 is utilized as the calibration standard. Production lots of kit calibrator are created by diluting the bulk calibration material in CRP Diluent to the nominal highest calibration level used in the assay. The concentration of each lot of kit calibrator is assigned using four dilutions across the quantitation range, using the reference lot as the calibration standard.

# Controls:

The manufacturer recommends that at least two controls be run to verify the performance of the assay method. A control in the mid to upper end of the normal range, and a control in the mid-region of the assay curve are recommended for the day to day evaluation of the performance of the assay. The manufacturer recommends that at least two CRP controls at two different levels be used for quality control. The manufacturer recommends Bio-Rad’s LiquichekTM Cardiac Markers Plus Controls, LiquichekTM Elevated CRP Controls or equivalent.

Stability:

# Kit stability/Shelf Life:

All kit components are one-time use only, and therefore open-vial stability testing is not required. A total of three kits were utilized for stability testing. Real-time stability testing was conducted at baseline, three months, six months, seven months, nine months and 12 months. Six replicates were run per plate, three total runs per kit, three kits, and six time intervals for a total of 108 data points. The provided data support the kit stability claim of 7 months. The real-time stability study is ongoing.

Data provided for the calibrator stability testing after thawing support the stability of the calibrators for 2 hours after thawing.

# d. Detection limit:

All three studies below were conducted based on CLSI EP17-A2.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying 24 replicates of the blank sample (assay diluent) over five working days on three different lots of MSD CRP assay kits. A total of 120 data points per lot were generated. LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for all three assay lots.

Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by testing 20 replicates of six low-level CRP pools that were prepared by mixing the MSD CRP Calibrator and the MSD CRP Diluent in varying propritions. This resulted in 120 data points per lot, and three different lots were tested. The measured LoD values for the three assay kits used for this testing were $0 . 0 3 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , $0 . 0 4 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $0 . 0 4 8 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The overall LoD for the test system is equal to the highest LoD calculated for any of the 3 assay lots used for testing. Therefore, the overall test system $\mathrm { L o D = 0 . 0 4 9 \ m g / L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { ( L o Q ) } }$ was determined by further testing six low-level CRP pools that were prepared by mixing the MSD CRP Calibrator and the MSD CRP Diluent in varying proportions. Each sample was tested in eight replicates in a single run, and one run was conducted per day for a total of five closely grouped working days. Three los were tested. A total of 48 data points were acquired per lot. The LoQ for the MSD CRP Assay Kit and MESO SECTOR S 700 Instrument was determined to be $0 . 5 9 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , and the Sponsor is claiming an\ LoQ of $3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference study was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2 using pooled human serum or CRP Diluent samples with CRP concentrations ranging from $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ to 40 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ . Each sample was tested in five replicates across three different lots of reagents. The following putative interferents were tested by spiking in pooled human serum samples with the CLSI EP7-A2-recommended concentrations (control samples were spiked with the same volume of the sample diluent): unconjugated bilirubin (32 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ , conjugated bilirubin $( 5 . 4 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , hemoglobin $( 2 2 , 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , triglyceriderich lipoproteins $( 6 3 3 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), rheumatoid factor $( 4 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ , human anti-mouse antibodies $( 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ , acetaminophen $( 1 3 2 4 \mathrm { m M } )$ , acetylsalicylic acid $( 3 . 6 2 \mathrm { m M } )$ , ibuprofen $( 2 4 2 5 \mathrm { m M } )$ , salicylic acid $( 4 . 3 4 \mathrm { m M } )$ , methotrexate $( 2 \mathrm { m M } )$ . No interferences from the tested substances were observed at the concentrations tested.
