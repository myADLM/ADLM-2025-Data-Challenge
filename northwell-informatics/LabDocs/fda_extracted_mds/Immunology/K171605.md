# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Elecsys CA 15-3 II Test System is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection for the quantitative determination of CA 15-3 in human serum and plasma. It is intended for use on the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer. The cobas e family of analyzers employs the electrochemiluminescence “ECLIA” technology.

Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent barcode.

# 1.1. Reagents

The cobas e pack includes:

 Streptavidin-coated microparticles   
 Reagent 1 (Biotinylated monoclonal antibody (115D8; mouse) 1.75 mg/L)   
 Reagent 2 (Monoclonal anti-CA 15-3 antibody (DF3; mouse) labeled with ruthenium complex $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ )

# 1.2. Calibration

Traceability: This method has been standardized against the Elecsys CA 15 3 assay. This in turn has been standardized against the Enzymun Test CA 15 3 method and CA 15 3 RIA by Fujirebio Diagnostics. The predefined master curve is adapted to the analyzer using the relevant CalSet. Calibration frequency: Calibration must be performed once per reagent lot using fresh reagent (i.e. not more than 24 hours since the cobas e pack was registered on the analyzer). Calibration interval may be extended based on acceptable verification of calibration by the laboratory.

# 1.3. Control

PreciControl Tumor Marker is used for the quality control verification of the performance of the assay on the cobas e analyzers.

# 2. INDICATIONS FOR USE

Immunological in vitro assay for quantitative determination of CA 15-3 in human serum and Liheparin plasma to aid in the management of breast cancer patients. In conjunction with other clinical and diagnostic procedures, serial testing with this assay is an aid

in the early detection of recurrence in previously treated stage II and III breast cancer patients for monitoring response to therapy in metastatic breast cancer patients.

The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

# 4. NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Non-clinical performance evaluation for the Elecsys CA 15-3 II are briefly summarized below:

# 4.1. Precision

Precision of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was evaluated on one cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer according to CLSI EP5-A3 guideline. One reagent lot was evaluated.

The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each control (PC Tumor Marker $=$ PreciControl Tumor Marker) and five pooled human sera (HS) samples per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days. The samples were run in randomized order on the cobas e 801 analyzer. To obtain samples with higher concentration, low sample pools were spiked with a high concentrated native sample (pool)..

# 4.2. Analytical Sensitivity

# 4.2.1. Limit of Blank (LoB)

LoB of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer has been determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.

Limit of Blank determines the highest observed measurement values for samples free of analyte. The Limit of Blank was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples. The Limit of Blank was determined by performing one run per day from three reagent lots on one cobas e 801 instrument, over six days. The testing included one blank sample with ten replicates per run for a total of sixty total blank replicates per reagent lot.

# 4.2.2. Limit of Detection (LoD)

LoD of the Elecsys CA 15-3 assay on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer has been determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.

The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. The Limit of Detection was determined by performing one run per day from three reagent lots on one cobas e 801 instrument, over six days. The testing included two replicates per sample (5 samples) per run for a total of sixty total blank replicates per sample per reagent lot.

# 4.2.3. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The LoQ of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was determined on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer according to CLSI Guideline EP17-A2.

A set of ten human serum samples (single donors, native as well as diluted) with concentrations in the specified LoQ-area was evaluated for each of 3 reagent lots.

The mean value and the intermediate precision as coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (SD) for each LoQ sample were calculated. The Limit of Quantitation was determined by performing one run per day from three reagent lots on one cobas e 801 instrument, over five days. The testing included ten samples, each with five replicates per daily run over 5 days for a total of twenty five replicates per sample per reagent lot.

# 4.3. High-Dose Hook Effect

The high-dose hook effect of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was assessed on the cobas e 801 analyzer in three-fold determination. Two samples were spiked with analyte to achieve high CA 15-3 concentrations. For each sample, a dilution series was performed using native human

serum. The hook concentration reported corresponds to the highest analyte concentration that generates a signal $2 1 0 \%$ above the upper limit of the measuring range.

# 4.4. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range

Linearity of the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was evaluated using the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer according to CLSI EP6-A.

Three high analyte serum samples and three high analyte plasma samples (serum/plasma pool, spiked) were diluted with Elecsys Universal Diluent. 15 concentrations (dilutions) throughout the measuring range were prepared. Samples were assayed in 3-fold determination within a single run.

The linearity data were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials according to CLSI EP6-A. In a first step, a linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic).

All deviations were within predetermined acceptance criteria.

# 4.5. Endogenous Interferences

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances using the Elecsys CA 15-3 II was determined on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay analyzer using human serum samples.

For each interfering substance three human serum samples containing low (pooled sera), mid (pooled spiked sera) and high (pooled spiked sera) concentrations of CA 15-3 were tested.

# 4.6. Hemolysis/Bilirubin/Lipemia/Biotin

Biotin:

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance, another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic NaCl solution (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments.

The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked) sample. In conclusion, the specification was met for all substances tested, as each substance was found to be non-interfering at the spiked concentration.

Lipemia:

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance, and another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic NaCl solution (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments.

The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked) sample. In conclusion, the specification was met for all substances tested, as each substance was found to be non-interfering at the spiked concentration.

Hemoglobin:

Fresh hemolysate was prepared from fresh EDTA or heparin blood. One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the hemolysate (interfering pool), another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic NaCl solution (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked) sample.

In conclusion, the specification was met for all substances tested, as each substance was found to be non-interfering at the spiked concentration.

Bilirubin:

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance, and another aliquot with was spiked with the same volume of the solvent (0.1 mol/L NaOH) of the interfering

substance (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments.

# HAMA:

The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies on the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was assessed on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer.

The specified HAMA-serum with a concentration of $8 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and the related reference serum (without interferent) was measured in two-fold determination over 3 levels. Recovery of the HAMA-serum compared to the reference serum sample was calculated.

In conclusion, the specification was met for all substances tested, as each substance was found to be non-interfering at the spiked concentration.

Rheumatoid Factors Interference:

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance, and another aliquot with the same volume of the solvent (buffer matrix) of the interfering substance (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments.

The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference sample.

In conclusion, the specification was met for all substances tested, as each substance was found to be non-interfering at the spiked concentration.

# 4.7. Exogenous Interferences – Anticoagulants

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys CA 15-3 II Immunoassay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples (native) drawn into Serum, and Li-Heparin plasma.

Forty nine native samples were tested with one reagent lot on one cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer. Potential effects are assessed by Passing/Bablok regression analysis.

# 4.8. Method Comparison to cobas e 601 Immunoassay Analyzer

A method comparison was performed using the cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer as predicate device. The study was performed on the cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer (X) and on the cobas e 801 analyzer (Y).

A total of 190 human serum samples (all single donors, native samples) were measured with Elecsys CA 15-3 II immunoassay on both analyzers in singleton covering the entire measuring range. Mean values ranges between $5 . 1 4 - 2 9 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ for the cobas e 601 analyzer and between $4 . 2 4 - 2 7 3 \ : \mathrm { U / m L }$ for the cobas e 801 analyzer.

Evaluation was performed for all samples within the measuring range of both assays and in compliance with Standard Operation Procedures of Roche Diagnostics GmbH. Passing/Bablok and linear regression analysis was performed according to CLSI EP09-A3.

# 4.9. Reagent Stability

To test reagent stability, two studies were executed with one study completed including:

Study 1. On board reagent stability (16 weeks)

Study 2. A real-time stability study is ongoing to support shelf-life stability claim.

4.9.1. Study 1- Onboard reagent stability (for 16 weeks)

Elecsys CA 15-3 II reagent kits can be stored on board of the analyzers for up to 16 weeks.

A new calibration of the kit kept on-board is recommended every 28 days.

Onboard Reagent Stability and Calibration Stability for the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was tested on one cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer.

A fresh cobas e pack was placed on the analyzer and calibrated. Reference values for the samples tested were determined (day 0). After 5, 9, 13 and 17 weeks the same samples were measured with the same reagent kit kept under onboard condition. Re-calibration was performed at every measuring time point.

Samples tested include six human serum (HS) samples. Each sample was tested in two-fold determination. The human serum samples used were pooled sera for sample ranges low, Decision range 1 and 2, and pooled spiked sera for sample ranges medium and high.

# 4.9.2. Study 2 - Reagent Real-time Stability

In the real-time stability study, the Elecsys CA 15-3 II reagent was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stored assay reagents were tested at time point $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ (after manufacturing) and at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device. Testing was performed using PreciControl Tumor Marker Level 1 and 2 (lyophilized, stored at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for lot-numbers 156423, 158287 and 174942.

Study 1. Lot calibration stability

Study 2. On-board calibration stability

# 4.11.1. Study 1-Lot Calibration Stability

Calibration of an Elecsys CA 15-3 II reagent lot is recommended every 12 weeks. During that time period fresh reagent kits of the same lot can be used without calibration using the calibration curve of the Day 0 reagent kit.

Elecsys CA 15-3 II was calibrated with a fresh reagent kit on Day 0 using a cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer. After 13weeks a new reagent kit of the same lot was used and recovery of samples was determined using the calibration curve of day 0.

Five human serum (HS) samples were tested; each sample was tested with two-fold determination. The human serum samples used were pooled diluted sera for sample range low, pooled sera for Decision range, and pooled spiked sera for sample ranges medium and high.

# 4.11.2. Study 2-On-board Calibration Stability

Elecsys CA 15-3 II reagent kits can be stored on board of the analyzers for up to 28 days without a new calibration.

Reagent On-board Calibration stability for the Elecsys CA 15-3 II assay was tested on one cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer.

A fresh Reagent cobas e pack was placed on the analyzer and calibrated. All samples were measured on day 0. On day 29 the same samples were measured with the same reagent kit kept under on-board conditions using the calibration curve established on day 0.

Samples tested include six human serum (HS) samples. Each sample was tested in two-fold determination. The human serum samples used were pooled diluted sera for sample range low, pooled sera for Decision range, and pooled spiked sera for sample ranges medium and high.
