# 5.4 Device Description / Test Principle

The N Latex FLC (free light chain) assays are in vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative determination of free light chains, type kappa or type lambda, in human serum and EDTA plasma by means of particle-enhanced immunonephelometry using the BN™ II and BN ProSpec® Systems. Used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings, FLC measurements are used as an aid in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) and amyloidosis (AL).

Used in conjunction with the assay reagents, N FLC Standard SL is for use in the establishment of reference curves for the determination of free light chains, type kappa and type lambda on the BN™ II and BN ProSpec® Systems. The N FLC Control SL 1 and 2 products are for use as assayed accuracy controls and precision controls in the determination of free light chains, type kappa and type lambda by immunonephelometry with the BN™ II and BN ProSpec® Systems.

The FLC test systems are based upon the principles of particle-enhanced immunonephelometry. Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to human free light chains, type kappa or lambda, respectively, are agglutinated when mixed with samples containing FLC. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# 5.6 Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of the substantial equivalence determination.

# 5.6.1 Analytical Performance

# 5.6.1.1 Precision and Reproducibility

The precision of the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda FLC assays were evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP05-A3 guideline. Serum samples were obtained from commercial sources and samples with values close to normal, abnormal and very abnormal analyte levels were pooled to achieve target concentrations spanning the linear range of each FLC assay. In the study, the tests were performed on three levels of serum specimens (S1 – S3), and two levels of controls (C1, C2). These specimens included one sample within $2 5 \%$ of the cutoff/upper limit of normal for FLC kappa and FLC lambda. Testing was performed on three BN II and three BN ProSpec $\textcircled{8}$ instruments with two replicates per run, two runs per day using three lots of the assay-specific reagents. The precision data was analyzed according to three-way nested ANOVA and the results of mean $( { \mathsf { m g } } / \mathsf { L } )$ and Coefficient of Variation $\left[ \mathrm { C V } \left( \% \right) \right]$ are summarized below:

# 5.6.1.2 Measuring range (Linearity and LoQ)

The linearity studies were performed according to CLSI EP06-A: 2003, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline.

A test specimen was diluted serially in kappa or lambda depleted plasma or serum to yield a minimum of 9 levels within the claimed measuring range of the assay. Serum and EDTA plasma specimens from four healthy donors from Sanquin blood bank (one donor each for kappa EDTA plasma and serum and one donor each for lambda EDTA plasma and serum) were spiked with purified polyclonal FLC kappa and FLC lambda and subsequently diluted with FLC depleted plasma until concentrations of FLC kappa and lambda were below the initial measuring range. The diluted samples were measured in three independent measurements.

Limit of Quantitation studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2: 2012, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.

Five individual serum samples with very low concentrations of FLC kappa and five individual samples with very low concentrations of FLC lambda were diluted with PBS containing $1 \%$ human serum albumin (HSA) to a kappa concentration of $0 . 1 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and lambda concentration of $0 . 5 2 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ .

The samples were run 10 times on two lots of reagents, on two systems to obtain the concentration for FLC kappa and FLC lambda.

Aliquoted samples were tested twice on two different systems, BN II and BN ProSpec, using two different FLC kappa and FLC lambda reagent lots, on three consecutive days. The systems were programmed to run the samples at the lowest possible dilution of 1:5 for each assay to obtain results low enough for determination of the LoQ.

A typical LoQ for N Latex FLC kappa of $0 . 1 9 5 \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ with a total error of $1 0 . 5 7 \%$ and a typical LoQ for N Latex FLC lambda of $0 . 5 3 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ with a total error of $1 0 . 0 1 ~ \%$ was determined.

Linearity data and LoQ studies support Siemens’ claim that the measuring range of the N Latex FLC assays are:

FLC kappa, 3.4 to $1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ FLC lambda, 1.9 to 60 mg/L

# 5.6.1.3 High Dose Hook Effect (Antigen Excess)

Serum samples with high concentrations of FLC kappa and FLC lambda were manually diluted until the concentrations of the samples were at the low end of the initial measuring range. The results of the dilutions are compared to the upper limit of the calibration curve. When pre-reaction bit values (signals) for either assay are higher than the bit value of the upper end of the calibration curve, on either instrument, a new dilution and measurement are started automatically by the system.

Due to the built-in pre-reaction protocols on BN II and BN ProSpec, no hook effect was observed as false negatives when samples up to 27,100 mg/L for FLC kappa and up to $5 7 { , } 3 0 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / L }$ for FLC lambda were tested.

# 5.6.1.6 Specificity

# 5.7 Clinical Studies

# 5.7.1 Expected values / Reference interval

A reference interval study for N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC assay was performed according to CLSI EP28-A3C, ‘Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory’.

The reference intervals were determined from a US-population of 201 apparently healthy subjects. The reference intervals were calculated non-parametrically and represent the central $95 \%$ range of the population.

The following reference intervals apply for serum and plasma samples from healthy adults:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">2.5th-97.5th percentile</td></tr><tr><td>FLC kappa</td><td>8.24-28.9 mg/L</td></tr><tr><td>FLC lambda</td><td>9.10-32.6 mg/L</td></tr></table>

The calculation of the $\kappa / \lambda$ ratios resulted in 0.88 (0.53 to 1.51) (median, $1 . 0 ^ { \mathsf { s t } } - 9 9 . 0 ^ { \mathsf { t h } }$ percentile).

The sponsor recommends that each laboratory should determine its own reference intervals since values may vary depending on the individual population studied.

# 5.7.2 Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
