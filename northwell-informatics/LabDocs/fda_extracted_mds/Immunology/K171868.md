# E. Intended Use:

The Progenika A1AT genotyping kit is a qualitative, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization-based in vitro diagnostic test to be used with the Luminex $2 0 0 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ instrument (with xPONENT® software) for the simultaneous detection and identification of 14 allelic variants and their associated alleles found in the Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) codifying gene SERPINA1. The test is intended for use with genomic DNA extracted from human whole blood samples collected as dry blood spots (DBS) or in K2-EDTA.

The kit is indicated for prescription use only.

# F. Device Description:

Alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) Genotyping Test utilizes Luminex xMAP technology. Genomic DNA is extracted from DBS or from human K2- EDTA anticoagulated whole blood. Extracted DNA is amplified and biotinylated by multiplex PCR and PCR products are denatured and hybridized to oligonucleotide probes coupled to color-coded beads. Hybridized DNA is labeled with a fluorescent conjugate and the resulting signal is detected with a Luminex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 200 system. Raw data obtained is processed with the A1AT Genotyping Test ANALYSIS SOFTWARE in order to obtain the final report. The A1AT Genotyping Test ANALYSIS SOFTWARE algorithm converts the allelic variant genotypes into associated alleles, based on the current literature.

The A1AT Genotyping Test Kit is composed of 4 reagent components (A1AT PCR Master Mix, A1AT Beads Master Mix, SAPE, SAPE Dilution Buffer) required to perform all the above mentioned processing steps, and a CD containing the A1AT Genotyping Test ANALYSIS SOFTWARE and other necessary files. Two kit configurations are available: for 48 or for 192 tests (different amounts of the same reagent components are provided in each case).

# G. Substantial Equivalence Information:

Predicate Device: HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING Kit

510(k) number: k063498

Applicant: SEBIA, Inc.

Main conclusion: Although technologically different (isoelectrofocusing vs. PCR/hybridization based genotyping), the intended use of the HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit and the A1AT Genotyping Test can be considered equivalent, since both aim at identifying variant forms of the A1AT protein. In addition based on the performance data, it can be considered that the differences in the technological characteristics do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.

# H. Performance Data: Analytical Data:

a) Precision:

Lot-to-lot repeatability: The lot-to-lot repeatability was determined by testing the “Sample Panel” (five DNA samples covering Z/Z, M/Z, S/S, M/S, and S/Z Sample Results) in triplicate with three different reagent lots, by two operators, on six non-consecutive days, alternating between two Luminex instruments. An overall repeatability of $9 9 . 7 \%$ was obtained for Sample Results.

External Reproducibility: The reproducibility of the device was determined by testing 17 samples covering all the heterozygous genotype of the 14 allelic variants (5 collected in DBS, 11 archived genomic DNA samples and 1 synthetic sample) tested by two operators per each of the three external sites (LifeShare Blood Center and Progenika Inc. in the USA, and the University of Pavia in Italy) over at least a 20-day period. Each operator tested those samples in duplicate on three non-consecutive days. A $100 \%$ of correct Sample Results was obtained in the study.

b) Stability:

Real-time Stability: a Real-time Stability study has been performed with kits of three different lots stored at ${ 2 } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . There were eight test points: 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 and 16 months after manufacturing. At each test point 20 replicates of the “Sample Panel” were analyzed per reagent lot. All the samples provided correct Sample Results at every time point, and as such, 15 months product stability when stored at 2- $8 \%$ has been demonstrated (one month before the last time point at which acceptance criteria were met).

Open Vial Stability: With the purpose of determining the stability of the product after it has been opened for the first time, 20 replicates of the “Sample Panel” were tested at six test points (6, 9, 12, 13, 15, and 16 months after manufacturing, equivalent to 0, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 months after opening for the first time). All the Sample Results obtained at every time point was correct and as such, the product has proved up to 9 months stability after the vials were first opened.

c) Lower Limit of Detection (LoD):

The DNA concentration at which $9 5 \%$ of sample replicates resulted in correct Sample Results was determined by testing 20 replicates of nine DNA dilutions of the “Sample Panel” (from 0.16 to $0 . 0 0 3 3 ~ \mathrm { { n g / \mu l } ) }$ using two reagent lots. It was shown that the highest LoD among the two lots used was $0 . 0 3 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / \mu l } }$ .

# d) DNA Extraction Validation:

With the aim of testing the possible impact of different extraction methods on assay performance, twelve blood samples (covering ${ > } 9 5 \%$ of cases worldwide where allelic variants have been identified in the A1AT coding gene) collected in DBS (two types) and in K2- EDTA tubes were extracted three times by two operators on three different days. All the Sample Results obtained were correct with every extraction method.

# e) Cross-contamination:

With the purpose of evaluating that the test does not show detectable cross-contamination or carryover between samples or between samples and Negative Controls during processing. No crosscontamination that could result in an incorrect Sample Results was detected.

# f) Interfering Substances:

The effect of the presence of hemoglobin $( 5 5 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , bilirubin (36.8 mg/dL), triglicerides $( 4 2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and K2-EDTA short drawn (5X K2- EDTA concentration) on product performance was evaluated by spiking five blood samples collected both, in DBS and in K2-EDTA tubes, with mentioned potential interfering substances. Correct Sample Results were obtained in every case.

# Comparison Data:

g) Method Comparison:

The results obtained with the A1AT Genotyping Test were compared with the results obtained from bi-directional Sanger sequencing. A total of 116 DNA samples, representing as many variants interrogated by the assay as possible, were included in the study, distributed as follows: 66 clinical samples, 46 genomic DNAs extracted from cell lines and 4 synthetic DNA samples.

The sample panel covered all heterozygous and homozygous genotypes of each allelic variant and 15 compound heterozygous genotypes.

The comparison showed $100 \%$ concordance between A1AT Genotyping Test and bidirectional Sanger sequencing results, as it is shown in the table below.
