Dear Kevin Lawson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

ImmuLisa Enhanced™ Anti-RNA POL III Antibody ELISA   
Anti-RNA POL III Antibody ELISA   
Autoantibodies, anti-ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP) III antibody [NYO]   
INOVA QUANTA Lite™ RNA POL III ELISA

General Description: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) occur in sera of patients with various connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), systemic sclerosis / scleroderma (SSc), polymyositis and Sjögren’s syndrome. These ANA are directed against nuclear antigens, including DNA, nucleohistone and various extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) such as RNP, Sm, SS-A (Ro), SS-B (La), Centromere, Scl-70 (topoisomerase I), Jo-1 and RNA polymerase III (RNA POL III). These antigens are macromolecular complexes of protein and RNA.

Systemic sclerosis is associated with many autoantibodies. The anti-centromere antibody has been observed in a large percentage of patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) or CREST syndrome (Calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal motility abnormalities, sclerodactylia and telangiectasia) variant of systemic sclerosis or scleroderma. The anti-Scl-70 antibodies are associated with systemic sclerosis with the risk of diffuse skin involvement. The anti-RNA Pol III antibodies are also predictive of diffuse skin involvement, as well as a predictor for the development of hypertensive renal crisis. Anti-RNA Pol III antibodies are frequently found without the presence of anti-Scl-70 or anti-centromere antibodies in patients with systemic sclerosis.

This test is performed as a solid phase immunoassay. Microwells are coated with recombinant RNA POL III antigen. Controls, calibrators and patient sera are incubated in the antigen coated wells to allow specific antibodies present in the serum to bind to the RNA POL III antigen. Bound antibodies are detected by adding an enzyme labeled anti-human IgG conjugate. Specific enzyme substrate (TMB) is then added and the presence of antibodies is detected by a color change that is read by a spectrophotometer at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . Results are expressed in ELISA units per milliliter $( \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l } )$ and reported as positive or negative.

Intended Use: An enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the qualitative or semi-quantitative detection of anti-RNA POL III IgG antibodies in human serum as an aid in diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.

Similarities and Differences: Both kits use recombinant RNA POL III coated on 96 well plates to detect IgG RNA POL III antibody with HRP anti-human IgG conjugate and TMB substrate. The IMMCO kit utilizes a 5 point calibrator curve with a borderline/indeterminate range of $2 0 { - } 2 5 \ \mathsf { E U / m l } ;$ ; while the INOVA kit uses a single low positive sample as a calibrator and has a cutoff of 20 units with no borderline range.

# Non-clinical Tests:

Method Comparison: Both kits were tested with well-characterized systemic sclerosis subjects and disease controls. Semiquantitative results are presented below. Qualitative results are the same as the borderline considered positive results.

# Precision

Precision was tested with positive and negative specimens selected throughout the range of the assay. Seven patients were run in duplicate, twice per day for 20 days $\scriptstyle 1 = 8 0$ replicates per sample). Assays were run with two different operators / equipment sets.

# Reproducibility

Qualitative reproducibility was tested with 40 runs of samples in the negative range, $\sim 2 0 \%$ below cutoff, $\sim 2 0 \%$ above cutoff, in the moderate positive range of the assay and near the cutoff using the qualitative analysis method. Samples were tested in duplicate twice per day for 20 days by two different operators / equipment sets. Assay results for the cutoff specimen produced $60 \%$ qualitative (positive) agreement. The sample that was $\sim 2 0 \%$ above cutoff produced $9 8 \%$ qualitative (positive) agreement. All other specimens produced $100 \%$ qualitative agreement.

# Limit of Detection

The limit of detection (LoD) was determined based on 60 replicates of the blank and 10 replicates each of 6 low-level (NHS) samples on kits from two different lots. LoD was determined to be $3 . 2 \ \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ .

# Linearity and Recovery

Linearity and recovery were tested by diluting positive specimens through the assay range in equidistant dilutions and comparing actual vs. expected results. The linear range of the assay was determined be $3 . 2 \left( \mathsf { L o D } \right) - 1 6 0 \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l }$ . Results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Test Range(EU/ml)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Y-intercept(95% CI)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R{2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% recovery</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.5 to 33.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.02(0.96 to 1.10)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.15 (-1.72 to 1.43)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9943</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>96% to 117%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.0 to 66.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.98(0.95 to 1.01)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.56(0.13 to 2.98)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9987</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>97% to 109%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>31.8 to 169.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99(0.88 to 1.09)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-2.68 (-14.56 to 9.20)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9890</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>91% to 103%</td></tr></table>

# Interference

Interference was studied by mixing sera with known RNA POL III antibody levels with negative serum samples spiked with potential interferents and studying deviation from expected results. No significant interference was demonstrated for the following substances at the levels indicated: hemoglobin $( 2 \ \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { L } )$ , bilirubin $( 3 4 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , rheumatoid factor $( 1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l } )$ , cholesterol $( 1 3 \ : \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , triglycerides $( 3 7 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , prednisone $( 0 . 8 4 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ), Naproxen $( 2 5 \mathrm { m g / m l } )$ , Methotrexate $( 2 { \mathrm { ~ m m o l / L } } ,$ Enalapril $( 0 . 8 6 \mathrm { u m o l / L } ,$ , Sildenafil (12.9pmol/L), Amlodipine (245 umol/L), Cyclophosphamide (1437 umol/L), Omeprazole (17.4 umol/L), Metoclopramide (1.5 umol/L), Doxycycline (67.5 umol/L), Bosentan $( 3 \mathsf { u g } / \mathsf { m l } )$ , Tocilizumab $( 5 4 9 \mathrm { u g / m l } )$ , Mycophenolate mofetil $( 1 4 . 0 1 \mathrm { u g / m l ) }$ and Heparin $( 3 0 0 0 \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { L } )$ .

Clinical Study: Sets of clinical samples were tested on the IMMCO RNA POL III ELISA as described in the Cross Reactivity section. This included 281 systemic sclerosis samples and 549 autoimmune and infectious disease controls.

Systemic sclerosis Clinical Sensitivity: $2 3 . 1 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ C.I. 18.4-28.6%) Systemic sclerosis Clinical Specificity: $9 8 . 2 \%$ $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C . l . 9 6 . 6 { - 9 9 . 1 \% } } )$

Indeterminate samples for these studies were considered positive. NHS were excluded in sensitivity/specificity calculations.
