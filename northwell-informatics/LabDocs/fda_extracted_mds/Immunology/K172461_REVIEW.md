# L. Test Principle:

AESKUSLIDES ANCA is an indirect fluorescent antibody assay utilizing human neutrophilgranulocyte-coated slides fixed with Ethanol or Formalin as a substrate for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) in human serum by manual microscopy or with the HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM.

Slides coated with human neutrophil granulocytes for autoantibody detection are fixed by two different methods: ethanol (EtOH) fixation or formalin fixation. Ethanol fixation allows cell components to move through the cells after the fixation process. Formalin fixation causes cellular components to cross-link, i.e., movement of cellular components is abrogated and the patterns are distinct. By processing serum on both Ethanol and Formalin-fixed slides, the user can confirm if the pattern is C-, P-, or A-ANCA, according to the table below.

\*Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)

The ANCA Formalin test is not intended to be used by itself, but in conjunction with the ANCA Ethanol test.

The HELIOS Vasculitis Pattern Plus software is able to detect both $\mathrm { C } \mathrm { - }$ and P-ANCA patterns. The A-ANCA pattern is reported as undefined positive. All suggested results obtained with the HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM must be confirmed by trained personnel.

Manual interpretation of AESKUSLIDES ANCA (Ethanol):

The two main patterns seen on an ethanol-fixed substrate are perinuclear (P-ANCA) and cytoplasmic (C-ANCA):

C-ANCA presents as coarse speckled cytoplasmic fluorescence, often with accentuated staining between the nuclear lobes. This pattern is characteristic for antibodies reacting with proteinase 3 (PR3).

P-ANCA presents as perinuclear staining with or without nuclear extension. This pattern is usually characteristic for antibodies reacting with myeloperoxidase (MPO). Note that anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive samples (containing anti-DNA/histones) may react with the nuclei of ethanol-fixed neutrophils, causing nuclear staining, and may mask or mimic the P-ANCA pattern(s).

A third pattern, less commonly seen, is called atypical ANCA (A-ANCA or X-ANCA):

A-ANCA presents as a cytoplasmic and perinuclear or very perinuclear staining on ethanol-fixed neutrophil substrate and usually becomes negative on formalin-fixed substrate.

Manual interpretation of AESKUSLIDES ANCA (Formalin):

On formalin fixed substrate, both MPO and PR3 antibodies appear as coarse cytoplasmic granular staining with interlobular accentuation.

Results from both AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and Formalin provide further information on the antibodies present in the serum. The fluorescence intensity level is the intensity of the specific fluorescence expressed as a numeric value. These values are reported as a number between $^ { \circ } 0 ^ { \circ }$ (no specific fluorescence) and $\sp { \infty } 4 + \sp { \infty }$ (very strong visible reaction).

AESKU recommends a screening dilution of 1:20, followed by serial dilutions for semiquantitative determinations, and suggests each laboratory establish its own screening dilution and titration scheme based on its population.

# Qualitative Evaluation

A serum dilution is considered negative for ANCA antibodies if the cells exhibit $< 1 +$ fluorescence in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Likewise, a serum dilution is considered positive for ANCA antibodies if the cells exhibit $\geq 1 +$ fluorescence in the cytoplasm or nucleus. A sample is considered positive for ANCA antibodies if it exhibits $\geq 1 +$ fluorescence of the cytoplasm or nucleus at a sample dilution of 1:20 or greater. Operators should report all titers and specific fluorescence staining seen.

# Semi‐quantitative Evaluation

The endpoint titer is defined as the highest sample dilution factor for which specific fluorescence of the cytoplasm or nucleus is identifiable. The titers are classified as:

1:80 and 1:160 are considered medium titers   
1:320 and greater are considered high titers

Automated instrument interpretation of test results by the software:

After slides are processed by the HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM, digital images of representative fields of view in the well are captured and stored on the computer system. The HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM Pattern Recognition software recognizes the pattern of the captured image by using SVM (Support Vector Machine) technology. After image preprocessing, feature extraction and classification, the software delivers the results. All suggested results given by the HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM software must be confirmed within the Result Confirmation tool by a trained operator.

The HELIOS PATTERN RECOGNITON software tool identifies the following Immunofluorescence patterns:

The HELIOS DEVICE SOFTWARE examines the fluorescence intensity and uses an analysis algorithm which takes exposure and pixel frequency into account. It examines relevant regions of the captured images, such as the fluorescence cell area, and subtracts the background, to provide an assessment of positive or negative results.

Trained operators must confirm all suggestions. Intensity and End Point Titers are identified by the HELIOS DEVICE SOFTWARE and pattern suggestions are made by the HELIOS PATTERN RECOGNITION tool.

AESKU recommends a screening dilution of 1:20, followed by serial dilutions for semiquantitative determinations and suggests each laboratory establish its own screening dilution and titration scheme based on its population.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

All runs have been performed according to the respective instructions for use (IFUs). One positive and one negative control (kit controls) were included in each run. Samples were tested at 1:20 dilution. Results were analyzed by two independent readers. The samples were characterized using three different methods: method A (HELIOS), method B (HELIOS User Evaluation) and method C (Manual AESKSULIDES ANCA). Positive/negative classification and pattern was recorded for each sample in each run and for each method. Fluorescence intensity (FI) agreement was determined for method C. Pattern suggestion in method A was provided by the Vasculitis Pattern Plus software tool. FI $\%$ agreement across all samples was evaluated only for method C and was calculated as the number of samples that did not differ from expected by more than $\pm 1$ fluorescene intensity divided by the number of total samples.

# Within-Lab Precision:

To assess the precision performance of the AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and Formalin, 10 samples were tested over five days, two runs per day, three replicates per sample run, resulting in 30 data points for each sample. For ANCA Ethanol, eight samples were positive, four with P-ANCA pattern, of which two were high positive and two medium positive, and four with C-ANCA pattern, of which two were borderline positive, one was medium positive and one was high positive. Two samples were negative. For ANCA Formalin, eight samples were positive (all CANCA pattern), of which four were high positive, three were medium positive and one was low positive. There were two negative samples. Below are the results of the within-lab precision study.

# Between-Site Reproducibility:

There were 10 samples tested on five days, two runs per day, three replicates per sample per run, at three different study sites. Two study sites were in the U.S., while one was in Germany, with one HELIOS AUTOMATED IFA SYSTEM per study site. Results were analyzed by two different readers per study site, resulting in a total of 90 data points per sample. For ANCA Ethanol, there were four P-ANCA patterns, with two high positive and two medium positive, and four C-ANCA patterns, with one high positive, one medium positive and two borderline samples. For ANCA Formalin, there were eight C-ANCA patterns, with four high positive, three medium and one low positive sample. There were also two negative samples included in the Ethanol and Formalin sample sets. Below are the results of the between-site reproducibility study.

# Lot-to-Lot Comparison:

A lot-to-lot reproducibility study was performed using three reagent lots each for AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin. For ANCA Ethanol, 12 sera were tested: four P-ANCA patterns, with two high and two medium positive samples, four C-ANCA patterns, with two high, one medium and one low positive sample, two A-ANCA patterns, with one high and one medium positive sample, and two negative samples. For ANCA Formalin, 12 sera were tested: eight C-ANCA patterns, with four high, three medium, and one low positive sample, and four negative samples. For both ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin each of the 12 serum samples was assayed 10 times on each reagent lot to give a total of 30

replicates per serum sample. Slides were processed manually according to the IFU and subsequently analyzed at the microscope by two independent readers.

Endpoint Titer Estimate Study:

Five serum samples with pre-characterized endpoint titers between 1:10 and 1:320 were assayed to determine the precision of the endpoint titer parameter. This study was performed using method B (HELIOS User Evaluation) and method C (Manual AESKUSLIDES ANCA) by two independent readers. For each of the two methods, each serum dilution was assayed on five days, with two runs per day and three replicates per run, resulting in 30 repetitions per serum dilution per reader. This study was conducted at three different study sites to allow the calculation of Between-Site reproducibility. All runs have been performed according to their respective IFUs. One positive and one negative kit controls were included in each run. For each replicate of the dilution series, endpoint titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which the sample was classified as positive.

Traceability:

A recognized standard for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies is not available.

Stability:

Accelarated Stability Study:

Three lots of complete kits (including slides, controls, conjugate and sample buffer) of AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and Formalin were stored at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 6 weeks. At $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { t = 0 } }$ , one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, and six weeks, a kit was manually tested on a set of eight samples. For ANCA Ethanol, the following samples were assayed: three C-ANCA (high-, medium- and low-positive), three PANCA (high-, medium- and low-positive), one A-ANCA (medium-positive), and one negative sample. For ANCA Formalin, four C-ANCA samples were tested (one high-, two medium-, one low-, and one borderline-positive), and three negative samples. The following parameters were assessed: positive-, negative-, overall-, pattern- and FI-agreements. For AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol all acceptance criteria were met for a time span of 6 weeks at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The Sponsor claims a shelf-life of at least 24 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . For AESKUSLIDES ANCA Formalin all acceptance criteria were met for a time span of four weeks at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The Sponsor claims a shelflife of at least 18 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Real-time Stability Study:

In order to confim the results of the Accelareted Stability Study, a real-time stability study is being conducted over a period of 27 months. ANCA Ethanol and Formalin kits will be stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the aforementioned period. The following time points are being tested: $\mathrm { t } = 0$ , 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 27 months. The following samples are being tested: for ANCA Ethanol, three C-ANCA (high-, medium-, low-positive), three P-ANCA (high-, medium-, low-positive), one A-ANCA (medium-positive), and one negative sample; for ANCA Formalin: five C-ANCA (one high-, two medium-, and two low-positive), and three negative samples. Each serum sample is being tested in triplicate per run. At $\mathrm { t } = 0$ , three runs are being performed for each of the three different kit lots to give a total of nine repetitions per serum per lot. Two runs are being conducted for each of three different kit lots to give a total of six repetitions per serum per lot. Positive-, negative, overall-, pattern- and FIagreements will be evaluated. Current results support ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin real-time stability of at least three months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . This study is ongoing.

In-use Stability Study:

Three different reagent lots were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ over a time period of 6 weeks. Tests have been performed at the following time points: $\mathrm { t } = 0$ , one, two, four, and six weeks for each reagent lot. After the first test at time point $\mathrm { t } = 0$ , kits were incubated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Each kit component (with the exception of slide foils) had been opened and all buffers (except wash buffer) had been prepared at time point $\mathrm { t } = 0$ . Eight serum samples have been tested at each time point: for ANCA Ethanol, three CANCA (high-, medium-, and low-positive), three P-ANCA (high-, medium-, and low-positive), one A-ANCA (high-positive), and one negative sample; for ANCA Formalin, six C-ANCA (one high-, two medium-, one low-, and two borderlinepositive), and two negative samples. Slides were processed manually and analyzed at the microscope by two independent readers. Positive-, negative-, overall-, patternand FI-agreements were evaluated. The data support in-use stability of six weeks at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for both ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin.

Stability data for the diluted wash buffer support a time frame of one week at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Serum Freeze-Thaw Study:

Serum stability was evaluated by testing 10 serum samples. For ANCA Ethanol, the following samples were tested: three P-ANCA (two high- and one medium-positive), three C-ANCA (high-, medium- and low-positive), and one A-ANCA mediumpositive sample, and three negative samples. For ANCA Formalin, there were six CANCA samples tested: three high-, and three medium-positive samples. For each serum, one aliquot was prepared as a control (no freeze-thaw). A second aliquot for each serum was prepared that underwent four freeze-thaw cycles. Slides were read by two independent readers. Each freeze/thaw sample was compared to the respective control sample. Results were assessed by determining positive-, negative-, overall-, pattern-, and FI-agreements. All agreements were $100 \%$ and support the manufacturer’s claim that samples can be frozen and thawed up to four times.

Long-term Storage Stability of Sera:

Nine different serum samples were aliquoted and stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for a time period of 14 months. For ANCA Ethanol, the following samples were assayed: two CANCA, three P-ANCA, one A-ANCA, and three negative samples. For ANCA Formalin, the following samples were assayed: four C-ANCA, one P-ANCA , and four negative samples. Frozen aliquots of different sera were thawed and assayed with ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin kits at the following time points: 3, 6, 8, 10, and 14 months. All tests were performed manually and subsequently analyzed at the microscope. The following parameters were assessed: positive-, negative-, pattern-, and FI-agreements. The results show that long-term storage of sera at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ over a time period of at least 12 months has no effect on performance and test

results of AESKUSLIDES ANCA.

Interference:

The interference study was performed according to CLSI guideline EP07-A2. Interference by 10 different substances was assessed at two different concentrations. There were a total of 14 samples tested: for ANCA Ethanol, five C-ANCA (one high-, one medium-, and three low-positive), five P-ANCA (one high-, one medium-, and three low-positive), two A-ANCA (one medium- and one low-positive), and two negative samples; for ANCA Formalin, 10 C-ANCA (three high-, two medium-, and five low-medium), and four negative samples.

The following substances were tested at the indicated concentrations:

Interfering substances were spiked in each of the 14 samples in two different concentrations. Controls were prepared for each serum sample by spiking in only the respective amount of diluent without interfering substances. Spiked serum samples and their controls were tested in triplicate for each concentration of interferent with AESKUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol and ANCA Formalin. All tests were performed manually, and results were analyzed by two independent readers at the microscope. Positive-, negative-, overall-, pattern and FI-agreements were evaluated.

No interferences were observed with the tested substances at the two tested concentrations.

# Cross-reactivity:

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that Anti-nuclear antibody(ANA)- positive samples may cause interference with AESKUSLIDES ANCA (Ethanol and Formalin), leading to fluorescence patterns on neutrophil granlocytes that can be confused with ANCA patterns. It is known that ANA and other anti-cell antibodies may interfere with ANCA detection by causing nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining. It is assumed that the main cause of interference shown in the population below in tables under Method Comparison to Predicate Device is the result of ANAinterference in the samples.

In this study, 25 analytically characterzed ANA-positive samples with homogenous, speckled, centromere, nucleolar, and nuclear dot patterns were tested with ANCA Ethanol and Formalin kits in triplicates. Methods A, B and C were evaluated. One positive and one negative control were included in each run. Samples were tested at 1:20 dilution. The number and percentage of ANCA positive samples were calculated.

In total, $40 \%$ , $64 \%$ and $60 \%$ of ANA positive samples were positive on AESKLUSLIDES ANCA Ethanol with methods A, B and C, respectively.

In total, $20 \%$ , $1 6 \%$ and $1 6 \%$ of ANA positive samples were detected positive on AESKLUSLIDES ANCA Formalin methods A, B and C, respectively.

The results show that ANA positive samples representing different ANA specific patterns can also give patterns on neutrophil granulocytes that resemble and can be confused with $\mathrm { P } \mathrm { - }$ and C-ANCA patterns. Based on the above results, the following limitation is contained in the Package Insert: “Decisions about treatment should not be based solely on ANCA IFA results. ANCA serological test results should be used in conjunction with information available from the clinical evaluation and other diagnostic information. Positive ANCA IFA results should be confirmed by MPO and PR3 ELISA. ANA positive samples may react with fixed neutrophils, generating fluorescence patterns resembling ANCA patterns.”

# f. Assay cut-off:

AESKU recommends a screening dilution of 1:20 followed by serial dilutions for semi-quantitative determinations, but suggests that each laboratory establishes their own screening dilution and titration scheme based on their population. The titers of 1:10 and 1:20 are considered low titers. 1:40 and 1:80 are considered medium titers. and 1:160 and greater are considered high titers.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

In order to show comparable performance of AESKUSLIDES ANCA (Ethanol and Formalin) and the predicate assay, a clinical study utilizing 507 serum samples (132 serum samples from patients with AAV and 375 samples from patients with other diseases) was performed. For each assay, the sample set was processed manually and analyzed for positive/negative result and pattern classification using Method C. Positivitiy/negativity was determined in relation to the clinical diagnosis. Samples were screened at a dilution of 1:20.
