# L. Test Principle:

Evaluating the concentration of a soluble antigen (e.g. IgG lambda) by turbidimetry involves the addition of the test sample to a solution containing the appropriate antibody (anti-IgG lambda) in a reaction vessel or cuvette. A beam of light is passed through the cuvette and, as the antigen-antibody reaction proceeds, the light passing through the cuvette is scattered increasingly as insoluble immune complexes are formed. Light scatter is monitored by measuring the decrease in intensity of the incident beam of light. The antibody in the cuvette is in excess so the amount of immune complex formed is proportional to the antigen concentration. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed initially to produce a calibration curve of measured light scatter versus antigen concentration. Samples of unknown antigen concentration can then be assayed and the results read from the calibration curve.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed following CLSI document Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. The linearity of the IgGK and IgGL assays have been confirmed using serially diluted serum samples to cover the standard measuring ranges of 2.3 – 30.0 $\mathfrak { g } / \mathsf { L }$ and $1 . 5 - 1 7 . 5 \ : \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { L }$ respectively. The results demonstrated that the IgGK and IgGL assays are linear over the ranges of $1 . 9 3 0 - 3 3 . 4 2 7 \ : \mathfrak { g } / \mathsf { L }$ and 1.380 – $1 9 . 3 0 0 \ : \mathfrak { g } / \mathsf { L }$ at $1 + 1 9$ dilution with deviation from linearity $\leq 1 0 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: An Internal Reference material (IR) was assigned by comparison with the Reference Material DA470K.

Stability:

Open-vial stability was performed on three lots of Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and IgG Lambda kits with testing intervals at various time points up to 112 days. Data supports an open vial stability claim of 3 months at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .

On-board stability was performed on three lots of Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and IgG Lambda kits with testing intervals at various time points up to 37 days for IgGK and

49 days for IgGL. Data supports an on-board stability claim of 28 days, provided that the power is left switched on as stated in the product insert.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A. The Limit of Blank was based on 60 determinations of analyte depleted sample and was estimated at the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the distribution. The Limit of Detection was calculated from the LoB and the combined SD of the 5 LoQ samples. The LoQ was calculated from 5 independent samples (serum samples diluted with analyte depleted serum to achieve a concentration close to the bottom of the measuring range) tested twelve times over five days. The tabulated summary of results is shown below:

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference:

Interferences were assessed according to CLSI EP7-A2 by testing three serum samples with different IgG Kappa and IgG Lambda concentration ranges, including a sample close to the lower limit of the reference interval, a sample within the reference interval and an elevated serum sample. Each sample was spiked with interfering substances and tested in multiple replicates. The acceptance criterion was that the mean results from the spiked samples must be within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the mean of the control samples.

# Cross reactivity:

No significant cross reaction was observed during testing for the predicate device. The specificity of the antisera is unchanged.

# Antigen Excess Detection:

The possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the device on the Binding Site Optilite was evaluated with 8 monoclonal IgG Kappa and 6 monoclonal IgG Lambda samples with concentrations above the respective standard measuring ranges. No antigen excess was observed up to $1 0 0 . 5 9 / \mathsf { L }$ and $1 0 2 . 5 9 / \mathrm { L }$ for IgG Kappa and IgG Lambda respectively.

f. Assay cut-off: Refer to Expected values.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

# IgG Kappa:

A comparison study was performed by analysing 284 serum samples (including 135 IgG Kappa paraprotein and 60 IgG Lambda paraprotein samples, 60 donor samples and 29 other samples, covering the range 0.2 – $4 7 . 6 9 \ : 9 / \mathrm { L } )$ using the Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa kit and an alternative commercially available assay. Passing Bablok regression analysis generated the following results:

$\mathsf { y } = 1 . 1 0 \mathsf { x } - 0 . 6 8 \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { L }$ correlation coefficient $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 5 7$ (y $" =$ Optilite, $\mathsf { x } =$ predicate analyser)

# IgG Lambda:

A comparison study was performed by analysing 172 serum samples (including 42 IgG Kappa paraprotein and $5 9 \mathsf { l g } \mathsf { G }$ Lambda paraprotein samples, 59 donor samples and 1 AL Amyloidosis sample, covering the range $0 . 0 9 - 4 0 . 6 5 \ : \mathfrak { g } / \mathrm { L } ,$ using the Optilite Hevylite IgG Lambda kit and an alternative commercially available assay. Passing Bablok regression analysis generated the following results:

$\mathsf { y } = 0 . 9 5 \mathsf { x } + 0 . 0 0 \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { L }$ correlation coefficient $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 8 2 3$ (y $=$ Optilite, $\mathsf { x } =$ predicate analyser)

# IgG Kappa/Lambda Ratio:

A comparison study was performed by analysing 143 serum samples (including 39 IgG Kappa paraprotein and $4 4 \mathsf { l g } \mathsf { G }$ Lambda paraprotein samples, 59 donor samples and 1 AL Amyloidosis sample, covering the range $0 . 0 1 - 2 7 7 . 5 0 \ : \mathrm { g / L ) }$ using the Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and IgG Lambda kits and alternative commercially available assays. Passing Bablok regression analysis generated the following results:

$\mathsf { y } = 1 . 1 2 \mathsf { x } - 0 . 1 7$ correlation coefficient $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 0 1$ ( $\prime =$ Optilite, $\mathsf { x } =$ predicate analyser)

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

# 3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity/clinical specificity: Transformation of the BNII Study onto the Optilite

# Purpose of the study

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical HLC Response categorisation of the predicate and the Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and Lambda Kits obtained from samples taken at multiple time points from IgG Kappa and IgG Lambda multiple myeloma patients during the course of their disease. The sponsor generated Passing and Bablok regression equations for the comparison study of the Optilite kits against the predicate kits. The regression equation was then modelled with the existing monitoring sample results from the original BNII submission to evaluate the clinical validity of the new device.

# Optilite HLC Response Category Study

Assignment of classification was based on the HLC Monitoring Response Category detailed in Table 1, using all assay data available. Responses were categorised in accordance with NCCN Guidelines v1.2011 by using the percentage change from baseline. Responses were characterised as progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), and complete response (CR). Kappa statistics were used to evaluate agreement between the test and predicate devices.

# Optilite Monitoring Study Design

A comparison of 69 monitoring samples from 10 IgG Kappa patients and 12 IgG Lambda patients was performed to compare the BNII HLC response category assigned to those observed with the Optilite Hevylite IgG Kappa and Lambda kits (Note: The Optilite monitoring response category is not to be used interchangeably with other manufacturer’s assays or with any other instrument platform monitoring response category). The results of the comparison study using 69 monitoring samples yielding 43 response classifications are shown in the table below:

These monitoring data were also supported by additional statistical regression equation modelling data.

# Data Modelling:

A data modelling procedure was carried out on monitoring sample results from the original BNII submission. The Passing Bablok regression equations derived from the comparison study and the total imprecision values derived from the precision studies were used to mathematically transform the data. The results are summarised in the tables below.
