ImmuGlo™ HEp-2 Elite IFA   
HEp-2 IFA   
Antinuclear Antibody, Indirect Immunofluorescent, Antigen, Control [DHN]   
ImmuGlo ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODY (ANA) TEST (HEP-2 CELLS)

General Description: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) target various nuclear and cellular components and are highly prevalent in systemic autoimmune connective tissue disorders. ANA can be detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using HEp-2 cell substrates. Such assays aid in the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other connective tissue disorders including mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, drug induced lupus, as well as cases of autoimmune hepatitis. ANA occur in about $9 5 \%$ of SLE patients. HEp-2 cell lines present a variety of autoantigens that are not found in solid phase assays developed for screening of ANA. Solid phase assays developed on various platforms differ in their antigen profiles, sensitivity and specificity raising uncertainties regarding the interpretation of results. Due to the limitations of solid phase assays, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) considers IFA using a HEp-2 cell substrate as the gold standard for ANA testing.

The HEp-2-IFA method is able to report both ANA pattern and titer for the test specimen. Various groups have worked to improve awareness of ANA patterns detected by HEp-2, criteria for accurate interpretation and disease association of ANA patterns. Much of this work has been compiled in the International Consensus on Antinuclear Antibody Patterns (ICAP) report recommending a standardized nomenclature and reporting format for IFA patterns.

The major nuclear patterns observed on HEp-2 substrates include Homogeneous (AC-1), Speckled (AC-2, AC-4, AC-5), Centromere (AC-3), Discrete Nuclear Dots (AC-6, AC-7) and Nucleolar (AC-8, AC-9 and AC-10) patterns. A critical development in recent years is the definition of a frequently reported pattern termed “Dense Fine Speckled” that has been assigned the anti-cell pattern number AC-2 and recommended as a competent level reporting parameter by ICAP. The major autoantigenic target associated with the DFS/AC-2 pattern, also referred to as the DFS70 pattern, is a 70 kDa antigen known as LEDGF (Lens Epithelium Derived Growth Factor) or PSIP1 gene product. These autoantibodies were initially reported to occur in sera from patients with positive ANA tests but no clinical evidence of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) and do not have a distinct clinical association. The prevalence and significance of DFS70 autoantibodies, methods used to screen/confirm the DFS/AC-2 pattern (i.e. IFA or solidphase) and implications of inaccurate interpretation of DFS70/DFS/AC-2 pattern have been presented in literature. The DFS/DFS70/AC-2 pattern may be difficult to read and can be mis-interpreted as homogeneous (associated with DNA, histones and nucleosomes), fine speckled, or a mix of homogeneous and fine speckled patterns, all of which are associated with systemic autoimmune diseases. Emerging awareness of the DFS70 pattern and the lack of commercially available assays that aid in the accurate discrimination of the DFS/DFS70/AC-2 pattern from mixed disease associated patterns increases the need for a method that may aid in distinction between ANA patterns at the screening stage without compromising the inherent advantages of the HEp-2 IFA method. The ICAP committee recommends all clinical labs report the DFS70 pattern.

HEp-2 Elite slides provided with this kit contain a 1:9 mixture of standard HEp-2 cells and engineered HEp-2 cells devoid of functional copies of PSIP1 gene (UniGene Gene ID: 1116). The engineered HEp-2 cells are able to detect all ANA specificities with the exception of the DFS70/AC-2 pattern resulting from autoantibodies associated with PSIP1. In DFS70 positive reactions standard HEp-2 cells provide a positive reaction while engineered HEp-2 cells do not. The HEp-2 Elite substrate thereby provides additional functionality to aid in discriminating homogeneous, speckled, and dense fine speckled (DFS70/AC-2) patterns during the screening phase.

Intended Use: The ImmuGlo™ HEp-2 Elite IFA is an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test for the qualitative or semi-quantitative detection of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) of the IgG isotype in human serum utilizing standard HEp-2 cells and engineered HEp-2 cells as a substrate. The ImmuGlo™ HEp-2 Elite IFA is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of systemic rheumatic diseases in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.

Similarities and Differences: Both kits use HEp-2 cells in an IFA format with negative and positive controls, serum diluent, wash solution, IgG conjugate and mounting medium to detect ANA IgG antibodies. Both kits use 1:40 screening dilutions and 30 minute incubation steps and slides are read on a fluorescence microscope. The ImmuGlo HEp-2 Elite IFA utilizes standard HEp-2 cells mixed with engineered HEp-2 with the PSIP1 gene knocked out in 1:9 ratio while the ImmuGlo ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODY (ANA) TEST utilizes only standard HEp-2 cells.

# Non-clinical Tests:

Method Comparison: Both kits were tested with well-characterized ANA associated disease subjects and disease controls.

# Pattern Agreement Study

An additional study was designed to determine pattern agreement using 243 samples with known ANA patterns. These samples were randomized and slides provided to 3 independent evaluators. The readers were blinded to each others’ results, as well as expected values for the samples. The data was analyzed by comparing Elite vs Predicate by reader and by consensus read (at least 2 of 3 readers). In the case of mixed patterns where more than one pattern was observed, the dominant or primary pattern was analyzed.

# Precision

Repeatability

To assess repeatability of the ImmuGlo™ HEp-2 Elite IFA and a manual microscope 8 negative and 17 positive samples with various patterns and intensities were tested in 6 replicates in 10 runs (2 runs per day for 5 days), resulting in 60 replicates for each sample read by 2 operators for a total n of 120. All samples met the $90 \%$ acceptance criteria for qualitative agreement (positive / negative), fluorescence intensity agreement ( $( \pm 1$ fluorescence value within one run) and pattern agreement.

# Reproducibility

In another study, the ImmuGlo™ HEp-2 Elite IFA and a manual microscope 10 positive samples and 1 negative sample with various patterns and intensities tested in triplicate in 10 runs (2 runs per day for 5 days) at three different sites, resulting in 90 replicates for each sample. $\%$ pattern agreement, $\%$ titer agreement and $\%$ fluorescence intensity agreement results are provided below. The AQL for these studies was $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ fluorescence value, $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ titer and a consensus pattern agreement. The acceptance criteria for these studies was $9 5 \%$ or greater agreement between readers within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ fluorescence value, $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ titer with consensus pattern agreement. The two samples that did not meet AQL were the result of subjective reader error. Overall agreement was $9 9 . 7 5 \%$ . Samples 2 and 9 demonstrated secondary patterns. There was agreement on pattern and intensity for these samples. No report of a secondary pattern is considered agreement for all other samples.

# Interference

Interference was studied by mixing sera with known ANA antibody levels with potentially interfering serum samples and studying deviation from expected results. No significant interference was demonstrated for the following substances at the levels indicated: hemoglobin $( 2 ~ \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { L } )$ , unconjugated bilirubin $( 3 4 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , rheumatoid factor $( 1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { E U } / \mathsf { m l } )$ , cholesterol $( 1 3 \mathrm { \ m m o l / L } )$ , triglycerides $( 3 . 7 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ ), naproxen $( 2 1 7 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { L } )$ ibuprofen $( 2 4 2 5 \mathrm { ~ u m o l / L } )$ ), prednisone $( 0 . 8 4 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , mycophenylate mofetil $( 1 4 . 0 1 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l } )$ , hydroxychloroquine $( 3 8 8 \mathrm { n g / m l } )$ , cyclophosphamide $( 1 4 3 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , rituximab $\left( 1 . 1 4 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / m l } \right)$ and Belimumab $( 0 . 9 3 9 \mathrm { m g / m l } )$ .

Clinical Study: Sets of clinical samples were tested on the ImmuGlo HEp-2 Elite IFA. This included 256 ANA associated disease samples and 497 utoimmune and infectious disease controls.

ANA Associated Disease Sensitivity: $7 8 . 1 \%$ $9 5 \%$ C.I. 72.5-82.9%) ANA Associated Disease Specificity: $7 5 . 1 \%$ $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C . l . } 7 1 . 0 \mathsf { - } 7 8 . 7 \% )$

ANA associated diseases used for calculation of sensitivity included Autoimmune hepatitis, Antiphospholipid syndrome, Mixed connective tissue disorder, Myositis, Sjögren's syndrome, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Systemic sclerosis and Drug induced lupus erythematosus. Disease Control samples (non-ANA associated diseases) used for calculation of specificity included Celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, Pernicious anemia, Primary biliary cirrhosis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Autoimmune thyroid disease, Ulcerative colitis, ANCA-associated vasculitis, Raynaud’s syndrome, Psoriasis, Atopic dermatitis, Colorectal cancer, Ovarian cancer, Pancreatic cancer, Breast cancer, Prostate cancer, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis C, Herpes simplex virus, Lyme disease, Mononucleosis, Rubella, Syphilis, Toxoplasmosis, Human immunodeficiency virus and Hepatitis B. Normal human sera and DFS70 suspected samples were excluded in sensitivity/specificity calculations.

Stability: All reagents for this kit are the same as the predicate device except for the slide, so accelerated stability testing was performed on the slide to ensure no change in shelf life. Accelerated stability testing on 3 lots stored at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for up to 30 days showed no drop in fluorescence over the course of the experiment supporting the predicate shelf life of 18 months. Real time and open kit stability studies are ongoi ng. Real time stability is currently 18 months for 2 lots and 9 for a third, which all continue to meet AQL.
