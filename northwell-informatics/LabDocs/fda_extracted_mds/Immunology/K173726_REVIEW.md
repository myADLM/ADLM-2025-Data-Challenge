# L. Test Principle:

The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific IgE in the patient sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-antiIgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the responses for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

i) Within-laboratory imprecision:

Imprecision of the allergen component f447, rAra h 6, Peanut was evaluated by using five positive plasma samples, with the following concentrations of antigenspecific IgE: 0.13, 1.08, 17.93 and $5 1 . 0 6 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ . Each sample was tested in 4 replicates in one assay run per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using a Phadia 250. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance $( \% C V )$ were calculated for each sample separately. Results are shown in the table below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the allergen component was assessed following CLSI guideline I/LA20-A2. Three positive plasma samples were each diluted in negative plasma generating at least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions. Undiluted samples were tested in

12 replicates and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use using the Phadia 250 instrument using one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component. The range of the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is LoD to $1 0 0 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ .

Results of the replicates from all three samples were analyzed for linearity. Regression statistics comparing the observed results to expected results are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i) Traceability:

The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 or the equivalent $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ International Standard 11/234 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).

ii) Kit Stability:

Real-time and accelerated stability:

Both an ongoing real-time stability study and an accelerated stability study were performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A using three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen f447, rAra h 6 (Peanut). The accelerated stability data support the manufacturer’s claim of 24 month unopened shelf-life stability. The real-time stability study supports six month unopened shelf-life stability and is ongoing.

The studies to determine the stability of the calibration curve, real-time, and onboard stability of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator are described in K100999.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined on the Phadia 250 in alignment with CLSI guideline EP17-A2 using two lots of reagents. The LoB was based on determinations of five blank samples in three runs with five replicates per run and was estimated as the $9 5 \%$ percentile of the distribution.

LoD was calculated according to the equation: $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + \mathrm { c B } \bullet \mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { L o D } }$ where $\mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { L o D } }$ is the pooled SD for each of five low positive samples measured in 15 replicates. Results from maximum LoD of the two lots were used in the calculation of LoQ. The precision profile provided supports the LoQ claim of $0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ at $\leq 1 5 \%$ CV.

The results are shown in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ImmunoCAP AllergenComponent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB(kUA/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SDLoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD(kUA/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ(kU/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>f447, rAra h 6 (Peanut)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.001</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.01</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.10</td></tr></table>

e. Analytical specificity:

# i) Inhibition studies:

Immunological specificity of the allergen component was verified through competitive inhibition. The studies were planned in accordance with CLSI I/LA20- A3. The specific IgE concentration for the positive sample is shown in the table below:

<table><tr><td>ImmunoCAP Allergen Component</td><td>kUA/L</td></tr><tr><td>f447, rAra h 6 (Peanut)</td><td>2.8</td></tr></table>

The f447, rAra h 6 Peanut allergen solution (inhibitor) was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose dependent inhibition. The following unrelated inhibitors rFel d 2, Cat, rHev b 6.02, Latex and rVes v 5, Common wasp and related inhibitor rAra h 9 Peanut were tested at a dose that is ten-fold or higher than the f447, rAra h 6 Peanut concentration that yielded $5 5 0 \%$ inhibition. Equal volumes of the positive sample and varying serial dilutions of f447, rAra h 6 Peanut were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for two hours before being analyzed with ImmunoCAP Allergen f447 on the Phadia 250 according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use. The testing was performed in duplicate in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.

The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in $\%$ , calculated according to the formula below:

$$
\left( 1 - \left( { \frac { r - b } { t - b } } \right) \right) \times 1 0 0 = i \%
$$

$\mathbf { r } =$ response [RU]   
${ \mathfrak { b } } =$ background response ( $100 \%$ inhibition) [RU]   
$\mathbf { t } =$ total response $0 \%$ inhibition) [RU]   
$\mathrm { i } =$ inhibition

Any negative inhibition $\%$ -values are shown as $0 \%$ inhibition.

The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution (inhibitor) and the unrelated and related inhibitors indicate that the new ImmunoCAP Allergen Component f447, rAra h 6, Peanut contains the immunologically relevant allergen as shown below:

The inhibition study showed that $5 5 0 \%$ inhibition was achieved with the inhibitor (rAra h 6 allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration of $0 . 9 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ . The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors, including three from unrelated groups (rFel d 2, Cat; rHev b 6.02, Latex and rVes v 5, Common wasp) and one related inhibitor from the same allergen group (r Ara h 9, Peanut f427) did not show any significant inhibition. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen f447, rAra h 6 Peanut solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.

# ii) Interference:

a) Endogenous Substance Interference:

Interference from icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples was tested using Bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) $1 9 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L } ]$ , Bilirubin F ( $1 9 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , Hemoglobin $\mathrm { 5 1 0 ~ m g / d L } )$ , Chyle (1,660 FTU-Formazine Turbidity Units) and Rheumatoid Factor $( 4 5 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ . Interferents were spiked into two positive samples and one negative sample and analyzed in four replicates in one assay run using the Phadia 250. The results demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE.

# b) Exogenous Substance Interference:

Two literature references were provided supporting that commonly prescribed allergy medications do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE (omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin.

b. Matrix comparison: Refer to K101251.

3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:

The performance of the allergen component f447, rAra h 6, Peanut was compared to a clinical diagnosis of allergy. The objectives of this study were: (i) to show the linkage between specific IgE antibodies to ImmunoCAP Allergen Component and the corresponding extract based ImmunoCAP Allergen, using clinical samples, and (ii) to demonstrate that samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical reaction to the allergen have undetectable or very low levels of specific IgE to the individual ImmunoCAP Allergen Component. Thirty four clinical serum samples from individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the allergen, as diagnosed by a physician, were used in the study. Information about clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. Non-atopic samples $( { < } 0 . 3 5 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } )$ from 100 healthy non-atopic donors were also tested. Clinical sensitivity and specificity in this sample cohort are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>Clinical Diagnosis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Atopic</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Non-atopic</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=3 colspan=1>f447, rAra h 6(Peanut)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>28</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>28</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>106</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>34</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>134</td></tr></table>

Sensitivity $= 8 2 . 4 \%$ (28/34) ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $6 5 . 5 \% 6 9 3 . 2 \% )$ Specificity $= 1 0 0 \%$ (100/100) ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 6 . 4 \% - 1 0 0 \% )$
