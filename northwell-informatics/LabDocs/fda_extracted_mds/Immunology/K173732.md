Dear Andrea Thomas:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

# L. Test Principle:

Evaluating the concentration of a soluble antigen (e.g. Kappa free light chains) by turbidimetry involves the addition of the test sample to a solution containing the appropriate antibody in a reaction vessel or cuvette. A beam of light is passed through the cuvette and, as the antigen-antibody reaction proceeds, the light passing through the cuvette is scattered increasingly as insoluble immune complexes are formed. Light scatter is monitored by measuring the decrease in intensity of the incident beam of light. The antibody in the cuvette is in excess so the amount of immune complex formed is proportional to the antigen concentration. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed initially to produce a calibration curve of measured light scatter versus antigen concentration. Samples of unknown antigen concentration can then be assayed and the results read from the calibration curve.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed following CLSI document Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. The linearity of the Kappa Free and Lambda Free assays have been confirmed using serially diluted urine samples to cover the standard measuring ranges of $2 . 9 - 1 2 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ (Kappa) and 5.2 – 139mg/L (Lambda) respectively. The results demonstrated that the kappa free and lambda free assays are linear over the ranges of 2.383–142.687mg/L (Kappa) and 3.87 – 160.02mg/L (Lambda) with deviation from linearity $\leq 1 0 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: Internally produced master calibrator

Stability: Not applicable. On board, open vial and real time stability was evaluated in K150658.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A and was carried out using both serum and urine matrices. The Limit of Blank was based on 60 determinations of blank samples (analyte depleted serum and urine at a low analyte concentration) and was estimated at the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the distribution. The Limit of Detection was calculated from the LoB and the combined SD of the five LoQ samples. The LoQ was calculated from five independent samples (Serum samples: samples diluted with analyte depleted serum and Urine samples: in house urine at low analyte concentration which was then pooled with an in house urine with a higher analyte concentration) to achieve a concentration close to the bottom of the measuring range) tested twelve times over five days. The tabulated summary of results is shown below:

e. Analytical specificity: Interference:

Interferences were assessed according to CLSI EP7-A2 by testing a single urine sample for the Kappa Free assay and the Lambda Free assay. Samples were prepared with an analyte concentration around the reference limit of each assay. Each sample was made up using urine from a healthy adult donor and urine from a kappa or lambda myeloma patient. Samples containing interferents were compared to matched control samples which contained no interferent. The mean results from the spiked samples must be within $10 \%$ of the mean of the control samples.

# Cross reactivity:

No significant cross reaction was observed during testing for the predicate device. The specificity of the antisera is unchanged.

# Antigen Excess Detection:

The possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the device on the Optilite analyser was evaluated in K150658

# Assay cut-off:

Not applicable. Refer to expected values of reference range.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

# Kappa Free:

A comparison study was performed by analysing 165 urine samples (including 86 with analyte levels below the reference limit) using the Optilite Freelite Mx Kappa Free kit and an alternative commercially available assay. Passing Bablok regression analysis generated the following results:

$y = 1 . 0 2 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 2 1 ~ \mathrm { ( m g / L ) }$ ( $\prime =$ Optilite; $\mathsf { x } =$ predicate analyser) correlation coefficient $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 9 9 2$

# Lambda Free:

A comparison study was performed by analysing 115 urine samples (including 59 with analyte levels below the reference limit) using the Optilite Freelite Mx Lambda Free kit and an alternative commercially available assay. Passing Bablok regression analysis generated the following results:

$y = 1 . 1 1 \times - 0 . 2 7 ( \mathrm { m g / L ) }$ ( $\prime =$ Optilite; $\mathsf { x } =$ predicate analyser) correlation coefficient ${ \sf r } = 0 . 9 4 7$

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.
