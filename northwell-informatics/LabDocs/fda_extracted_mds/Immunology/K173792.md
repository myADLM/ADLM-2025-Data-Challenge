Dear Martin Mann:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR

Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic.

# L. Test Principle:

The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. They are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen. The wells are at the same time a holder of the coupled antigen for convenient automation and a reaction chamber with reaction/washing solution handling based on pipetting to add and aspiration to remove liquids.

The EliA wells are coated with human PR3 protein, or human MPO protein, or human recombinant α3 chain of collagen IV. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to these proteins bind to the specific antigen. After washing away nonbound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgG is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs (3 instruments $\times 7$ runs). The study was performed with 1 run/day over a period of 7 days. Each sample was tested in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample. The data was calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1.

We included only one lot of EliA $\mathsf { P R 3 ^ { s } }$ , EliA MPOS and EliA GBM on the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument, as data for inter-lot-variation was reviewed in K140225. The results are summarized in the tables below:

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Previously reviewed in K140225

Carry-over: Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate is impossible.

# $f .$ Assay cut-off:

The ranges (negative, equivocal, positive) recommended for the evaluation of the test results were derived from the clinical studies (s. K140225).

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device (Instrument comparison): See 2c Instrument Comparison below

b. Matrix comparison: Previously reviewed under K140225.

c. Instrument comparison

In the Method Comparison studies for the three EliA tests included in this submission, more than 100 samples $( \geq 2 0 \%$ of the samples within $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the medical decision point) were run in single replicates on one Phadia 250 and three Phadia 2500/5000 instruments. The acceptance criteria for the method comparison (the slope for the regression lines should be 0.9 – 1.1 for single replicate to single replicate and intercept close to 0) were met for EliA PR3S, EliA MPOS and EliA GBM.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Clinical performance values were reviewed in K140225.

4. Clinical cut-off: Same as assay cut-off.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The frequency distribution for PR3, MPO and GBM antibodies was investigated in a group of apparently healthy subjects equally distributed by age and gender, using sera from a Caucasian population obtained from a blood bank. The results are given in the table below:

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

All available data support that both instrument platforms, Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500/5000 perform substantially equivalent when using the EliA PR3S, EliA MPOS, and EliA GBM immunoassays.

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
