# L. Test Principle:

The determination of soluble antigen (CRP) concentration by turbidimetric methods involves the reaction with specific antiserum (anti-CRP) to form insoluble complexes. When light is passed through the suspension formed a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a photodiode by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample. Concentrations are automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. The precision samples consisted of 5 serum samples at the following concentrations: $0 . 8 6 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ , $1 . 6 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , $3 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , ${ 5 . 0 6 } \mathrm { m g / L }$ and 8.54 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ . The samples were run in duplicate with 2 runs per day, using one instruments and one reagent batch, over the course of 20 days. The results from a representative lot are summarized in the table below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP06- A guideline. A high pool was prepared using a serum sample with high CRP activity. The low pool was pooled normal serum. The high and low pools were inter-diluted to achieve concentrations spanning $10 \%$ beyond the limits of the claimed measuring range ( $\mathrm { 0 . 4 4 \ m g / L }$ to $1 2 . 1 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ). The results were analyzed using weighted linear regression analysis and the results showed that the deviation from linearity did not exceed $10 \%$ .

The linearity studies support the claimed measuring range of 0.5 to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The assay is traceable to ERM-DA474, which is traceable to CRM 470.

# d. Detection limit:

Detection limit studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.

Limit of blank (LoB): The LoB was carried out using 4 depleted serum pools and 3 reagent lots using 1 instrument. Samples were run five times each per day, over 3 days to give a total of 60 replicates per reagent lot. For each reagent lot, the LoB results were ranked from lowest to highest concentration, and the LoB was estimated to be the result equivalent to the concentration at the 95th percentile.

Limit of detection (LoD): 4 serum sample pools were used to calculate the LoD using 3 reagent lots and 1 instrument. Samples were run five times each per day, over 3 days on each reagent lot. The LoD was calculated for each reagent lot using the parametric approach described in the guideline.

Limit of quantitation (LoQ): 4 serum sample pools were used to calculate the LoQ using 3 reagent lots and 1 instrument. Samples were run five times each per day, over 3 days on each reagent lot. The LoQ was determined using the lowest concentration that met the defined performance goals of imprecision $( \% \mathrm { C V } ) { < } 2 0 \%$ .

Based on the results of the studies, the sponsor claims the following detection limits:

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline. 4 pool levels of serum samples (with CRP concentrations around 1, 2, 3 and $5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ ) were used. Each sample was spiked with interfering substances and tested. Samples were tested in replicates of twenty at three analyte concentrations using a single lot of reagents. The results of the spiked samples were compared to the results of the non-spiked samples. At the following concentrations, the percentage difference between the results of the spiked samples compared to the results of the non-spiked samples was less that $\pm 1 0 \%$ .

The sponsor includes the following information in the package insert.

“Turbidimetric assays are not suitable for measurement of highly lipaemic or haemolysed samples or samples containing high levels of circulating immune complexes (CICs) due to the unpredictable degree of non-specific scatter these sample types may generate. Unexpected results should be confirmed using an alternative assay method.”

“Samples at selected CRP concentrations were spiked with decreasing concentrations of rheumatoid factor. The following results were obtained.

A sample at $3 . 8 \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP showed $< 1 0 \%$ interference by $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ RF. Any sample with an RF concentration greater than $2 5 \ \mathrm { \ I U / m L }$ should be re-tested with an alternative method.”

CRP prozone study:

A study was performed to verify the CRP prozone performance on the Optilite analyzer. 28 samples with CRP concentrations ranging from 0.8, to $1 1 6 1 . 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ were evaluated. The study demonstrated that up to $8 2 9 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ the results were reported as above the measuring range and flagged as being out of the measuring range $( { > } 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L } )$ . However, due to antigen excess, samples with CRP concentrations above $8 9 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ will be reported erroneously low with a prozone flag. For example, a sample with a CRP concentration of $1 1 6 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ is reported as $9 1 . 3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ with a prozone flag.

The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling regarding the prozone effect:

“The reportable range of this assay is approximately $0 . 5 - 1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , depending on lotspecific calibrator values. Any result obtained above this range must be considered invalid and the sample should be re-tested using a conventional CRP assay. For example, in a study samples between $8 9 3 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $1 1 6 1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ returned falsely low concentrations ( $9 9 . 4 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $9 1 . 3 2 \mathrm { m g / L } $ ), however antigen excess was correctly detected by the analyser and results were accompanied by a “High activity” flag in all cases”

“Potential occurrences of antigen excess cannot be completely excluded. Samples detected as being in excess are flagged as "High activity" and are automatically remeasured at a higher sample dilution to confirm antigen excess. Any sample with a concentration above $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ should be considered invalid and re-tested with a conventional CRP assay.”
