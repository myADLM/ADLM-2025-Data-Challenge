# SPECIAL 510(K): DEVICE MODIFICATION OIR DECISION MEMORANDUM

# 510(k) Number: K181436

This $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own class II or class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:

1. The name and 510(k) number of the applicant’s previously cleared device. (For a preamendment device, a statement to this effect has been provided.)

OSOM Mono Test

510(k) number: K972231

2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S):

This change was for a modification of the OSOM Mono Test whereby the current capillary tube, which includes a Mylar wrapped glass tube and a dry natural rubber latex bulb, will be replaced by the Microsafe capillary tube. Both the current capillary tube and the Microsafe capillary tube collect $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of fingertip whole blood and deliver the blood to the sample Test Tube. No changes to the chemistry of the assay have been made as the unmodified and modified devices are identical in assay formulation.

# The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and assay information:

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary:

A risk assessment of the modified Mono Test was conducted and documented according to the firm’s Quality Systems requirements. This assessment included a standard Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) which concluded that there is minimal impact on Clinical Studies and that the only risk was to Non-Clinical Performance. Two studies were carried out to demonstrate that there was no impact on the results with the modified assay – Volume Capability Study and Compatibility Study.

i. Volume Capability Study: The volume of deionized water taken up by the Micrsafe Tubes when following the package insert was measured using three lots of Microsafe Tubes. The average volume within and across lots was between $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and $5 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and met the acceptance criteria.   
ii. Compatibility Study: Finger-stick samples from three different seronegative donors were evaluated across the three lots of Microsafe Tubes. No deleterious effect on the assay was observed and the results met the acceptance criteria.

A third study (Time to Dispense) was carried out to determine how long a finger-stick sample could be retained in a MicroSafe Tube and still be dispensed. The study was for information only.

iii. Finger-stick whole blood samples were collected and dispensed after 30, 60, and 120 seconds. Three lots of Microsafe Tubes were evaluated. A finger-stick sample could be left in the Microsafe Tube for 120 seconds with no deleterious effect on dispensing a specimen.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the applicant’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
