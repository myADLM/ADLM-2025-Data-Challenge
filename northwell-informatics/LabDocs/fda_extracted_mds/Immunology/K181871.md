# L. Test Principle:

The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. They are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen. The wells are at the same time a holder of the coupled antigen for convenient automation and a reaction chamber with reaction/washing solution handling based on pipetting to add and aspiration to remove liquids.

The EliA wells are coated with human recombinant tissue transglutaminase, or with synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to these proteins bind to the specific antigen. After washing away nonbound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgA or IgG antibodies (EliA IgA Conjugate or EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgA or IgG is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs (3 instruments $\times 7$ runs).

The study was performed with 1 run/day over a period of 7 days. Each sample was tested in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample. The data was calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1.

The results are summarized in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The EliA IgG method was previously reviewed in K061165. The EliA IgA method was previously reviewed in K062787.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation studies were performed on the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument. One blank sample and three low level samples were measured in thirty-three and eleven replicates, respectively, in each of two runs.

# EliA Celikey IgG:

The LoD for EliA Celikey IgG is 0.6 EliA $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { U } m l }$ , determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI document EP17-A2 and with proportions of false positives (α) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 132 determinations with 66 blank and 66 low level replicates; and LoB of 0.0 EliA $\cup / \mathsf { m L }$ .

Since none of those low level samples met the target level for the $C V \%$ of $20 \%$ - a requirement for the LoQ estimation – 3 additional low level samples were measured.

All low level samples were included in the LoD estimation (6 low level samples and a total of 132 determinations).

The LoQ for EliA Celikey IgG is 1.7 EliA U/mL, determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI document EP17-A2, based on 66 determinations of 3 low level samples that are different from the ones for the determination of the LoD, and a target uncertainty goal of $20 \%$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Previously reviewed in K062583 and K093459.

Carry-over: Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate is impossible.

f. Assay cut-off:

The ranges (negative, equivocal, positive) recommended for the evaluation of the test results were derived from the clinical studies (s. K062583 and K093459).

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device (Instrument comparison): See 2c Instrument Comparison below

b. Matrix comparison: Previously reviewed under K062583 and K093459.

# c. Instrument comparison

In the Method Comparison studies for the three EliA tests included in this submission, more than 100 samples $( \geq 2 0 \%$ of the samples within $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the medical decision point) were run in single replicates on one Phadia 250 and three Phadia 2500/5000 instruments. The acceptance criteria for the method comparison (the slope for the regression lines should be $0 . 9 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 . 1$ for single replicate to single replicate and intercept close to 0) were met for EliA Celikey IgG, EliA GliadinDP IgA and EliA Gliadin $D P$ IgG.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Clinical performance values were reviewed in K062583 and K093459.

4. Clinical cut-off: Same as assay cut-off.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The frequency distribution for anti-tTG IgG and anti-gliadin IgA and IgG antibodies was investigated in a group of apparently healthy subjects equally distributed by age and gender, using sera from a Caucasian population obtained from a blood bank.

The results are given in the table below:

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

All available data support that both instrument platforms, Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500/5000 perform substantially equivalent when using the EliA Celikey IgG, EliA GliadinDP IgA and EliA GliadinDP IgG immunoassays.

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
