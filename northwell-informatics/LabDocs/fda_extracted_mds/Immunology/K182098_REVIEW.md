N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays

In-vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative determination of free light chains (FLC), type kappa or type lambda in human serum and EDTA-plasma by means of particleenhanced immunonephelometry using the BN Systems. FLC measurements are used as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM) and as an aid in the diagnosis of amyloidosis (AL) in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.

The response category assignment of Complete Response for the monitoring of MM, is reliant upon the combination of clinical history and other tests including protein electrophoresis, immunofixation and bone marrow, imaging and urine assessments.

2. Indications for use: Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statements:

For prescription use only

Warning: The result of the FLC Kappa or FLC Lambda in a given specimen determined with assays and/or instrument platforms from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the assay used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If, in the course of serially monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda levels is changed, additional sequential testing should be carried out. Prior to changing assays, the laboratory MUST confirm baseline values for patients being serially monitored.

4. Special instrument requirements:

BN II (K943997) and BN ProSpec Systems (K001647)

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The FLC test systems are based upon the principles of particle-enhanced immunonephelometry. Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to human free light chains (FLCs), type kappa or lambda, are agglutinated when mixed with samples containing FLCs. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

3. Clinical studies:

The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa assay and the N Latex FLC lambda assay as an aid in monitoring of disease status in multiple myeloma (MM) and light chain multiple myeloma (LCMM) subjects was determined from a retrospective clincal study. Changes in FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda levels in serial serum samples from subjects diagnosed with MM and LCMM during treatment were compared to clinical response categories based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) as determined by the clinicians.

The patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows:

Inclusion criteria:

· Confirmed diagnosis of MM or LCMM · At least four blood collections in intervals of $\geq$ three weeks · Informed consent available · Clinical information of response level available

Exclusion criteria:

· Less than four blood collections   
· No informed consent available   
· Patients subsequently diagnosed with another disease

A total of 125 (104 MM and 21 LCMM) subjects were enrolled in the study. Among them, 27 subjects were excluded: 17 subjects had less than four sample draws; four MM subjects were re-diagnosed to Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia; two subjects had no informed consent available; and four subjects had no available clinical information about response level. Therefore, a total 98 subjects (81 IgG, IgA and IgM MM and 17 Kappa and Lambda LCMM subjects) with a total of 391 serum samples were used in the study analysis.

Of the 98 subjects, 47 $( 4 7 \% )$ were male and 51 $( 5 2 \% )$ were female. The mean age was 65 years and the range was 35 to 92 years. The majority of subjects $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 7 0 } , 7 1 \% ,$ ) were Caucasian, the remaining subjects included 18 $( 1 8 \% )$ African American, one $( 1 \% )$ Asian and nine $( 9 \% )$ Unknown.

A total of 391 draws were collected from 98 subjects. The mean number of draws per subject was five, ranging from four to seven draws. The duration of the monitoring days ranged from 88 days to 1338 days.

The information collected for each sample included the following: (a) general information including patient’s demographic information and date of blood sample drawn; (b) clinical information including patient’s diagnosis report/medical notes, treatment initiated, and diagnostic response criteria; c) laboratory data including serum electrophoresis results, serum/ urine immunofixation electrophoresis, serum FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda, CRAB (Calcium, Renal Failure, Anemia, Bone lesions) status, and plasma cell count.

# Results:

The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays as aid in monitoring MM was evaluated by testing a total of 391 samples from 98 subjects consisting of 98 baseline values and 293 monitoring observations and comparing to clinical disease response status.

At each follow-up visit, the percentage change of the Involved FLC Kappa (iFLC Kappa) or Involved FLC Lambda (iFLC Lambda) was calculated by comparing the test result to the test result from the previous visit. The monitoring response criteria based on the FLC results were based on the FLC ratio, $\%$ relative change of difference between both FLC (rd_FLC), M protein level and IFE monocloncal protein detection.

The clinical assessment for each monitoring observation was provided by the attending physician who was responsible for the corresponding therapy decisions based on therapy response criteria defined according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2011/National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology on Multiple Myeloma. Clinical status of each monitoring event was

categorized into one of six response categories: Stringent Complete Response (sCR), Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progressive Disease (PD).

Data were analyzed based on the comparison of disease category determined from N Latex assays to clinical assessement.

Results of N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays in combination with other laboratory results were used to assign a response category and compared to the clinical assessment according to the table below:

Discordance results:

The response criteria established by clinicians are often based on multiple factors besides FLC results, therefore FLC results alone might lead to a different classification.

The clinical disease reponse categories were condensed into two clinical status categories: “Progression” and “No-progression”. Subjects with ‘Progression’ consist of those monitoring events defined as ‘Progressive Disease’. Subjects with ‘NoProgression’ consist those monitoring events defined as ‘Good Response, Moderate Response, and Stable Disease Response’ categories. The performance N-Latex FLC results compared to the clinical status are summarized as follows:
