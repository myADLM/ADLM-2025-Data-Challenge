# L. Te st Principle:

EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the antibodies to be measured.

The EliA wells are coated with human recombinant centromere protein B, human recombinant RNP (RNP70, A, C) or with human recombinant RNP $( 7 0 \mathrm { k D a } )$ protein. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to these proteins bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non

bound conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the value of fluorescent signal, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical performance:

All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria for all analytical performance studies.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs (three instruments total and seven runs per instrument). The study was performed with a single run/day over a period of seven days. Each sample was tested in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample (3 instruments $\times 7$ runs x 4 replicates $= 8 4$ ). The data were calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1. Five native patient serum samples were tested: one negative, one or two in the equivocal range, and two or three positive specimens. All samples were tested on all instruments. The results are summarized in the tables below:

The following statements are included in the package inserts: “Please note that concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.” and “Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”

The hook effect was previously reviewed in K082759 (EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP) and K083117 (EliA RNP70).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Same as in the predicate devices. Refer to K082759 (EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP) and K083117 (EliA RNP70).

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed on a Phadia 2500 instrument. LoB was measured in two assay runs with each run including a blank sample in 33 replicates, giving a total of 66 replicates. LoD was measured in two assay runs by testing three low level serum samples in 11 replicates per sample in a run, giving a total of 66 replicates. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was based on 66 determinations and a precision targetof $20 \%$ . The results are summarized in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:

i) Interference:

Interference by endogenous substances was previously reviewed in K082759 (EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP) and K083117 (EliA RNP70).

ii) Cross-reactivity: Cross-reactivity was previously reviewed in K082759 (EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP) and K083117 (EliA RNP70).

iii) Carry-over:

The Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate was not evaluated.

# f. Assay cut-off:

The assay cut-offs are the same as in the predicate devices (refer to K082759 and K083117) and are summarized in the tables below:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: See 2c. Instrument Comparison below.

b. Matrix comparison: Matrix comparison between serum and plasma was reviewed in  K141375K082759 (EliA CENP and EliA U1RNP) and K083117 (EliA RNP70).

# Instrument comparison:c.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate conformance and show comparability of EliA CENP, EliA U1RNP, and EliA RNP70 on the Phadia 250 instrument versus the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument.
