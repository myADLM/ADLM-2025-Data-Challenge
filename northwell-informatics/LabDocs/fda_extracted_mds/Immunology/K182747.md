Dear Sheryl Skinner:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

# L. Test Principle:

The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. They are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen. The wells are at the same time a holder of the coupled antigen for convenient automation and a reaction chamber with reaction/washing solution handling based on pipetting to add and aspiration to remove liquids.

The EliA wells are coated with aggregated rabbit IgG antigen. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to these proteins bind to the specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgM antibodies (EliA IgM Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The assay directly measures the amount of antibody of interest bound to the antigen coating the EliA well, therefore the higher the value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs (3 instruments $\times 7$ runs). The study was performed with 1 run/day over a period of 7 days. Each sample was tested in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample. The data was calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1.

We included only one lot of EliA RF IgM Well on the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument, as data for inter-lot-variation has already been shown in K102673. The results are summarized in the table below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Four patient serum samples were diluted in sample diluent and tested with one batch of EliA RF IgM Immunoassay and one set of system reagents on Phadia 2500/5000. The results of the regression analysis are summarized below:

The reportable range (Limit of Detection, upper limit) for EliA RF IgM is from 0.6 to 200 IU/mL. The measuring range (Limit of Quantitation, upper limit) is from 1.0 to 200 IU/mL.

Statements included in the package insert: “Please note that concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.”

“Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The EliA IgM method was previously reviewed in K091845.

d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed on the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument. One blank sample and three low level samples were measured in thirty-three and eleven replicates, respectively, in each of two runs.

# EliA RF IgM:

The LoD for EliA RF IgM is $0 . 6 \ | \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ , determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI document EP17-A and with proportions of false positives (α) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 132 determinations with 66 blank and 66 low level replicates; and LoB of $0 . 2 \ | \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ .

The LoQ for EliA RF IgM is $1 . 0 \ | \cup / \mathrm { m L }$ , determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI document EP17-A2, based on 66 determinations, and a target uncertainty goal of $20 \%$ .

The results are summarized in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Previously reviewed in K102673.

Carry-over: Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate is impossible.

# f. Assay cut-off:

The ranges (negative, equivocal, positive) recommended for the evaluation of the test results were derived from the clinical studies (s. K102673).

a. Clinical sensitivity: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Clinical performance values were reviewed in K102673.

4. Clinical cut-off: Same as assay cut-off.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The frequency distribution for IgM rheumatoid factor was investigated in a group of apparently healthy subjects equally distributed by age and gender, using sera from a Caucasian population obtained from a blood bank.   
The results are given in the table below:

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

All available data support that both instrument platforms, Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500/5000 perform substantially equivalent when using the EliA RF IgM immunoassay.

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
