3. Special conditions for use statement: Prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: For use on the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instruments

# I. Device Description:

EliA uses a modular reagent system. The assay-specific, method-specific and general reagents are packaged and purchased as separate units. The reagents on Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical; they are only filled in different containers.

(1) EliA Assay-specific reagent:

EliA RF IgM Wells are coated with aggregated rabbit $\mathrm { I g } \mathbf { G } -$ four carriers (12 wells each), ready to use;

(2) EliA Method-specific reagents:

EliA IgM Conjugate 50 or 200: $\beta$ -Galactosidase labeled anti- $\mathrm { \cdot } \mathrm { l g } \mathrm { M }$ (mouse monoclonal antibodies) in PBS containing BSA and $0 . 0 6 \%$ (w/v) sodium azide in six wedge-shaped bottles, $5 \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use; or six wedge shaped bottles, $1 9 \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use EliA IgM Calibrator Strips: Human IgM (0, 10, 35, 80, 500, $1 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$ in PBS

containing BSA, detergent and $0 . 0 9 5 \%$ (w/v) sodium azide – five strips, six single- use vials per strip, $0 . 3 \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use;   
EliA IgM Curve Control Strips: Human IgM $( 8 0 \mu \ g / \mathrm { L } )$ in PBS containing BSA, detergent and $0 . 0 9 5 \%$ (w/v) sodium azide – five strips, six single-use vials per strip, $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use;   
EliA IgM Calibrator Well: Coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies – four carriers (12 wells each), ready to use.   
EliA Sample Diluent: PBS containing BSA, detergent and $0 . 0 9 5 \%$ (w/v) sodium azide – six bottles, $4 8 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use; or six bottles, $4 0 0 \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use;

(3) EliA General reagents:

Development Solution $( 0 . 0 1 \% 4 $ -Methylumbelliferyl- $\beta$ -D-galacto-side, $< 0 . 0 0 1 0 \%$ preservative), ready for use;   
· Stop Solution $4 \%$ Sodium Carbonate), ready for use;   
· Dilution Wells (high density polyethylene wells), 50 carriers, ready to use; Pipette Tips in Racks (polyethylene tips), $2 4 \mathrm { r a c k s } \times 1 6 0$ tips, ready for use; Washing Solution (information in separate Washing Solution package insert)

Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical instruments except for sample throughput. Phadia 2500 consists of one process module (two process lines), whereas Phadia 5000 consists of two process modules ( $2 \times 2$ process lines). Instrument operation is handled by onboard Instrument Software (ISW). Data output is administered by Information Data Manager (IDM). All steps of an assay are performed within a single process line. Thus, study protocols used for Phadia 2500 are also valid for Phadia 5000.

# L. Test Principle:

EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the antibodies to be measured.

The EliA wells are coated with aggregated rabbit IgG antigen. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies (RF) to these proteins bind to the specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgM antibodies (EliA IgM Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The assay directly measures the amount of antibody of interest bound to the antigen coating the EliA well, therefore the higher the value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria for all analytical performance studies.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs (three instruments total and seven runs per instrument). The study was performed with a single run/day over a period of seven days. Each sample was tested in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample (3 instruments $\times 7$ runs x 4 replicates $= 8 4$ ). The data were calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1. Five native patient serum samples were tested: one negative, one in the equivocal range, and three positive specimens. All samples were tested on all instruments. The results are summarized in the tables below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Four patient serum samples were diluted in EliA Sample Diluent and tested in triplicate with one lot of EliA RF IgM and one set of system reagents on Phadia 2500/5000. The results of the dilutions were compared with their expected values. The ratio observed/expected (O/E) was calculated. Mean observed value was used in the calculation. The results of the regression analysis are summarized in the tables below:

The reportable range (Limit of Detection, upper limit) for EliA RF $\mathrm { I g M }$ is from 0.6 to 200 EliA $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ . The measuring range (Limit of Quantitation, upper limit) is from 1.0 to 200 EliA $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ .

The following statements are included in the package inserts: “Please note that concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.” and “Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”

The hook effect was previously reviewed in K102673 c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Same as in the predicate devices. Refer to K102673.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed on a Phadia 2500 instrument. LoB was measured in two assay runs with each run including a blank sample in 33 replicates, giving a total of 66 replicates. LoD was measured in two assay runs by testing three low level serum samples in 11 replicates per sample in a run, giving a total of 66 replicates. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was based on 66 determinations and a precision target of $20 \%$ . The results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EliA RF IgM (EliA U/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Phadia 2500/5000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0</td></tr></table>

e. Analytical specificity:

i) Interference: Interference by endogenous substances was previously reviewed in K102673.

ii) Carry-over: The Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate was not evaluated.

f. Assay cut-off:

The assay cut-offs are the same as in the predicate devices and are summarized in the tables below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt; 3.5 EliA U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.5-5.0 EliA U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Equivocal</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt; 5.0 EliA U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td></tr></table>

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: See 2c. Instrument Comparison below.
