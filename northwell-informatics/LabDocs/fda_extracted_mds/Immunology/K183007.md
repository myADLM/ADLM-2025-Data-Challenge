Dear Sheryl Skinner:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97).

# L. Test Principle:

The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. They are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen. The wells are at the same time a holder of the coupled antigen for convenient automation and a reaction chamber with reaction/washing solution handling based on pipetting to add and aspiration to remove liquids.

The EliA wells are coated with a synthetic SmD3 peptide. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to SmD3 peptide bind to the specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs (3 instruments $\times 7$ runs).

The study was performed with 1 run/day over a period of 7 days. Each sample was tested in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample. The data was calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1.

We included only one lot of EliA $\mathsf { s m } { \mathsf { D } } ^ { P }$ Well on the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument, as data for inter-lot-variation has already been shown in K132631. The results are summarized in the table below:

The linear range and the measuring range are set to 1.6 EliA U/mL (LoQ) to 480 EliA $\cup / \mathsf { m L }$ (upper limit of measuring range).

The reportable range (Limit of Detection, upper limit of measuring range) for EliA $\mathsf { s m } { \mathsf { D } } ^ { P }$ is from 0.8 to 480 EliA $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { U } } / \mathrm { m L }$ . Concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The EliA IgG method was previously reviewed in K061165.

d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed on the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument. One blank sample and five low level samples were measured in twelve replicates in each of six runs spread over six different days.

The LoD for EliA $\mathsf { s m } \mathsf { D } ^ { P }$ is 0.8 EliA U/mL, determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI document EP17-A and with proportions of false positives (α) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 432 determinations with 72 blank and 360 low level replicates; and LoB of 0.3 EliA U/mL.

The LoQ for EliA $\mathsf { s m } { \mathsf { D } } ^ { P }$ is 1.6 EliA $\mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ , determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI document EP17-A, based on 360 determinations; and a target uncertainty goal of $20 \%$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Previously reviewed in K132631

Carry-over: Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate is impossible.

In the Method Comparison studies for EliA $\mathsf { s m } { \mathsf { D } } ^ { P }$ , more than 100 samples $( \geq 1 0 \%$ of the samples within $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the medical decision point) were run in single replicates on one Phadia 250 and one Phadia 2500/5000 instrument. The acceptance criteria for the method comparison (the slope for the regression lines should be $0 . 9 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 . 1$ for single replicate to single replicate and intercept close to 0) were met for EliA $\mathsf { s m } { \mathsf { D } } ^ { P }$ .

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Clinical performance values were reviewed in K132631.   
4. Clinical cut-off: Same as assay cut-off.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The frequency distribution for Sm antibodies was investigated in a group of apparently healthy subjects equally distributed by age and gender, using sera from a Caucasian population obtained from a blood bank.

The results are given in the table below:

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

All available data support that both instrument platforms, Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500/5000 perform substantially equivalent when using the EliA SmDP immunoassays.

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
