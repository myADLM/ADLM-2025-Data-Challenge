# I. Device Description:

EliA uses a modular reagent system. The assay-specific, method-specific and general reagents are packaged and purchased as separate units. The reagents on Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical; they are only filled in different containers.

(1) EliA Assay-specific reagent: · EliA SmDP Wells are coated with a synthetic SmD3 peptide – four carriers (12 wells each), ready to use;   
(2) EliA Method-specific reagent: · EliA IgG Calibrator Strips: Human IgG (0, 4, 10, 20, 100, $6 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$ ) in PBS containing BSA, detergent and $0 . 0 9 5 \%$ $\mathrm { ( w / v ) }$ sodium azide in five strips, six single- use vials per strip, $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use; EliA IgG Curve Control Strips: Human IgG $( 2 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } )$ in PBS containing BSA, detergent and $0 . 0 9 5 \%$ (w/v) sodium azide in five strips, six single-use vials per strip, $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use; EliA Sample Diluent: PBS containing BSA, detergent and $0 . 0 9 5 \%$ (w/v) sodium azide in six bottles, $4 8 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use; or six bottles, $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use;

EliA IgG Conjugate 50 or 200: $\beta$ -Galactosidase labeled anti-IgG (mouse monoclonal antibodies) in PBS containing BSA and $0 . 0 6 \%$ (w/v) sodium azide in six wedge-shaped bottles, $5 \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use; or six wedge-shaped bottles, $1 9 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ each, ready to use; EliA IgG Calibrator Well: Coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies in four carriers (12 wells each), ready to use

(3) EliA General reagents:

Development Solution ( $0 . 0 1 \ \% 4 $ -Methylumbelliferyl- $\beta$ -D-galacto-side, $< 0 . 0 0 1 0 \%$ preservative), ready for use; · Stop Solution ( $4 \%$ Sodium Carbonate), ready for use; Dilution Wells (high density polyethylene wells), 50 carriers, ready to use; · Pipette Tips in Racks (polyethylene tips), 24 racks $\times 1 6 0$ tips, ready for use; · Washing Solution (information in separate Washing Solution package insert)

Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 are identical instruments except for sample throughput. The Phadia 2500 consists of one process module (two process lines), whereas Phadia 5000 consists of two process modules ( $2 \times 2$ process lines). Instrument operation is handled by onboard Instrument Software (ISW). Data output is administered by Information Data Manager (IDM). All steps of an assay are performed within a single process line. Thus, study protocols used for Phadia 2500 are also valid for Phadia 5000.

# L. Te st Principle:

EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the antibodies to be measured.

The EliA wells are coated with a synthetic $\mathrm { S m D } _ { 3 }$ peptide. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to $\mathrm { S m D } _ { 3 }$ peptide bind to the specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical performance:

All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria for all analytical performance studies.

To determine the precision of the assay, the variability was assessed in a study with a total of 21 runs (three instruments total and seven runs per instrument). The study was performed with a single run/day over a period of seven days. Each sample was tested in four replicates/run giving in total 84 replicates per sample (3 instruments $\times 7$ runs x 4 replicates $= 8 4$ ). The data were calculated against the calibration curve from Day 1. Five native patient serum samples were tested: one negative, two in the equivocal range, and two positive specimens. All samples were tested on all instruments. The results are summarized in the tables below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Four patient serum samples were diluted in EliA Sample Diluent and tested in triplicate with one lot of EliA $\mathrm { S m D ^ { p } }$ immunoassay and one set of system reagents on Phadia 2500/5000. The results of the dilutions were compared with their expected values. The ratio observed/expected $\mathrm { ( O / E ) }$ was calculated. Mean observed value was used in the calculation. The results of the regression analysis are summarized in the tables below:

The reportable range (Limit of Detection to upper limit) for EliA $\mathrm { S m D ^ { p } }$ is from 0.8 to 480 EliA $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ . The measuring range (Limit of Quantitation to upper limit) is from 1.6 to 480 EliA U/mL.

The following statements are included in the package inserts: “Please note that concentration values between LoD and LoQ may show a higher uncertainty.” and “Please note that due to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.”

The hook effect was previously reviewed in K132631.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Same as in the predicate devices. Refer to K132631.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed on a Phadia 2500 instrument. LoB was measured in six assay runs with each run including a blank sample in 12 replicates, giving a total of 72 replicates. LoD was measured in six assay runs by testing five low level serum samples in 12 replicates per sample in a run, giving a total of 360 replicates. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was based on 360 determinations and a precision target of $20 \%$ . The results are summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>EliA SmDP Assau (EliA U/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Phadia 2500/5000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.6</td></tr></table>

e. Analytical specificity:

i) Interference: Interference by endogenous substances was previously reviewed in K132631.

ii) Cross-reactivity: Cross-reactivity was previously reviewed in K132631.

iii) Carry-over:

The Phadia 2500/5000 instruments use disposable tips for pipetting samples and a separate pipette for the conjugate, therefore carry-over from samples to conjugate was not evaluated.

f. Assay cut-off:

The assay cut-offs are the same as in the predicate device and are summarized in the tables below:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: See 2c. Instrument Comparison below.

b. Matrix comparison: Matrix comparison between serum and plasma was reviewed in K132631.

# Instrument comparison:c.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate conformance and show comparability of EliA $\mathrm { S m D ^ { P } }$ on the Phadia 250 instrument versus the Phadia 2500/5000 instrument. A total of 105 samples (75 positive, 15 negative and 15 equivocal) were run in singlicate on one Phadia 250 instrument and three Phadia 2500/5000 instruments for comparison. Only samples inside the measuring range were included in the calculations. Results were analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression and summarized below:
