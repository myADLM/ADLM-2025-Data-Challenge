Re: K183151 Trade/Device Name: Optilite IgA CSF Kit Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.5510 Regulation Name: Immunoglobulins A, G, M, D, and E immunological test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: CFN Dated: November 6, 2018 Received: November 14, 2018

Dear Natasha Verhaak:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (http://www.fda.gov/DICE) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

CLSI EP17-A2 Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline

CLSI EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition

# L. Test Principle:

The determination of soluble antigen concentration by turbidimetric methods involves the reaction with specific antiserum to form insoluble complexes. When light is passed through the suspension formed a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a photodiode by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample. Concentrations are automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was based on CLSI EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Quantitative Measurement Methods. The study was performed over 5 working days, with 2 runs per day. Two users assessed 4 different samples, using 2 reagent lots each on 3 analysers.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed following CLSI Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline (EP6-A). The linearity of this assay has been confirmed using a serially diluted sample over the range of 1.0- $4 4 . 8 \mathsf { m g / L }$ with deviation from linearity $< 1 0 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i) Traceability:

The calibration of the assay is traceable to ERM-DA470k/IFCC.

ii) Kit Stability:

Real-time stability – The Optilite IgA CSF Reagent, Calibrator and Controls have a shelf life of up to 18 months.

Open-vial stability - The Optilite IgA CSF Reagent, Calibrator and Controls can be stored, opened at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ for up to 3 months.

On-board stability – The Optilite IgA CSF Reagent can be stored on-board the Optilite Analyser for up to 30 days.
