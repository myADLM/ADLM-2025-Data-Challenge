# L. Test Principle:

The determination of soluble antigen concentration by turbidimetric methods involves the reaction with specific antiserum to form insoluble complexes. When light is passed through the suspension formed a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a photodiode by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample. Concentrations are automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision studies were based on CLSI EP5-A3 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Quantitative Measurement Methods as was agreed in pre-submission meeting Q171503.

The repeatability and within laboratory study was performed over 20 working days, with 2 runs per day and 2 reps per run. 3 different samples were assessed using 1 reagent lot on 1 analyser.

Repeatability and Within Laboratory Results:

The between instrument precision study was performed over 6 working days. 2 instruments were tested each day, with 2 replicates per instrument. 3 different samples were assessed using 1 reagent lot on a total of 3 different instruments.

Between Instrument Results:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Mean(mg/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>BetweenInstrument</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV %</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.340</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.008</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.994</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.162</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.184</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.288</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.8</td></tr></table>

The between lot precision study was performed over 6 working days. 2 lots were tested each day, with 2 replicates per lot. 3 different samples were assessed using 2 reagent lots on 1 analyser.

Between Lot Results:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Mean(mg/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Between Lot</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV %</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.318</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.009</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.007</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.090</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.236</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.291</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.7</td></tr></table>

The above results do not indicate any change in performance compared to the device cleared in K082129. The precision claims in the product insert therefore still accurately represent the performance of the modified kit and do not need to be amended.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was carried out as per the original submission (K082129) where a dilution series was produced from a high pool with a known concentration of $8 . 6 4 \ : \mathfrak { g } / \mathsf { L }$ and a low pool with a concentration of $0 . 1 5 9 / \mathsf { L }$ . Each diluted sample was tested in six replicates and a linear regression analysis was carried out. The linear regression equation was shown to be $\mathsf { y } =$ $\boldsymbol { 0 . 9 9 0 4 x - 0 . 1 5 8 3 \ : \mathrm { g / L } }$ , with an r value of 0.999.

These results are comparable to those currently presented in the product insert and therefore do not indicate any change in performance compared to the device cleared in K082129. The linearity claims in the product insert therefore still accurately represent the performance of the modified kit and do not need to be amended.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i) Traceability:

The calibration of the assay is traceable to ERM-DA470k/IFCC.

ii) Kit Stability:

Accelerated Stability

Accelerated stability studies were carried out to verify that the stability of the kit is unchanged in accordance with ISO 23640:2015. 6 replicates of controls, internal reference and samples were tested over a period equivalent to 13-months and analysed in line with EP25-A with a maximum allowable difference of $\pm 1 5 \%$ in order to verify the stability claim of 12 months. Reagents were stored at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to accelerate the study by a factor of 10.

Real Time Stability

To further support the results of the accelerated stability testing, a real time stability study is currently being carried out in accordance with EP25-A and as was agreed in pre-submission meeting Q171503.

On Board Stability

On board stability studies were carried out as per the original 510(k) submission and showed no difference in the cleared on board stability claim

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) for this assay is defined as the bottom of the measuring range, $0 . 1 \ 9 / \mathsf L$ at minimum (1/10) sample dilution, which is equivalent to $0 . 2 ~ { \mathfrak { g } } / \mathsf { L }$ at standard (1/20) dilution. The LoQ validation study was based on CLSI EP17-A2 Evaluation of the Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – 2nd Edition in accordance with pre-submission meeting Q171503. Four samples were tested using two reagent lots. The LoQ claim was validated by all the samples reporting within the acceptance criteria of an allowable CV of $10 \%$ .

The limit of detection (LoD) represents the lowest measurable analyte level that can be distinguished from zero, this was estimated as $0 . 0 0 4 ~ { \mathfrak { g } } / \mathsf { L }$ in the original submission and the limit of blank (LoB) was estimated to be $0 . 0 0 1 { \mathfrak { g } } / \mathsf { L }$ . Additional testing was carried out following the antisera change and no change in performance was observed.

The results generated do not indicate any change in performance compared to the device cleared in K082129. The LoB, LoD and LoQ claims in the product insert therefore still accurately represent the performance of the modified kit and do not need to be amended.

e. Analytical specificity:

As per original submission (K082129)

f. Assay cut-off: Not determined

3. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison study was performed by analysing 89 serum samples and 44 plasma samples using the modified IgM Kit for use on the SPAPLus and the unmodified kit which is already commercially available. The study was carried out in accordance with pre-submission meeting Q171503. Bland Altman and Passing Bablok regression analysis generated the following results:

<table><tr><td>Bland Altman Mean Bias</td><td>95% Limits of Agreement</td></tr><tr><td>-2.18%</td><td>-16.55% to 12.18%</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>Predicate Sample Ranges</td><td>Test Samples Ranges</td></tr><tr><td>0.107 - 11.780</td><td>0.116 - 11.066</td></tr></table>

The above results do not indicate any change in performance compared to the device cleared in K082129. The comparison claims in the product insert therefore still accurately represent the performance of the modified kit and do not need to be amended.

b. Matrix comparison:

As per the original submission (K082129), no difference between matrices were observed.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: None determined

b. Clinical specificity:   
None determined   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):   
Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: None determined

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Following the protocol agreed in Q171503, 20 samples from apparently healthy US donors were tested using the modified assay. The acceptance criteria for the transfer is $\leq 2$ samples falling outside of the limits of the reference interval to be transferred.

Of the 20 samples tested, 19 gave results within the reference interval, ranging from 0.364 to $1 . 7 3 6 ~ \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { L }$ . One sample gave a result of $\boldsymbol { 0 . 3 4 8 \ 9 / L }$ , which is on the lower boundary of the reference interval $( 0 . 3 5 { \mathfrak { g } } / \mathsf { L } )$ . The results of this study therefore meet the acceptance criteria and indicate that the reference interval can be transferred from the originally cleared device.

This is further supported by the results of the comparison study. When considering the lower limit of the reference interval, all samples tested gave clinically concordant results.

# N. Proposed Labelling:

The labelling is sufficient, and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

The labelling is the same as the cleared kit and has not been changed.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
