Classification: NXO, Class II

Predicate Device: Calprest ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { \mathsf { N G } }$ (QUANTA Lite® Calprotectin Extended Range ELISA), 510(k) number: K160447

# Intended Use

The ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA is an in vitro diagnostic chemiluminescent assay intended for the quantitative measurement of fecal calprotectin, a neutrophilic protein that is a marker of intestinal mucosal inflammation, in human stool. The ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and as an aid in the differentiation of IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.

The ALPCO Easy Stool Extraction Device is intended for use in the preparation of human stool specimens for testing in the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA.

# Methodology

The ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA is performed on stool samples, collected without preservatives. After an extraction procedure of the stool sample, using either the manual weighing or Easy Extraction Device procedure, the test allows the selective measurement of calprotectin-antigen by sandwich ELISA. A monoclonal capture antibody (mAb) highly specific to the calprotectin heterodimeric and polymeric complexes, respectively, is coated onto the microtiter plate. Calibrators, controls and specimen extracts are incubated. After a washing step, a biotinylated secondary monoclonal detection antibody detects the calprotectin molecules bound to the antibody coated onto the plate. After incubation and a further washing step, a Streptavidin-Horseradish Peroxidase Enzyme conjugate binds to the available biotin on the immobilized secondary antibody. A chemiluminescent substrate is added and read when the substrate glows as a result of its oxidation with the enzyme. The signal is then read on a chemiluminescent plate reader.

# Analytical Sensitivity Studies

# Limit of Blank (LoB)

The limit of blank of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Four blank stool samples were extracted and tested in replicates of six on two reagent lots across three days. The LoB was determined to be $3 . 6 ~ \mu \ g / \ g$ by the nonparametric method.

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

The limit of detection of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Four stool samples containing a low level of calprotectin were extracted and tested in replicates of five on two reagent lots across three days. The LoD was determined to be $7 . 7 \mu \mathrm { g } / \bar { \theta }$ by the parametric method.

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The limit of quantitation of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Six stool samples containing a low level of calprotectin were extracted and tested in replicates of five on two reagent lots across three days. The mean and within laboratory precision were calculated for each sample for each reagent lot. For each reagent lot, the observed precision $( \% C \backslash I )$ (Y-axis) was plotted vs. the sample calprotectin concentration (X-axis) to give a precision profile, and fit by a constant variance function using Analyse-it Method Validation edition. The LoQ estimate for each reagent lot was determined as the measurand concentration at the intersection of the precision profile curve with the accuracy goal of $2 0 \% C V$ . The LoQ was determined to be $7 . 9 \mu \mathrm { g } / \bar { \theta }$ .

# Linearity

The matrix linearity and aqueous linearity of the analytical measuring range of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA were evaluated internally at ALPCO in accordance with CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. To evaluate matrix linearity, a stool sample extract containing a high concentration of fecal calprotectin was serially diluted 1:2 with a stool sample extract containing a low concentration of fecal calprotectin to obtain dilution levels with values that cover the entire AMR. Stool sample extracts were obtained using the Easy Extraction method. Each stool sample extract combination was assayed in duplicate in a single analysis using one reagent lot of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA. To evaluate aqueous linearity, a sample made by diluting native antigen in standard diluent buffer containing stabilizers and preservatives (the same buffer used to make the controls and calibrators) was serially diluted 1:2 with standard diluent buffer to obtain dilution levels with values that cover the entire AMR. Each aqueous sample dilution was assayed in duplicate in a single analysis using one reagent lot of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA. Results were analyzed using Analyse-it Method Validation edition to determine the best fitting polynomial. For linearity to be claimed, the best fitting polynomial had to be linear (first order) or the difference between the best fitting nonlinear polynomial (second or third order) and the linear polynomial could not exceed $\pm 1 5 \%$ . The plots were further analyzed by linear regression. The slope and y-intercept, and the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals thereof, and ${ \mathsf { R } } ^ { 2 }$ of the regression analysis were calculated. In addition, the recovery of each replicate value included in the regression analysis for the linearity dilutions was calculated and the average recovery was calculated. Acceptance criteria were met, the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA is acceptably linear over the analytical measuring range. The results are as follows:

# Accuracy/Recovery

The accuracy/recovery of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA was evaluated using seven (7) extracted stool samples containing various concentrations of calprotectin across the analytical measuring range of the assay, samples were extracted using the Easy Extraction method. Native calprotectin diluted in standard diluent was used as the spiking material. The stool sample extracts were mixed with the spiking material in a proportion of 9:1 (9 parts sample:1 part spiking material) to calculate recovery: Samples with calprotectin concentrations lower than $2 0 0 \mu \ g / \ g$ were spiked with $4 2 . 8 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ . Samples with calprotectin concentrations higher than $2 0 0 ~ { \mu \ g } / { \ g }$ were spiked with $1 2 9 . 3 ~ \mu \varrho / \varrho$ . Each baseline sample extract, control spike and spiked sample were tested in duplicate in the same assay run. Recovery was calculated compared to the baseline result and acceptance criteria were met.

# Stool Sample Extraction Method Comparison

The extraction methods of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA were evaluated internally at ALPCO to determine if the extraction methods provide similar results. The study was performed using one (1) kit lot of ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA by one (1) operator. Sixty-eight (68) stool samples varying in consistency and containing various fecal calprotectin concentrations over a significant fraction of reportable range and near the clinical cut-offs of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA were extracted in parallel using both the Easy Extraction method and manual weighing method. Each resultant stool sample extract was analyzed in singlicate. 61 of the samples were within the AMR of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA and included in the analysis. A scatter plot was created by plotting the values obtained from the Easy Extraction method extracts (Y-axis) against the manual weighing method extracts (X-axis) and analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression analysis using Analyse-it Method Validation Edition. The Y-Intercept, slope, and bootstrap $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals thereof, and correlation r were calculated. The results are as follows:

# Comparison with Predicate Device

A method comparison study was performed comparing the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA and the predicate device. 400 samples that were used to determine the clinical performance characteristics of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA were tested on the predicate device according to the manufacturer-supplied labeling.

A qualitative agreement analysis between the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA and the predicate device was conducted including all samples that were tested on both devices $( N = 4 0 0 )$ using the cut-offs of both products to calculate the positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and total percent agreement (TPA), and $9 5 \%$ CIs (Wilson score method) thereof considering equivocal results as both positive and negative. The results are as follows:

# Clinical Performance

The estimates of clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA were determined by comparing analytical test results of the prospectively collected stool specimens against the clinical diagnosis made by the clinical investigator/gastroenterologist (reference standard):

• IBD diagnosis was based on endoscopy results and/or histology of biopsies taken during the endoscopy.   
• IBS diagnosis was based on the Rome IV criteria and confirmed by negative endoscopy including the colon and terminal ileum.   
• Subjects were diagnosed with “Other GI conditions” when they did not meet the diagnostic criteria for IBD or IBS (Rome IV).

# Expected Values

To verify the low clinical cut-off value $( 5 0 ~ \mu \ g / \ g )$ , normal stool samples were obtained from asymptomatic individuals with no abdominal complaints and no history of IBS, IBD or other chronic intestinal disorders; this study cohort was separate from those used to establish estimates of the clinical performance of the test device. The expected result for the “normal”/asymptomatic population is $< 5 0 ~ \mu \ g / \ g$ (normal). Calprotectin levels were analyzed using the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA on 131 samples obtained from apparently healthy individuals with the following demographics:

• Gender: 65 females / 66 males • Age: 22 to 82 years old, mean age 42.4 years

With a cut-off of $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g } , ~ 1 3 0 / 1 3 1$ of the samples were normal/negative with the ALPCO Calprotectin Chemiluminescence ELISA. Values ranged from $< 7 . 9 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g }$ to $7 5 . 1 \mu \mathrm { g } / \bar { \varrho } .$ , with 86/131 samples measuring below the lower end of the AMR. The $90 \%$ confidence intervals for the lower and upper $9 5 \%$ reference limits of the 131 healthy individuals were determined by the nonparametric quantile method, $( \mathsf { N } { + } \mathsf { 1 } ) \mathsf { p }$ in accordance with CLSI EP28-A3c, Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory, $3 ^ { r d }$ Edition using Analyse-it Method Validation Edition. The results are as follows:

Lower Limit $( 9 0 \% \thinspace \mathsf { C l } ) : 0 . 7 \mu \mathrm { g } / \xi \left( 0 . 5 - 0 . 9 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g } \right)$ Upper Limit $( 9 0 \% \mathsf { C l } ) \colon 3 7 . 7 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g } \left( 3 0 . 9 - 7 5 . 1 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { g } \right)$
