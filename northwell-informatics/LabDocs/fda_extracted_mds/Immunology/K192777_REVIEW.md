Lite Reagent: $5 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ monoclonal mouse anti-DF3 antibody labeled with acridinium ester in buffered saline with bovine serum albumin (BSA), sodium azide $( < 0 . 1 \% )$ , and preservatives. • Solid Phase Reagent: $2 5 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ monoclonal mouse capture antibody covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in buffer with BSA, sodium azide $( < 0 . 1 \% )$ , and preservatives. Conjugate Reagent: $5 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ monoclonal mouse anti-115D8 antibody labeled with a thiocarbamate of fluorescein in buffered saline with BSA and preservatives.

# B Principle of Operation:

The ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 assay is a fully automated, two-step sandwich immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology. The Lite Reagent is composed of the monoclonal mouse antibody, DF3, specific for CA 15-3, labeled with acridinium ester. The Conjugate Reagent is composed of the monoclonal mouse antibody 115D8, specific for CA15-3, labeled with fluorescein.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: The precision and reproducibility of the assay were demonstrated in K012357.

2. Linearity:

The linearity of the assay was demonstrated in K012357.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Analytical specificity/interference were demonstrated in K012357

4. Assay Reportable Range: The claimed measuring range is from $3 . 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ to $2 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): The traceability and stability were established in K012357.

6. Detection Limit:

The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 were determined according to the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.

LoB was determined by testing six analyte free samples in replicates of five per run, two run per day, for six days on one ADVIA Centaur XP system using two lots of reagents. The LoB was estimated as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of 360 measurements for each of the lots tested and determined to be $0 . 6 2 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ and $0 . 8 2 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ for the two lots. The claimed LoB is $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { U / m L }$

LoD was determined using 10 serum samples with low CA15-3 concentrations. Each sample was tested in five replicates per run, two runs per day, for six days on one ADVIA Centaur XP system using two lots of reagents. The LoD was calculated as the $\mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { \bf x }$ SD of the replicates for the low-level samples and determined as $0 . 9 6 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and $1 . 0 3 \mathrm { ~ U } / \mathrm { m L }$ for the two lots. The claimed LoD is $2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

LoQ was determined using a set of 10 serum samples. Each sample was tested in five replicates per run, two runs per day, for six days with two reagent lots on one ADVIA Centaur XP system for a total of 60 data points per sample per reagent lot. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the specification for the total withinlaboratory imprecision $\leq 2 0 \%$ CV. The results supports that the claimed LoQ is $3 . 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ which is the lower limit of the measuring range claimed for the assay.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device: Not applicable

2. Matrix Comparison:

To demonstrate that Li-Heparin plasma and K2-EDTA plasma samples yield results comparable with serum samples by the ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 assay, a study was performed by using 129 serum/K2-EDTA plasma paired samples and 108 serum/Li-heparin plasma paired samples. Paired samples were each tested in singleton with one reagent lot on one ADVIA Centaur XP system. The Demining regression analysis was performed, and the results are summarized in the following table:
