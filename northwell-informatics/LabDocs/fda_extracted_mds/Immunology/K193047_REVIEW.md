as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM) on the BN Systems and Atellica CH Analyzer, as an aid in the diagnosis of amyloidosis (AL) on the BN Systems and Atellica CH Analyzer, as an aid in the evaluation of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) on the BN Systems.

Results of FLC measurements should always be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Warning: The result of the FLC Kappa or FLC Lambda in a given specimen determined with assays and or instrument platforms from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the FLC Kappa or FLC Lambda assay used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably.

# Precaution:

The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa and lambda has not been thoroughly studied in IgM and Light Chain MGUS patients due to the low prevalence of these subtypes. Patients with decreased renal function may have elevated FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda. Sample populations excluded MGUS populations that were further diagnosed with a disease/disorder in subsequent testing with another medical device such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, because the samples were enriched the specificity of the test may be inflated.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

BN II (K943997) and BN ProSpec Systems (K001647)

# A Device Description:

# B Principle of Operation:

No modification is made to the principle of operation for the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda cleared in K171742 and K182098.

The N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays are based upon the principles of particle-enhanced immunoassay. Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to human free light chains, type kappa or lambda, respectively, are agglutinated when mixed with samples containing kappa and lambda free light chains. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# C Clinical Studies:

Clinical performance of the N Latex FLC kappa assay and the N Latex FLC lambda assay as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma, and as an aid in the diagnosis of amyloidosis was previously demonstrated in K171742 and K182098.

MGUS is a clinically asymptomatic premalignant clonal plasma cell or lymphoplasmacytic proliferative disorder. The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa assay and the N Latex FLC lambda assay as an aid in the evaluation of MGUS was investigated from the following retrospective clinical studies:

# Study 1:

A retrospective study was performed by testing a total of 121 samples from clinically confirmed MGUS patients (with IFE positivity) and a total of 102 samples from clinically defined nonMGUS patients with polyclonal immunostimulation (confirmed with SPEP/SIFE). The result of the device was compared to the clinical diagnosis for each sample.

The cohort of 121 MGUS samples included 89 Non-IgM MGUS, $2 1 \ \mathrm { I g M }$ MGUS, and 11 light chain (LC) MGUS. All samples were tested for FLC kappa and lambda levels with N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays on BN II analyzer. FLC $\kappa / \lambda$ ratios were also calculated for each sample. The test result for MGUS positive or negative were based on the following criteria:

For Non-LC MGUS, the test was considered as “MGUS Positive” or “Abnormal” when abnormal FLC $\kappa / \lambda$ ratio (outside reference interval, i.e., $< 0 . 5 3$ or ${ > } 1 . 5 1$ ) with IFE positivity was determined. For LC MGUS, the test was considered as “MGUS Positive” when abnormal FLC $\kappa / \lambda$ ratio (outside reference interval, i.e., $< 0 . 5 3$ or ${ > } 1 . 5 1$ ) with elevated FLC kappa $( > 2 8 . 9$ $\mathrm { m g / L ) }$ or elevated FLC lambda FLC $( > 3 2 . 6 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ was determined.

Sixty-one (61) out of 121 MGUS cases were tested positive by the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assay with a positive rate of $5 0 . 4 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $4 1 . 2 \substack { - 5 9 . 6 \% }$ . The distribution of the cohort and the positivity rate for each clinical type of MGUS are summarized in the following table:

The 102 samples from patients with confirmed non-MGUS polyclonal stimulation (polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia) were comprised of chronic inflammation or infection (55); autoimmune diseases (12); cardiovascular diseases (13); cancer (4); liver diseases (2); respiratory diseases (5); GI related diseases (3); and other diseases/conditions (8). Ninety-two (92) out of 102 of these non-MGUS samples were also determined as negative by the $_ \mathrm { N }$ Latex FLC kappa and lambda assay, indicating a negative agreement of $9 0 . 2 \%$ b $9 5 \%$ CI: $8 2 . 7 { - } 9 5 . 2 \% )$ in this sample cohort. The 10 false positive samples were from patients with the following disorders: polyclonal increase in the gamma globulin; Sjogren’s syndrome; liver-related disease; hypervolemia; spinal cord injury; heart failure and nodular prostatic hyperplasia.

# Limitation

In this study, sample populations excluded MGUS populations that were further diagnosed with a disease/disorder in subsequent testing with another medical device such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, because the samples were enriched the specificity of the test in the study may be inflated. Risk mitigation strategies include use of the device in conjunction with other tests such as serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation blood tests. The labeling also included this limitation.

# Study 2:

Another retrospective study was performed by testing 61 subjects with clinically stable MGUS and four subjects with progressive clinical status converting from MGUS to multiple myeloma (MM). Among 61 MGUS stable subjects, 50 patients were diagnosed with non-IgM MGUS (33 $\mathrm { I g G K }$ , nine IgG L, six IgA K, and two IgA L), eight patients with IgM MGUS (seven IgM K and one $\mathrm { I g M L }$ ), and three patients with LC MGUS (two kappa and one lambda). All four subjects with progressive disease status were initially diagnosed with non-IgM MGUS (one IgG K, one $\mathrm { I g G L }$ , one IgA K, and one IgA L).

At least four serial draws were collected from each patient and tested with the N Latex kappa and lambda assays. FLC $\kappa / \lambda$ ratio was calculated for even blood draw samples. Since the MGUS has been identified as a precursor to malignant diseases (multiple myeloma or amyloidosis), but not as a disease which requires treatment, no defined criteria in how to interpret consecutive FLC results are available. Therefore, for device evaluation purposes only, the criteria for stable MGUS and progressive MGUS based on test results in this study is defined as follows:

For stable MGUS, FLC $\kappa / \lambda$ ratio must be within the reference interval of 0.53 – 1.51 at the time of the last draw AND a relative change of the involved FLC (iFLC) is $< 2 5 \%$ for two consecutive assessments.   
For progressive MGUS, the FLC $\kappa / \lambda$ ratio is outside of the reference interval ${ \mathrm { \check { \it e } } } 0 . 5 3$ or ${ > } 1 . 5 1 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ ) AND a relative change of the involved FLC (iFLC) is $23 \%$ for two consecutive assessments.

Sixty (60) out of 61 clinically stable MGUS subjects were determined as stable by the test and three out of four clinically progressive subjects were determined as progressive by the test.

# Limitation

The study included time points of blood draws not indicative of clinical practice. Also, the algorithm using only FLC had not been validated for progression of disease. Furthermore, a small sample size (4 patients) with only one subtype (i.e., non-IgM MGUS) was used to study progression in this study. Risk mitigation strategies include that this test is not a stand-alone test for the evaluation of patients with MGUS and the test is to be utilized in conjunction with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation blood tests.
