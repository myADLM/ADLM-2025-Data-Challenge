# A Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur Total IgE (tIgE) reagent kit contains the following:

ADVIA Centaur Total IgE Ready Pack primary reagent pack consist of the ADVIA Centaur tIgE Lite Reagent and Solid Phase Reagents:

• Lite Reagent: $5 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ /pack of goat anti-human IgE antibody $( \sim 2 . 4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) labeled with acridinium ester in buffer with sodium azide $( 0 . 1 2 \% )$ , protein stabilizers, and preservatives. Solid Phase Reagent: 22.5 mL/pack of mouse anti-human IgE antibody $( { \sim } 0 . 0 2 \ \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in buffer with protein stabilizers, sodium azide $( 0 . 1 1 \% )$ , and preservatives.

Materials Required but not provided

• ADVIA Centaur Calibrator 80 consists of low and high levels of human IgE in equine serum and preservatives.

Optional Reagents

ADVIA Centaur IgE Master Curve Material (MCM) consists of MCM 1 that is lyophilized human plasma with sodium azide $0 . 1 \%$ after reconstitution) and preservatives, and MCM 2- 7 that are various levels of IgE in lyophilized human plasma with sodium azide $0 . 1 \%$ after reconstitution) and preservatives.

• ADVIA Centaur IgE Diluent consist of IgE-free human plasma with sodium azide $( 0 . 1 \% )$ .

# B Principle of Operation:

The ADVIA Centaur Total IgE (tIgE) assay is a fully automated, two-site sandwich immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology. The sample is incubated with both the Lite and Solid Phase Reagents simultaneously for 7.5 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After incubation, the immuno-complex is washed, and the Acid Reagent and Base Reagent are added to initiate the chemiluminescent reaction. A direct relationship exists between the amount of total IgE present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: The precision and reproducibility of the assay were demonstrated in K920372.

2. Linearity: The linearity of the assay was demonstrated in K920372.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The analytical specificity was demonstrated in in K920372.

Interference was evaluated with hemoglobin, triglycerides and bilirubin in K920372. To evaluate the performance of the ADVIA Centaur Total IgE (tIgE) assay in the presence of K2-EDTA and lithium heparin, one sample at low and one at high level of tIgE for each matrix were used to titrate the EDTA and heparin anticoagulants in order to simulate the effect of partially filled blood collection plasma tube. The nominal K2-EDTA and lithium heparin concentrations are $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ and $1 5 . 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ in blood collection tubes, respectively. Both K2-EDTA and lithium heparin were spiked at three times and five times the additive concentration for testing. Testing was performed in six replicates per sample on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using one lot of reagent. The recovery was calculated as the difference between the means of the test samples spiked with the interferent and control samples spiked with the same volume of the interferent vehicle. Results summarized in the table below show no significant assay interference was demonstrated with K2-EDTA and lithium heparin at the indicated test concentrations.

4. Assay Reportable Range: The claimed measuring range is from $2 . 5 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): The traceability and reagent stability were established in K920372.

6. Detection Limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation for the ADVIA Centaur Total IgE (tIgE) assay were determined in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.

The LoB was determined using two lots of reagents and one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument. For lot 1, four analyte-free serum samples were tested in five replicates per sample, two runs per day for five days to obtain a total of 240 replicates. For lot 2, five analyte-free serum samples were tested in five replicates per sample, two runs per day for five days, to obtain a total of 300 replicates. The LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile of the measurements for each of the lots tested and determined to be $0 . 6 9 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $0 . 2 8 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ for the two lots of reagents. The claimed LoB is $1 . 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

The LoD was determined using 10 patient serum pools with low analyte levels. Each sample was tested in five replicates per run, two runs per day, for six days on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using two lots of reagents. A total of 605 replicates was obtained for reagent lot 1 and 557 replicates for reagent lot 2. The LoD was calculated as the $\mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { \bf ~ x }$ SD of the replicates for the low-level samples and determined as $1 . 2 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $1 . 2 1 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ for the two lots of reagents. The claimed LoD is $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

The LoQ was determined using 10 serum samples comprised of patient pools with low analyte levels. Each sample was tested in six replicates per run, two runs per day, for five days on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using two lots of reagents. A total of 600 replicates was obtained for reagent lot 1 and 420 replicates for reagent lot 2. The LoQ, defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the specification for the total withinlaboratory imprecision $\leq 2 0 \%$ CV is $1 . 6 4 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $1 . 7 5 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ for the two lots of reagents. The claimed LoQ is $2 . 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ which is the lower limit of the measuring range claimed for the assay.
