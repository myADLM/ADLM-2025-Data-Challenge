Dear Mey Lyn Vasquez:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part

801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

# 9. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS DATA

# Detection Capability

Detection capability was determined in accordance with CLSI Document EP17-A2.11

Limit of Blank (LoB) 0.50 ng/mL (μg/L) Limit of Detection (LoD) 1.00 ng/mL (μg/L) Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) 2.00 ng/mL (μg/L)

The LoB corresponds to the highest measurement likely to be observed for a blank sample with a probability of $9 5 \%$

The LoD corresponds to the lowest concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen that can be detected with a probability of $9 5 \%$

The LoQ corresponds to the lowest amount of carcinoembryonic antigen in a sample at which the within laboratory CV is $\leq 2 0 \%$

# Precision

Cleared under premarket submission k981478

# Method Comparison

Method comparison data and regression analysis was revised in k200215.

# Accuracy / Method Comparison

For 201 samples in the range of 2.00 to $7 8 . 9 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L ( \mu g / L ) }$ , the relationship between the ADVIA Centaur CEA assay and the ACS:180 CEA assay is described by the equation:

ADVIA Centaur $\mathsf { C E A } = 0 . 9 7 \ ( \mathsf { A C S } ; 1 8 0 \ \mathsf { C E A } ) + 0 . 1 1 \ \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ Correlation coefficient $( \mathsf { r } ) = 1 . 0 0$

# Specimen Equivalence

Specimen equivalency was determined using the Deming linear regression model in accordance with CLSI Document EP09‑A3. The following results were obtained:   

<table><tr><td>Tube (y) vs. Serum (x)</td><td>N a</td><td>Sample Interval</td><td>Slope</td><td>Intercept</td><td>rb</td></tr><tr><td>Dipotassium EDTA plasma</td><td>64</td><td>2.08-97.10 ng/mL (μg/L)</td><td>0.95</td><td>0.20 ng/mL (μg/L)</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Lithium heparin plasma</td><td>46</td><td>2.11-97.10 ng/mL (μg/L)</td><td>0.99</td><td>0.19 ng/mL (μg/L)</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>a Number of samples tested. b Correlation coefficient.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

The assay is designed to have a slope of 0.90–1.10 for alternate tube types versus serum.

Agreement of the specimen types may vary depending on the study design and sample population used. Assay results obtained at individual laboratories may vary from the data presented.

# X. CONCLUSION

Comparative testing of the ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CEA assay is substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the Predicate Device – ADVIA Centau $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CEA assay cleared under 510(k) K981478.
