C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The ImmunoCAP system is a fully integrated and automated system for the determination of specific IgE in human blood serum or plasma samples. It is comprised of general, and test- and method-specific reagents for Phadia test system modules, as well as instrument and data management software.

The general ImmunoCAP reagents include ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Conjugate, ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Curve Control, ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators, Specific IgE anti-IgE ImmunoCAP, Allergen ImmunoCAP carriers, ImmunoCAP development solution and stop solution. The method-specific reagents consist of individual purified allergens (native or recombinant) covalently coupled to a support in a plastic housing.

# B Principle of Operation:

The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific IgE in the patient sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more

specific IgE is present in the specimen. The fluorescence results are converted to $\mathrm { \hbar ^ { 6 } k U _ { A } / L }$ ’ concentrations by the software with the use of a calibration curve.

# 2. Linearity:

The linearity of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal was assessed following CLSI guideline $\mathrm { I } / \mathrm { L A } { - } 2 0 \ 3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ Edition. Three positive samples were each diluted to generate at least six 2-fold consecutive dilutions. Undiluted samples were tested in 12 replicates and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run on the Phadia 250 instrument according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use using one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215 reagent. Results of the replicates from all three samples were analyzed for linearity. Regression statistics comparing the observed results to expected results are presented below:

The claimed assay range of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal is 0.1 to $8 6 . 3 \mathrm { ~ k U _ { A } / L }$

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

# i) Inhibition studies:

Immunological specificity of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal was verified by performing competitive inhibition studies in accordance with $\mathrm { I } / \mathrm { L A } { - } 2 0 \ 3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ Edition. A positive sample with known concentration of IgE specific to allergen component o215 $( 4 . 8 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } )$ was tested. Equal volumes of the positive sample and varying serial dilutions of the specific allergen component o215 in solution were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for two hours before being analyzed with ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal on the Phadia 250 according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use. The testing was performed in duplicate in one assay run. Mean values (in $\mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ ) were calculated. The inhibition values in $\%$ were calculated according to the formula below:

$$
\left( 1 - \left( \frac { r - b } { t - b } \right) \right) \times 1 0 0 = \dot { \ i } \%
$$

${ \bf r } =$ concentration $[ \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } ]$   
${ \mathfrak { b } } =$ background concentration ( $100 \%$ inhibition) $[ \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } ]$   
$\mathbf { t } =$ total concentration ( $0 \%$ inhibition) $[ \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L } ]$   
$\dot { 1 } =$ inhibition

Results from the dose-dependent inhibition study showed that $5 5 0 \%$ inhibition was achieved with the specific allergen component o215 in solution at a concentration of 6.5 $\mathsf { p m o l } / \mu \mathrm { L }$ .

To further evaluate the immunological specificity of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alphaGal, three allergens from different or unrelated allergen groups [nGal d 1 (ovomucoid), Pla l 1 (Plantain) and rPhl p 11 (grass pollen)] and one allergen from the same or related allergen group [cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD)] were tested at doses that are 10-fold or higher than the specific allergen component concentration that yielded

$5 5 0 \%$ inhibition. None of the allergens tested show any significant inhibition. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen o215 solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen component.

# ii) Interference:

# a) Endogenous Substance Interference:

Interferences were assessed by testing two positive samples and one negative sample. Each sample was spiked with the interfering substances or substance-specific diluents and analyzed in four replicates in one assay run using the Phadia 250 according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use. The data demonstrated that ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal was not adversely affected by high levels of the following substances up to the concentrations listed in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Inte rfe re nt</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No inhibition up to the tested concentrations</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin, unconjugated</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>327.0 μmol/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin, conjugated</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>363.0 μmol/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Chyle</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1610.0 FTU (Formazine Turbidity Units)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.9 g/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Rheumatoid factor</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>550 IU/mL</td></tr></table>

# b) Exogenous Substance Interference:

Two literature references were provided supporting the claim that commonly prescribed allergy medications do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE (omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox et. al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/ American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 2008; 101:580-592.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

The claimed measuring range is from 0.1 to $8 6 . 3 \mathrm { ~ k U _ { A } / L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

i) Traceability:

The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the 2nd International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 or the equivalent 3rd International Standard 11/234 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).

ii) Kit Stability:

A real-time stability study was performed using three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal in accordance with CLSI EP25-A to demonstrate shelf-life stability (from the date of manufacture). The stability data support 24 months unopened shelf-life stability.

The studies to determine the stability of the calibration curve calibrators, real-time, and on-board stability of ImmunoCAP IgE calibrator are described in K100999.

6. Detection Limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were determined on the Phadia 250 in alignment with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2 using two lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal.

The LoB was determined by testing five blank samples in three runs with five replicates per run to yield a total of 75 replicates per lot for all samples. The LoB was estimated as the $9 5 \%$ percentile of the distribution and determined as $0 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ and $0 . 0 1 3 \mathrm { ~ k U _ { A } / L }$ for the two lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal. The claimed LoB is $0 . 0 1 3 \mathrm { ~ k U _ { A } / L }$ .

The LoD was determined by testing five low positive samples in three runs with five replicates to yield a total of 75 replicates per lot for all samples. The LoD was calculated according to the equation: $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + \mathrm { c } \mathrm { B } \bullet \mathrm { S D L o D }$ , where SDLoD is the pooled SD for the samples, and determined as $0 . 0 2 1 \mathrm { ~ k U _ { A } / L }$ and $0 . 0 2 5 \mathrm { ~ k U _ { A } / L }$ for the two lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal. The claimed LoD is $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ .

The LoQ was estimated as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the specification for the total within-laboratory imprecision $\leq 2 0 \%$ CV. The LoQ was determined as $0 . 0 2 5 \mathrm { ~ k U _ { A } / L }$ and $0 . 0 3 4 ~ \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ for the two lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal. The precision profile supports the LoQ claim of $0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ which is the lower limit of the measuring range claimed for ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal.

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

Limit of Quantitation for ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ . All results $> 0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ are interpreted as being analytically positive.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device: Refer to clinical studies.

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

To demonstrate that $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA plasma samples yield results comparable with serum samples by the ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal, a study was performed by using 40 serum/K2-

EDTA plasma paired samples. None of the samples were contrived. Paired samples were each tested according to ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use in one replicate in one assay run on one Phadia 250 instrument using one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alphaGal. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed, and the results are summarized in the following table:

# C Clinical Studie s:

# 1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

Serum samples from 200 patients presenting to the University of Virginia Allergy Clinic with urticaria, anaphylaxis, or other symptoms following intake of red meat, were evaluated retrospectively (Study Group A: Allergic to red meat). Sixty allergic individuals without known alpha-Gal mediated red meat hypersensitivity were included as atopic controls in the study. Of these, 30 presented known allergies to foods, including animal-derived foods other than red meat (Study Group B: Atopic controls/ Other foods), and 30 were allergic to airborne allergens (Study Group C: Atopic controls/ Inhalants). Additionally, samples from 50 individuals, with no history of allergic disease and no evidence of atopic sensitization (Study Group D: Non-atopic controls), were analyzed.

Among the patients with a red meat hypersensitivity (Group A), $9 7 . 5 \%$ (195/200) were found to be sensitized to alpha-Gal as measured by ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal. Consistent with the ubiquitous presence of alpha-Gal in non-primate mammals, more than $7 5 \%$ of these patients also had specific IgE to other animal allergens tested: $9 8 \%$ were sensitized to beef (f27), $78 \%$ to cat dander (e1), $8 6 \%$ to dog dander (e5), $94 \%$ to pork (f26) and $9 3 \%$ to cow’s milk (f2). Consistent with the absence of alpha-Gal in non-mammalian animals, only $5 \%$ and $1 8 \%$ were sensitized to chicken (f83) and egg white (f1), respectively. Among the atopic controls (Study Groups B and C), $1 6 . 7 \%$ were sensitized to alpha-Gal. None of the non-atopic controls in Study Group D showed sensitization either to alpha-Gal or beef.

In total, 195 of 200 patients with a red meat hypersensitivity had specific IgE antibodies to alpha-Gal, corresponding to a clinical sensitivity of $9 7 . 5 \%$ . Of the 110 control subjects (60 atopic and 50 non-atopic), 10 (five food allergic subjects and five inhalant allergic subjects) were

sensitized to alpha-Gal. Clinical performance, sensitivity (Se) and specificity $( \mathsf { S p } )$ was calculated based on the detection limit of $0 . 1 \mathrm { k U _ { A } / L }$ . The results are summarized in the following table:

The specificity obtained from the atopic controls $( 8 3 . 3 \% )$ agrees with previous random cohort studies indicating that $1 5 \%$ or more of the general U.S. population is sensitized to alpha-Gal 1-3.
