# Test Principle

The EliA tests are fluorescence immunoassays for the detection and measurement of human antibodies based on EliA solid-phase components, which contain specific antigens for the antibodies to be measured.

The specific antigen for the antibodies to be detected is bound to the EliA solid phase component (EliA Well). The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. They are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen. The wells are at the same time a holder of the coupled antigen for convenient automation and a reaction chamber with reaction/washing solution handling based on pipetting to add and aspiration to remove liquids. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to these proteins bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The assay directly measures the amount of antibody of interest bound to the antigen coating the EliA well, therefore the higher the value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

# Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical performance:

a) Precision/Reproducibility:

To determine the precision of the assay on the Phadia 250 instrument and the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instrument series, the variability was assessed on 5 samples.

Three lots were used to determine the precision of the assay on Phadia 250 (totaling 252 replicate determinations per sample).

One lot was used to determine the precision of the assay on Phadia 2500E, which is a representative of the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instrument series.

# EliA Rib-P on Phadia 250:

To determine the precision of the assay on the Phadia 250 instrument, the variability was assessed in a study with 21 runs by examining the samples in 252 replicates across 3 lots and 3 Phadia 250 instruments over 7 days.

Linearity was shown for the entire measuring range.

# Hook Effect/Over the Range Results:

Not applicable. Results above the upper limit of the measuring range are reported as $" > 4 0 3 "$ . No recommendations are made for dilution of samples outside measuring range in the Directions For Use.

c) Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): Traceability:

The IgG calibrators are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. New batches of IgG calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.

The instrument measures specific IgG concentrations in $\mu \ g / \mathsf { L }$ . By using a conversion factor given by the lot-specific code of the EliA test well, the results are automatically converted to EliA U/mL.

# Stability:

Data for open and closed real-time stability and on-board stability of EliA IgG reagents and general EliA reagents on Phadia 250 as well as on the Emodule of the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 series were already cleared with several other EliA tests, e.g. under K141375 (EliA M2 on Phadia 250). For the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 instrument series, they were already cleared under K061165/A003 (EliA CCP).

# Shelf-life:

The stability of EliA Rib-P Wells was evaluated with a real-time study. The results support stability of the test under the recommended storage of 2 – $8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for up to 36 months.

# On-board stability:

The on-board stability EliA Rib-P carriers (containing the antigen coated wells) was tested over 8 weeks using 3 positive and 2 negative samples only on the Phadia 250 instrument. As the storage conditions in the Emodule of the Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000 series are similar to the Phadia 250, the results can also be used for stability claims for these instruments. The on-board stability for the Phadia 250 was determined to be 28 days at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ .

# Open Stability:

Stability after first opening of the foil bag containing the EliA Rib-P wells was tested with a real-time study. According to this study, a shelf-life of 9 months at ${ 2 / 8 } ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ after first opening can be assigned to EliA Rib-P wells.

# d) Detection Limit:

Four blank and four low level samples were measured with two different reagent sets (two lots of antigen wells). The four blank samples were created from depleted IgG sera, each diluted with EliA Sample Diluent. The blank samples and the low-level samples were assayed in three runs using two different sets of EliA Rib-P Well lots over three different days on a Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E each in 5-fold determination.

For each instrument type, the total number of combined observations for blank and low-level samples is 120 (60 per reagent set, 15 per sample and reagent set).

The results are summarized in the table below:   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Instrument</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoBEliA U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoDEliA U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQEliA U/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Phadia 250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>E-module of the Phadia 2500and Phadia 5000 series</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.1</td></tr></table>

A harmonized LoB of 0.1 EliA $\cup / \mathsf { m L }$ , LoD of 0.5 EliA $\mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ , and LoQ of 1.9 EliA U/mL for the immunoassay was used.

The LoD for EliA Rib-P is 0.5 EliA $\mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ , determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI document EP17-A2 and with proportions of false positives (α) less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 240 determinations with 120 blank and 120 low-level replicates per instrument type; and LoB of 0.1 EliA $\cup / \mathsf { m L }$ .

# e) Analytical specificity:

Endogenous and Exogenous Interference:

A study was run to investigate whether high concentrations of potentially interfering substances in serum, like bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipemic factor, rheumatoid factor, Ibuprofen, Losartan, Hydroxychloroquine, Azathioprine, Prednisone, Rituximab and Infliximab adversely affect the results of the new device.

Three serum samples (one negative sample, one sample with a concentration within the equivocal range, and one high positive sample) were prediluted in EliA Sample Diluent and spiked with the different interfering substances or blank solution. The samples were tested in triplicates. A calibration curve was run in duplicate. The runs were repeated twice. One batch of EliA antigen wells and one batch of system reagents were used throughout the studies.

The ratio of blank/spiked sample ranged from 0.90 – 1.10 for EliA Rib-P. No interference was observed up to the concentrations listed in the table below:

# Reference Sera:

Externally defined sera should be measured according to their target values as mentioned by the institution CDC. Using EliA Rib-P, all 12 CDC samples were found according to their target.

# f) Assay Cut-Off:

To define the cut-off, a study was performed using a cohort consisting of 70 apparently healthy blood donors and 30 samples from SLE patients. The samples were measured on a Phadia 250 instrument.

The cut-off was set as follows for EliA Rib-P:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;7 EliA U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7-10EliAU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Equivocal</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt;10EliA U/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td></tr></table>

In case of equivocal results, it is recommended to retest the patient after 8- 12 weeks.

2. Comparison Studies:

a) Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A total of 323 patient samples with concentrations covering the measuring range were tested.

b) Other Clinical Supportive Data: Not applicable.

4. Clinical Cut-Off: Same as assay cut-off.

5. Expected Values/Reference Range:

Antibody prevalence in autoimmune patients varies widely depending on disease area. The proportion of sera from a normal population found positive for the antinuclear antibodies covered by the EliA Rib-P test is below $1 \%$ . Expected values may vary depending on the population tested.

The frequency distribution for antinuclear antibodies was investigated in a group of apparently healthy subjects equally distributed by age and gender, using sera from Caucasian, African American, Hispanic and Asian population obtained from a blood bank.

The results are given in the table below:
