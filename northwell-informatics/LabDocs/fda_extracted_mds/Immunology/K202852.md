# L. TEST PRINCIPLE:

The DiviTum®TKa is a multi-step end-point ELISA assay involving a cascade of enzymatic reactions and one antibody binding reaction. During the DiviTum®TKa test, a serum sample is combined with a reaction mixture containing the substrate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Since BrdU is a substrate analog to thymidine, TK from the serum sample phosphorylates the BrdU to its monophosphate, BrdUMP. The BrdUMP is then phosphorylated to BrdUTP and incorporated into a DNA/RNA hybrid, bound to the 96 well microplate solid surface, using a reverse transcriptase DNA polymerase. After washing, an alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-BrdU antibody is added to the reaction well. The amount of phosphatase conjugate bound to the DNA is determined by a colorimetric reaction, turning the substrate color from colorless to yellow, and the optical density readings (OD) hence indicate the TKa in the sample. Calibrators with predetermined nominal values are included in the kit. These are used to generate a standard curve by which the OD readings from the patient samples are converted to TKa expressed as DiviTum®TKa Units (DuA).

# M. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:

# 1. ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE

a. Precision/Reproducibility

The precision evaluation study for DiviTum®TKa was designed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP05-A3 to test reproducibility, repeatability, and other possible sources of variation for the assay: Operator, reagent lot and laboratory site. The study was divided into four parts: Two single site studies, a multi-site study and a lot-to-lot study.

The 1st single site precision evaluation study was performed at one site with five samples in five replicates per assay run, by two operators for 10 days per operator, and with three kit lots. The 2nd single site precision evaluation study was performed with six samples in two replicates per assay run for 20 days with two assay runs per day. The study was conducted by two operators at one site. The multisite precision evaluation study was conducted at three individual study sites (of which two are external CLIA certified laboratories) with five samples in five replicates per assay run for five days per site for a total of fifteen days. The lot-to-lot precision evaluation study was performed at one site by two operators using 3 unique (regarding critical raw materials) kit lots. Three kit lots were assayed per day for 5 days. The study was conducted with 5 replicates per run and per kit lot.

The results from the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ single site precision evaluation study, the multisite precision evaluation study, the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ single site precision evaluation study, and the lot-to-lot precision evaluation study fulfilled the pre-defined acceptance criteria for acceptable variation between measurements using DiviTum®TKa. The results of site-to-site reproducibility and within laboratory precision are presented below in Tables 4 (multisite precision evaluation study) and 5 ( $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ single site precision evaluation study).

# b. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range

i. Linearity.

The assay linearity interval was defined as $1 0 0 - 2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { D u A }$ . Sample pools “HIGH” and “LOW” were prepared using native serum samples. The HIGH sample pool had a $\mathrm { D u A }$ value (as measured by DiviTum®TKa) higher than the upper limit of the linearity interval (ULLI). The LOW sample pool had a DuA value lower than the lower limit of the linearity interval (LLLI). The two sample pools (HIGH and LOW) were mixed to obtain 10 intermediate concentrations with TK activity distributed throughout the whole AMI and near the assay clinical decision point at $2 5 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ .

Four replicates per linearity panel member were analysed using DiviTum®TKa. Expected values were calculated using the measured value of sample HIGH and LOW together with proportional data obtained from the mixing of samples.

Measured values were plotted on the vertical (y-) axis and the expected values on the horizontal $\left( \mathrm { X - } \right)$ axis. Weighted least squares (WLS) linear regression analysis with an intercept was applied on the dataset. The results from WLS linear regression is presented in Table 6. The curve is described by the following equation (curve-equation): Measured value $= 4 . 1 5 7 \mathrm { + 0 . 9 6 ~ x }$ Expected value

# BI $\textcircled{+}$ VICA

Traditional 510(k) Submission, DiviTum®TKa A.6 510(k) Summary DiviTum®TKa

DiviTum®TKa in patient samples with high TKa.. No Hook effect was observed within a TK-concentration range that reaches up to approximately $1 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ , which is almost 50 times higher than the ULOQ in DiviTum®TKa.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods)

i. Traceability and Calibrators

DiviTum®TKa is a complex multi-step end-point assay involving five enzymatic reactions and one antibody binding reaction. It is not possible to characterize the measured TK activity in this assay using SI units. According to ISO 17511:2020, in IVD assays using units that are non-SI traceable, the calibration hierarchy shall be defined in a way that enables consistent realization of the corresponding (non-SI) units of measure. Biovica therefore established in-house measurement procedures and calibrators to support values assigned to the product calibrators.

The definition of $1 \mathrm { D u A }$ (DiviTum unit of Activity) is the TK activity of $1 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ of recombinant TK1, MyBiosource. It equals the reaction rate catalyzed by $1 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ of recombinant TK under the standard DiviTum®TKa assay conditions.

# ii. Reagent Stability

DiviTum®TKa is stable for 12 months in storage at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The expiry date stated on the labeling will be 12 months in storage at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } C$ . The FDA recognized consensus standard CLSI EP25A was used as guideline for stability studies.

# iii. Stability during assay run

To verify in use stability, assay runs were performed at different temperatures using a minishaker chamber to control/maintain the temperature during thawing $( 3 0 \mathrm { m i n } )$ , mixing of reagents $( 1 0 \mathrm { m i n } )$ , and incubation (1.5h). The temperatures tested were $+ 1 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $+ 2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ , and $+ 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The $\% C \mathrm { V }$ between the three assays run at each temperature was $< 1 5 \%$ for all temperatures, and hence the stability of the kit is not significantly affected by variations in lab temperature in the range of normal room temperature $( + 1 8 – 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } . )$

# d. Detection Limit

A detection capability study has been performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP17-A2 to characterize measurement accuracy in the low-end region of the assay.

i. Limit of Blank (LOB): LOB was calculated to $3 3 \mathrm { D u A }$ , using the non-parametric option.   
ii. Limit of Detection (LOD): LOD was calculated to 47 DuA.   
iii. Limit of Quantitation (LOQ): The estimated LoQ of DiviTum®TKa is $8 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ .   
iv. Analytical Measuring Interval (AMI) The Analytical Measuring Interval (AMI) for DiviTum®TKa is set to $1 0 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ to 2000 DuA. The AMI is established from the LoQ, Linearity and Precision studies. Samples below $1 0 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ will be reported as $< 1 0 0$ DuA and samples above $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ will be reported as ${ > } 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ .

e. Analytical Specificity

The effects of 55 potential interfering substances (Table 7) were tested according to the CLSI guidelines EP07 $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ edition and EP37 $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ edition. When tested within normal reference values, none of the 55 tested substances showed any significant interference with DiviTum $\mathbb { B } \mathrm { T K } \mathrm { a }$ . However, interference was observed for serum samples with high lipemia $\mathrm { ( > 4 2 7 ~ m g / d l ) }$ or with abnormally elevated Bilirubin (at $\ge 1 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) or using Cisplatin or with abnormally elevated ALP levels $( { > } 9 8 0 ~ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { l } )$ ), the DiviTum $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ TKa results shall be interpreted with caution.

b. Matrix comparison Not applicable. Serum samples are the only matrix used for analysis.

# 3. CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of the DiviTum®TKa as an aid in monitoring disease progression in previously diagnosed postmenopausal $\mathrm { H R } +$ metastatic breast cancer patients undergoing treatment, was determined through a clinical validation study using left-over banked serum samples from metastatic breast cancer patients undergoing treatment. Multiple time-point measurements of TKa in serum samples from patients were linked to clinical data on disease progression. The clinical validation study included 454 patients (subjects) with a total of 1598 DiviTum®TKa serum samples/test results. 52 serum samples/test results obtained after the patient had progressed were excluded before the statistical analysis. These 52 serum samples were distributed over the 454 patients. The number of serum samples/test results – included in all the statistical analyses, and still representing 454 patients, hence constituted 1546 test results of which 1164 test results (samples) were captured during treatment, but still representing all 454 patients. The remaining 382 test results (samples) were from baseline (i.e., pre-treatment). The multiple time-point test results were divided into time intervals based on the original sampling day (phlebotomy) – i.e., actual visit (sampling) day at physician after registration. Patient treatment was initiated according to patient information – i.e., after baseline $( > 2 1$ days) sampling.

The number of DiviTum®TKa measurements per patient $\mathrm { ( N } { = } 4 5 4 )$ and TKa mean, median, minimum, and maximum values per time interval are listed in Table 6.

Elevated serum TKa was defined as above or equal to $2 5 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ (clinical reference value).

From the 1164 DiviTum ${ \mathfrak { B } } _ { \mathrm { T K } 4 }$ monitoring tests (during treatment), disease progression within 30 days from testing was seen in 63 cases. Thirty-three $( 5 2 . 4 \% )$ of the 63 samples with disease progression had TKa above the clinical reference value $( \ge 2 5 0 \mathrm { D u A } )$ ). Eight hundred and eightyeight $( 8 0 . 7 \% )$ of the 1101 samples with TKa ${ < } 2 5 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ were not associated with disease progression within the next 30 days. Table 9 presents the data in a $2 \times 2$ format and also includes data on progression within 60 days of testing.

# a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

The diagnostical performance is presented in Table 710. At a clinical reference value at 250 $\mathrm { D u A }$ , a DiviTum $^ { \textregistered } \mathrm { T K a }$ value $\geq 2 5 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ is $5 2 . 4 \%$ sensitive for disease progression within the next 30 days $( 4 8 . 7 \%$ for disease progression within 60 days). A value below the clinical reference value $( 2 5 0 \mathrm { D u A } )$ is $8 0 . 7 \%$ specific that disease will not progress within the next 30 days $8 1 . 9 \%$ specific for no-progression within the next 60 days). Sensitivity is represented as the proportion of patients with disease progression that had elevated DiviTum®TKa. Specificity is represented as the proportion of patients without disease progression that did not have elevated DiviTum®TKa. Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR) is represented as the fold increase of a patient’s likelihood of disease progression when having elevated DiviTum®TKa. Negative Likelihood Ratio (NPR) is represented as the fold decrease of a patient’s likelihood of disease progression without elevated DiviTum®TKa.

# 4. Clinical reference value (“cut off”)

To determine the clinical reference value, the intended patient population, and the intended purpose of DiviTum®TKa was considered. As TK activity is an indicator for cell proliferation, it was important to determine which values can be expected in a healthy population and a population with other clinical conditions leading to cell proliferation. This was done to get a first indication for a suitable clinical reference value. The clinical reference value was determined by analyzing 123 serum samples from apparently healthy post-menopausal females in a reference study. The clinical reference value was based on the 95th percentile of the distribution in this study. The sample size and statistical method evaluation were done according to the CLSI guideline EP28-A3. Based on the study results the assay clinical reference value for DiviTum®TKa was set to $2 5 0 \mathrm { D u A }$ . This clinical reference value/cut-off was verified by published data (Larsson et.al. “Serial evaluation of serum thymidine kinase activity is prognostic in women with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer” vol 10, no. 4484, 2020). To assess sensitivity and specificity at various clinical reference values, an ROC analysis was also performed. Results are shown in Figure 1.

Figure $1 - A$ and B: ROC curves for progression within $3 0$ days $( A )$ and 60 days (B), with the clinical reference value/cut-off at 250 $D u A$ noted.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The reference range was established by measuring the TKa in 123 healthy blood donors. The reference interval for healthy serum donors is 55 to $2 5 4 \mathrm { D u A }$ . The 95th percentile for healthy serum donors is $2 5 4 \mathrm { D u A }$ .

Groups with non-malignant conditions were analyzed to evaluate possible effects on the TKa value, see Table 811. The groups were chosen based on the possibility that the disorder affects the cell cycle and/or cell proliferation or being common in the study population.

Groups with malignant conditions were also analyzed, see Table 12. They were chosen based on the association with breast cancer.

Based on these results, it can be concluded that values below $2 5 4 \mathrm { D u A }$ are within the normal range for a healthy population of post-menopausal women (U.S. collected). The TKa was found to be slightly increased in patients with cell cycle affecting viral infections (acute Herpes Simplex and Epstein-Barr viral infections) as well as in certain autoimmune diseases (Rheumatoid Arthritis). Elevated levels of TKa are seen in patients with any type of late stage or aggressive malignant disease (cancer) as TKa is a biomarker for cell proliferation.
