# B Principle of Operation:

Abnormal bands in serum protein electropherograms (SPEP), primarily those in the beta globulin and gamma globulin zones, are suspected to be monoclonal proteins (M-proteins, paraproteins, monoclonal immunoglobulins). The presence of monoclonal protein as indicated by SPEP leads to testing of sample with an immunofixation (IF) technique to detect and identify the monoclonal protein components, using the HYDRAGEL IF assay.

Isatuximab is a human therapeutic IgG kappa monoclonal antibody and as such, during the clinical monitoring of patients treated with isatuximab, this antibody is visualized as a band detected by serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation in the gamma region. The presence of isatuximab can be interpreted as an endogenous IgG kappa monoclonal protein, and thus confound the clinical interpretation of the assay results.

The HYDRASHIFT isatuximab immunofixation procedure performed on the HYDRAGEL IF $2 / 4 \mathrm { g e l }$ is based on the creation of an isatuximab/anti-isatuximab antibody complex that is shifted outside the gammaglobulin zone. With the HYDRASHIFT isatuximab procedure, the isatuximab/anti-isatuximab antibody complex is visualized in alpha-1 zone on the IgG and Kappa immunofixation tracks and the isatuximab interference is removed from the gamma zone. This can allow for the visualization of any endogenous IgG kappa monoclonal proteins by IF that may have been masked by the endogenous isatuximab.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

Unless stated otherwise, all of the results described below met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria.

# 1. Precision:

To evaluate precision, a panel of 10 serum samples were tested using the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab procedure using either the HYDRAGEL 4 IF Acid Violet Standard Mask, or the HYDRAGEL 4 IF Acid Violet Dynamic Mask. The panel of 10 samples contained a normal isatuximab control, a normal serum control, and eight human serum samples with different monoclonal protein components. These eight serum samples were analyzed as native samples or with the addition of an isatuximab spike-in to verify the concordance between native and spiked samples. The samples tested for precision are described in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample#</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample Type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Samples examined</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal isatuximab control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal serum control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IgG kappa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum and 1.0 g/L isatuximab-spiked serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IgG lambda</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum and 1.0 g/L isatuximab-spiked serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IgA kappa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum and 1.0 g/L isatuximab-spiked serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IgA lambda</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum and 1.0 g/L isatuximab-spiked serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IgM kappa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum and 1.0 g/L isatuximab-spiked serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IgM lambda + IgA kappa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum and 1.0 g/L isatuximab-spiked serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Free Kappa component</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum and 1.0 g/L isatuximab-spiked serum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Free Lambda component</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Native serum and 1.0 g/L isatuximab-spiked serum</td></tr></table>

Within-in run precision (repeatability):

Each of the above 10 samples was tested four times within the same gel. As noted above, sample $\# 1$ and $\# 2$ were run without the addition of isatuximab as controls. Samples #3─#10 were run as native samples without isatuximab or with an isatuximab spike-in $( 1 . 0 \mathrm { g / L } )$ . All samples were run with both the Standard Mask (SM) and Dynamic Mask (DM) for a total of eight assessments per sample. The gel results were read and evaluated by two readers for the presence or absence of monoclonal proteins and the presence of the isatuximab/antiisatuximab antibody complex visualized in the alpha-1 zone on the $\mathrm { I g G }$ and kappa immunofixation tracks. The repeatability was evaluated visually for the concordance of monoclonal bands for each sample. The results showed $100 \%$ concordance for each sample, and between the same sample tested with the SM and DM, and between readers. The results are summarized below:

Native samples were $100 \%$ concordant when visualized using the SM and DM. Replicates of isatuximab spiked samples were $100 \%$ concordant between SM and DM. Samples with monoclonal proteins other than the IgG kappa (isatuximab monoclonal component) were $100 \%$ concordant when compared with native samples. An isatuximab/anti-isatuximab band was observed in the alpha-1 zone on the IgG and kappa immunofixation tracks in isatuximab-spiked samples.

Between-day, between-lot/instrument precision:

To evaluate the total imprecision of between the gel, lot, and instrument components, the same 10 samples in the format described above were assessed on three HYDRASYS 2 instruments using one HYDRASYS 2/4 isatuxmab lot per instrument, over three working days. Samples were run with both the HYDRAGEL 4 IF Acid Violet Standard Mask (SM) and HYDRAGEL 4 IF Acid Violet Dynamic Mask (DM) for a total of nine assessments per sample for each method. The normal isatuximab control was assessed on nine gels over three working days, yielding a total of 27 assessments each using the SM and the DM. In addition, samples #3─#10 were tested with or without an isatuximab spike-in $( 1 . 0 \mathrm { g / L } )$ , as described in the repeatability study. All results were read by two readers. The results were evaluated visually for the concordance of monoclonal proteins and the presence of isatuximab/antiisatuximab antibody complex in the alpha-1 zone for each sample. The results showed $100 \%$ concordance for all of the samples between days, instruments and lots, between SM and DM visualization methods, and between the two readers.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

Not applicable

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability:   
The isatuximab control and the anti-isatuximab antibody are traceable to internal reference controls.

# Isatuximab CONTROL:

The isatuximab control is manufactured from a pool of human sera complemented with isatuximab, which is a therapeutic human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody. The isatuximab control is in a stabilized lyophilized form and sold separately.

The freeze-dried isatuximab control vial must be stored refrigerated (at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ). It is recommended to run the isatuximab Control after each change of lot of a reagent (agarose gel, diluent or antisera).

# Stability:

Except for the istuximab control and the anti-isatuximab antibody, the test reagents of HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab kit were cleared in K960669. All the components are stable until the expiration date indicated on the kit box or on the component labels.

Kit Stability: To determine the expiration date for the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab kit components, including $\mathrm { I g G }$ anti-isatuximab antibody and HYDRAGEL IF diluent, an accelerated and real time stability studies were, or are currently being, performed. Briefly, IgG anti-isatuixmab reagent was stored for 10 weeks at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in an accelerated shelf-life stability study, or stored for 6 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a real time stability study. Similarly, the stability of HYDRAGEL IF diluent reagent was stored for 3 months at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in an accelerated stability study and for 6 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a real time stability. The results from the accelerated stability studies support the following stability claims:

• IgG anti-isatuximab reagent is stable for up to 2 years at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . HYDRAGEL IF diluent is stable for up to 3 years at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 3 years at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

Sample stability: To assess the stability of serum samples before their analysis using the HYDRASHIFT $2 / 4$ isatuximab kit in conjunction with the HYDRAGEL 4 IF Acid Violet Dynamic Mask, six serum specimens with different monoclonal components (IgG kappa, IgA lambda, IgM kappa, $\mathrm { I g G }$ lambda, IgA kappa, and $\mathrm { I g M }$ lambda) were spiked with isatuximab antibody, and stored under various conditions (fresh, 10 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 days at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 months at $- 1 8$ to $- 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } $ ) before being assessed for their monoclonal components via immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE). The tests were performed by one operator on three separate days and evaluated for $100 \%$ concordance between the reference and test condition. The results demonstrate that samples are stable under the following conditions:

Samples are stable for 10 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Samples are stable for 3 days when stored at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Samples are stable for 3 months when stored at $- 1 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$

6. Detection Limit:

# Sensitivity:

A sensitivity study was performed in order to determine the threshold detection value for visualization of the isatuximab/anti-isatuximab antibody complex. Five serum samples containing different monoclonal gammaglobulinemia components were used in this study and shown as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample Type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total Band Protein Concentration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample A</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High gamma globulin serum pool</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample B</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pooled normal serum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High IgG kappa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.3 g/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample D</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High IgA kappa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38.2 g/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample E</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High IgM kappa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.4 g/L</td></tr></table>

Each of above samples was spiked with different concentrations of isatuximab for six final concentration points $( 0 . 0 \mathrm { g / L } , 0 . 1 \mathrm { g / L } , 0 . 2 \mathrm { g / L } , 0 . 3 \mathrm { g / L } , 0 . 5 \mathrm { g / L } , 1 . 0 \mathrm { g / L } ,$ , and $3 . 0 \mathrm { g / L }$ isatuximab). Each native and isatuximab-spiked serum sample was assessed by one operator in one run on three instruments utilizing both the SM and the DM methods. The results showed that the limit of detection for the isatuximab/anti-isatuximab antibody complex in the alpha-1 zone of the $\mathrm { I g G }$ and kappa tracks is $0 . 3 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ .

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

Not applicable. The detection value for visualization of the isatuximab / anti-isatuximab antibody complex in the alpha-1 zone of the IgG kappa tracks is $0 . 3 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ .

# B Comparison Studies:

# 1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Three method comparison studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab kit in comparison to the predicate HYDRASYS IF device. One internal study and two complementary external studies were conducted.

# Internal Study:

An internal study was conducted using 53 serum specimens, including 26 normal specimens and 27 specimens with monoclonal components, and analyzed using the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab procedure in conjunction with either HYDRAGEL 2 or 4 IF Acid Violet Standard Mask or Dynamic Mask for a total of four different configurations in the study. The samples were evaluated by one operator using two separate HYDRASYS instruments over seven working days as native specimens or as isatuximab-spiked $( 1 . 0 \mathrm { g / L } )$ specimens. The results demonstrated $100 \%$ concordance between the various samples and masking procedures.

\* An asterix $( ^ { * } )$ indicates multiple distinct molecular weight monoclonal gammaglobulin proteins. For example, $2 ^ { * } \operatorname { I g A }$ kappa indicates that the sample contained two separate IgA kappa monoclonal gammaglobulin bands.

Each specimen was assessed for concordance between the disease reference and HYDRASHIFT 2/4 Isatuximab test analysis. If differences were observed between the two, the result was considered equivalent if the difference was attributable to the presence of isatuximab in the serum sample. For example, an IgA kappa sample would be considered concordant if it contained an isatuxumab monoclonal band when assayed using the HYDASYS 2/4 IF device, but the isatuximab interference was eliminated when assayed using the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab test result, yielding an IgA kappa result. For the purpose of the study, the disease reference condition for the samples was predetermined by a clinician based on 2016 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria.

The results demonstrated that the samples were $100 \%$ concordant between the reference result and the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab test result in both external studies.

Please note, while the purpose of the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab assay is to detect endogenous serum monoclonal proteins in the presence of isatuximab by removing isatuximab interference, if isatuximab is present in the sample at a concentration below the limit of detection, an isatuximab/anti-isatuximab band may not be observed. In addition, an isatuximab/anti-isatuximab band may not be reliably seen in sera obtained from isatuximab treated multiple myeloma patients that are not in complete (CR) or very good partial response (VGPR), such as partial response (PR), minimal response (MR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) patients. This information may also be found in the package insert of the HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab kit.
