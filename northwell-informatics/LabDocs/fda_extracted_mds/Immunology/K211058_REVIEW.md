# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Lp(a) Ultra assay is comprised of a kit with ready to use liquids for the quantitative immunoturbidimetric determination of lipoprotein (a). The kit contains two reagents sufficient to perform 86 tests on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer. Reagent 1 is comprised of a glycine buffer at $\mathsf { p H } 9 . 0$ with $< 0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide. Reagent 2 is comprised of a $0 . 4 \%$ suspension of anti-Lp(a) polyclonal antibodies latex particles at $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 3$ and with $< 0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide. The Lp(a) Ultra assay is calibrated with the Lp(a) Cal Set consisting of five lyophilized calibrators.

# B Principle of Operation:

Lp(a) Ultra assay is a latex-based immunoturbidimetric assay to measure Lp(a) levels in serum and plasma. The immunoturbidimetric assay is constructed with reagents that agglutinate due to antigen-antibody reaction between Lp(a) in a sample and anti-Lp(a) antibody bound to latex particles. This agglutination is detected as an absorbance change, with the magnitude of the change being proportional to the quantity of Lp(a).

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision performance of the Lp(a) Ultra assay on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer was established in two studies for within-run and within-laboratory precision.

# Study #1 – within-run precision

In the study, five samples (two controls, two serum pools, and one calibrator in serum) were tested in replicates of 20 in one run for assessment of the within-run precision (repeatability). The assessment was conducted on each of three days using one instrument and one reagent lot. The within-run precision (repeatability) was calculated for each sample and for each day:

# Study #2 – within-laboratory

In the study, five samples were tested in replicates of two per run, with two runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 measurements per sample. The study was performed using one instrument and one reagent lot. The results for each sample presented in the table below were analyzed for variance by an ANOVA method for the factors of within-run, run, and day. The within-laboratory SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were estimated using the summation of the within-run, between-run, and between-day variance components.

The linearity performance of the Lp(a) Ultra assay was evaluated in a study following the recommendations in CLSI EP06 Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures, 2nd Edition. In the study, a dilution series of 13 samples were prepared by intermixing known volumes of a high Lp(a) concentration serum pool and low Lp(a) concentration serum pool. Each sample was measured in triplicate using each of two reagent lots on a Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer. The data were analyzed by linear regression using the mean of the observed result versus the expected concentration based on the known dilution ratio. Deviations from linearity within the claimed measuring range were never observed to be greater than $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Based on these results, the sponsor concluded that the test system demonstrated a linear response over the claimed measuring range of 10 to 100 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# High dose hook effect study

The sponsor provided data to support the claim that no high dose hook effect is observed with this assay for Lp(a) concentrations up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The analytical specificity of the Lp(a) Ultra assay on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer was established by conducting interference testing following the recommendations in CLSI $\mathrm { E P 0 7 } 3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ Edition. Interference from certain endogenous and exogenous substances was assessed using two serum pools with low and high Lp(a) concentrations of $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each low and high sample was further divided into two aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test (with added interferent). Each sample was tested in 5 replicates using one lot and one instrument. A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference in the mean between the control and test sample was outside of the predefined allowable error of within $\pm 1 0 \%$ $\mathrm { o r } \pm 3 ~ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ . The observed maximum interference was - $5 \%$ with absolute difference of - $- 2 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the following levels of interfering substances:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Highest concentration whichno significant interferencewas observed</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Endogenous</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>715 mg/dL*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Conjugated bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Unconjugated bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Rheumatoid factor</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>500 IU/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1000 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Exogenous</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ascorbic acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>180 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intralipid® Intravenous FatEmulsion</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1000 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

\* For those substances that on initial screening were found to interfere, additional testing was conducted to establish the concentration limit below which no significant interference is

expected. Significant interference was found for triglycerides at concentration of 1000 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The results of additional testing for triglycerides are given in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lp(a) concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration limit with nosignificant interference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.4 to 79.2 mg/dL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>715 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

4. Assay Reportable Range:

See linearity section VII A.2.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability

The Lp(a) Ultra assay is metrologically traceable to externally sourced calibrators with assigned values. For each new lot of calibrators, the assigned values are verified by the sponsor to be within an acceptance interval by testing against the previous lot of calibrators.

6. Detection Limit:

Detection capability studies of the Lp(a) Ultra on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer for limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.

# LoB

The LoB for the Lp(a) Ultra assay was evaluated using four zero-analyte saline samples, and two reagent kit lots and one instrument. Each of the four samples was measured in replicates of 5 with each of the two lots over three days for a total of 60 replicates per lot. The LoB was analyzed by the parametric method described in the guideline and found to be $0 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for both lots.

# LoD

The LoD was evaluated using four low-level samples prepared from serum pools using 2 reagent lots and one instrument. The samples were tested in replicates of 5 using each of two lots on three different days for a total of 60 measurement per lot. For each lot, the LoD was analyzed using a parametric data analysis which was the lowest concentration at which the analyte can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability based on $\mathrm { n } = 6 0$ replicates. The LoD of the assay was selected from the highest value obtained across the two lots; $1 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

#

The LoQ was evaluated using 8 low-level samples prepared from serum pools diluted with saline using two reagent lots and one instrument. Each of the samples was tested in replicates of 10 for each of the two lots on three different days for a total of 30 measurements per sample per lot. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of analyte which has imprecision of less than or equal to $20 \%$ CV. The LoQ of the assay was selected from the highest value obtained across the two lots; $3 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

The agreement accuracy of the Lp(a) Ultra assay on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer was establish with a method comparison study to a legally marketed Lp(a) device. In the study, 146 serum samples were tested in duplicate on the candidate device and duplicate on the comparator device. The data was analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression using the first replicate for the candidate device and the average of duplicates for the comparator device. The slope and intercept of the regression line were calculated, with the following results.

# REFERENCE VALUES

The defined threshold of Lp(a) concentration at which individuals can be classified as being at increased risk varies greatly among studies, ranging from $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

A Lp(a) concentration of $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ corresponding to the 75th percentile in a male Caucasian reference population is widely used as cut-off or threshold value.1,2 Different Lp(a) levels can be found in different racial/ethnicity groups.3,4 Increased serum Lp (a) concentrations are associated with increased risk of premature coronary artery disease and stroke. Because Lipoprotein (a) levels are highly heritable, Lp (a) may be an important marker for premature CHD, especially among Caucasians. Although Lipoprotein (a) levels are higher in African Americans than in Caucasians, associated CHD risk appears to be less.5 It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own range of normal Lp(a) values for the population in their region. For diagnostic purposes, results obtained should always be evaluated considering the patient's history and all other clinical findings.
