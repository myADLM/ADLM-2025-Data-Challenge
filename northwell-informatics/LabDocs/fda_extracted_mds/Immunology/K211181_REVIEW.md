C. Type of Test: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based nucleic acid amplification and subsequent melt-curve analysis

III. Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A. Intended Use

The Idylla MSI Test, for use on the Idylla System, uses formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of human colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor, from which nucleic acids are liberated, then analyzed using PCR amplification of seven monomorphic biomarkers (ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A and SULF2) and subsequent meltcurve analysis. The Idylla MSI Test reports results as either microsatellite stable (MSS), or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or invalid.

Idylla MSI Test is indicated for use by healthcare professionals for the qualitative identification of microsatellite instability (MSI) in CRC tumors, indicative of mismatch repair deficiency, as an aid in the identification of potential Lynch syndrome to help identify patients that would benefit from additional genetic testing to diagnose Lynch syndrome.

The Results from the Idylla MSI Test should be interpreted by healthcare professionals in conjunction with other clinical findings, family history, and other laboratory data. The Idylla MSI Test should not be used for diagnosis of CRC.

The clinical performance of this device to guide treatment decision for MSI high patients has not been established.

B. Special conditions for use statement(s) Rx – For prescription use For in vitro diagnostic use   
C. Special instrument requirements Biocartis Idylla System with Idylla MSI Test TTP.

# IV. Device Description

# 1. Principle of Operation

The Idylla MSI Test is an automated test on the Idylla System. The Biocartis Idylla System covers the entire process from sample to result with fully integrated sample preparation followed by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and fluorescence detection of the targeted sequences. The Idylla System consists of the Idylla Console connected to up to eight Idylla Instruments. Idylla Cartridges, designed for specific applications, are processed by the Idylla System using test specific software. The test specific software, referred to as Test Type Package (TTP), is available for download to the Idylla Console. The Test procedure and data analysis are validated for FFPE tissue sections.

The Idylla MSI Test detects a novel panel of seven monomorphic biomarkers which are listed in the Table 1 below.

Table 1. Seven biomarkers in the Idylla MSI Test   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Biomarkers</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ACVR2A</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>BTBD7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>DIDO1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MRE11</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>RYR3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SEC31A</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SULF2</td></tr></table>

The process steps in the Idylla MSI Test are:

Sample Processing (FFPE liquefaction and cell lysis): After insertion of the FFPE tissue section into the cartridge, a combination of chemical reagents, enzymes, heat, and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) induces deparaffinization, disruption of the tissue and lysis of the cells. The nucleic acids are liberated for subsequent PCR amplification. There is no DNA extraction step in the procedure.

Amplification, Detection and Analysis: All necessary PCR reagents are present in a stable formulation and are used to amplify seven biomarkers. After amplification of the specific regions of the seven (7) biomarkers, the molecular beacons bind to the target regions. Contact quenching no longer takes place and the beacons will produce a fluorescence signal. These mutant-specific beacons differentially melt from the wild type or mutated amplicons with increasing temperature. The fluorescence differences at melting temperatures are further analyzed by the MSI TTP and translated into genetic calls on biomarker level and MSI status on sample level.

Reporting: At the end of the run, a result report outlining the MSI status along with the number of positive MSI biomarkers detected in the analyzed sample is displayed on the console screen. The MSI status of the sample can be determined if at least five valid marker-specific fluorescence profiles could be fully analyzed (otherwise the MSI status is called ‘Invalid’). The presence of at least two mutant markers results in an ‘MSI-H’ call (Microsatellite Instability-High), otherwise the status is reported as ‘MSS’ (Microsatellite Stable).

# 2. Specimen Handling/Requirement

Standard formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding procedures should be followed. Tissue samples should be fixed as quickly as possible and fixation times limited to preferably less than 72 hours to reduce the risk of severe DNA fragmentation. $4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ to $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ FFPE tissue

sections can be used as specimen in the Idylla MSI Test. Specimens should be macrodissected if less than $33 \%$ of the section is tumor.

# 3. Interpretation of Results

The Idylla System automatically interprets the test results and makes them available for viewing on the Console. The Idylla MSI Test reports a result for the MSI status of the sample, the MSI Score Range of the sample, the number of positive biomarkers and an overall quality status. A sample is called Microsatellite Instability-High or MSI-H if the sample has ${ \ge } 2$ mutant biomarkers and an MSI Score Range $\geq 0 . 1 5$ . A sample is called Microsatellite Stable or MSS if the sample has $^ { < 2 }$ mutant biomarkers and an MSI Score Range $< 0 . 1 5$ (Table 2).

Table 2. Result Interpretation   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Number of PositiveBiomarkers</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MSI Score Range</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MSI Status</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;0.15</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MSS</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≥2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≥0.15</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MSI-H</td></tr></table>

An ‘Invalid’ call for a biomarker is observed when no PCR product was formed in a particular sample and therefore no characteristic fluorescent profile could be analyzed. This may occur when using poor quality samples. A Cartridge is considered valid if $\geq 5$ out of $7 \ \mathrm { M S I }$ biomarkers show a valid marker result for the sample. An invalid Cartridge will report the MSI status being 'Invalid'. An 'Invalid' result is reported if ${ > } 2$ out of 7 MSI biomarkers show an invalid biomarker result for a particular sample (Table 3).

This study was designed to evaluate lot-to-lot, instrument/operator, inter-day and inter-lab variability on the Idylla MSI Test. At each site, each sample was tested by one operator on four instruments with one replicate per instrument per day, for three non-consecutive days using three lots of Idylla MSI Test Cartridges, resulting in a total of twelve replicates per sample per site. Overall, this study produced 36 results (tests) in total per sample from all three sites. All 252 valid runs from the three sites were used for data analysis.

\* Borderline samples per Idylla Test v2.0 initial screening results $^ { * * }$ While reproducibility for this marker across 36 replicates is $> 8 5 \%$ , the biomarker call observed is discordant to the biomarker status of the clinical sample that was obtained during sample characterization.

All three sites generated correct MSI status calls across the sites for all seven clinical samples tested (Table 7). The reproducibility across 36 replicates for each biomarker per sample is between 77.8 and $100 \%$ , for some occasions a biomarker call is observed that is discordant to the initial biomarker status of the clinical sample ( $^ { * * }$ indicated in Table 8).

# 2. MSS and MSI-H FFPE Control Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the external controls was evaluated at three laboratory sites. The test panel consisted of 2 types of contrived reference sample types (MSI-H and MSS), manufactured in 3 different sample lots by supplier SenslD. At the individual sites, each sample was tested on a set of 4 instruments, by 2 operators and with samples originating from 3 lots during 6 non-consecutive days with 2 replicates. It was observed that the call rate per sample lot was at least 35/36 $( 9 7 \% )$ and overall call rate on for all replicates was 216/216 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ in this study. A call rate of at least $1 0 5 / 1 0 8$ was observed with a point estimate of $9 7 \%$ for individual biomarkers (Tables 9 and 10).

# 3. Linearity

# 4.1 Limit of Blank

The limit of blank (LoB) study was conducted to evaluate the non-specific amplification and cross-reactivity between the mutant and wild type targets and consisted of two parts.

Part 1: The no template control (NTC) study wherein the level of contamination with human DNA was determined in MSI cartridges produced in the manufacturing facilities.

Part 2: Wild Type (WT) study wherein the background signals caused by potential cross-reactivity of the MSI mutation amplicons with MSI WT DNA were evaluated.

For the NTC study, 60 cartridges from three lots were tested to examine the contamination in the investigational use only (IUO) MSI Test cartridges. The results obtained from NTC study were calculated for the proportion of invalid calls (# of invalid/60). For the WT study, 20 FFPE MSS clinical samples were tested in duplicate using three different lots of IUO MSI Test cartridges to evaluate the analytical specificity of the test.

The LoB study results demonstrate that the Idylla MSI Test can correctly generate an ‘Invalid’ MSI status call when there is no sample in the Cartridge and the MSI status ‘MSS’ when a wild type sample is tested with the Idylla MSI Test.

# 4.2 Limit of Detection

The Limit of Detection (LoD) is defined as the lowest average mutant/total allele ratio (of weighted combined MSI biomarkers based on prevalence) generating a positive MSI status in $9 5 \%$ of cases (at a $9 5 \%$ confidence level).

Estimation of LoD with reference samples: The LoD estimation study was performed using reference cell lines $0 \%$ and $100 \%$ allelic frequency (AF) samples), by a titration experiment using varying levels of MSI-H allelic frequency $( 5 \% - 5 0 \% )$ at two different sample input levels (high and low input) representative for clinical samples. This study result showed the estimated LoD was $30 \%$ allelic frequency, at which the Idylla MSI Test generated correct MSI status calls for all the biomarkers (Table 11 and 12).

Clinical LoD estimation: The LoD using clinical samples was estimated using four FFPE samples by a titration experiment using varying levels of MSI-H neoplastic cell content $( 5 - 5 0 \% )$ . The call rates for sample 4 were variable: this sample had a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) measurement which was well below the validated linear range of the ddPCR method before dilutions were made. This sample was also originally characterized as a challenging sample with only 2 positive markers. Therefore, the call rate for this sample could also be indicative for the performance of challenging samples (Table 13).

Clinical LOD confirmation: The LOD was confirmed using seven FFPE clinical samples (MSI-H and MSS including challenging samples) at approximately $33 \%$ neoplastic cell content, and the minimum required tissue level $2 5 \ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ per $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ section). The samples were tested across two Cartridge lots in ten replicates per lot $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 0 )$ ) over five days on multiple Instruments (total $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 4 0$ from all seven samples). As presented in Table 14 below, the results revealed that all seven (7) samples tested (three (3) MSS and four (4) MSI-H) generated $100 \%$ correct MSI status calls. This study confirms the clinical analytical sensitivity (LoD) of the Idylla MSI Test at $\leq 3 3 \%$ neoplastic cell content in clinical samples at the lowest sample input size $( 2 5 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ per $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ section).

For MSS samples, individual biomarkers score consistently wild type (Table 16). For clinical MSI-H samples, a concordance of $\ge 9 5 \%$ -point estimate can be observed for 4 biomarkers (BTBD7, RYR3, ACVR2A and MRE11) across all 4 MSI-H samples. The remaining biomarkers showed concordance below $9 5 \%$ for some samples. For SEC31A, two samples had hit rates below $9 5 \%$ , Sample 3 at $8 5 \%$ and Sample 4 at $3 5 \%$ . DIDO1 demonstrated a $70 \%$ hit rate in sample 1, and SULF2 demonstrated a hit rate of $65 \%$ with sample 2 (Table 15).

# 5. Analytical Specificity/Interference

Interference testing was performed using seven FFPE colorectal cancer clinical samples (MSI-H and MSS), including commonly encountered interfering substances such as hemoglobin, triglycerides, and paraffin. For hemoglobin and triglycerides, interference was tested at the highest possible concentration levels $2 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ and $3 7 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , respectively). To assess the paraffin interference, one additional $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ paraffin blank section was added to the cartridge along with the sample. Each sample was tested with an interfering substance in five replicates using a single lot of Idylla MSI Cartridges. Additionally, the samples were tested without an interfering substance as a control. The results obtained for each interfering substance were checked for a correct MSI status call and compared with the control results (runs without interfering substance) for the proportion $( \% )$ of concordance with control results.

Total runs from all seven clinical samples tested (at five runs per sample)

All seven samples tested with interference substances i.e., hemoglobin, triglycerides and excess paraffin generated correct MSI status calls, showed $100 \%$ concordance with control results (Table 17).

Mucin (i.e., $\%$ mucinous cells in FFPE sample) impact on the Idylla MSI Test was evaluated using nineteen individual FFPE clinical samples with various levels of mucinous cell content $( 0 \% - 6 0 \% )$ . These samples included both MSI-H and MSS samples that met sample requirement criteria for the test. Each mucinous sample was tested in three replicates using one lot of Idylla MSI Test Cartridges. All nineteen mucinous samples results showed correct MSI calls for approximately $9 6 . 5 \%$ runs (55 of 57 runs) performed, except one sample which generated ‘Invalid’ results for 2 out of 3 runs performed. This study indicated that samples with mucinous cell content up to $60 \%$ have no impact on the performance of the Idylla MSI Test, and can still generate correct MSI status calls.

The impact of necrosis content $5 5 0 \%$ on the Idylla MSI Test was evaluated using four FFPE clinical samples with various levels of necrosis content $( 6 6 - 7 3 \% )$ . The samples included both MSI-H and MSS samples. Each sample was tested in triplicate with and without necrosis content. All four samples generated a correct MSI status call for testing with and without necrosis. Therefore, necrosis content up to $73 \%$ has no impact on the Idylla MSI Test.

# 6. Assay Reportable Range

Seven samples consisting of four MSI-H and three MSS clinical FFPE samples (including one each of MSI-H and MSS borderline samples) were used for this study. In this study, borderline samples refer to MSI mutant samples with one positive marker (MSS borderline, negative) or $2 / 3$ positive markers (MSI-H borderline, positive). The minimum and maximum tissue requirement was determined by a titration experiment using six different levels of input material $( 1 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 } - 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { \dot { 2 } } )$ per sample using $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ FFPE clinical specimens containing the minimum required tumor content (i.e., $\geq 3 3 \%$ ) per the product requirements. Sufficient FFPE MSI-H/MSS sections from each sample were liquefied using MSI Test split protocol Part 1, and these liquefactions were diluted with buffer to prepare the desired six level tissue input samples (300, 200, 100, 50, 25 and $1 2 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ ). Each dilution sample was tested in six replicates using three different MSI Test cartridge lots. The results obtained were analyzed for proportion of correct calls and checked against the acceptance criteria specified in the protocol.

Data analysis showed that overall, the results met the acceptance criteria of $2 9 5 \%$ concordance (correct MSI status calls) for tissue input levels $( \mathrm { m } \bar { \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } } )$ 300, 200, 100, 50, and 25. However, input level $1 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } 2 $ did not meet the acceptance criteria with an $8 5 . 7 ~ \%$ (36/42) concordance (correct MSI status calls).

The results demonstrated that the Idylla MSI Test can achieve valid and correct MSI status calls with tissue input levels from minimum of $2 5 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ to maximum of $3 0 0 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ for $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ sections, equivalent for $4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ sections from minimum of $6 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ to maximum $7 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ tissue input.

# 7.1 Shelf Life

Four verification lots and one validation lot were tested in support of the Idylla MSI Test shelf life. The product lots were stored at temperatures of $5 { \pm } 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ representing the worst-case scenarios. A limited number of cartridges were stored at temperature of $2 5 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to be tested if the instability trend is observed at $3 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (fallback scenario). One product lot (#3505) was subjected to the mixed thermal program prior to the real time stability testing as described in the Shipping Stability section.

# 7.2 Shipping Stability

Cartridges underwent temperature cycling between $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 72 hours and $+ 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours across a total of two cycles. The third winter cycle of 48 hours at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 24 hours at $+ 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ hours followed immediately. After completion of winter cycling, the cartridges were exposed to the temperature of $4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 72 hours.

Immediately after temperature cycles, 9 MSI cartridges were tested with 6 FFPE MSI slices and 3 FFPE MSS slices to generate the time point $0 ^ { \circ }$ data. The reference baseline for data analysis was time point 0 data (QC release). The cartridges exposed to the thermal cycling have been stored at $3 0 \pm 2 { \ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and further tested according to the real time stability study protocol.

The results show that exposing the Idylla MSI Test to high (up to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and low temperatures (to $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for a limited time up to 72 hours does not impact the product performance.

# 7.3 In Use Stability

For this study, 84 MSI cartridges were removed from the pouch and kept in the incubator at $3 0 \pm 2 { \ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 5 \%$ RH for 6 days. First 12 cartridges were removed from the incubator after two hours $\mathrm { ( = \ d a y \ 0 ) }$ and tested with 6 MSI-H samples and 6 MSS samples. The remaining cartridges were run on day 1 to 6 (six cartridges per day). In-use stability study (without pouch, without specimen) is verified at the beginning (within 3 months after T0) and at the end of shelf life.

For in-use study 1, MSI cartridges were removed from their pouches and placed in an incubator (at $3 0 \pm 2 { \ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 5 \pm 5 ~ \mathrm { \% R H }$ for up to 6 days. The first cartridges were tested with MSS and MSI FFPE slices after 2 hours $( = \mathrm { d a y } \ 0 )$ ) in the incubator, and the remaining cartridges were tested at the 5 subsequent time points, i.e., day 2 to day 6. Six cartridges were tested per time point: 3 cartridges with FFPE MSS slices and 3 cartridges with FFPE MSI slices.

For In-use study 2, MSI cartridges were removed from their pouches, loaded with a MSS FFPE slice or MSI slice. Six cartridges loaded with the two input sample types were run on Idylla immediately after the sample was loaded (hour 0). The other loaded cartridges were placed in an incubator (at $3 0 \pm 2 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 5 \pm 5 \ : \% \mathrm { R H } )$ for 3 and 9 hours before running them on Idylla. Six cartridges were tested per time point: 3 cartridges with FFPE MSS slices and 3 cartridges with FFPE MSI slices.

The in-use stability data obtained at beginning and end of shelf life support that MSI cartridges can be used up to:

5 days after removed from the pouch and stored on the bench (at laboratory ambient conditions) without sample   
8 hours after removed from pouch, loaded with a sample and stored at laboratory ambient conditions.

# 8. Assay Cut-Off

Seven novel individual MSI markers (ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A and SULF2) will be tested.

• A sample is called Microsatellite Instability-High or MSI-H if the sample has ${ \ge } 2$ mutant biomarkers and an MSI Score Range $\ge 0 . 1 5$ . A sample is called Microsatellite Stable or MSS if the sample has $^ { < 2 }$ mutant biomarkers and an MSI Score Range $< 0 . 1 5$ .

# 9. Cartridge Accuracy for Minimal Number of Expansions

The test panel to assess cartridge accuracy consisted of synthetic targets (ST), representing all seven MSI biomarkers, containing the repeat sequence with one additional nucleotide $( + 1 )$ or one deleted nucleotide (-1). Both reference sample and spiked MSS samples were tested in triplicate in cartridges resulting from one cartridge lot (Table 19).

All nine Idylla runs resulted in valid test results. Three cartridges tested with the control panel, MSS contrived sample, resulted in an MSS call. Three cartridges tested with MSS sample spiked with ST cocktail 1 (-1 nucleotide) resulted in an MSI-H call. Cartridges tested with MSS sample spiked with ST cocktail 2 ( $+ 1$ nucleotide) resulted in three MSS calls (Table 20).

# 10. Carry-Over

The Idylla MSI Test is a unitized cartridge test system. Therefore, this study is not applicable.

# 11. Curls versus Slides of FFPE Specimens

Ten paired (curls and slides) FFPE MSS and ten paired (curls and slides) FFPE MSI-H samples from CRC patients that fulfilled the sample requirements per Idylla MSI Test Instructions For Use were tested. A total of 40 samples (20 curls and 20 slides) were tested. The agreement of the final MSI status (genetic) call results between curls and slides for each sample tested (10 MSS and 10 MSI-H) were compared.

The data analysis revealed that of the 20 samples tested (10 MSS and 10 MSI-H), one MSIH sample had discordant results between curl and slide, and the remaining 19 samples showed agreement for results between curls and slides.

# B. Comparison Studies:

A method comparison study was conducted to clinically validate the accuracy of the Idylla MSI Test against a predicate device, the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System for the detection of MSI status. A comparison of the Idylla MSI Test result to results of a germline Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR) was performed for identification of Lynch syndrome (LS) cases.

The study was conducted by testing 123 sequentially enrolled colorectal samples representative of the intended use population. The sequential sample set was supplemented with 20 confirmed Lynch cases (enrichment cohort) obtained from the Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). The study used retrospective FFPE tissue samples collected from CRC patients in the US representative of the intended use population. All stages of CRC (stages I – IV), and tumors from different sites of the colorectal area were represented.

Of the total 143 samples included in the study (123 sequential and 20 confirmed Lynch), valid test results were obtained for all 143 with Idylla MSI Test, for 140 with the predicate and 133 with germline NGS of MMR genes.

The agreement parameters PPA, NPA and OPA were calculated between Idylla MSI Test and the predicate for MSI status calls and between Idylla MSI Test and germline NGS of MMR genes for Lynch identification.

# 1. Idylla MSI Test vs Predicate

The concordance and agreement analysis between Idylla MSI Test and the predicate for the 143 samples is presented in Table 21 and Table 22, respectively. A total of 32 samples were detected as MSI-H by the predicate out of which 31 were also detected as MSI-H by the Idylla MSI Test. Of the total 108 samples detected as MSS by the predicate, 107 were also MSS by Idylla MSI Test. The PPA was $9 6 . 8 8 \%$ and the NPA was $9 9 . 0 7 \%$ with OPA of $9 8 . 5 7 \%$ between the two methods.

# 2. Idylla MSI Test Vs Germline NGS for MMR Genes

Based on the detection of germline pathogenic mutations by NGS in the MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2), a total of 25 samples were Lynch syndrome positive. Table 27 and Table 28 present concordance and agreement results, respectively, between the Idylla MSI Test and germline NGS of MMR genes for all samples. Of the total 25 confirmed Lynch cases by germline NGS, the Idylla MSI Test correctly identified 23 samples as MSI-H. Two (2) samples typed as MSS were confirmed by NGS to have pathogenic mutations in the MSH2 gene.

The PPA between Idylla MSI Test and NGS for identification of Lynch syndrome was $9 2 \%$ . The NPA is less informative since Lynch syndrome negative samples by germline NGS can still exhibit MSI-H due to sporadic somatic mutations in one or more of the MMR genes (sporadic dMMR).

Yes ____X____ or No_

3. Level of Concern: Moderate

4. Specimen Handling: Please refer to Device Description section above.

5. Calibration and Quality controls:

In contrast to standard PCR equipment, the ldylla System is calibrated at the time of manufacturing. No user performed system calibration is needed. The instrument automatically initiates a self-test before a cartridge is processed. This test checks individual instrument modules. If the self-test fails, a fatal error is reported and the instrument is disabled. On a monthly basis, the system requires a self-diagnostic test to check for potential hardware issues. The system notifies the user of the test need by displaying a warning icon on the console. Self-diagnostic test failure leads to a fatal error and requires the intervention of authorized service personnel.
