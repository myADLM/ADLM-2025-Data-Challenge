# Device description

The Aptiva CTD Essential reagent utilizes particle based multi-analyte technology (PMAT) in a cartridge format. Each analyte (dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P) in the Aptiva CTD Essential reagent is a solid phase immunoassay utilizing fluorescent microparticles. This technology allows each of the ten analytes, along with a human anti-IgG capture antibody (IgG Control Microparticle), to be coated onto eleven uniquely recognizable paramagnetic microparticles, which are combined into one tube.

The Aptiva Multi-Analyte Instrument is a fully automated, random-access analyzer. This platform is a closed system with continuous load and random-access capabilities that processes the samples, runs the reagent, and reports results. It includes liquid handling hardware, optical module (OM), and integrated computer with proprietary software and touch screen user interface.

The ten unique populations of microparticles coated with dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo1, Centromere and Ribo-P, along with the one for the control microparticle, are stored in the reagent cartridge under conditions that preserve the autoantigens in their reactive states. When the assay cartridge is ready to be used for the first time, the reagent tube seals are pierced using the cartridge lid. The reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the Aptiva Multi-Analyte Instrument, where the microparticles are automatically rehydrated using buffer located within the cartridge.

A patient’s serum is diluted 1:44.4 fold with Aptiva system rinse by the instrument in a disposable cuvette. A small amount of the diluted sample is combined with assay buffer and the microparticle suspension in a second cuvette, and mixed (final serum dilution: 1:230). This reaction cuvette is incubated for $9 \%$ minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . The cuvette is then exposed to a magnet that retains the microparticles in place. The liquid is aspirated, and the microparticles are resuspended as system rinse is added to the cuvette and the magnet is removed. This wash cycle is repeated. During the third wash, no system rinse is added after the aspiration step. After the third wash, phycoerythrin conjugated polyclonal anti-human IgG (known as PE Tracer IgG) is added to the cuvette with microparticles, and mixed. Again, the cuvette is incubated for $9 \%$ minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . Three wash steps, as described above, are performed on the microparticles. Following the wash steps, the microparticles are transferred to the optical module of the instrument, where a charge coupled device (CCD) camera takes multiple images to identify and count the twelve unique microparticle regions, as well as determine the amount of conjugate on the microparticles. A twelfth particle, coated with goat anti-human IgG, is present in the reagent as a control to flag low concentrations of IgG in the patient serum sample as an assay verification step. The median fluorescent intensity (MFI) is proportional to the amount of PE Tracer that is bound to the human IgG, which is proportional to the amount of IgG antibodies bound to the corresponding microparticle regions.

For quantitation, the ten assays (together as part of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent) each utilizes a predefined lot specific Master Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the RFID tag on the reagent cartridge. The first time a reagent cartridge of a new lot of Aptiva CTD Essential is placed in the instrument, it must be calibrated. The Aptiva CTD Essential Calibrators are sold separately. The calibration process utilizes the 6 Calibrators that are included in the Calibrators kit to adjust the predefined lot specific dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P Master Curves into instrument specific Working Curves. These Working Curves are used to calculate FLU (or $| \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m } \mathsf { L }$ for dsDNA) values from the measured MFI. The Working Curves are lot and instrument specific and stored in the system for use with any reagent cartridge from that lot. The lot specific calibration expires 6 months from the last time the calibration was performed, and re-calibration is required.

Aptiva CTD Essential Calibrators and Aptiva CTD Essential Controls are sold separately.

The Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent kit contains the following materials:

One (1) Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent Cartridge contains the following materials to process 250 determinations:

a. dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P, and Control paramagnetic particles, preserved.

# Analytical performance characteristics

# Quantitation and units of measure

For quantitation, the Aptiva CTD Essential reagent utilizes predefined lot specific Master Curves per each analyte, that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent cartridge RFID. The analyte specific Master Curves are generated at Inova for each reagent lot, where in-house Master Curve Standards with assigned FLU (or IU/mL for dsDNA) values are run multiple times. The resulting MFI values generated are used to create a unique 4 parameter logistic (4PL) curve for each of the ten analytes. The IgG control microparticle will flag low concentrations of IgG in the patient serum sample as an assay verification step. This microparticle also has an in-house standard which is run each time a new reagent lot is manufactured. The MFI produced by this standard is used as the cut-off threshold for the IgG control microparticle for that reagent lot. These four parameters of the analyte curves, as well as the MFI cut-off for the IgG control microparticle are embedded in the reagent cartridge RFID.

# Reproducibility Studies

# Reproducibility between sites (instruments)

Reproducibility (between sites) of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent was evaluated on 5 samples for dsDNA, RNP, Jo-1 and Ribo-P, and 6 samples for Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl-70 and Centromere, by testing according to CLSI EP05-A3 Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, at three different sites. Samples were run in replicates of 5, once a day, for 5 days, to generate 25 data points per sample, per site. Data were analyzed with the Analyse-it for Excel method evaluation software to calculate between site precision.

Acceptance criteria: Reproducibility Between-Site $\% \mathrm { C V } \colon < 1 2 \%$

# Reproducibility between lots

Reproducibility (between lots) of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent was evaluated on 6 samples for dsDNA and Ro52, 5 samples for Sm, Ro60 and Jo-1, and 4 samples for RNP, SS-B, Scl-70, Centromere and Ribo-P, by testing according to CLSI EP05-A3 Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, using three different lots. Samples were run in replicates of 5, once a day, for 5 days, to generate 25 data points per sample, per lot, 75 data points total for each sample. Data were analyzed with the Analyse-it for Excel method evaluation software to calculate between lot precision. Acceptance criteria: Reproducibility Between-Lot $\% { \mathrm { C V } } { : < 1 2 \% }$

# Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The LoB, LoD, and LoQ of the dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P assays in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent were calculated separately by a study according to CLSI EP17- A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline- Second Edition.

Study protocol for LoB:

Four blank samples were prepared using three lots of Aptiva system rinse. The blanks were run in replicates of five, once a day for 3 days, on two reagent lots as a “serum” sample type for a total of 60 data points generated on each lot. The LoB was determined for each assay, on each reagent lot separately with the Analyse-it for Excel software’s Reference Interval function, at the 95th percentile, using the nonparametric method for all analyses.

The table below summarizes the LoB for all the analytes in CTD Essential Reagent.

# High concentration hook effect

To assess hook effect, 2 samples for dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere, and Ribo-P were tested at three increasing 2-fold serial dilutions from the standard 1:44.4 dilution used by the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent. All FLU values above the analytical measuring ranges of the ten assays are theoretical and were mathematically calculated using the 4 parameters of their respective calibration curves. All samples showed increase in FLU values as dilution factor became more concentrated, thereby confirming that high positive specimens above the AMR do not show hook effect up to for the for dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere, and Ribo-P in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent.

# Linearity

The linearity of the AMR was calculated separately for all analytes (dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Ribo-P and Centromere) as part of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent.

The linearity for all analytes was evaluated by a study according to CLSI EP06-Ed2, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ Edition. The study used three human serum samples for the dsDNA assay, four human serum samples for the RNP, Sm, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P assays and 5 samples for the Ro60 assay with various antibody concentrations in $10 \%$ increments (from $0 \%$ to $90 \%$ of sample) to obtain values that cover the entire AMR of each analyte. The dilutions were assayed in duplicates. Results were analyzed according to the guideline performing regression analysis and identifying the best fitting polynomial.

Acceptance criteria:

• Allowable deviation from linearity: $+ / - 1 5 \%$ or $+ / - 0 . 7 5$ FLU $( + / - 5 . 2 5 \ : | \mathrm { U / m L }$ for dsDNA)   
• Slope: 0.9-1.1

These data demonstrate that the entire analytical measuring range for dsDNA (AMR: 2.30 – 814.10 IU/mL), of RNP (AMR: 0.50 – 181.99 FLU), Sm (AMR: 0.25 – 256.00 FLU) Ro52 (AMR: 0.25 – 196.27 FLU), Ro60 (AMR: 0.50 – 583.72 FLU), SS-B (0.40 – 195.84 FLU Scl-70 (0.50 – 371.24 FLU), Jo-1 (0.25 – 153.60 FLU) Centromere (AMR: 0.50 – 187.69 FLU) and Ribo-P (AMR: 0.25 – 86.86 FLU) have proven to be linear.

# Interference

The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second Edition. A set of three human serum specimens, one positive, one near the cutoff and one negative sample were tested using the following endogenous interfering substances (bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglycerides, cholesterol, rheumatoid factor IgM and human IgG) and exogenous interfering substances (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, prednisone, warfarin, diltiazem, azathioprine, sildenafil, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and heparin). All interferents were spiked into every serum specimen and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicates with the Aptiva CTD Essential assays (dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P). Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to control samples.

Acceptance criteria for the interference studies were $8 5 \% - 1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or $\pm \ 1 5 \%$ of the cut-off $( \pm 0 . 7 5 $ FLU or $\pm 4 . 0 5 1 \mathrm { U / m L }$ for dsDNA) difference, whichever is greater.

The Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent did not show interference with bilirubin up to $1 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ , hemoglobin up to $2 { \mathrm { ~ m g / m L } }$ , triglyceride up to $1 0 0 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , cholesterol up to $3 3 2 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , RF IgM up to $1 5 3 . 4 \ : | \mathrm { U / m L }$ and human IgG up to $3 5 m g / \mathrm { m L }$ . The Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent did not show interference up to $2 1 . 9 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ibuprofen, $1 5 . 6 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ acetaminophen, $0 . 0 0 9 9 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ prednisone, $7 . 5 \ \mathrm { \ m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ warfarin, $0 . 0 9 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ diltiazem, $0 . 2 5 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ azathioprine, $0 . 2 7 1 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ sildenafil, $5 4 . 9 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ cyclophosphamide, $1 . 1 2 5 \ : \mathrm { m g / m L }$ mycophenolate mofetil and 330 units/dL heparin.

Note: Rituximab was not evaluated for interference with the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent.

# Sample Stability and Handling

For the all analytes included in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent (dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P) three samples were tested. The samples used for this study were achieved by combining high and low antibody level to yield their desired reactivity. All samples were tested in duplicates for up to 21 days while stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ , up to 48 hours while stored at room temperature, and after repeated freeze/thaw cycles up to 5 cycles. Results were compared to those obtained on control samples (time zero / zero cycles).

Acceptance criteria: percent recovery is between $8 5 \substack { - 1 1 5 \% }$ for positive samples, and between $8 0 - 1 2 0 \%$ for negative samples $( < 5 . 0 0$ FLU or $< 2 7 . 0 0 1 \mathrm { U / m L }$ for dsDNA).

All samples fulfilled the acceptance criteria at each time point for each condition. Based on these results, we recommend that samples may be stored up to 24 hours at room temperature, up to 14 days at ${ 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } } \mathsf C$ and can be subjected to up to 4 freeze/thaw cycles (when samples are stored at or below $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ ).

# Reagent Stability

# Shelf life

To establish the initial claim for shelf life, accelerated stability studies were performed for 5 weeks at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $\pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ , where one week is equal to six months at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ .

Accelerated stability testing was performed on each of the following sealed components to establish initial stability claim:

Aptiva CTD Essential microparticles – 3 lots • Rehydration Buffer – 3 lots

Each week a new sealed component was placed in the incubator, and all components were tested at the end of the experiment together with the one that was stored at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ . The recovery of the measured values was calculated for each time point (compared to those obtained with $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ stored reagent). All calculations were performed by comparing results of sealed components stored at $5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ (control) to those stored at $3 7 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ (test) for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, where one week is equal to six months at $5 \pm$ $3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . Linear regression analysis was performed between recovery values and the number of days. For each component tested, linear regression analysis was performed separately on each bead in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent (dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere, Ribo-P and Control Bead).

Acceptance criteria for two-year preliminary expiration dating: With regression analysis, the lower and upper $9 5 \%$ Cl interval of the regression line is between $80 \%$ and $120 \%$ recovery at day 28 (week 4).

All components tested fulfilled the acceptance criteria above, therefore, two-year expiration dating was assigned to each component.

# In-use (onboard) stability

Reagent Cartridge

To establish the in-use stability of the Aptiva CTD Essential reagent cartridges, one lot of reagent cartridge was tested using human serum samples for all analytes. The specimens were tested periodically for 45 days. At day 21 the reagent cartridge was recalibrated, and a cartridge specific Working Curve was generated. Percent recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values, and linear regression analysis was performed by plotting percent recovery against the number of days. The claim was established using the following criteria (using the one that is fulfilled first):

- The stability claim is established at the actual measurement day proceeding the day when the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line reaches $8 5 \%$ or $1 1 5 \%$ recovery, or   
- At the actual measurement day preceding the day when $2 2 \%$ of the recovery data, (3 data points) is $\leq 7 5 \%$ or $2 1 2 5 \%$ recovery.

All data obtained fulfilled the acceptance criteria established.

The in-use (onboard) stability of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent was set at 36 days, with an 18 day recalibration.

# Real time stability

Real time stability testing has been scheduled to be performed every three or six months on the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagents kit, to verify the two-year expiration that was assigned based on accelerated stability studies. Results for the first time point at 6 months will be available in Q1 2022.

A negative sample, a low positive sample, and a high positive sample will be tested at each time point.   
- Acceptance criteria: results should fall within their respective ranges.

# Cut-off, reference range

The following cutoff is used for both the RNP, Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl-70, Centromere and Ribo-P assays in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent:

Negative <5.00 FLU Positive ≥5.00 FLU

For the dsDNA assay, the following cutoff is used in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent:

Negative <27.00 IU/mL Indeterminate 27.00 – 35.00 IU/mL Positive ≥35.00 IU/mL

The reference population for establishing the reference interval for the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent is outlined as follows:

The dsDNA, SS-B, Ro60, Ro52, Sm, RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo- $\cdot \mathsf { P }$ assay cut-offs were determined using 120 samples from reference subjects consisting of 16 patients with celiac disease, 18 patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, 25 patients with infectious diseases, 7 patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), 2 patients with PBC/autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), 8 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), 1 patient with PSC/AIH, 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 13 patients with Lyme disease.

All specimens were the same matrix (human serum) as specified in the Intended Use. All specimens were unaltered. The cut-off values were established in accordance with CLSI EP28-A3c: Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline - Third Edition. The Analyse-it for Excel software was used to make the calculations. The distribution of the results was nonnormal (Shapiro-Wilk $\mathsf { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1 $ ), therefore the non-parametric percentile method was used. NOTE: For each assay, when a sample is proven to have antibodies that yield a positive result using another FDA cleared assay, the sample is excluded from the analysis.

For dsDNA, the cut-off was established based on equal or greater than the 95th percentile of the results obtained on the reference subjects, along with the results of 13 samples from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, to ensure optimal differentiation between dsDNA positive and negative samples. The cutoff for dsDNA has been established at 454 MFI and was assigned a value of $3 5 . 0 0 1 \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

For Sm, the cut-off was established based on equal or greater than the 95th percentile of the results obtained on the reference subjects, along with the results of 13 samples from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, to ensure optimal differentiation between Sm positive and negative samples. The cut-off has been established at 200 MFI and assigned a value of 5.00 FLU.

For Ribo-P, the cut-off was established based on equal or greater than the 95th percentile of the results obtained on the reference subjects, along with the results of 13 samples from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, to ensure optimal differentiation between Ribo-P positive and negative samples. The cutoff has been established at 350 MFI and assigned a value of 5.00 FLU.

For RNP, the cut-off was established based on equal or greater than the 95th percentile of the results obtained on the reference subjects, along with the results of 7 samples from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 5 samples from patients with mixed connective tissue disease, to ensure optimal differentiation between RNP positive and negative samples. The cut-off has been established at 211 MFI and was assigned a value of 5.00 FLU.

# Clinical performance characteristics

# Clinical sensitivity, specificity

A cohort of characterized samples, none of which were used for establishing the reference range, was used to validate the clinical performance of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent. The clinical validation study included 1269 samples from patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS, $\mathsf { n } = 1 4 1$ ), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, $\mathtt { n } = 2 3 0$ ), systemic sclerosis (SSc, $\mathsf { n } = 2 1 7$ ), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, $\mathsf { n } \mathop { = } \mathsf { 9 } \mathsf { 1 }$ ), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM, $\scriptstyle 1 = 2 0 0$ ) and control samples $\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 3 9 0 )$ from patients with various types of autoimmune and infectious diseases.
