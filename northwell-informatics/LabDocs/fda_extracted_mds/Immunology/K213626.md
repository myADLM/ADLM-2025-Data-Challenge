# 8.3. Test Principles:

An immunometric immunoassay technique is used. AFP present in the sample reacts with a biotinylated antibody (sheep anti-AFP) bound to streptavidin on a microwell. Unbound sample is removed by washing. In a second incubation a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- labeled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-AFP) binds to the immobilized AFP. Unbound materials are removed by washing.

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of AFP present.

# 9. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

\*Repeatability (formerly called within-run precision) was determined using two replicates per run. \*\*Within Lab precision was determined using a single reagent lot and a single ca libration.

b. Linearity/assay measuring range: The linearity was established in accordance with the CLSI protocol EP06.

# Linearity/Measuring Range

<table><tr><td>VITROS System</td><td>Measuring (Reportable) Range</td></tr><tr><td>5600</td><td>0.800-500 IU/mL</td></tr></table>

d. Dilution Recovery

Serum samples with concentrations greater than the measuring range may be diluted up to 4000‑fold (1 part sample with 3999 parts diluent) with the VITROS High Sample Diluent A. Dilutions of up to 1:400 (1 part sample with 399 parts diluent) may be performed automatically on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System, using the VITROS High Sample Diluent A Reagent Pack.

e. Traceability:

Calibration of the VITROS AFP test is traceable to in-house reference calibrators which have been calibrated against the First International Reference Preparation 72/225.

f. Detection Limits:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the VITROS AFP test is $0 . 4 7 6 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $( 0 . 5 7 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ), determined consistent with CLSI document EP17. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the VITROS AFP test was determined to be $0 . 8 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $( 0 . 9 6 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ ) at $20 \%$ CV. The Limit of Blank (LOB) is $0 . 2 2 9 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

g. Analytical Specificity:

# Known Interferences

The VITROS AFP test was screened for interfering substances at AFP concentrations of approximately $4 . 8 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $\mathrm { 5 . 8 1 \ n g / m L ) }$ and $1 9 . 2 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ( $2 3 . 2 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ following CLSI EP07 and EP37. Of the compounds tested, none were found to cause a bias of $> 1 0 \%$ . Refer to “Specificity” for a list of compounds that did not show interference.

# Other Limitations

The results from this test should be used and interpreted only in the context of the overall clinical picture.   
• Heterophile, as well as human anti-animal antibodies (most common being human antimouse antibodies or HAMA) in serum or plasma of certain individuals are known to cause interference with immunoassays. The anti-animal antibodies may be present in blood samples from individuals regularly exposed to animals or who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy. Results inconsistent with clinical observations indicate the need for additional testing.   
• For changes in tumor marker concentrations during therapy: o Progressive disease is defined by an increase of at least $2 5 \%$ . Sampling should be repeated within two to four weeks for additional evidence. o Partial remission is defined as a decrease of at least $50 \%$ in the tumor marker concentrations.   
• Different test methods cannot be used interchangeably. A change to the test used during serial monitoring of a patient should be accompanied by additional sequential testing to confirm baseline concentrations. The results reported to the physician must include the identity of the AFP test used.   
• Certain drugs and clinical conditions are known to alter AFP concentrations in vivo. For additional information, refer to one of the published summaries.

# Substances that do not Interfere

The substances listed in the table below were tested with the VITROS AFP test following CLSI EP07and EP37 and found not to cause bias $> 1 0 \%$ at AFP concentrations of approximately 4.80 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ $( 5 . 8 1 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ and $1 9 . 2 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ( $2 3 . 2 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ at the test concentrations shown.

i. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Accuracy was evaluated consistent with CLSI document EP09. The plot and table show the results of a method comparison study using patient (serum) samples analyzed on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System using the candidate VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack compared with those analyzed using the cleared predicate VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack. The relationship between the 2 methods was determined by Weighted Deming regression

k. Conversion Factor Change

A study published in Clinica Chimica Acta 96 (1979) 59-65)1 established the correspondence between the international unit defining activity of the WHO standard ( I.U.) and the mass units as $1 \ \mathrm { I . U . } = 1 . 2 1 \ \mathrm { n g }$ of AFP ( $\mathrm { C I } { = } 1 . 0 2$ -1.43). The standard preparation has been investigated in two collaborative studies using several Reagent Pack methods, such as radioimmunoassay, single radial immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis.1, 2 Six laboratories estimated that one IU approximately equals 1.21 (1.02 – 1.43) nanograms of AFP1 .

For the Predicate VITROS AFP Reagent Pack AFP concentrations are quoted in $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ or $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .   
Conversion between units is made using the formula: result in $\mathrm { { n g / m L ^ { = } } }$ result in $\mathrm { I U / m L x 1 } . 0 4$ .

Efforts to harmonize this conversion factor between manufacturers are ongoing and the National Cancer Institute is using the 1.21 conversion factor. The adoption of the 1.21 conversion factor aligns the modified VITROS AFP Reagent Pack to the other manufacturers already using the 1.21 conversion factor.
