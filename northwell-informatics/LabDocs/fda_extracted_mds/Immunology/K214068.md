Dear Angels Roma:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

# INSTRUMENT PROCEDURE

The Quantia IgE assay file must be installed on the ARCHITECT c System prior to performing the assay.

For detailed information on assay file installation and viewing and editing assay parameters, refer to the ARCHITECT System Operations Manual, Section 2.

For information on printing assay parameters, refer to the ARCHITECT System Operations Manual, Section 5.

For a detailed description of system procedures, refer to the ARCHITECT System Operations Manual.

# SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING

# Suitable Specimens

Serum: Use fresh serum collected by standard venipucture techniques. Ensure complete clot formation has taken place prior to centrifugation. Centrifuge according to tube manufacturer’s instructions to ensure proper separation of serum blood cells. Gel separator tubes were not tested.

Some specimens, especially those from patients receiving anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy, may take longer to complete their clotting processes. Fibrin clots may subsequently form in these sera and the clots could cause erroneous test results.

Plasma: Use plasma collected by standard venipuncture techniques. The acceptable anticoagulanants are sodium EDTA, potassium EDTA, sodium heparin, lithium heparin, and citrate. Ensure centrifugation is adequate to remove platelets. Centrifuge according to tube manufacturer’s instructions to ensure proper separation of plasma from bloods cells. Gel separator tubes were not tested.

For total sample volume requirements, refer to the ASSAY PARAMETERS sections of this package insert and Section 5 of the ARCHITECT System Operations Manual.

Guder et al.8 suggest storage of frozen specimens at ${ \bf - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for no longer than the time interval cited above. However, limitations of laboratory equipment make it necessary in practice for clinical laboratories to establish a range around ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for specimen storage. This temperature range may be established from either the freezer manufacturer’s specifications or your laboratory standard operating procedure(s) for specimen storage.

NOTE: Stored specimens must be inspected for particulates. If present, mix and centrifuge the specimen to remove particulates prior to testing.

# SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

Representative performance data are provided in this section. Results obtained in individual laboratories may vary.

# Linearity

Linearity was assessed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocol NCCLS EP6-A.12 The reportable range of the Quantia IgE assay is 25.0 to $1 0 0 0 . 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# Linearity

A study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP06 2nd ed. Two high-analyte samples (human serum IgE at approximately 1040.1 and $1 0 1 8 . 1 \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ and 2 zero-analyte samples (IgEdepleted serum) were combined at different proportions to make 2 linearity panels that each consisted of samples with concentrations evenly distributed across the intended analytical measuring interval.

The assay demonstrated acceptable linearity across the analytical measuring interval of 20.0 to $1 0 0 0 . 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# Limit of Quantification (LOQ)

The LOQ of the Quantia IgE assay is $2 5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The LOQ was determined using dilutions of the 100 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ level of the Quantia IgE Calibrator prepared in physiologic saline. The LOQ is defined as the

Lower Limits of Measurement A study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP17-A2. The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) values are summarized below. These

lowest analyte concentration that can be measured with a within-run CV below $20 \%$ and the recovery is within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of expected value.

# Limit of Detection (LOD)

The LOD of the Quantia IgE assay is $1 2 . 9 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , calculated by running 30 replicates of saline. LOD is defined as the mean concentration of an analyte-free sample $^ { + 2 }$ SD, where SD is the within-run standard deviation.

a The LoB represents the 95th percentile from ${ \mathfrak { n } } \geq$ 60 replicates of zero-analyte samples.

b The LoD represents the lowest concentration at which the analyte can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability based on $\mathbf { n } \geq 6 0$ replicates of lowanalyte level samples.

c The LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at which a maximum allowable precision of 20 $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and a maximum allowable bias of $20 \%$ were met and was determined from $\mathrm { n } \geq 6 0$ replicates of

low-analyte level samples and where the assay is linear.

A study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP05-A3. Testing was conducted using 3 lots of the Quantia IgE reagent, 1 lot of the Quantia IgE Calibrator, 1 lot of the Quantia Ferritin/Myoglobin/IgE Control, and 1 instrument. Two controls, 1:1 mixture of control I and II, and 2 serum panels were tested in a minimum of 2 replicates, twice per day on 20 days.

Additional testing was conducted with 3 native serum pools using the same number of reagent, calibrator, and control lots and instruments utilized in the 20-day study. The 3 serum panels (Panel A, B, and C) were tested in a minimum of 2 replicates, twice per day on 12 days.
