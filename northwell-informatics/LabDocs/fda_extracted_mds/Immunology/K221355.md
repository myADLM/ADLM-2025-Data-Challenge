# Device Description

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack (test) is performed using the VITROS CA 125 II Reagent Pack and VITROS CA 125 II Calibrators on the VITROS 5600 System.

An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the reaction of OC 125 present in the sample with a microwell coated with biotinylated Antibody (Mouse monoclonal anti-OC 125) bound to Streptavidin, and a Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labelled antibody conjugate (Mouse monoclonal anti- OC 125). Unbound (HRP)-labeled anti-OC 125 antibody conjugate is removed by washing.

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of OC 125 present in the sample.

VITROS CA 125 II Reagent Pack contains:

1 reagent pack containing:

100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-OC 125 defined antigen, binds ${ > } 3 2 . 5$ U OC 125 defined antigen/well) $9 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$ assay reagent (buffer containing bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin and antimicrobial agent) $9 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$ conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti-OC 125 defined antigen, binds $\geq 5 4 2$ U OC 125 defined antigen $/ \mathrm { m L }$ ) in buffer with bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin and antimicrobial agent.

VITROS CA 125 II Calibrator contains:

• 1 set of VITROS CA 125 II Calibrators 1, 2, and 3 (OC 125 defined antigen in buffer with bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent, $1 . 7 5 \mathrm { m L }$ ); nominal values 24.0; 130 and 875 U OC 125 defined antigen/mL   
• 24 calibrator bar code labels (8 for each calibrator)

# Other Limitations

• The results from this or any other diagnostic test should be used and interpreted only in the context of the overall clinical picture.

Heterophilic antibodies in the serum or plasma of certain individuals may cause interference with immunoassays. These antibodies may be present in blood samples from individuals regularly exposed to animals or who have been treated with animal serum products. Results which are inconsistent with

# VITROS CA 125 II Reagent

Traditional 510(k)

clinical observations indicate the need for additional testing.

• Individuals receiving mouse immunoglobulin by parenteral routes may produce anti-mouse antibodies. Serum from such individuals may produce erroneous results.

• The VITROS CA 125 II has no high dose hook effect up to $3 4 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

• The VITROS CA 125 II test is not recommended as a screening procedure to detect cancer in the general population.

Different test methods cannot be used interchangeably. OC 125 defined antigen in a given patient sample determined with different tests and from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in test methods and reagent specificity. A change to the test used during serial monitoring of a patient should be accompanied by additional sequential testing to confirm baseline concentrations. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the CA $1 2 5 \ \mathrm { H I }$ test used.

• CA 125 test concentrations are elevated in $1 \%$ of healthy individuals and may be elevated in diseases other than ovarian carcinoma, including both benign and malignant disorders. CA 125 test concentrations greater than or equal to $3 5 \mathrm { \ U / m L }$ may be found in patients with non-malignant conditions, such as pericarditis, cirrhosis, severe hepatic necrosis, endometriosis (Stages II-IV), first trimester pregnancy, and ovarian cysts or in patients with non-ovarian malignancies, such as uterine carcinoma, hepatoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and lung cancer.

A CA 125 test concentration below $3 5 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ does not indicate the absence of residual ovarian cancer because patients with histopathologic evidence of ovarian carcinoma may have CA 125 test concentrations within the range of healthy individuals. Clinical decisions should not be based on a VITROS CA 125 II test concentration below $3 5 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

The test should not be performed until at least three weeks after the completion of primary chemotherapy and at least two months after abdominal surgery. This is recommended because it is not clear what effect, if any, these procedures may have on the CA 125 test concentration.

• For changes in tumor marker concentrations during therapy:

• Progressive disease is defined by an increase of at least $2 5 \%$ . Sampling should be repeated within two to four weeks for additional evidence.

• Partial remission is defined as a decrease of at least $50 \%$ in the tumor marker concentrations.

• Certain drugs are known to alter CA 125 concentrations in vivo. Please consult one of the published summaries for details.

# Dilution

The dilution recovery and dilution imprecision product requirements were met for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack. Serum or plasma (EDTA or heparin) samples with concentrations greater than the measuring range may be automatically diluted on the system up to 20‑fold (1 part sample with 19 parts diluent) by the VITROS 5600 Integrated System with the VITROS High Sample Diluent B Reagent Pack prior to test. Refer to the VITROS High Sample Diluent B Reagent Pack instructions for use.

# Expected Values

Adult Reference Interval   
The adult reference interval was validated following CLSI document EP28-A3c Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline – Third Edition.

The number of test results from 60 healthy female and male blood donors that fell outside the current reference interval claim of ${ \bf \gamma } { > } 3 5 \mathrm { U / m L }$ are shown in Table 1, for each reagent lot and instrument combination. As no more than $10 \%$ of the test results were outside the current limit, the reference interval claim of the current VITROS CA $1 2 5 \ \mathrm { H I }$ will be transferred to the updated VITROS CA 125 II Reagent Pack.

# Traceability of Calibration

Calibration of the VITROS CA 125 II test is traceable to in-house reference calibrators which have been value assigned to correlate to another commercially available test.

# Method Comparison

Accuracy was evaluated consistent with CLSI documents Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples. 3rd ed. CLSI guideline EP09c; and Evaluation of Total Analytical Error for Quantitative medical laboratory Measurement Procedures. 2nd ed. CLSI guideline EP21.

Accuracy was evaluated consistent with CLSI document EP09. The plot and table show the results of a method comparison study using patient serum samples analyzed on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System compared with those analyzed using the VITROS CA 125 reagent pack. The relationship between the 2 methods was determined by Passing Bablok regression.
