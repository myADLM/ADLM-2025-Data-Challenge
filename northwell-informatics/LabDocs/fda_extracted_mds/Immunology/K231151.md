Dual 510(k) CLIA Waiver for Kenota 1 Total IgE: 510(k)Summary

Solution to allow the sample to flow along the membrane to the test line containing immobilized mouse anti-human IgE that captures the human IgE in the test sample. This immune complex is captured by mouse anti-(human IgE) IgG bound to the fluorescent reporter. The fluorescent test signal is directly proportional to the level of IgE in the sample. Excess Europium-antibody conjugates are captured at the control line, which consists of immobilized rat anti-mouse kappa light chain IgG.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Kenota 1 (instrument)

2. Specimen Identification:

Capillary whole blood is the only specimen type for Kenota 1 and the samples are loaded into the instrument one sample at a time.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The Kenota 1 processes fresh fingerstick whole blood samples collected in a blood collector coated with lithium heparin anticoagulant (Minivette POCT lithium-heparin green plunger $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , Sarstedt)) and transferred to the syringe assembly of the Kenota 1 Sample Collection Kit (SCK) for the Kenota 1 Total IgE. The syringe assembly is manually loaded into the Kenota 1 by the operator.

4. Calibration:

The Kenota 1 is factory calibrated. The Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge is factory calibrated to align directly with the $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ International Standard for serum IgE (11/234), using a set of nine working calibrators with values assigned to 0, 2.17, 6.2, 18.6, 37.2, 93, 310, 620, and 930 kU/L.

# 5. Quality Control:

Performance of the Kenota 1 Total IgE is verified with the Kenota 1 Total IgE External Controls (EC). The EC is a stabilized control material used for verifying the performance of the Kenota 1, Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge, and intended users’ operational procedures. Results of the external control session are not interpreted by the operator but by the Kenota 1 instrument. If the external control session fails, the Kenota 1 is automatically locked out and the operator is instructed to contact Kenota Support. The external control session is required

b. Within-laboratory precision study for evaluation of variability of instruments

Instrument-to-Instrument variability was evaluated using three Kenota 1 instruments with one cartridge lot using fresh venous whole blood samples collected in lithium-heparin anticoagulant-coated blood collection tubes. The study included three operators (one operator for each instrument). In the study, the total IgE concentration was measured using one lot of the Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge in five replicates for each instrument/operator two times per day for five days (5 days $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ runs x 3 instruments x 5 replicates $= 1 5 0$ replicates per sample).

An estimate of repeatability was determined using 355 fresh fingerstick whole blood samples covering the analytical measuring interval (AMI) that were collected in the Minivette POCT lithium-heparin tubes. The study was conducted in three CLIA-waived sites in the U.S. and the testing was performed by a total of eleven (11) untrained operators, including three untrained operators at Site 1, three untrained operators at Site 2, and five untrained operators at site 3. Two different operators each collected a separate fingerstick whole blood from the same patient and tested the sample on two (2) or three (3) Kenota 1 instruments at each site with a single lot of Kenota 1 total IgE Cartridge. Variability of two fingerstick numerical results was calculated for each patient in five semi-quantitative intervals. The SD for each semi-quantitative interval was calculated as the SD averaged over patients from the interval. The results of the repeatability evaluation are presented in the table below.

3. Interference and Cross-reactivity:

Dual 510(k) CLIA Waiver for Kenota 1 Total IgE: 510(k)Summary

a. Interference

Interference was evaluated according to CLSI document EP07, 3rd Edition and EP37 by testing human lithium-heparin venous whole blood samples at two IgE levels (low and high) for potential interfering substances. Each test sample was spiked with a known amount of potentially interfering substances and analyzed at a minimum of six replicates. The recovery was calculated by comparing test samples spiked with the potential interferents to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. When interference was detected at the initial single dose testing, a dose-response assessment was conducted to identify the amount of the interfering substance with $< \pm 1 0 \%$ difference between the test and control sample. No significant interference was observed $( \leq \pm 1 0 \%$ difference between the control and spiked sample) for Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge up to the concentrations of the potential interfering and cross-reacting substances tested as shown in the tables below.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

i. Traceability: The Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) working calibrators are traceable to the primary reference material WHO 3rd International Standard Human IgE (11/234).

ii. Kenota 1 Total IgE Test Cartridge (Reagent) Stability: A real-time stability study for the Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline CLSI EP25-Ed2. Three human plasma samples (low, medium, and high) were tested using three lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge paired

Dual 510(k) CLIA Waiver for Kenota 1 Total IgE: 510(k)Summary with Kenota 1 Developing Solution on four Kenota 1 instruments (1 to 3 instruments per storage time point) to evaluate assay performance of the cartridge at multiple time points. As a worst-case scenario, each reagent lot was prestressed to environmental test conditions that simulated potential winter $\left( - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ and summer $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ transport profiles for 24 hours and then stored at $2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ through the duration of the stability period. Results support the claimed reagent shelf-life stability for 5 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

iii. Kenota 1 Total IgE External Controls (EC) Stability:

A real-time stability study for the EC was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline CLSI EP25-Ed2. Two EC samples (low and high) were tested using three lots of EC with one lot of the Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge on one Kenota 1 at multiple time points. Each EC lot was stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ (recommended storage condition) or under prestressed to environmental test conditions at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours and then stored at - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ through the duration of the stability period. Results support the claimed EC shelflife stability for 5 months at ${ } - 2 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

iv. Kenota 1 Sample Collection Kit (SCK) and Kenota 1 Developing Solution (DS) Stability:

A real-time stability study for SCK paired with DS was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline CLSI EP25-Ed2. Two human venous whole blood samples (low and high) were tested using four lots of SCK and four lots of DS with one lot of the Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge on one Kenota 1 instrument at multiple time points. Two EC-DS lot pairs were stored at $3 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (recommended storage condition at $1 5 \mathrm { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ or under prestressed to environmental test conditions that simulated potential winter $\left( - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ and summer $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ transport profiles for 24 hours and then stored at $3 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ through the duration of the stability period. Results support the claimed SCK and DS shelf-life stability for 5 weeks at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# 6. Detection Limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) studies were conducted in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.

i. Limit of Blank (LoB) The LoB was evaluated with three different venous whole blood samples with total IgE concentrations ${ < } 3 \mathrm { \ k U / L }$ and one surrogate whole blood matrix with no IgE used as the individual blank samples. Each blank /very low sample was tested in ten replicates on two Kenota 1 instruments for 3 days (one run per day), using two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge to obtain a total of 120 replicates (4 samples x 10 replicates x 3 days $=$ 120 replicates) per reagent lot. The LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile of the

Dual 510(k) CLIA Waiver for Kenota 1 Total IgE: 510(k)Summary measurements for each of the lots tested and determined to be $1 . 5 \mathrm { k U / L }$ and $1 . 9 \mathrm { k U / L }$ for the two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge. The LoB of Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge was determined $1 . 9 \mathrm { k U / L }$ .

ii. Limit of Detection (LoD) / Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) The LoD and LoQ were determined using four individual low venous whole blood samples. Each LoD sample was tested in ten replicates, for each of the two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge, one run per day for three days to obtain a total of 30 replicates per sample in each reagent lot. The LoD was calculated as the $\mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5 / $ (1 - [1/4(B-K)]) x SD of the replicates for the low level samples as $4 . 4 \ : \mathrm { k U / L }$ and $3 . 9 \mathrm { k U / L }$ for the two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge. The LoQ was calculated to be 4.7 and $5 . 0 \mathrm { k U / L }$ for the two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge. The claimed LoD is $5 \mathrm { k U / L }$ and the claimed LoQ is $5 \mathrm { k U / L }$ .

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

Not applicable

8. Accuracy (Blood Collector / Instrument):

The performance of blood collector was evaluated by recovery of test samples run on the Kenota 1 instrument. Fresh venous whole blood was collected using two lots of Minivette POCT Lithium-heparin, $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ (Sarstedt). Five blood collectors in each lot were used to collect venous whole blood and prepare two test samples (low at $\sim 5 0 \mathrm { { k U / L } }$ and high at $\sim 4 5 0$ kU/L) for measuring recovery of IgE. The Standard IgE (3rd International Standard for serum IgE, 11/234) was spiked into the test samples and the recovery was analyzed by the ‘measured increase of IgE’ over ‘expected increase of $\mathrm { I g E } '$ . The recovery bias was $< \pm 1 0 \%$ across two blood collector lots for the samples run on the Kenota 1.

# 9. Carry-Over:

Control and test carryover conditions were evaluated across four Kenota 1 instruments that tested a venous whole blood sample in the ‘very low’ category $( 1 1 . 4 \mathrm { k U / L } )$ immediately after testing a sample in ‘above measuring interval’ category $1 8 7 5 \mathrm { k U / L }$ measured by the predicate). The IgE level was measured in five consecutive cycles of testing ‘above measuring interval sample – very low sample’ for each instrument. There was no carry-over between tests run on four instruments.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Dual 510(k) CLIA Waiver for Kenota 1 Total IgE: 510(k)Summary

A method comparison study was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline $\mathrm { E P 0 9 c }$ . $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ Ed. The subjects were recruited as representative of the intended use population, for patients with eczema or atopy coming in for regular appointments to the allergy specialty care clinics. Individuals with skin damage, burns or scars at the site of venipuncture on both arms were excluded. Patients provided fresh fingerstick whole blood collected by a total of eleven untrained operators at three CLIA-waived sites in the US using Minivette POCT lithium-heparin tubes for the Kenota 1 Total IgE System. The same patients provided venous whole blood collected by phlebotomists for the comparator at the same three CLIA-waived sites in the US. A total of 411 eligible subjects aged 6 to 80 years participated in the study. Of these 411 subjects, there were 50 subjects excluded / missed due to withdrawal or failed fingerstick / venipuncture specimen collection. There were additional four (4) subjects with invalid test results due to human or instrument errors. Therefore, 357 samples were used for comparison analysis. The semi-quantitative analysis for the test result categories is summarized in the table below where cells in green color present allowable candidate test categories and the cells in the orange color present “erroneous” categories (Limits of Erroneous Results, LER) where a difference between the candidate category and the comparator values is more than $\pm 1$ category.

# F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

The Kenota 1 Total IgE is intended to be used at Point-of-Care (POC) sites, including allergist / immunologist offices with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Certificate of Waiver. Operational limits of the Kenota 1 Total IgE were tested in the following series of studies:

# 1. Temperature and Relative Humidity

A study was performed to evaluate whether performing tests using a Kenota 1 and reagents at a wide range of temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions could lead to erroneous results. If the room temperature and/or humidity conditions exceed the instrument’s limit ( $1 7 { - } 2 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ humidity), the instrument’s failure alert check is triggered. The instruments and cartridges were exposed to seven test conditions (see Test condition 2) to 8)

# Dual 510(k) CLIA Waiver for Kenota 1 Total IgE: 510(k)Summary

below) and the test was performed using two fresh venous whole blood samples $( \sim 4 5 \mathrm { k U / L }$ and ${ \sim } 4 5 0 \mathrm { k U / L }$ ) in 10 replicates:

1) 2) Control condition: $2 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , RH $3 7 \%$   
Test condition: $1 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ RH $6 \%$   
3) Test condition: $1 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ RH $8 8 \%$   
4) Test condition: $2 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \ \mathrm { R H } \ 1 1 \%$   
5) Test condition: $2 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { R H } 8 6 \%$   
6) Test condition: $1 6 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \ \mathrm { R H } \ 3 2 \%$   
7) Test condition: $2 9 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ RH $22 \%$   
8) Test condition: $2 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ RH $9 6 \%$

The test results were within $\pm 5 \%$ bias in Test Condition 2), 3), and 4) compared to Control condition 1) above. The run was not initiated when the instrument detected the room temperature and/or humidity conditions exceeding the instrument’s limit $1 7 - 2 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ humidity) in Test condition 6), 7), and 8) above and the tablet screen displayed an error message (e.g., ‘Room Temperature Too High’). This study demonstrates that the instrument reports valid results only when the testing room temperature and/or humidity conditions are within the instrument’s operating specification ( $1 7 { - } 2 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ RH) based on the instrument’s failure alert check.

# 2. Instrument on vibrating surface

A study was performed to evaluate whether performing tests using the Kenota 1 instrument in environments subject to vibrations leads to erroneous results. A fresh venous whole blood sample $( \sim 2 0 0 \mathrm { k U / L } )$ was tested in 24 replicates each on a surface with no/minimal environmental vibrations and a surface with extreme environmental vibrations. An unbalanced centrifuge was run at 3000 RPM. A vibration meter was used to detect the vibrations for 1 minute at specific locations that were measured at $0 . 3 3 \mathrm { g }$ on the top of the centrifuge, $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { g }$ on the table next to the centrifuge, $0 . 0 7 \mathrm { g }$ on the side of the instrument, and $0 . 1 6 \mathrm { g }$ on the top of the instrument. This study demonstrates the test is unaffected $( < \pm 5 \%$ bias) by running a test on a vibrating surface.

# 3. Instrument on tilted surface

A study was performed to evaluate whether performing tests using the Kenota 1 instrument in environments subject to tilted surface leads to erroneous results. If the tilted surface beyond its specification limit is detected, the instrument’s failure alert check is triggered. A fresh venous whole blood sample $( \sim 1 7 5 \mathrm { k U / L } )$ was tested in a control condition (no tilt $/ 0$ degree, 24 replicates), slight tilt (2 degrees, 24 replicates), moderate tilt (4 degrees, 3 replicates), and high tilt (8 degrees, 3 replicates). The test results were $< \pm 5 \%$ bias on

Dual 510(k) CLIA Waiver for Kenota 1 Total IgE: 510(k)Summary front/back and left/right tilt at $\pm 2$ degrees. The run was not initiated when the instrument detected a front/back and left/right tilt at $\pm 4$ degrees and $\pm 8$ degrees, showing an error message “Tilt Error” on the tablet screen. This study demonstrates that the test reports valid results only when the instrument is placed up to 2-degree tilted angle.

# 4. Sub-optimal lighting conditions

A study was performed to evaluate whether operators perform testing under varying lighting conditions. A fresh venous whole blood sample was $( \sim 2 0 0 \mathrm { k U / L } )$ tested in 48 replicates in each of the following conditions:

1) Control condition: office lighting $( \cong 5 0 0 \ : \mathrm { l u x } )$   
2) Test condition: direct sunlight $( \cong 1 0 0 0 0 \mathrm { l u x } )$   
3) Test condition: dark $( \cong 5 \mathrm { l u x } )$

The test results were $< \pm 5 \%$ bias in Test Condition 2), and 3) compared to Test condition 1) above. This study demonstrates that the test operators were able to perform the tests in various lighting conditions.

# 5. Mechanical impact on instrument

A study was performed to evaluate whether mechanical impacts ( $1 0 0 \mathrm { g }$ object dropped five times from $3 0 \mathrm { c m }$ ) to the Kenota 1 instrument could lead to biased results. A fresh venous whole blood sample $\left( { \sim 2 2 0 \mathrm { k U / L } } \right)$ was tested in 24 replicates in each of the following conditions:

1) Control condition: no mechanical impact   
2) Test condition: mechanical impact during run initialization failure alert checks   
3) Test condition: mechanical impact during sample dispensing   
4) Test condition: mechanical impact during cartridge imaging

The test results were $< \pm 5 \%$ bias in Test Condition 2), 3), and 4) compared to Control condition 1) above. This study demonstrates that the test is unaffected by mechanical impacts on the instrument during different stages of testing.

# 6. Samples with air bubbles

A study was performed to determine the ability of the Kenota 1 instrument’s failure alert check to detect the presence of air bubbles in the sample after the instrument mixes the sample in the SCK. Air bubbles introduced into the SKC syringe are typically resolved by the sample mixing performed by the instrument and unresolved bubbles are assessed by a failure

Dual 510(k) CLIA Waiver for Kenota 1 Total IgE: 510(k)Summary alert check, preventing SCK with large bubbles from beginning a run. If air bubbles exceeding the size limit are detected by the instrument, the failure alert check is triggered. A fresh venous whole blood sample $( \sim 1 9 4 \mathrm { k U / L } )$ was tested in 24 replicates with (Test condition) and without (Control condition) induced air bubbles. For the test condition, air bubbles were intentionally introduced until two sample syringes passed the run initialization failure alert checks (approximately $1 { - } 4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { L } }$ air bubble size). The test results were $< \pm 5 \%$ bias in Test condition compared to Control condition. This study demonstrates that accurate results can be obtained if operators introduce air bubbles in the test sample up to approximately $4 \mu \mathrm { L }$ size.

# 7. Different cartridge positions within the sleeve

A study was performed to determine if the test results are affected by the location within the stack of cartridges in the sleeve. Each sleeve holds up to $1 5 \mathrm { K }$ enota 1 Total IgE Cartridges. A fresh venous whole blood sample $( \sim 2 0 0 \mathrm { k U / L } )$ ) was used for the test using cartridges in three different location categories (Low: position 1-5, Middle: position 6-10, High: position 11- 15). The sample was tested in 12 runs with 5 replicates per run that generated a total of 60 replicates per location category (e.g., 60 results from Low category). The average of test results was $< \pm 5 \%$ bias in comparison by the location category (Low, Middle, and High). This study demonstrates that the test results are unaffected by different cartridge positions within the sleeve.
