# Device Description

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack (test) is performed using the VITROS CEA Reagent Pack and VITROS CEA Calibrators on the VITROS 5600 System.

An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the reaction of CEA present in the sample with a microwell coated with biotinylated Antibody (Mouse monoclonal anti-CEA) bound to Streptavidin, and a Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labelled antibody conjugate (Mouse monoclonal anti- CEA). Unbound (HRP)-labeled anti-CEA antibody conjugate is removed by washing.

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the

Traditional 510(k)

luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of CEA present in the sample.

VITROS CEA Reagent Pack contains:

1 reagent pack containing:

100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-CEA, binds ≥8ng CEA/well);   
• $9 . 7 \mathrm { m L }$ assay reagent (buffer containing bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin and antimicrobial agent). $9 . 7 \mathrm { m L }$ conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti-CEA, binds ≥123ng CEA/mL).

VITROS CEA Calibrator contains:

1 set of VITROS CEA Calibrators 1 and 2 (human CEA in bovine serum with antimicrobial agent, $2 \mathrm { m L }$ ); nominal values 3 and $2 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L ( \mu g / L ) }$ • 16 calibrator bar code labels (8 for each calibrator)

# Intended Use Statement(s):

Rx ONLY

For in vitro diagnostic use only.

For the quantitative measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration in human serum and plasma (EDTA or heparin) using the VITROS 5600 Integrated System, to aid in the prognosis and management of cancer patients in whom changing concentrations of CEA are observed.

# Nonclinical Performance

Several nonclinical tests were performed.

# Stability Studies

Long term stability and on-board storage performance was evaluated consistent with methods based on CLSI EP25-A.

Long Term Stability: Four runs have been performed on each of 3 Lots at each time-point, monthly interval data supports a 52 week shelf-life.

On-board Stability: Three Lots of the VITROS CEA assay were stored opened refrigerated for up to 12 weeks. Four runs were performed on each Lot at each time-point for fresh and open, all results were acceptable and support the current claim of 8 weeks on-board stability.

# Precision

Precision was evaluated consistent with CLSI document EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline—Third Edition. Four (4) precision fluids, covering the analytical measuring interval, were evaluated for performance. For one reagent lot, two (2) replicates of each precision fluid were run on two (2) occasions per day for twenty (20) days, for a total of 80 data points per fluid.

The data presented are a representation of test performance and are provided as a guideline. Variables such as sample handling and storage, reagent handling and storage, laboratory environment, and system maintenance can affect reproducibility of test results.

\*Within-laboratory precision includes following components: repeatability, between-run, between-day and between-lot was determined using three reagent lots.

# Detection Capability

Detection studies for the VITROS CEA Reagent were evaluated consistent with CLSI document EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Edition. Four endogenous fluids containing no measurable carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were used for determining the LoB. The study design was 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day over 5 test days $= 2 0$ reps per test fluid $_ { \textrm { X 4 } }$ fluids $= 8 0$ replicates x 3 lots $= 2 4 0$ total replicates.

Five samples were used for establishing the LoD, which were targeted at 1 to 5 times the LoB concentration. The LoD samples were admixtures of serum samples containing endogenous CEA combined with CEA affinity stripped serum to achieve the approximate target CEA concentrations. The LoD fluids were used to determine the LoQ. All samples were run using three reagent lots on one VITROS 5600 System, 6 replicates per run, 2 runs per day over 5 test days $= 6 0$ reps per fluid $\texttt { X 5 }$ fluids $= 3 0 0$ replicates x 3 lots $= 9 0 0$ total replicates.

The observed Limit of Detection (LoD) for the VITROS CEA test is $0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ $( \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } )$ , determined consistent with CLSI document EP17. This supports the claimed LOD of $0 . 3 1 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ . The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the VITROS CEA test was designed to be less than or equal to currently claimed low end of the measuring range of $0 . 3 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } \left( \mu \mathrm { g / L } \right)$ at $20 \%$ CV. The observed LoQ at $20 \%$ CV was determined to be $0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } \left( \mu \mathrm { g / L } \right)$ , consistent with CLSI document EP17. The claimed LoQ is set at $0 . 3 1 \mathrm { n g / m L } ( \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$ . The representative LoB is $0 . 0 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# Linearity

Linearity studies were performed according to CLSI document $\mathrm { E P 0 6 2 ^ { n d } }$ edition. In a study with 13 levels and five replicates for each level on 1 reagent lot on one VITROS 5600 Integrated System, linearity was demonstrated from $0 . 2 2 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ $( \mathrm { u g / L } )$ to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ $( \mathrm { u g / L } )$ with deviations from linearity within $+ / - 1 4 . 3 \%$ .

# Other Limitations

• The VITROS CEA test is not recommended as a screening procedure for cancer detection.   
• Patients with confirmed carcinoma frequently have CEA levels in the same range as normal patients. Elevated levels of CEA may be found in smokers or patients with nonmalignant conditions. Based on these observations, CEA levels in serum and plasma, regardless of level, should not be interpreted as absolute evidence of the presence or absence of malignant disease. Certain drugs and clinical conditions are known to alter CEA concentrations in vivo. For additional information, refer to one of the published summaries. The results from this test should be used and interpreted only in the context of the overall clinical picture. Heterophile, as well as human anti-animal antibodies (most common being human antimouse antibodies or HAMA) in serum or plasma of certain individuals are known to cause interference with immunoassays. The anti-animal antibodies may be present in blood samples from individuals regularly exposed to animals or who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy. Results inconsistent with clinical observations indicate the need for additional testing.

# Dilution

The dilution recovery and dilution imprecision product requirements were met for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack. Serum or Plasma (EDTA or heparin) samples with concentrations greater than the measuring range will be reported as $> 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L ( \mu g / L ) }$ and may be automatically diluted on the system up to 100-fold (1 part sample with 99 parts diluent) by the VITROS 5600 Integrated System with the VITROS High Sample Diluent B Reagent Pack prior to test. Refer to the VITROS High Sample Diluent B Reagent Pack Instructions for Use.

# Expected Values

Adult Reference Interval   
The adult reference interval was validated following CLSI document EP28-A3c Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline – Third Edition.

The distribution of CEA values for healthy non-smokers $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 6 8 )$ ) and healthy smokers $( \mathrm { n } { = } 7 2 )$ ) showed equivalency to the expected values claim published in the Instructions for Use of the current US VITROS CEA

# High Dose Hook

The assessment was consistent with the high dose hook guidance found in CLSI document EP34. The high dose hook panel was prepared with VITROS High Sample Diluent B (HSDB), containing no measurable CEA, spiked with endogenous CEA antigen to produce a fluid with a concentration of approximately 546,000 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ( \mu g / L ) }$ . This fluid was diluted with VITROS HSDB to produce a set of ten fluids (the High Dose Hook Panel) with concentrations spanning between 273 and $5 4 6 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } )$ . The high dose hook panel samples were tested in singleton using one reagent lot on one VITROS 5600 System.

The updated VITROS CEA assay has a high dose hook claim of up to $8 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# Traceability of Calibration

The Calibration of the VITROS CEA assay is traceable to in‑house reference calibrators which have been value assigned to correlate to another commercially available test with reference to the 1st International Preparation 73/601.

# Method Comparison
