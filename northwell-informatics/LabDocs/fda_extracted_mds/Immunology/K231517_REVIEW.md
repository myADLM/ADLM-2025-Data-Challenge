# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack is supplied ready for use and contains:

• 100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-CEA, binds ${ \ge } 8$ ng CEA/well) $9 . 7 \mathrm { m L }$ assay reagent (buffer containing bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin and antimicrobial agent) $9 . 7 \mathrm { m L }$ conjugate reagent (Horseradish Peroxidase labeled mouse monoclonal anti-CEA, binds $\geq 1 2 3 ~ \mathrm { n g } \mathrm { C E A / m L } $ in buffer with bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent

VITROS CEA Calibrators are supplied ready to use and include:

• 1 set of VITROS CEA Calibrators 1 and 2 (human CEA in bovine serum with antimicrobial agent, $2 \mathrm { m L }$ ); nominal values 3 and $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$   
• Lot calibration card   
• Protocol card   
• 16 calibrator bar code labels (8 for each calibrator)   
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Signal Reagent   
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Universal Wash Reagent   
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products High Sample Diluent B   
• Quality control materials VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Reagent Pack Storage Box (optional) with desiccant

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack has been modified from the previously cleared assay which is susceptible to interference from biotin. The modification was made to allow the biotinylated antibody capture conjugate to be pre-bound to the well, which eliminates the risk of biotin interference.

# B Principle of Operation:

An immunometric immunoassay technique is used. CEA present in the sample reacts with a biotinylated antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-CEA) bound to streptavidin on a microwell. In the next step, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal antiCEA) binds to the immobilized CEA. Unbound materials are removed by washing. The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound and light produced is directly proportional to the concentration of CEA present in the sample.

# VII Performance Characteristics:

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack was evaluated by testing a panel of four serum sample pools on one VITROS 5600 System using three reagent lots. The CEA concentration of the samples were at 6.44, 40.8, 223 and $3 8 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Testing was performed with two replicates per run, two runs per day over 20 days, yielding a total of 80 measurements for each reagent lot. Imprecision was calculated by combining the data for three reagent lots $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 2 4 0$ datapoint per sample) and the results are summarized in the table below:

2. Linearity:

Linearity was evaluated per CLSI EP06, 2nd edition. A low pool of CEA stripped human serum sample and a high pool (CEA high patient sample), with a target dose above the top end of the measuring interval of $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , were mixed to create 13 levels ranging from

0.22 to $4 9 9 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each sample was tested in five replicates using one lot of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack on one VITROS 5600 System. For each level, the mean of the measured values, predicted value and the deviation from linearity were calculated. Predicted values were calculated using a best fitted straight line by a weighted least squares linear regression analysis. Percent deviations from linearity were calculated as differences between the observed values (mean values) and the predicted values divided by the predicted values. The study results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Dilution Range(ng/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Deviation fromLinearity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.22 to 499.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.043</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.067</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.999</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-4.4% - 4.5%</td></tr></table>

Linearity was demonstrated from $0 . 2 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $4 9 9 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with deviations from linearity within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . The results support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring range (AMR): $0 . 3 1 - 4 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Dilution Study:

To assess the automated dilution feature, samples were prepared with CEA concentrations targeted at $1 2 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 8 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $2 4 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $3 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $3 8 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $5 5 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and $7 5 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ by spiking recombinant CEA analyte into seven unique native human serum samples. These samples were tested in duplicate using one lot of each predicate device and the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack using the automatic 1:100 dilution performed by the analyzer. The $5 5 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and 75,000 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ samples were diluted 1:5 manually before being further diluted 1:100 by the analyzer. The value of each sample obtained from the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack was compared to the expected value and percent recovery was calculated. The results support an automatic sample dilution of 1:100 for the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack.

# Hook Effect

The hook effect was assessed using a high dose hook panel that was prepared with VITROS high sample diluent (HSDB) (containing no measurable CEA) spiked with endogenous CEA antigen to produce a sample with a concentration of approximately $5 4 6 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . This sample was diluted with VITROS HSDB to produce a set of 10 samples (the High Dose Hook Panel) with concentrations spanning between 273 and $5 4 6 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Samples were tested in singlicate using the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack on one VITROS 5600 System. The claim for the hook effect for the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent is up to $8 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

# Interference:

Potential interfering substances were tested for their ability to interfere with the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack using procedures recommended in the CLSI EP07-A3. Each potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substance was

tested at two analyte concentrations: $3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Test samples were spiked with the test substance and results were compared to matched control samples spiked with an equal volume of solvent (blank). The CEA in the test samples and control samples were measured in five replicates using each of three reagent lots on the modified VITROS Integrated 5600 System. The recovery was calculated by comparing measurements of the test and control samples. No interference $( \leq \pm 1 0 \%$ difference of test from control) for the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack was seen, up to the concentrations of the potential interfering substances tested as shown in the tables below.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Traceability:

The calibration of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack is traceable to NIBSC First International Reference Preparation 72/225.

# Stability:

Long term stability and on-board storage performance was evaluated consistent with methods based on CLSI EP25-A.

Shelf-life (Long Term) of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack was evaluated by using three lots of reagents stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . At each monthly interval, three serum samples with CEA concentrations of 5, 20 and $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were tested in four runs on each of three lots. The data of each sample at each testing time point were compared to the data of initial value tested at T0. The data support a shelf-life of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack up to 52 weeks when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

On-board stability of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack was evaluated using three lots of Reagent Packs and Calibrators that were stored opened on the instrument for up to 12 weeks. Four runs were performed by testing Calibrators and QC In-house Controls on each lot at each time point for fresh and open. The results support the claim of 8 weeks on-board stability.

# 6. Detection Limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack were verified based on the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.

The LoB was determined by testing four analyte stripped serum sample pools with three reagent lots. For each lot, samples were tested two replicates per run, two runs per day over five test days, resulting a total of 80 datapoints per lot. LoB was defined as the value

corresponding to the 95th percentile of the rank position of the distribution of values. The highest LoB value observed across three reagent lots was $0 . 0 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The LoD was determined by testing five samples containing CEA at one to five times the LoB concentration with three reagent lots. For each lot, the samples were run in six replicates per run, two runs per day, for five days, yielding a total of 300 datapoints per lot. The LoD was calculated using a parametric approach. The highest LoD value observed across lots was $0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The claimed LoD is $0 . 3 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The LoQ was determined based on the data from the LoD study described above, using precision profile approach, with goal of precision of $20 \%$ CV. The highest LoQ value observed across lots was $0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The result supports the claimed LoQ as $0 . 3 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

The Expected Values for the unmodified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack (predicate) was established based on the results of a study of 768 specimens obtained from healthy subjects and diseased patients.

To verify the expected results, serum samples from a total 68 healthy nonsmokers and 72 healthy smokers were tested in singlicate, on the VITROS 5600 System, using one lot of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack (candidate device), according to CLSI EP28-A3c. The results are summarized in the following table:
