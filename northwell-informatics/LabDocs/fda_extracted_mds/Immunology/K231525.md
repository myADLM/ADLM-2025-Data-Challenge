# Device Description

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 assay (test) is performed using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA $1 9 { - } 9 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Reagent Pack and VITROS CA 19-9 Calibrators on the VITROS 5600 System.

An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the simultaneous reaction of 1116- NS-19-9 defined antigen present in the sample with a microwell coated with biotinylated Antibody (Mouse monoclonal anti-1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen) bound to Streptavidin. In a second incubation a Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)- labelled antibody conjugate (Mouse monoclonal anti-1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen) binds to the immobilized 1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen. Unbound materials are removed by washing.

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The

VITROS CA 19-9   
Traditional 510(k)   
HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of 1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen present in the sample.

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9TM Reagent Pack contains:

1 reagent pack containing:

• 100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen, binds $\geq 4 9$ U 1116-NS19-9 defined antigen/well) $1 3 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$ assay reagent (buffer containing bovine serum, bovine gamma globulin and antimicrobial agent) $2 0 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti-1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen, binds ${ \ge } 3 2 6$ U 1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen $/ \mathrm { m L }$ ) in buffer with bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin and antimicrobial agent.

VITROS CA 19-9 Calibrator contains:

1, 2, and 3 (OC 1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen in buffer with bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent, $1 . 7 5 \mathrm { m L }$ ); nominal values 15; 60 and 700 U 1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen/mL   
24 calibrator bar code labels (8 for each calibrator)

# Nonclinical Performance

Several nonclinical tests were performed.

# Stability Studies

Long term stability and on-board storage performance was evaluated consistent with methods based on CLSI EP25-A.

Long Term Stability: Four runs have been performed on each of 3 Lots at each time-point, monthly intervals, data supports a 20 week shelf-life.

On-board Stability: Three Lots of the VITROS CA19-9 assay were stored opened refrigerated for up to 12 weeks. Four runs were performed on the each Lot at each time-point for fresh and open, all result were acceptable and support the current claim of 8 weeks on-board stability.

# Precision

Precision was evaluated on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System consistent with CLSI document EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline—Third Edition. Six (6) precision fluids, covering the analytical measuring interval, were evaluated for performance. For one reagent lot, two (2) replicates of each precision fluid were run on two (2) occasions per day for twenty (20) days, for a total of 80 data points per fluid.

The data presented are a representation of test performance and are provided as a guideline. Variables such as sample handling and storage, reagent handling and storage, laboratory environment, and system maintenance can affect reproducibility of test results.

\*Repeatability (formerly called within-run precision) was determined using two replicates per run. \*\*Within Lab precision was determined using a single reagent lot and a single calibration.

# Detection Capability

Detection studies for the VITROS CA 19-9 Assay were evaluated on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System consistent with CLSI document EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Edition. Four endogenous fluids containing no measurable 1116-NS-19-9 defined antigens (CA19-9) were used for determining the LoB. The study design was 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day over 5 test days $= 2 0$ reps per test fluid $\mathtt { x 4 }$ fluids $= 8 0$ replicates x 3 lots $= 2 4 0$ total replicates

Five samples were used for establishing the LoD, which were targeted at 1 to 5 times the LoB concentration. The LoD samples were admixtures of serum samples containing endogenous CA 19-9 to achieve the approximate target CA 19-9 concentrations. The LoD fluids were used to determine the LoQ. All samples were run using three reagent lots on one VITROS 5600 System,

6 replicates per run, 2 runs per day over 5 test days $= 6 0$ reps per fluid x 5 fluids $= 3 0 0$ replicates x 3 lots $= 9 0 0$ total replicates.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the VITROS CA 19-9 test is $1 . 4 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ , determined consistent with CLSI document $\mathrm { E P } 1 7 { \cdot } \mathrm { A } 2 ^ { 1 }$ . The Limit of Quantification (LoQ) for the VITROS CA19-9 test was designed to be less than or equal to $1 . 4 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ at $2 0 \% \mathrm { C V }$ . The existing LoB product claim of $1 . 0 5 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ has been verified.

# Linearity

Linearity was established in accordance with the CLSI document $\mathrm { E P 0 6 2 ^ { n d } }$ Edition. The linearity test panel was comprised of 16 levels, five replicates of each linearity level were run on three reagent lots on one VITROS 5600 Integrated System over 2 days.

# Dilution

The dilution recovery and dilution imprecision product requirements were met for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 Reagent. Serum or plasma (EDTA or heparin) samples with concentrations greater than the measuring range may be automatically diluted on the system up to 20‑fold (1 part sample with 19 parts diluent) by the VITROS 5600 Integrated System with the VITROS High Sample Diluent B Reagent Pack prior to test. Refer to the VITROS High Sample Diluent B Reagent Pack instructions for use. The 20-fold dilution has been demonstrated on samples with a concentration up to $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ .
