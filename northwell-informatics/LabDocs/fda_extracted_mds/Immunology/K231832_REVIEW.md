Other items needed to run the assay include the Access Myoglobin reagent packs, Access Myoglobin Calibrators, along with the UniCel DxI wash buffer II, and Lumi-Phos PRO substrate. It is intended for use on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer in a clinical laboratory setting.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Access Myoglobin assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay.

A sample is added to a reaction vessel with mouse monoclonal anti-myoglobin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, mouse monoclonal anti-myoglobin-biotin conjugate, and paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-biotin. Human serum myoglobin binds to the anti-myoglobin biotin conjugate and is immobilized on paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-biotin antibody, while the mouse anti-myoglobin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts specifically with a different antigenic site on the myoglobin molecule.

After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field, while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Studies were performed to determine the imprecision of the candidate device using a protocol based on CLSI EP05-A3.

The study was run on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers using three reagent lots, and three calibrator lots. Five (5) lithium heparin samples, with varying myoglobin concentrations were tested across two runs per day, over 20 or more days. The study met the minimum requirement of 80 replicates per sample on each instrument and reagent lot combination. Three commercial quality controls were run in duplicate on each day to verify the system was in control.

Results from one representative lot:

2. Linearity:

A study was performed to determine the linearity of the candidate device based on the recommendations in the CLSI $\mathrm { E P 0 6 - } 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Edition guideline. Eight lithium heparin samples ranging from $0 . 1 5 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (native) to $4 7 7 8 . 1 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were prepared by mixing a high sample spiked with human myoglobin and a native sample with a low concentration. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of four. The study was run using three reagent lots and three calibrator lots. The data were analyzed using a weighted linear regression model and the deviation from linearity did not exceed $10 \%$ . The data supports the claimed reportable range of $3 . 0 \mathrm { n g / L }$ to $4 0 0 \mathrm { n g / L }$ of myoglobin.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Interference was reviewed in K021229. The sponsor also provided information to support that biotin up to $1 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ does not interfere with the test. The following statement is included in the labeling. “Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of $\leq 1 { , } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ demonstrate a less than or equal to $10 \%$ change in results. Biotin concentrations greater than this may lead to incorrect Access Myoglobin results for patient samples.”

4. Assay Reportable Range:

The data provided support the sponsor’s claims that the reportable range of this assay is $3 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } - 4 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): Traceability was reviewed in k021229.

6. Detection Limit:

Studies were performed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation using protocols based on CLSI EP17-A2. LoB was determined to be $0 . 3 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The LoD was determined to be $0 . 8 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The LoQ was determined to be $1 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ based on a $20 \%$ CV performance goal.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not applicable

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was completed to compare the candidate device compared to the predicate device using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c-A3. A total of one hundred and fifty-five (155) lithium heparin plasma samples (11 were contrived with human myoglobin and 144 were native samples including 15 that were native pools) were evaluated in the method comparison study.

The study was run on three DxI 9000 instruments and three Access 2 instruments with three reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots.

The comparison between paired measurements was analyzed by fitting the observed Access Myoglobin Assay on DxI 9000 instrument (dependent variable, y) into a linear regression model, with the observed Access Myoglobin Assay on Access 2 values as the only independent variable (x, predicate) are shown below:
