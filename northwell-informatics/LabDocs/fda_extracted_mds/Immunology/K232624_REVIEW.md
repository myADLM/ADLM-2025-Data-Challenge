# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

Extension of the upper limit of the measuring range of the conventional CRP assay range (CRP1) defined in K212559.

# B Measurand:

C-reactive protein

# C Type of Test:

Quantitative immunonephelometric assay

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

CardioPhase hsCRP is an in-vitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative determination of C‑reactive protein (CRP) in human serum, and heparin and EDTA plasma by means of particle enhanced immunonephelometry using the BN II and BN ProSpec System. In acute phase response, increased levels of a number of plasma proteins, including C-reactive protein, is observed. Measurement of CRP is useful for the detection and evaluation of infection, tissue injury, inflammatory disorders and associated diseases. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements may be used as an independent risk marker for the identification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease. Measurements of hsCRP, when used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events, in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only For in vitro diagnostic use.

D Special Instrument Requirements:

BN II System and BN ProSpec

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

CardioPhase hsCRP reagent is ready-to-use and consists of a suspension of polystyrene particles coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies $( < 0 . 0 1 6 \ : \mathrm { g / L ) }$ specific to human CRP and preservatives.

Kit Contents:

• $5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5 \mathrm { ~ m L ~ }$ CardioPhase hsCRP Reagent -or$3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 \mathrm { ~ m L }$ CardioPhase hsCRP Reagent

Materials required but not provided:

N Rheumatology Standard SL   
N/T Rheumatology Controls SL/1 and SL/2 and/or Apolipoprotein Control Serum CHD   
N Supplementary Reagent/Precipitation   
N Diluent   
BN II Evaporation Stoppers (optional)   
Additional materials and supplies as described in the BN System Instruction Manual

# B Principle of Operation:

Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to human CRP are aggregated when mixed with samples containing CRP. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration. Two measuring range settings are available: the conventional CRP1 workflow $( 3 . 1 - 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ and the high sensitivity CRP2 workflow $( 0 . 1 6 - 1 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ).

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed to evaluate the comparability between the performance of the CRP1 method of the CardioPhase hsCRP on the BN II System and the RCRP Flex assay on the Dimension clinical chemistry system following CLSI EP09c. A cohort of 129 native serum samples was tested on one lot of the predicate and on three lots of the CardioPhase using the CRP1 method. Samples falling outside the measuring range of either assay were removed from the analysis and the results were determined by PassingBablok regression analysis. For each lot, the predicted bias at CRP concentrations of 10 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ , 150, $\mathrm { m g / L }$ and $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ was $\leq \pm 6 \%$ . The results of each lot are shown below:
