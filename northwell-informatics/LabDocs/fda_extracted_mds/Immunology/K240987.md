Dear Neha Desai:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Access sTfR assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels in human serum and plasma (heparin) using the Access Immunoassay Systems. This assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), and for the differential diagnosis of IDA and Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD).

This assay may also be used in conjunction with an Access Ferritin measurement to provide a calculated sTfR/log ferritin index. This index is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of IDA, and for the differential diagnosis of IDA and ACD.

# Device Name

Common Name: Access sTfR   
Trade Name: Access sTfR on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer   
Classification Name: Transferrin immunological test system   
Classification Regulation: [21 CFR 866.5880]

Predicate Device Device Name: Access sTfR 510(k) Numbers: k080634

# Device Description

Access sTfR: The sTfR assay reagent pack consists of two specific reagents: (R1a) paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin:biotinylated soluble transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody, proteins (mouse, goat, bovine), bovine serum albumin (BSA), $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide, and $0 . 1 7 \%$ ProClin 300; and (R1b) Monoclonal mouse anti-human soluble transferrin receptor alkaline phosphatase (bovine) conjugate, BSA, $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide and $0 . 1 7 \%$ ProClin 300. Two assay packs containing 50 tests per pack are provided for a total of 100 assay determinations.

The Access sTfR assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with paramagnetic particles coated with anti-sTfR antibody. During incubation, the sTfR antigen in the sample binds to the immobilized anti-sTfR antibody on the solid phase. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-sTfR antibody is then added and reacts with a different antigenic site on the sTfR molecule.

After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

# Intended Use

The Access sTfR assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels in human serum and plasma (heparin) using the Access Immunoassay Systems.
