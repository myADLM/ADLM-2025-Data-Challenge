This assay may also be used in conjunction with an Access Ferritin measurement to provide a calculated sTfR/log ferritin index. This index is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of IDA, and for the differential diagnosis of IDA and ACD.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only D Special Instrument Requirements: DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225)

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Each Access sTfR reagent kit contains two reagent packs (50 tests/pack). Each pack contains the following:

• R1a: Paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin: biotinylated soluble transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody, proteins (mouse, goat, bovine), BSA, $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide and $0 . 1 7 \%$ $\mathrm { P r o C l i n ^ { * } } 3 0 0$ . R1b: Monoclonal mouse anti-human soluble transferrin receptor alkaline phosphatase (bovine) conjugate, BSA, $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide and $0 . 1 7 \%$ ProClin 300.

# Materials needed but not supplied:

• Access sTfR Calibrators: six levels (0, 3, 10, 30, 80 and 150 nmol/L) Quality Control (QC) materials: o Access sTfR QC1 (10 nmol/L) o Access sTfR QC2 and QC3 (25 and 90 nmol/L) o Commercial control materials Substrate: Lumi-Phos PRO UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II Access Wash Buffer II (optional material for dilution)

The modification of the Access sTfR includes:

(a) a new substrate replacement (Lumi-Phos PRO)   
(b) run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer with an updated analytical measuring interval of $0 . 0 5 - 1 5 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

# B Principle of Operation:

The Access sTfR assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with paramagnetic particles coated with anti-sTfR antibody. During incubation, the sTfR antigen in the sample binds to the immobilized anti-sTfR antibody on the solid phase. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-sTfR antibody is then added and reacts with a different antigenic site on the sTfR molecule. After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

2. Linearity:

Linearity of the modified Access sTfR on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer was performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP06, 2nd Edition. Three dilution series were prepared by mixing one High serum sample with a Low serum sample. One dilution series included eight dilution levels covering the analytical measuring interval (AMI) of the modified Access sTfR $( 0 . 0 3 - 1 3 3 . 2 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ ). The second dilution series included dilution samples covering low end of AMI $( 0 . 0 2 - 2 8 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ ). The third dilution series included dilution samples covering high end of AMI $( 7 2 . 8 - 1 8 4 . 8 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ ). For all dilution series, the lowest samples were run in replicates of eight, and all other dilution levels were run in replicates of four on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer using one lot of reagents. For each level, the ‘measured value’ (mean sTfR nmol/L) was compared to its predicted value for deviation percentage using a weighted linear regression analysis. This deviation was then compared to the allowable deviation from linearity (ADL). The data showed the linearity interval from $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 8 4 . 8 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ with the deviations from linearity within $\pm 1 0 \%$ .

The results support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring interval (AMI): 0.05 – 150 nmol/L.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Refer to K080634

4. Assay Reportable Range: The reportable range is the same as the claimed analytical measuring interval (AMI): 0.05 – 150 nmol/L.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

a) Traceability:

The traceability was established in K080634. There is no change to the traceability of the modified Access sTfR.

b) Stability:

The Access sTfR and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged separately. Access sTfR kit stability was established in K080634. The proposed change is to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the Access sTfR with a new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO) for the assay run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The shelf-life claims and onboard stability claims of Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.

6. Detection Limit:

CLSI guideline EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the Access Ferritin.

a) LoB:

Five analyte depleted ultrafiltered samples (prepared from five unique native serum samples) were tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over three days using two modified Access sTfR reagent lots on two DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers $\mathrm { ( N } { = } 7 5$ datapoints for each reagent lot and each instrument). The LoB was determined based on the $9 5 \%$ nonparametric percentile of the replicates for each of the two reagent lots. The claimed LoB for the modified Access sTfR on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

# b) LoD:

Eight serum samples containing low levels of sTfR were tested in nine replicates per run, one run per day for five days using three modified Access sTfR on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. LoD was calculated from LoB $^ +$ “SD multiplied by the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the standard normal distribution”. The claimed LoD for the modified Access sTfR on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ .

# c) LoQ:

Thirteen serum samples containing low levels of sTfR were tested in replicates of nine per run, one run per day, over five total days on each reagent lot and instrument using three reagent lots and three instruments for a minimum of 40 total datapoints for each sample on each lot. A variance components model was used to estimate the within-run and within-laboratory (total) $\% C V$ for each sample on each instrument and reagent lot combination. The estimated LoQ of the modified Access sTfR was set to be the sTfR concentration which met the within-laboratory imprecision of $20 \%$ CV. The claimed LoQ for the modified Access sTfR on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.05 nmol/L.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

CLSI Guideline EP09c, 3rd Edition was followed to compare the modified Access sTfR on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device, the Access sTfR on the Access 2 Immunoassay System. A total of 200 deidentified serum samples were tested with three lots of modified Access sTfR on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers and three predicate reagent lots on three Access 2 instruments. Patient samples falling within the analytical measuring interval $( 0 . 0 5 - 1 5 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ were evaluated using Passing-Bablok method.
