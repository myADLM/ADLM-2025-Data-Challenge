2. Classification: II

3. Product code: JTN- Susceptibility Test Disc, Antimicrobial

4. Panel: 83 Microbiology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

These discs are used for semi-quantitative in vitro susceptibility testing by the agar disc diffusion test procedure of common, rapidly growing and certain fastidious bacterial pathogens. These include the Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Vibrio cholerae and, by modified procedures, Haemophilus infuenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci.

2. Indication(s) for use:

Use of Gemifoxacin $5 \mu \mathrm { g } .$ , BBL Sensi-Disc for in vitro agar diffusion susceptibility testing is indicated when there is a need to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to gemifloxacin. $5 \mu \ g$ has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed below, as described in the FDA approved drug insert for this antimicrobic.

Active In Vitro and in clinical infections against:   
Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant strains)   
Haemophilus influenzae   
Haemophilus parainfluenzae   
Klebsiella pneumoniae (many strains are only moderately susceptible)   
Active In Vitro against:   
Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only)   
Streptococcus pyogenes   
Acinetobacter lwoffi   
Klebsiella oxytoca   
Proteus vulgaris

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

Gemifloxacin exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations of $0 . 2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ or less against most $( > 9 0 \% )$ strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of gemifloxacin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms has not been established in adequate and well controlled clinical trials: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Acinetobacter lwoffi, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris.

For Streptococcus pneumoniae, use Mueller-Hinton Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood.   
For Haemophilus influenzae use Haemophilus Test Medium Agar.

For Prescription Use only.

4. Special instrument requirements:

None

# I. Device Description:

Gemifloxacin $5 \mu \ g$ BBL Sensi-Disc is prepared by impregnating high quality paper with accurately determined amounts of gemifloxacin supplied by the drug manufacturer. Each gemifloxacin disk is clearly marked on both sides with the agent (GEM) and drug content $( 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } )$ . Gemifoxacin cartridges each contain 50 impregnated disks that are paced as either a single cartridge in a single box, or in a package containing ten cartridges. Gemifloxacin disks are used for semi-quantitative in vitro susceptibility evaluations by the agar diffusion test method.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Ciprofloxacin $5 \mu \mathrm { g }$ , BBL Sensi-Disc

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): K874425

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) pharmaceutical approved package insert, developed during clinical trial studies, was used for Interpretive Criteria and QC expected Ranges.

# L. Test Principle:

Disks containing a wide variety of antimicrobial agents are applied to the surface of Mueller Hinton Agar plates (or Haemophilus Test Medium Agar for Haemophilus influenzae or Mueller Hinton Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood for Streptococcus species) inoculated with pure cultures of clinical isolates (Bauer-Kirby method). Following incubation, the plates are examined and the zones of inhibition surrounding the disks are measured and compared with established zone size ranges for individual antimicrobial agents in order to determine the agent(s) most suitable for use in antimicrobial therapy. The categorical interpretation [susceptible (S), intermediate (I), or resistant (R)] for the organism being tested with the antimicrobial agent is made by comparing zone diameters to those found in the respective organism tables of NCCLS Document M2 (“Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests) and of NCCLS Document M100 (“Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing”).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

(Descriptive characteristics were sufficient for this disc, because the drug studies, evaluated by CDER, generated the Interpretive Criteria and QC expected Ranges used for review of this device.)

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable (N/A)   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): N/A   
d. Detection limit: N/A   
e. Analytical specificity: N/A   
f. Assay cut-off:

N/A

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: N/A

b. Matrix comparison: N/A

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A

b. Clinical specificity: N/A

4. Clinical cut-off: N/A

5. Expected values/Reference range: Enterobacteriaceae $\geq 2 0$ (S), 16-19 (I), < 15 (R) Streptococcus pneumoniae $\geq 2 3$ (S), 20-22 (I), < 19 (R) Haemophilus spp. $\geq 1 8$ (S)

The Interpretative criteria in the manufacturer’s instructions for use are the same as recommended by the FDA/CDER in the approved pharmaceutical package insert. The manufacturer’s QC isolates and ranges also match the approved pharmaceutical package insert but also include QC ranges for $P$ . aeruginosa or $S$ . aureus that are absent from the pharmaceutical package insert but match what is recommended by NCCLS. All values will be included in the device package insert.

For some organism/antimicrobial combinations, the absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results other than “Susceptible”. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a “non-susceptible” category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

1. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
