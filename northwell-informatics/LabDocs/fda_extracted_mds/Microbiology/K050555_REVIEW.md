# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use: BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System: The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for in vitro quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration of gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non - Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.

The BD Phoenix™ GP Panel: The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro rapid identification (ID) of gram positive bacteria from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, other gram positive cocci and gram positive bacilli. The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is also intended for the quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.

2. Indication for use: This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic cefazolin at concentrations of $2 - 3 2 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ to the Gram positive ID/AST or AST only Phoenix™ panels.

3. Special condition for use statement: Prescription Use Only

For oxacillin susceptible staphylococci spp. only

4. Special instrument Requirements: Not Applicable

# I. Device Description:

The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cationadjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing $0 . 0 1 \%$ Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation goes to pink to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The AST has a final inoculum of $\mathrm { 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } C F U / m l }$ . The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI standards.

Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods

for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard.”

# L. Test Principle:

The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” which contain no antibiotic.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Fourteen isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site reproducibility demonstrating $59 5 \%$ reproducibility. The ten isolate study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

# c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or method):

CLSI recommended Quality Control strains were tested at the concentrations listed (see table below). The Phoenix results demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results. Five different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the CLSI recommendation and used to compare with the Phoenix™ results. Clinical testing was performed at four sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known results. Twelve hundred and ten isolates were tested but the following table demonstrates the performance of methicillin susceptible staphylococci only since the Phoenix™ generated oxacillin result if resistant will generate a resistant category for cefazolin as recommended by CLSI. The testing of methicillin resistant staphylococci although not included in the evaluation did demonstrate that resistance to cefazolin could be detected but for methicillin resistant isolates the interpretation of cefazolin is based on the oxacillin result.
