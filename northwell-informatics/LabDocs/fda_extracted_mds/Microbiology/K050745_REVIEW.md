4. Special instrument requirements: Not Applicable

# I. Device Description:

The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST-S Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST-S broth, which contains an AST- S indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST-S broth is a non-blood, cationadjusted broth containing purified water, Tween 80, pancreatic digest of casein, peptones and other additional supplements for optimization of streptococcal growth. After adding the indicator solution to the AST- S inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation goes to pink to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The resulting AST has a final inoculum of $\dot { 5 } \mathrm { { x } } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { { C F U / m l } }$ . The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).

Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard.”

# L. Test Principle:

The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” which contains no antibiotic.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Thirty three gram-positive on-scale organisms were evaluated for site to site and inter site reproducibility demonstrating $59 5 \%$ reproducibility. The ten isolate study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The CLSI recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™. The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The BD Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the CLSI recommended ranges most of the time. Both QC organisms had the same mode with the reference and the BD Phoenix™.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results. Five different instruments were used. Five Streptococcal strains were evaluated to demonstrate acceptable reproducibility performance.

EA-Essential Agreement NS-Not Susceptible

CA-Category Agreement

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Eval EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the reference and have on-scale EA.

There appears to be a trend where the reference device is slightly more resistant than the test device as reflected in the Accuracy and QC studies however results are

still within essential agreement.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Streptococcus pneumoniae <1 (S) Streptococcus spp. other than S. pneumoniae <1 (S)

The ability of the BD Phoenix™ system to detect resistance to vancomycin in Streptococcus organisms is unknown because resistant organisms were not available at the time of comparative testing.

The Interpretative criteria, QC isolates and the expected ranges are the same as recommended by CLSI. All values will be included in the package insert.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
