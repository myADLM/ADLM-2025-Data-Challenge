# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used with the ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \textregistered } 2$ Systems for the automated quantitative or qualitative susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.

The VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2$ Gram Positive susceptibility Card is intended for use with the VITEK 2 Systems in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus agalactiae to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed in the Online Product Information.

This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic Meropenem at concentrations at 0.5, 1, and $4 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ for a calling range of $\leq 0 . 5 - \underline { { > } } 1 6 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ to the $\mathrm { { V I T E K } } ^ { \textregistered } 2$ gram positive susceptibility CARD for the testing of oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis on the VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2$ Systems.

It is intended for use with the VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2$ and VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2$ Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.

3. Special condition for use statement(s): Prescription Use only.

4. Special instrument Requirements: Not applicable

# I. Device Description:

Each VITEK ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture medium. A suspension of organism is made in $0 . 4 5 \%$ sterile saline from a pure culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \textregistered } 2$ automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual filling and sealing operation. The VITEK® 2 monitors the growth by optical scanning of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours) of incubation at $3 5 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C }$ . Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) readings are performed every 15 minutes. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.

# L. Test Principle:

Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for an early reading of results with an option to incubate up to 18 hours if necessary. The VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2$ Susceptibility Card test is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \textregistered } 2$ systems. The MIC result must be linked to an organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category interpretation will be reported.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Ten on-scale gram positive organisms were tested in triplicate at each of three sites for three days for an overall inter and intra site reproducibility of $59 5 \%$ . This testing was performed using both the manual dilution of the inoculum and also the automatic dilution method.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method): Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. This included the two recommended QC organisms with the following results. Although the reference testing included more dilutions than the VITEK as demonstrated in the table, all testing provided results with the same mode.

Inoculum density control: Internal verification of the DensiChek was performed using 2 ATCC organisms and five instruments with 50 results available for each organism. The clinical sites also performed weekly standardization of the DensiChek used at that site. All recorded calibrated values were within acceptable parameters.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison of the clinical data was performed to the agar dilution reference method as described in the CLSI M7. All of the test organisms that provided results did so in ${ < } 1 6$ hours in the ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \textregistered } 2$ systems. Testing was performed using the automatic and manual dilution features. In the Clinical testing both oxacillin susceptible and oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus spp. was tested at three sites that included both clinical and challenge isolates. A total of 382 Staphylococci were tested but only 160 were oxacillin susceptible. The VITEK system reports Meropenem as resistant for all methicillin/oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus spp. as recommended by CLSI and FDA. The performance is based on evaluating methicillin/oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus spp. only.

The data in the table below reflects the testing performed on oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus species:

CA-Category agreement vmj-very major discrepancies min-minor discrepancies maj-major discrepancies

CA is when the interpretation of the VITEK ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ results agrees exactly with the interpretation of the reference method. The CA is acceptable when compared to the reference method as described in the FDA guidance document, “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”.

Essential agreement can not be determined since the VITEK® 2 system tests less than five dilutions of meropenem.

The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the manual and auto-dilution methods of inoculation with the following performance that demonstrated that there was little or no difference between the two inoculation methods. The table below contains the data from the two dilution methods of testing oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus species:
