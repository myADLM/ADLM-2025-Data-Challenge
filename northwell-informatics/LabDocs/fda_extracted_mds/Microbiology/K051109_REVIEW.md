# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non – Enterobacteriaceae and most gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus.

The BD Phoenix™ SMIC/ID and SMIC Panel is intended for the in vitro rapid identification (ID) and quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera Streptococcus.

2. Indication(s) for use: This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic erythromycin at concentrations of $0 . 0 1 5 6 - 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for testing Streptococcus spp. only.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

Results for Streptococcus viridans group have been excluded in the BD Phoenix™ therefore no results will be reported. An alternate method should be performed when these combinations are identified.

4. Special instrument requirements: Not Applicable

# I. Device Description:

The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST-S Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST-S broth, which contains an AST- S indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST-S broth is a non-blood, cationadjusted broth containing purified water, Tween 80, pancreatic digest of casein, peptones and other additional supplements for optimization of streptococcal growth. After adding the indicator solution to the AST- S inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation and incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The resulting AST has a final inoculum of $\dot { 5 } \mathrm { { x } } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { { C F U / m l } }$ . The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).

Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard.”

# L. Test Principle:

The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” which contains no antibiotic.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Twelve strains were evaluated for site to site and inter site reproducibility demonstrating $59 5 \%$ reproducibility. The ten isolate study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The CLSI recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™. The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The BD Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the CLSI recommended ranges most of the time. The modes of the BD Phoenix™ and reference method were different where the mode of the reference method was one well dilution higher than the BD Phoenix™ but still in the acceptable range.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID broth was equivalent to a $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland standard using the BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results. Five different instruments were used. Five Streptococcal strains were evaluated to demonstrate acceptable reproducibility performance.

EA-Essential Agreement CA-Category Agreement R-resistant isolates

maj-major discrepancies vmj-very major discrepancies min- minor discrepancies

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix $\mathbf { \Pi } ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ and the reference and have on-scale EA.

There appears to be a trend where the reference device is slightly more resistant than the test device as reflected in the QC and Accuracy studies however results are still within essential agreement.
