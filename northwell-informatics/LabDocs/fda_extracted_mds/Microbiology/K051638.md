Proprietary Name:

Inverness Medical TestPack $+$ Plus Strep A with OBC

Common Name:

Rapid immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Group A Streptoccocal antigen from throat swabs.

# Classification Name:

Streptococcus spp. serological reagent test systems to identify Streptococcus spp. from cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens.

# Predicate Device:

QuickVue® Dipstick Strep A Test

Description of the Device: Inverness Medical TestPack + Plus Strep A with OBC Strep A is an immunoassay employing sheep and rabbit polyclonal antibodies and gold colloid particles. The test device uses lateral flow technology; following antigen extraction, the test time is approximately 5 minutes (Reference Section Technological Characteristics")

The Streptococcal Group A specific antigen is extracted from the throat swab using Reagent 1 (2.0 M Sodium Nitrite (& Xylenol Orange) and Reagent 2 (1.0 M Acetic Acid). Following this, Reagent 3 (1.0 M Tris Buffer) is added to neutralise the acid formed by Reagents I and 2. The mixture is then dropped into the sample well of the reaction disc from which it migrates through the membrane until it reaches the End of Assay (EOA) Window. As the specimen extract migrates through the membrane, it mobilises the antibody-coated colloid (colloid coated with Rabbit Anti-Strep A antibody). If Group A Streptococcal antigen is present in the specimen it will form a complex with the antibody-colloid. The antibody colloid complex migrates through the membrane and is then captured by the Group A Strep antibody (Sheep polyclonal antibody) in the result window, providing a visual indication of the presence of antigen. The test can be read when the 'End of Assay' (EOA) window has turned pink / red. A pink / red Plus Sign (+) appearing in the result window indicates the presence of the Group A Strep antigen. A Minus Sign (-) indicates no antigen was detected. The device also includes integral Control features as described in "Technological Characteristics".

# Intended Use

The Inverness Medical TestPack + Plus Strep A with OBC Test is intended for the qualitative detection of Group A Streptococcal (Group A Strep) antigen in throat swab specimens from patients with suspected Group A Strep associated pharyngitis and for confirmation of presumptive Group A Strep colonies isolated on culture plates. The test is intended for Professional and Laboratory Use only.

# Technological Characteristics

The Inverness Medical TestPack + Plus Strep A with OBC Test which uses lateral flow technology, is similar in technology to other lateral flow immunoassay devices and has the same characteristics and intended use as the predicate device. However, it also includes additional integral control features, as described in this section.

The test employs both sheep and rabbit polyclonal antibodies and a direct label to visualize the immunoreaction indicating the presence of Group A Streptococcal antigen. In the test procedure a throat swab is subjected to a nitrous acid extraction to release Group A Streptococcal antigen. The extracted material is then added, dropwise, into the Sample Well of the Reaction Disc; the mixture migrates along the membrane and it mobilises the antibody-coated colloid (colloid coated with Rabbit Anti-Strep A antibody). If Group A Streptococcal antigen is present in the specimen it will form a complex with the antibody-colloid; the antibody colloid complex migrates through the membrane and is then captured by the Group A Strep antibody (Sheep polyclonal antibody) in the result window, providing a visual indication of the presence of antigen. The test can be read when the EOA window has turned pink / red. A pink / red Plus Sign (+) appearing in the result window indicates the presence of the Group A Strep antigen. A Minus Sign (-) indicates no antigen was detected.

The test includes the following integral control features:

Extraction Reagent Control is demonstrated by colour changes during the swab extraction process to indicate that Reagents 1, 2 and 3 are added in the correct order. Reagent 1 is pink, but will change to yellow when Reagent 2 is added. After adding Reagent 3 the solution changes back from yellow to pink. If either of the colour changes does not occur (pink to yellow or yellow to pink), the test is invalid.

Positive On Board Control (POS CTL √): As the specimen migrates along the test strip the deposited Strep A specific antigen (Analyte Bar) is resolubilised and is captured by the antiStrep A linked colloid. This complex continues to migrate and is bound by the anti-Strep A antibody to form the POS CTL(V). The POS CTL (v) indicates that both the antibody-colloid complex and capture antibody systems are functional. The POS CTL (vV) will appear if the test reagents are working correctly whether there is analyte present in the test specimen or not. The POS CTL $( \surd$ must appear for a valid test.

Negative On Board Control (NEG CTL X): Formation of the NEG CTL (X) in the Result Window indicates that the test specimen may contain a non-specific entity that could cause a false positive result. If the NEG CTL (X) appears in the result window, the test is invalid.

Minus sign (-): The appearance of the Minus sign (-) indicates that migration of the specimen has occurred across the reaction disc. The absence of the Minus sign (-) may indicate improper addition of extraction reagents or deterioration of the reaction discs. Any colour on the Minus sign (-) should be interpreted as a valid Quality Control result. The Minus sign (-) must appear for the assay to be valid.

End of Assay Window: The pink or red colour in the End of Assay Window after specimen addition indicates specimen migration has completed across the reaction disc, the test is complete and the result can be read. The pink/red colour must appear in the End of Assay Window for the assay to be valid.

A number of clinical and laboratory performance studies were conducted to determine the substantial equivalence of the test to other commercially available products for the qualitative detection of Group A Streptococcal antigen. These studies are as follows:

A multi-centre study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the test relative to established culture techniques, to establish substantial equivalence. Physicians' Office Studies were conducted to demonstrate that physician office personnel with diverse educational backgrounds, training and work experience can correctly perform and interpret the results of the test. Common bacterial organisms and potentially interfering substances, specifically over-the-counter sore throat products, were shown not to interfere with the test's performance.

The clinical performance and laboratory studies conducted demonstrate that the Inverness Medical TestPack + Plus Strep A with OBC is substantially equivalent in

# its intended use and performance to other diagnostic products for the detection of Group A Streptococcal antigen currently on the market.
