# I. Device Description:

The device consists of a chromatography strip membrane housed in a plastic frame. The membrane carries immobilized polyclonal anti-Strep A antibody coupled to colloidal gold dye particles. The test line contains sheep and rabbit anti-group A streptococcus antibody. The control line consists of an immobilized antibody to the anti-Strep A indicator antibody. At the control line, anti-Strep A indicator antibodyunbound/bound colloidal gold complexes form a control line in the control window which indicates that the device is functioning properly. Additionally, the test device consists of negative and positive on board controls that also serve as indicators that the test reagents are working correctly.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document referenced (if applicable): Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The test device is a lateral flow immunoassay consisting of a chromatography strip membrane housed in a plastic frame. The membrane carries immobilized sheep and rabbit polyclonal antibodies bound to colloidal gold dye particles. The Streptococcal Group A specific antigen is extracted from the throat swab using Reagent 1 and Reagent 2. Following this, Reagent 3 is added to neutralize the acid formed by Reagents 1 and 2. The mixture is then dropped into the Sample Well of the reaction disc and allowed to migrate through the membrane until it reaches the End of Assay Window. As the specimen extract migrates through the membrane, it mobilizes the Group A Strep antibody-coated colloid. If Group A Streptococcal antigen is present in the specimen it will form a complex with the antibody-colloid. The antibody colloid complex migrates through the membrane and is then captured by the Group A Strep antibody in the result window, providing a visual indication of the presence of antigen. The test can be read when the End of Assay Window has turned pink/red. A pink/red Plus Sign $( + )$ appearing in the Result Window indicates the presence of the Group A Strep antigen. A Minus Sign $\left( - \right)$ indicates no antigen was detected.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Within lot, between lot and between operator reproducibility were tested over a 3 day period. Five replicates of a negative, weak positive and positive control were tested by 3 operators on each occasion. No differences were seen between runs, and all controls produced the expected results.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method): Not applicable   
d. Detection limit: The test device has a minimum limit of detection of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ CFU/mL.   
e. Analytical specificity: The analytical specificity was determined by testing organisms expected to be found in the respiratory tract at $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ organisms per mL, with the exception of Staphylococcus aureus, which was tested at $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 9 } }$ organisms per mL. No cross reactivity was found when TESTPACK STREP A was tested with the bacteria listed below:   
Arcanobacterium haemolyticum   
Bordetella pertussis   
Candida albicans   
Corynebacterium diphtheria   
Escherichia coli   
Fusobacterium necrophorum   
Klebsiella pneumoniae   
Haemophilus influenzae

TESTPACK STREP A was found to perform as expected with both positive and negative samples in the presence of benzocaine and lidocaine, which are active ingredients found in a number of commercially available sore throat treatments.

$f .$ Assay cut-off

Using ATCC strain 12344, the limit of detection of TESTPACK STREP A (at which Streptococci were detected $1 0 0 \%$ of the time) was shown to be $1 . 0 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 5$ CFU/swab.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with gold standard:   
For visually positive SBA (Sheep Blood agar) plates, clinicians recorded the   
density and growth of presumptive group A Streptococcus colonies. The   
results from SBA culture and the corresponding TESTPACK STREP A rapid   
results are compared below:

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity:   
The clinical performance of TESTPACK STREP A was compared with standard sheep blood agar culture. In a multi-center field evaluation, two throat swabs were collected simultaneously from children and adults presenting to clinics with symptoms of pharyngitis. One swab was tested by clinic staff according to each clinic’s normal standard of care. The remaining swab was retained for evaluation of TESTPACK STREP A and was either tested   
immediately or stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in transport tubes prior to testing. All swabs were tested on the day of collection. Swabs retained for evaluation of   
TESTPACK STREP A were used to inoculate a sheep blood agar (SBA) plate, prior to being tested using the TESTPACK STREP A test. Plates were   
incubated for 24-48 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with $5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 \%$ CO2. Presumptive group A Streptococcus colonies on SBA culture plates were confirmed using a   
commercially available Streptococcal latex grouping test. Results were   
obtained for 369 (335 pediatric and 34 adult) patients, of which 125 were found positive by standard SBA culture and 244 were found negative. The sensitivity of the TESTPACK STREP A test was $9 7 . 6 \%$ when compared to standard SBA culture $9 5 \%$ confidence interval [CI]: $( 9 3 . 1 - 9 9 . 5 \% )$ . The specificity of the TESTPACK STREP A test was $9 8 . 4 \%$ when compared to standard SBA culture $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval [CI]: $( 9 5 . 9 \ – 9 9 . 6 \% )$ .   
b. Clinical specificity: Refer to (e.) above   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b is not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: The lower limit of detection of this assay is $1 . 5 \mathrm { { x } } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { { c f u / m l } }$ .

5. Expected values/Reference range: (Interpretive Criteria)

It is believed that approximately $1 9 \%$ of all upper respiratory tracts infections are caused by Group A Streptococcus. A prevalence of $3 3 . 7 \%$ was observed in the clinical performance evaluation of TESTPACK STREP A. Group A Strep associated pharyngitis displays a seasonal variation and is most prevalent during the Winter and early Spring. Certain populations are at higher risk of infection, for example, schools, nursing homes and hospitals. Clustering of cases occurs.
