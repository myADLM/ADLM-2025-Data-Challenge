Real-time PCR amplification and detection system for targeted Bacillus   
anthracis   
DNA sequences

Classification Name:

System: Microorganism differentiation and identification device; 21 CFR 866.2660

Instrument: Micro Chemistry Analyzer for Clinical Use; 21 CFR 862.2170, product code JJF

Reagent Kit: (B. anthracis) Unclassified

The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Anthrax Detection System is a fully integrated in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) system composed of the JBAIDS instrument with laptop computer, software, 2 different freeze-dried reagent assays (in one kit) for the qualitative detection of pathogenic Bacillus anthracis, and 3 different sample preparation protocols for isolating target DNA from whole blood, blood culture, or direct culture.

The JBADS instrument, using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, is a portable thermocycler and real-time fluorimeter. The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit is specially designed for PCR in glass capillaries using the JBAIDS instrument and hydrolysis probes for detection of the pXO1 plasmid (Target 1) and the pXO2 plasmid (Target 2) DNA sequences. A fragment of plasmid DNA is amplified using specific primers, creating amplicon. The amplicon is detected using a specific hydrolysis probe, which is a short oligonucleotide that hybridizes to an internal sequence of the amplified fragment during the annealing phase of the PCR cycle. This probe has the ${ \pmb 5 } ^ { \prime }$ and $_ { 3 } ,$ ends labeled with a reporter dye and a quenching dye, respectively. When the probe hybridizes to the specific DNA target, the Taq polymerase enzyme replicating the target-specific DNA hydrolyzes the probe, separating the two fluorophores, thus allowing the reporter dye to fluoresce.

The reagent kit contains 4 different types of freeze-dried reagent vials: Positive Controls, Negative Controls, Inhibition Controls, and Unknowns (used for testing the patient sample). Each JBAIDS run requires a Positive and Negative Control, and each sample is tested using both an Inhibition Control vial and an Unknown reagent vial. The characteristics of the amplification curves from the positive control (PC), negative control (NC), inhibition controls (IC) and from each unknown sample are analyzed by the JBAIDS Software, and results are reported as Positive, Negative, Inhibited or Uncertain. When PCs or NCs are unacceptable, the test results for all samples in the JBAIDS run are considered invalid and must be repeated.

Prior to testing, whole-blood samples are purified using the Idaho Technology IT $\mathbf { \ } l - 2 \mathbf { - } 3 ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ FLOW Sample Purification Kit (or validated equivalent), while blood culture and direct culture specimens are prepared using the IT $\pmb { l - 2 - 3 } ^ { \pmb { \operatorname { T M } } }$ EY SWIPE Sample Purification Kit (or validated equivalent). The resulting purified sample is added to an Unknown reagent vial and an Inhibition Control reagent vial, along with reconstitution buffer.

Intended Use: The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test system intended for the qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) detection of target DNA sequences on the pXO1 plasmid (Target 1) and the ${ \mathfrak { p } } \mathbf { X } { \boldsymbol { 0 2 } }$ plasmid (Target 2) from Bacillus anthracis. The system can be used to test human whole blood collected in sodium citrate from individuals suspected of having anthrax, positive blood cultures, and cultured organisms grown on blood agar plates. The JBAIDS Anthrax Target 2 assay is used as a supplementary test only after a positive result with the Target 1 Assay.

The JBAIDS Anthrax Target 1 and Target 2 Assays are run on the JBAIDS instrument using the Diagnostic Wizard.

Results are for the presumptive identification of B. anthracis, in conjunction with culture and other laboratory tests. The following considerations also apply:

The diagnosis of anthrax infection must be made based on history, signs, symptoms, exposure likelihood, other laboratory evidence, in addition to the identification of pXO1 and pXO2 targets either from cultures or from direct blood specimens.   
The assays have not been evaluated with blood from individuals without clinical signs or symptoms who were presumed exposed and who subsequently developed anthrax (inhalation or other forms of the   
disease), or from individuals with any form of anthrax (inhalational, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal).   
The level of plasmid targets that would be present in blood from   
individuals with early systemic infection is unknown.   
The definitive identification of B. anthracis from colony growth, liquid blood culture growth, or from blood specimens requires additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with public health or other authorities for whom reports are required.

The safety and effectiveness of other types of tests or sample types (not identified as "For in vitro diagnostic use") have not been established.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. The JBAIDS instrument is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed LightCycler® Instrument Version 1.2, cleared under K033734.

The predicate for the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit is traditional microbiological identification of the organism (preamendment methods) with confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control Laboratory Response Network Gamma Phage Lysis assay.

The following tables compare the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System with the predicate devices, the LightCycler and classical microbiology.

The JBAIDS instrument has technological characteristics nearly identical to those of the LightCycler, with the addition of ruggedization for the military environment. The JBAIDS instrument raises no new issues with respect to safety or effectiveness.

The predicate instrument (Roche LightCycler $\mathfrak { B }$ ) has been used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory Response Network for the detection of $B$ . anthracis. The CDC reported high sensitivity and specificity for $B _ { \cdot }$ ,anthracis detection with the predicate device when used with a ${ \mathfrak { H } } ^ { \mathfrak { N } }$ nuclease probe.1 The LightCycler $\otimes$ has also been used to detect B. anthracis using HybProbeTM probes with high sensitivity and specificity.2

Gamma phage is a specific bacterial virus used in the CDC Laboratory Response Network Gamma Phage Lysis Assay as an IVD culture plating method to distinguish B. anthracis from B. cereus and other Bacillus species. Lawns of suspected $B$ anthracis are inoculated with gamma phage. Clear or partially clear zones of bacterial lysis are indicative of B. anthracis. The result from this test is used in conjunction with culture

and other laboratory tests and clinical information as an aid in the diagnosis of systemic anthrax infection in individuals suspected of having the disease.

The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System is intended for the qualitative IVD detection of targeted DNA sequences on the pX01 plasmid (Target 1) and the pX02 plasmid (Target 2) from the B. anthracis pathogen, both of which are essential for the organism's pathogenicity. The system can be used to test human whole blood collected in sodium citrate tubes, positive blood cultures, and cultured organisms grown on blood agar plates. The results from the PCR tests are used in conjunction with culture and other laboratory tests and clinical information as an aid in the diagnosis of systemic anthrax infection in individuals suspected of having the disease.

The preamendment predicate device and the JBAIDS system have the same intended use; they both provide test results that aid in the diagnosis of anthrax when considered with other clinical and microbiological evidence.

The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System yielded positive results with both the Target 1 and Target 2 assays for 23/23 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ of the isolates included in the direct culture panel, and for 11/11 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ of the isolates included in the blood culture panel. For the direct culture and blood culture panels, all of the samples were confirmed as $B$ anthracis using standard biochemical identification and tested positive using the CDC Reference Laboratory Procedure for Identification of $B$ anthracis Using Lysis by Gamma Phage. In addition 67/68 $( 9 8 . 5 \% )$ whole blood samples spiked with limit of detection levels of live $B$ anthracis were correctly identified by the JBAIDS assay.

The analytic specificity evaluation of the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System was conducted with organisms that are phylogenetically related to $B .$ anthracis, as well as with unrelated organisms that are likely to be found in clinical samples.

Regardless of the sample matrix, the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System gave positive test results with both the Target 1 and Target 2 assays for all virulent strains of $B$ . anthracis tested.

23 of 23 virulent strains of B. anthracis included in the direct culture panel were detected by both assays. \* 1 1 of 11 virulent strains of B. anthracis included in the blood culture panel were detected by both assays.

The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System assays also proved to be very specific.

E $3 4 ^ { * }$ of 37 non- $\mathcal { B }$ anthracis strains tested in the direct culture panel were negative for both the Target 1 and Target 2 assays. This included 25 phylogenetically related organisms and 12 unrelated organisms that might be found in clinical samples. 12 of 12 non-B. anthracis strains tested in the blood culture panel yielded negative results with both the Target 1 and Target 2 assays. This testing panel included 2 phylogenetically related organisms and 10 unrelated organisms that might be found in clinical samples.

\*The assay did cross-react with 3 virulent forms of B. cereus; however, these specific isolates have been known to cause anthrax-like illnesses.3

In addition to analytic studies, a multi-site clinical trial was conducted. Due to the near absence of clinical samples from individuals with a diagnosis of systemic anthrax, the clinical trial was limited to an assessment of the system's clinical specificity. Blood samples from hospitalized subjects with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with inhalation or systemic anthrax and for whom a blood culture had been ordered, were tested for B. anthracis using the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System and the results compared to the gold standard technique of blood culture. All 150 subject samples yielded negative test results using the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection system and B. anthracis was not identified in any of the blood cultures. The clinical specificity of the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System is $100 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI, $9 8 \% - 1 0 0 \% )$ :

Based on the available gamma phage literature and this study, the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System appears to be as effective as the predicate assay. The JBAIDS software automatically interprets the assay results, reducing the opportunity for user error, and the freeze-dried assay format minimizes assay setup errors. An additional practical and safety advantage of the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System over the predicate comes from the nature of the positive controls of the two assays. The gamma phage assay requires live, nonvirulent B. anthracis while the JBAIDS system uses only nucleic acid as a positive control.

In summary the JBAIDS assay, while technologically distinct from the predicate, is as safe and effective as the predicate, is easier to use, and is highly sensitive and specific.
