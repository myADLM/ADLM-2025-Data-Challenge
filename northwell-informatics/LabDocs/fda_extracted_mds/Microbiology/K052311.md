B.Device Name: Formal/Trade Name:

VITEK® 2 Gram Negative Tigecycline $( \leq 0 . 5 - \geq 8$ $\mu { \boldsymbol { \mathfrak { g } } } / m ! )$

Classification Name:

Fully Automated Short-Term Incubation Cycle Antimicrobial Susceptibility Device, 21 CFR 866.1645

Common Name:

VITEK 2 AST-GN Tigecycline

C. Predicate Device:

VITEK 2 Gram Negative Ertapenem (K041982)

# D. 510(k) Summary:

VITEK® 2 Gram Negative Tigecycline is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Citrobacter freundi, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens. It is intended for use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial presented in VITEK 2 AST Cards is in concentrations equivalent by efficacy to standard method concentrations in mcg/ml. The VITEK 2 AST Cards are essentially miniaturized versions of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) microdilution methodology.

The bacterial isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration in $0 . 4 5 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 automatically flls, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manualfilling and sealing operation. The VITEK 2 systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours).

At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card

VITEK 2 Gram Negative Tigecycline demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the NCClS reference agar dilution method, as defined in the FDA Class Il Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA. Issued Feb. 5, 2003.

The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of VITEK 2 Gram Negative Tigecycline. An extemal evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates and stock challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the acceptability of VITEK 2 Gram Negative Tigecycline by comparing its performance with the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) agar dilution reference method. VITEK 2 Gram Negative Tigecycline demonstrated acceptable performance of $91 . 9 \%$ overall Category Agreement when compared to the agar dilution reference method. Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.

Dear Ms. Tenllado:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have dctermined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, thc enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordancec with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labcling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into cither class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may bc subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in thc Federal Register.

Pleasc be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
