DEVICE NAME:

BD ProbeTecTM ET Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Amplified DNA Assays

BD ViperTM System

PREDICATE DEVICES:

BD ProbeTecT ET System as cleared with the BD ProbeTecTM ET Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Amplified DNA Assays (K984631)

BD Viper™ Instrument (K023955)

# INTENDED USE:

The BD ProbeTec ET Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) Amplified DNA Assays, when tested with the BD ProbeTec ET System, use Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA) technology for the direct, qualitative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in endocervical swabs, male urethral swabs, and in female and male urine specimens as evidence of infection with C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or of co-infection with both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. Specimens may be from symptomatic or asymptomatic females and males. A separate Amplification Control is an option for inhibition testing (BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC Reagent Pack). The BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC assays may be performed using either the BD ProbeTec ET System or a combination of the BD ProbeTec ET System and BD Viper instrument.

The BD Viper System, when used with BD ProbeTecTM ET amplified nucleic assay(s) is intended for the in vitro detection of targeted organisms from specimens as identified in the assay-specific reagent package insert(s).

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC Amplified DNA Assays utilize homogeneous SDA technology as the amplification method and fluorescent energy transfer (ET) as the detection method to test for the presence of CT and GC DNA in clinical specimens.

The BD Viper System is comprised of a standalone lysing heater and a BD Viper Instrument. The BD Viper Instrument is comprised of five major subsystems: robotic pipetting arm, priming and warming heaters (two sets), liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor with touch screen, instrument software and two thermally controlled fluorescent readers.

# SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE:

This Special 510(k) is submitted for modifications to the subsystems previously cleared with the BD ProbeTec ET System (K984631) and the BD Viper Instrument (K023955). The BD Viper System is comprised of a standalone lysing heater and a BD Viper Instrument that combines the thermal, pipetting and optical subsystems from the previously cleared devices. Thus, there is no technology or intended use change associated with the device modification.

Modifications to the subsystems previously cleared with the BD ProbeTec ET System and BD Viper Instrument are as follows:

The risk analysis did not identify these changes as raising new issues of safety and effectiveness. The parameters listed below were evaluated in studies comparing the BD Viper System to the BD ProbeTec ET System or to expected results (spiked specimen studies). The BD ProbeTec ET Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) Amplified DNA Assays were used to evaluate clinical performance. The BD Viper System met acceptance criteria for all parameters.

Re: k052481 Trade/Device Name: BD ViperTM System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.3390 Regulation Name: Neisseria spp. direct serological test reagents Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: LSL Dated: November 15, 2005 Received: November 16, 2005

Dear Ms. Kistler:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
