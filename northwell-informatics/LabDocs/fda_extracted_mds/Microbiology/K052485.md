Re: k052485 Trade/Device Name: MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System BioDef™M Regulation Number: Unclassified Product Code: NWZ, KZQ, NPO Dated: December 8, 2005 Received: December 9, 2005

Dear Mr. Stimson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): k052485

Device Name: MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System BioDef™

Indications For Use:

The MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System for BioDef™M is intended to aid in the identification of Bacillus anthracis through the analysis of membrane fatty acids derived from cultured bacterial samples, using gas chromatography and pattern recognition software.

# Warnings:

The Sherlock BioDef system is not intended for use with spore preparations or materials other than colonies from trypticase soy agar (with $5 \%$ defibrinated sheep blood) that have been presumptively identified as Bacillus spp. BioDef cannot assess presence or absence of virulence factors. Accurate identification of $B$ anthracis is dependent on purity of isolates, length of incubation $( 2 4 \mathrm { h } )$ at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and media type, along with well-trained and experienced technicians. Only BBLTM $5 \%$ sheep blood agar has been validated for identifying $B .$ anthracis with the MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System for BioDef™. The definitive identification of $B$ anthracis from colony growth requires additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with public health or other authorities to whom reporting is required. Identification of organisms other than $B$ anthracis in the Sherlock BioDef's system's BTR library database has not been evaluated.

Prescription Use X AND/OR Over-The-Counter Use (Part 21 CFR 801 Subpart D) (21 CFR 807 Subpart C)
