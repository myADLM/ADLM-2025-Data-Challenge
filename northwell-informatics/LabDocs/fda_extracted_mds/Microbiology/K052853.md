# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

Tigecycline $1 5 \mu \ g$ BBL" Sensi-Disc" is prepared by impregnating high quality paper with accurately determined amounts of Tigecycline supplied by the drug manufacturer.Each Tigecycline disk is clearly marked on both sides with the agent and drug content. Tigecycline cartridges each contain 50 kha  p o ten carriges.Tigecycline disks are used for semi-quantitative in viro susceptibility evaluations byhe agar diffusion test method.

Agar diffusion susceptibility methods employing dried filter paper disks impregnated with specific concentrations of antimicrobial agents were developed in the 1940s. In order to eliminate or minimize variability in the testing, Bauer et al. developed a standardized procedure in which Mueller Hinton Agar was selected as the test medium.

Various regulatory agencies and standards-writing organizations subsequently published standardized reference procedures based on the Bauer-Kirby method. Among the earliest and most widely accepted of these standardized procedures were those published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The procedure was adopted as a consensus standard by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [Formerly National Committe for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and is periodically updated.

# DEVICE PRINCIPLE:

Disks containing a wide variety of antimicrobial agents are applied to the surface of Mueller Hinton Agar plates [or Haemophilus Test Medium Agar for Haemophilus influenzae or Mueller Hinton Agar with 5% S B a u llaFo incubation, the plates are examined and the zones of inhibition surrounding the disks are measured and compared with established zone size ranges for individual antimicrobial agents in order to determine the mos itabliobl hyTh terial at b a  an  n    aln comparing zone diameters to those found in the respective organism tables of CLSINCCLS Document M2 ("Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests) and of CLSINCCLS Document M100 ("Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing").

# DEVICE COMPARISON:

The BBL™ Sensi-Disc™ Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Tigercycline15μg is similar to the BBL™ Sensi-Disc" Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Ciprofloxacin 5 μg in that:

Both methods are for antimicrobial susceptibility testing using paper disks impregnated with an antimicrobial agent.   
− Both methods have the same intended use. Both methods provide the user with antimicrobic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results based on measurements of zone diameters. Both methods require the user to determine categorical interpretations (S/I/R) using the measured zone diameters against CLSINCCLS Approved Standards M2 and M100. Both methods use pure cultures of bacterial isolates.

The BBL™" Sensi-Disc" Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Tigecycline 15μg differs from the BBL SenDistbial SustibilityTest DisksCro $5 \mu \ g$ in that:

BBL" Sensi-Disc" Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Tigecycline 15μg is a susceptibility test that uses disks impregnated with the antimicrobic Tigecycline at a concentration of 15μg while the BBL™" Sensi-Disc" Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Ciprofloxacin 5 µg is a susceptibility test that uses disks impregnated with the antimicrobic Ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 5 μg. BBL™ Sensi-Disc" Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disk  Tigecycline 15 μg is a susceptibility test used to test a different battery of microorganisms than the BBL Sensi-Disc™ Antimicrobial SusceptibilityTes DiskCiproi $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$

Dear Ms. Clark:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0484.
