# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; NCCLS M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.

# L. Test Principle:

The VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 Cefoxitin Screen test is based on the CLSI Disk Diffusion Test for prediction of mecA-mediated resistance in Staphylococci. Each VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 AST Card contains 64 wells. A control well containing only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 Compact has a manual filling and sealing operation. Both VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated. For the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ Cefoxitin Screen, the report will list either a positive or negative result. The VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ Cefoxitin Screen and oxacillin work in combination to determine the final oxacillin interpretation based on the CLSI recommendations.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Ten strains of staphylococci were tested at three sites with $59 5 \%$ reproducibility. This testing was performed using both the manual dilution of the inoculum and also the automatic dilution method.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms.

Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek instrument. This was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected range. Verification was performed during internal testing.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A clinical study was conducted at three sites using the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ Cefoxitin test and the CLSI Cefoxitin Disk Diffusion test method prepared as recommended in CLSI M7 approved standard. Inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were evaluated. Oxacillin is forced susceptible for coagnegative staphylococci other than S. lugdunensis and S. epidermidis when the oxacillin MIC result is $0 . 5 - 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and the cefoxitin screen result is negative. This rule was used in the final analysis of the results. Clinical testing was performed using the automated method of inoculation and the challenge set was tested using both the manual and the automated method. Greater than $9 5 \%$ of the isolates grew in the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ card in less than 16 hours.

The VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ system includes a limitation for not reporting results for $S .$ . saprophyticus when the oxacillin MIC and cefoxitin screen test together produce a resistant determination. The VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ over calls this group of organisms and a recommendation to use an alternate method is included in the labeling. With the removal of all S. saprophyticus that fall into that category the performance based on all other Staphylococcus is provided in the following table when the testing was performed using the automated testing format in conjunction with the oxacillin result from the card.
