Fully Automated Short-Term Incubation Cycle Antimicrobial Susceptibility Device, 21 CFR 866.1645

Common Name:

VITEK 2 AST-GP Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae

# C. Predicate Device:

VITEK 2 Gram Positive Moxifloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae (K031865).

# D. 510(k) Summary:

VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin fr Streptococcus pneumoniae is designed fr antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is intended for use with the VITEK $^ { \otimes } 2$ and VITEK®  Compact Systems s  laboratory d n thedetermination  invitr susceptibility t antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial presented in VITEK 2 AST Cards is in concentrations equivalent by effcacy to standard method concentrations in mcg/ml. The VITEK 2 AST Cards are entiallymiaturizersisheoubliltn tnue odeteig ei inhibitory concentration (MIC) microdilution methodology.

The bacterial isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration in $0 . 4 5 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fils, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has amanal fil  ealerain.Te iT mnitors herow ac wel   r adfi rd f  horsAt hecpetin e cuatin cc generated that contains the MiC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.

VITEK 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae demonstrated substantially defined in the FDA Class I Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, Issued Feb. 5, 2003.

The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of VITEK 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae. An external evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates and stock challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the acceptability of VITEK 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae by comparing its performance with the CLSI microbroth dilution reference method. The data is representative of performance on both the VITEK 2 System and VITEK 2 Compact instrument platforms, as evidenced in the AST equivalency study presented in the VITEK 2 Compact 510(k), K050002. VITEK 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae demonstrated acceptable performance of $9 9 . 5 \%$ overall Category Agreement. Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.

Dear Ms. Weaver:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known):_

# K0531860

Device Name: VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae $( \leq 0 . 2 5 - \geq 4 | \mu \sf g / m | )$

Indications For Use:

VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus pneumoniae. ViTEK 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae is a qualitative test. It is intended for use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.

The VITE ${ \sf K } ^ { \otimes } 2$ Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems for the automated quantitative or qualitative susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant aerobic gramnegative bacilli, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.
