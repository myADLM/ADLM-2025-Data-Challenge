# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

FDA Draft Guidance :Review Criteria for Assessment of Laboratory Tests for the detection of antibodies to Helicobacter pylori. Sep. 1992

# L. Test Principle:

The Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS test utilizes a mixture of monoclonal anti- $H .$ . pylori capture antibodies adsorbed to microwells. Diluted patient samples and a conjugate (peroxidase conjugated to monoclonal antibodies) are added to the wells and incubated for one hour at room temperature. A wash is performed to remove unbound material. Substrate is added and incubated for ten minutes at room temperature. Color develops in the presence of bound enzyme. Stop Solution is added and the results are interpreted visually or spectrophotometrically

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter-assay variability were assessed with a reference panel prepared from high positive samples $( \mathtt { n } = 2 )$ , low negative samples $( { \mathfrak { n } } =$ 2), and low positive and high negative specimens $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 1$ each). The latter were diluted to near the assay limit of sensitivity. Nine replicates each of the low positive and high negative samples were included in the panel to bring the total cohort to 22 reference specimens. Each reference specimen was coded to prevent its identification during testing. Each was evaluated twice per day for three consecutive days by three different laboratories. High negative samples (OD value just below 0.100) produced weakly positive results (OD values just above 0.100) in 42 out of 162 tests. It is expected that high negative samples prepared at the cut-off will produce weakly positive results $50 \%$ of the time. (See EP12-A, User protocol for evaluation of qualitative performance; approved guideline;

NCCLS/CLSI, Vol. 22, no.14, 2002.) Low positive, high positive and low negative samples produced the correct results $100 \%$ of the time. Reproducibility was $100 \%$ with no intra-assay and inter-assay variability for samples prepared above or below the limit of analytical sensitivity.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): N/A

# d. Detection limit:

Serial dilutions of purified $H .$ pylori flagellar antigen and a $H .$ . pylori bacterial strain (ATCC 43504) were prepared in stool or Sample Diluent and used to determine the lowest concentration of antigen that would still yield a definitive positive result $( { \bf A } _ { 4 5 0 / 6 3 0 }$ $\geq 0 . 1 0 0$ on Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS). Final concentrations were calculated from the data points using linear regression analysis. The analytical limit for $H .$ pylori flagellar antigen is $4 . 6 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ in stool and $0 . 6 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ in sample diluent. The limit for $H .$ . pylori bacterial strain is $1 . 0 \mathrm { X } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ organisms $\mathrm { \Delta m L }$ in stool and $4 . 4 \mathrm { X } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ organisms $/ \mathrm { m L }$ in Sample Diluent.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The specificity of Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS was tested by utilizing the following bacterial, yeast or viral strains. Positive and negative stools were spiked with $\geq 1 . 2 \mathrm { X } 1 0 ^ { \overline { { 9 } } }$ bacterial or yeast organisms/mL and tested by Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS. The concentration of viral organisms was not calculated. None of the organisms affected positive or negative test results.

# TESTS FOR INTERFERING SUBSTANCES

The following substances, that may be present in human stool do not interfere with positive or negative test results at the stated concentrations per $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { u L }$ human stool: $\mathrm { T U M S } - 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g } .$ , Mylanta - $0 . 8 4 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ , Pepto Bismol - $0 . 3 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ , Tagamet - 1 mg, Prilosec OTC - 1 mg, barium sulfate - $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ , whole blood - $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { u L }$ , mucin - $6 . 7 \ \mathrm { m g }$ , human hemoglobin (ie, dark stool) $- 1 5 \mathrm { m g }$ steric $^ +$ palmitic acids (ie, fatty stool) – $\cdot 7 . 9 \mathrm { m g }$ .

# f. Assay cut-off:

The cut-off value of 0.100 was established on a lot-to-lot basis with specific procedures for optimizing solid phase and conjugate reagents. The validity of selection of this cut-off was proven in verification studies and clinical studies performed on three lots of fully manufactured product. The histogram provided below plots the values of samples tested during the clinical studies. The histogram shows that most samples consistently produce values that fall well above the cut-off, or well below that value.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Tests with 291 samples from symptomatic patients collected either prior to or following treatment were used to demonstrate that Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS performed similarly to Premier Platinum HpSA. Thirty three of these samples were originally evaluated in an earlier trial to demonstrate the effectiveness of Premier Platinum HpSA. Test performance is detailed in the following table.

Eight of the ten samples that were positive by Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS, but negative by Premier Platinum HpSA, were positive by CLO, histology or UBT testing. The three samples that were positive by Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS but indeterminate by Premier Platinum HpSA were positive by CLO, histology or UBT testing. The one sample, that was negative by Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS but indeterminate by Premier Platinum HpSA, was negative by CLO, histology or UBT testing.

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A $b$ . Clinical specificity: N/A c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): See 2 (a) Comparison Studies

4. Clinical cut-off:

Comparison to the predicate showed $100 \%$ positive agreement and $9 4 . 8 \%$ negative agreement.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

Studies on the epidemiology of $H .$ pylori have shown that this organism is present worldwide. Gastritis caused by $H .$ pylori has been shown to correlate with age, ethnic background, family size and socioeconomic class. The prevalence of $H .$ . pylori infection in a given population can vary from $20 \%$ to $90 \%$ . In patients diagnosed with duodenal ulcers, however, it has been shown in every age group to be approximately $80 \%$ . Currently recommended eradication treatments have an efficacy rate between $7 5 \%$ and $90 \%$ .

The Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS test detects the presence of $H .$ . pylori antigens in human stool. Expected values for a given population should be determined for each laboratory. The rate of positivity may vary depending on geographic location, method of specimen collection, handling and transportation, test employed and general health environment of patient population under study. As demonstrated by Premier Platinum $\operatorname { H p S A }$ in tests conducted in the United States, Canada and Italy, incidence of disease ranged from $34 \%$ to $53 \%$ to $69 \%$ respectively.
