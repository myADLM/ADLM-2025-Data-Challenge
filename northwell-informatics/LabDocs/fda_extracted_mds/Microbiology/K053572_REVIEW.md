# L. Test Principle:

The C. DIFF QUIK CHEK™ test is a rapid membrane enzyme immunoassay that utilizes antibodies specific for the antigen, glutamate dehydrogenase, of $C .$ . difficile. The device contains a Reaction Window with two vertical lines of immobilized antibodies. The test line (“T”) contains antibodies against C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase. The control line (“C”) contains anti-IgG antibodies. The Conjugate consists of antibodies to glutamate dehydrogenase coupled to horseradish peroxidase. To perform the test, the sample is added to a tube containing a mixture of Diluent and Conjugate. The diluted sample-conjugate mixture is added to the Sample Well and the device is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. During the incubation, any glutamate

dehydrogenase in the sample binds to the antibody-peroxidase conjugate. The antigenantibody-conjugate complexes migrate through a filter pad to a membrane where they are captured by the immobilized glutamate dehydrogenase-specific antibodies in the line. The Reaction Window is subsequently washed with Wash Buffer, followed by the addition of Substrate. After a 10 minute incubation period, the “T” reaction is examined visually for the appearance of a vertical blue line on the “T” side of the Reaction Window. A blue line indicates a positive test. A positive “C” reaction, indicated by a vertical blue line on the “C” side of the Reaction Window, confirms that the test is working properly and the results are valid.

Discrepant samples were resolved using commercial tests for $C .$ . difficile glutamate dehydrogenase in ELISA or membrane test formats, or by a research PCR assay for the detection of $C .$ . difficile GDH gene $g l u D$ . Twenty-nine of the 56 apparent false positive samples were positive by another GDH test, and were considered true positives. Twentyseven remained false positive. Thirteen of the 16 apparent false negative samples were negative by another GDH test, and were considered true negatives. Three remained false negative.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity:

The C. DIFF QUIK CHEK™ test was compared to the bacterial culture test at two clinical laboratories and in-house at TECHLAB®, Inc. Specimens included in the evaluation were submitted to the clinical laboratories for routine testing. The presumptive bacterial culture test was performed according to the in-house procedures. Of the 979 specimens analyzed by culture, 206 were positive for Clostridium difficile. Results are summarized in Tables 1. (See table above)   
b. Clinical specificity: Refer to (a.) above   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b is not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: The clinical cut-off of this assay is approximately $0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . This limit does not vary from solid to liquid/semi-solid stool.

5. Expected values/Reference range: (Interpretive Criteria)

Clostridium difficile disease is primarily a nosocomial disease of elderly patients, and the frequency of the disease is dependent on factors such as patient population, type of institution and epidemiology. The reported incidence of $C .$ . difficile disease in patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may range from 5 to $20 \%$ , and hospitals may experience rates lower or higher than this range. It is important to consider any test results in conjunction with clinical symptoms because some healthy adults and large numbers of healthy infants (up to $50 \%$ ) will be positive for C. difficile toxin. In addition, $C .$ . difficile carriage rates of 22 to $32 \%$ have been reported in cystic fibrosis patients. Because the C. DIFF QUIK CHEK™ test detects both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains of $C .$ . difficile, the expected values of this test are higher compared to that of any toxin test. A positive result in the C. DIFF QUIK $C H E K ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ test confirms the presence of C. difficile in a fecal specimen; a negative result indicates the absence of the organism. A positive result should be followed by a toxin-specific test to confirm the presence of toxigenic $C$ . difficile. The prevalence of a positive C. DIFF QUIK CHEK™ test at an independent study site was $1 8 . 2 \%$ $\mathrm { ( N = } 5 7 8 \mathrm { ) }$ ).
