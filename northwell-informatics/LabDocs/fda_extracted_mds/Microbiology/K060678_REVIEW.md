VITROS Immunodiagnostic System, cleared by separate 510(k) pre-market notification (K962919/S1)

# I. Device Description:

The device uses a competitive immunoassay, where the formation of a signal generating immunoassay complex is inhibited by Anti-HAV antibody (AB) from the tested sample. The system is comprised of three main elements: (i) VITROS Anti-HAV Total Reagent Pack, with the VITROS Anti-HAV Total Calibrator and the VITROS Anti-HAV Total Controls, (ii) VITROS Immunodiagnostic System – instrumentation, which provides automated use of the immunoassay kits, and (iii) common reagents used by the VITROS System.

The VITROS Anti-HAV Total Reagent Pack is composed of streptavidin coated wells, HAV antigen in a buffered matrix of BSA and mouse serum with antimicrobial agent, and mouse antiHAV monoclonal antibody conjugated to biotin and the same mouse anti-HAV monoclonal antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase. The VITROS Anti-HAV Total Calibrator is a combination of anti-HAV negative and anti-HAV total positive plasma from donors confirmed negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV $1 { + } 2$ ) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The VITROS Anti-HAV Total Controls are a negative control (normal human plasma obtained from HBsAg, HIV $1 + 2$ and HCV negative donors), and a positive control (normal human plasma spiked with anti-HAV Total positive plasma, both from HBsAg, HIV $1 + 2$ and HCV negative donors).

Class II Special Control Guidance Document: Hepatitis A Virus Serological Assays, issued February 9, 2006 (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/oivd/guidance/1536.pdf)

# L. Test Principle:

Competitive immunoassay where the formation of an immunoassay complex that generated signal is inhibited by Anti-HAV antibody (AB) from the tested sample. The immunoassay complex: streptavidin plate–biotinylated mouse Anti-HAV AB–HAV antigen–HPR-labeled mouse antiHAV AB, that generated luminescent signal can not be formed anymore in the presence of AntiHAV AB from the patient sample.

Immunoassay complex with negative sample (no Anti-HAV AB present in sample):

![](images/bd5b6f720ae3942307846c55d68329d77aaa82922b5cdfbc2a2b31e29d5e73ef.jpg)

# Immunoassay complex with positive sample (Anti-HAV AB present in sample):

The competitive assay technique uses a pre-incubation of sample (potentially containing anti-HAV AB) with HAV antigen in the assay reagent followed by incubation with a biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-HAV AB and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse monoclonal antiHAV AB. The immune complex of biotinylated mouse Anti-HAV AB – HAV antigen – HPRlabeled mouse anti-HAV AB is captured by streptavidin on the wells, unbound materials are removed by washing. The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. The light signals are read by the VITROS System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is inversely proportional to the concentration of anti-HAV AB present. The assay used two controls: negative, anti-HAV negative normal human plasma and positive, normal human plasma spiked with anti-HAV AB total positive plasma.

# Interpretation of the results:

Results are calculated as a normalized signal, relative to a cut-off value (signal/cutoff, $\mathrm { s / c }$ ). During the calibration process a lot-specific parameter, encoded on the lot calibration card, is used to determine a valid stored cut-off value for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. Results are automatically calculated by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System.

Result $=$ Signal for test sample Cut-off value

Patient sample results will be displayed as “Antibody Pos”, “Borderline”, “Antibody Neg”, or “Retest?\*” (\* indicates the sample will require retesting following the testing algorithm). An initial result labeled with “Borderline” indicates a sample that requires duplicate repeat testing for antiHAV. An initial result labeled “Retest?” indicates a sample which requires dilution and re-assay.

\*The $2 / 3$ rule is applied, if $2 / 3$ tests are borderline again, analysis of follow-up sample (collected within 2-4 weeks) is recommended.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) protocol EP5-A2. The precision panel consisting of 4 samples (a negative, a negative close to the cut-off, a positive close to the cut-off and a positive) was prepared and shipped to 3 different sites. Two replicates of each of 4 panel samples were assayed at each of the 3 different sites once per day for at least 20 different days, over one calibration interval. The experiment was performed using 1 reagent lot on three different VITROS Immunodiagnostic Systems at three different sites. The data presented is a summary of the product performance by site:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The quantitative values of the assay allows a signal to cut-off ratio from ${ \mathrm { > } } 0 . 0$ to maximum 4.0. Sample with the maximum $4 . 0 \ : \mathrm { S / C o }$ value are required to be diluted and retested.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Each quoted mean value is derived from a minimum of 10 assays. The standard deviation is that which would be anticipated for singleton determinations of each control in a number of different laboratories using different reagent lots. Quoted values are lot specific.

Calibration is lot specific; reagent packs and calibrators are linked by lot number. A Master Calibration is established for each new reagent lot by performing multiple assays. This is the process by which a lot-specific parameter [a] which links the cut-off value to the calibrator signal is determined.

Cut-off value $=$ (a x Signal of CAL1)

The lot-specific parameter, the expected calibrator signal and the data which enables a System to calculate the cut-off value, are encoded on the lot calibration card. Scanning the lot calibration card loads the encoded data onto the System. When the calibrator is processed the validity of the calibration is assessed against a quality parameter which compares the actual signal of the calibrator with the expected signal. If the calibration is acceptable the cut-off value is calculated and stored for use with any reagent pack of that lot. The quality of calibration cannot be completely described by a single parameter. The calibration report should be used in conjunction with control values to determine the validity of the calibration. Recalibration is required after a predetermined calibration interval, or when a different reagent lot is loaded.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection (LoD) for anti- HAV Total is 2.024, determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI EP 17-A and with proportions of false positives $( \alpha )$ less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 136 determinations each, with 1 blank and 3 low-level samples.

The limit of blank (LoB) is 2.097, determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI EP 17-A and with proportions of false positives $( \alpha )$ less than $5 \%$ and false negatives (β) less than $5 \%$ ; based on 136 determinations of a sample free of anti-HAV.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The specificity of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay was evaluated by testing 283 samples from the following potentially cross-reacting sub-groups: SLE, anti-HIV, Cirrhosis, Non-viral Liver Disease, anti-HCV, anti-CMV, anti-HSV I & II, anti-EBV, antisyphilis, anti-Rubella, anti-Toxoplasma, anti-HBs, anti-HTLV, HBsAg, Rheumatoid Factor, Pregnancy (1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester), HAMA, Rubeola, Rubella, Mumps, VZV and ANA. All initially reactive samples were tested with a reference assay for confirmation. Of the 283 samples tested, four (4) were observed to be discordant. The incidence of discordant samples is not significantly different from the claimed sensitivity and specificity.

The cut-off signal was established at light signal that gave the best discrimination between anti-HAV reactive and anti-HAV negative sample populations, to provide optimum specificity and sensitivity for the assay. The cut-off signal level was assigned a result of 1.00. Assay results $< 0 . 8 0$ indicate a reactive sample, positive for anti-HAV. A result of ${ \ge } 0 . 8$ and $< 1 . 0$ indicates a borderline sample. A result of ${ \ge } 1 . 0$ and $< 4 . 0$ indicates a non reactive sample, negative for anti-HAV. A result of ${ \ge } 4 . 0$ indicates a sample which requires dilution and re-testing

see section 3c (other clinical supportive data)

b. Matrix comparison:

Serum vs. plasma (heparin, EDTA, or citrate)

A total of 25 donors had blood drawn which was spiked with anti-HAV Total positive plasma to a level close to the assay cut-off. The spiked blood was then aliquoted into serum and plasma collection tubes and tested in the VITROS anti-HAV Total assay. The percent difference in the plasma from serum was calculated. Mean percent differences from serum are represented below for each plasma type tested. The differences between serum and citrate samples may be larger than $10 \%$ due to the liquid anticoagulant in the tube. There is approximately a $10 \%$ dilution of the blood by the liquid anticoagulant in the citrate tubes

Methods comparison with predicate device:

The performance characteristics of the VITROS Anti- HAV Total assay were established in a multi-center prospective among individuals with signs or symptoms or biochemical manifestations (elevated liver function tests) of hepatitis and those at high risk of hepatitis infection due to lifestyle, behavior, occupation, or known exposure events. Specimens were evaluated from 872 subjects prospectively enrolled at three geographically separated collection sites within the United States (Population 1) located in Miami, FL $( 1 2 . 6 \% )$ , Dallas, TX $( 3 7 . 5 \% )$ and Chicago, IL $( 4 9 . 9 \% )$ . Specimens were also evaluated from 313 subjects with signs and symptoms of viral hepatitis prospectively enrolled in an area in India with a high prevalence of viral hepatitis (Population 2). The subjects in Population 1 were Caucasian $( 2 5 . 6 \% )$ , African American $( 5 3 . 1 \% )$ , Hispanic $( 1 7 . 0 \% )$ , with the remaining $4 . 3 \%$ represented by other ethnic groups. The group was $5 7 . 3 \%$ male and $4 2 . 7 \%$ female, and ranged in age from 16 to 81 years. Testing of these specimens with the VITROS Anti - HAV Total assay occurred at diagnostic laboratories located in Miami, FL $( 1 2 . 6 \% )$ , Port Jefferson, NY $( 4 9 . 9 \% )$ and Minneapolis, MN $( 3 7 . 5 \% )$ . The subjects in Population 2 were Indian $( 1 0 0 . 0 \% )$ . The group was $7 2 . 8 \%$ male and $2 7 . 2 \%$ female, and ranged in age from 18 to 90 years. Testing of these specimens with the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay occurred at diagnostic laboratories located in Miami, FL $( 4 3 . 8 \% )$ , Minneapolis, MN $( 4 3 . 8 \% )$ and Port Jefferson, NY $( 1 2 . 5 \% )$ . Agreement of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay was assessed relative to the reference anti-HAV total assay using serum samples from Population 1, Population 2.

\*The reference anti-HAV total assay was negative in three subjects, the 3 reactive results with VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay was considered falsely reactive for purposes of the analysis.

# Performance of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total Assay in Pediatric Subjects:

The VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay was also evaluated using residual laboratory serum samples from pediatric subjects at low risk for viral hepatitis. The samples were unlinked to the subjects’ identities, and were included based on age, gender and available volume remaining after all testing ordered for that sample had been completed. Samples were selected such that the following age ranges (in years) were represented (2-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19). The positive and negative percent agreement of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay with the reference anti-HAV total assay, and the $9 5 \%$ exact confidence intervals are presented in the following table. One sample, negative with the reference assay, was Borderline with the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay and was considered falsely reactive for purposes of the analysis.
