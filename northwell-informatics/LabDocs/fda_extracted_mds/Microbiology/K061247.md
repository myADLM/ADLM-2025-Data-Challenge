# NAME OF DEVICE:

Trade Name:

DiaSorin LIAISON® Treponema Assay

Common Names/Descriptions:

Immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to Treponema pallidum to aid in the diagnosis of Syphilis in human serum

Classification Names:

Treponema pallidum treponemal test reagents

Product Code:

LIP

PREDICATE DEVICES

Trinity CAPTIA™ Syphilis (T. Pallidum) G (K014233)

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

INTENDED USE: The LIAISON® Treponema assay uses chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) technology for the qualitative detection of total antibodies of any class $( { \mathsf { I g G } } / { \mathsf { I g M } } )$ directed against Treponema pallidum in human serum.

The presence of antibodies to Treponema pallidum specific antigen, in conjunction with non treponemal laboratory tests and clinical findings, may aid in the diagnosis of syphilis infection.

The LIAlsON® Treponema Assay is not intended for use in screening blood or plasma donors.

KIT DESCRIPTION: The method for determination of specific total antibodies to Treponema pallidum is a one-step chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA).

All assay steps and incubations are performed by the LIAlSON® Analyzer, with the exception of initial magnetic particle resuspension.

Recombinant antigens specific for Treponema pallidum are used for coating the magnetic particles (solid phase) and are used in the tracer when linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antigen conjugate). During the incubation step antibodies present in the calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase. The conjugate reacts with the antibodies already bound to the solid phase. After the incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.

Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash Chemiluminescence reaction is induced. The light signal and hence the amount of isoluminol-antigen conjugate is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of total antibodies to Treponema pallidum present in calibrators, controls or samples.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

Performance testing of the LIAISON $\textcircled{8}$ Treponema Assay for comparative clinical trials consisted of running selected samples for two (2) studies to support the intended use.

Study 1: Clinical Laboratory Screen Test (Treponemal Test followed by a NonTreponemal test). This study consisted of samples from:   
Medically Diagnosed Syphilis infection (Retrospective samples $n = 5 1$ patients from the US and $\mathsf { n } = 1 2 7$ patients from Europe) Total $\mathsf { n } = \mathsf { 1 7 8 }$ .   
Laboratory samples sent for Syphilis HIV Positive Samples (Prospective $\mathtt { \ p = 9 9 9 }$   
Pregnancy Samples (Prospective $\mathsf { n } = 2 0 0$   
Apparently Healthy Adults (Prospective ${ \mathsf { n } } = 9 9 2$ )   
Study 2: Diagnostic Confirmatory test (Traditional testing algorithm a non-treponemal test followed by a Treponemal test.) This study consists of: RPRVDRL positive samples (Retrospective $\scriptstyle \ n = 2 0 4$

COMPARATIVE CLINICAL TRIALS: The clinical trials were conducted at two external US laboratories and at DiaSorin,Inc. Testing was performed on prospective and retrospective samples as described in the two clinical studies above. The samples were tested by LIAISON $\textcircled{8}$ Treponema Assay and the comparator assay Trinity CAPTIA™M Syphilis (T.pallidum) G at the trial sites per the manufacturer's instructions for use. Discordant samples were further tested by RPR and TP-PA per the recommendations for non-treponemal testing and use of another treponemal method when following the algorithm to Screen for Syphilis: (Treponema Test as Screen) from (Use of Treponemal Tests to Screen for Syphilis, by Victoria Pope, PhD, Infect. Med 21 (8):399-404, 2004 Cliggottt Publishing Division of CMP Healthcare Media).

Samples sent to the Laboratory for Syphilis testing, 93.2% (95% Cl = 91.4 - 94.7%)   
HIV positive samples, $84 . 5 \%$ $( 9 5 \% 0 0 \% 0 1 = 7 8 . 7 - 8 9 . 2 \% )$   
Pregnancy samples, $9 8 . 0 \%$ $( 9 5 \% 0 7 \% 0 5 \% - 9 5 \% )$   
Apparently Healthy Adults, $9 4 . 2 \%$ $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C l } = 9 2 . 6 - 9 5 . 6 \% )$

The results demonstrate that the LIAlSON@ Treponema Assay can be used with the LIAISON® Analyzer for the qualitative detection of total antibodies in human serum when used as a clinical diagnostic screening test (not intended for use with blood donors or for screening the general population).

Study 2:

The LIAISON® Treponema Assay demonstrated overall agreement with the comparator kit for RPR/VDRL positive samples of 99.0% (95% Cl = 97.3 - 100%) when following the Traditional Algorithm: A non-treponemal test followed by a treponemal test.

The results demonstrate that the LIAlSON® Treponema Assay can be used with the LIAISON® Analyzer for the qualitative detection of total antibodies in human serum when used as a diagnostic confirmatory test (not intended for use with blood donors

Equivocal, repeat and resolution testing.

All equivocal results were repeated in duplicate on the Trinity CAPTIA™ Syphilis (T. Pallidum)-G kit and the LIAlSON® Treponema assay per the respective package inserts. All samples that were positive on the Trinity CAPTIA ™m kit were also repeated in duplicate per the package insert. Samples that were discordant between the Trinity CAPTIA TM kit and the LIAISON® Treponema kit were tested further with a nontreponemal test (RPR) and with a treponemal kit capable of picking up total antibodies (TP-PA). The resolution of the discordants was carried out by following the Algorithm suggested by Victoria Pope Ph.D, as shown above, and the percent agreements for positive, negative and overall were recalculated.

Study 1 - Resolved:   
Medically Diagnosed Syphilis Samples, 97.7% (95% CI = 94.9 - 99.2%)   
Samples sent to the Laboratory for Syphilis testing, 98.7% (95% Cl = 97.8 - 99.3%)   
HIV positive samples, $9 4 . 5 \%$ $( 9 5 \% 0 7 \% 0 1 = 9 0 . 4 - 9 7 . 2 \% )$ Y   
Pregnancy samples, $100 \%$ $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C l } = 9 8 . 2 - 1 0 0 \% )$   
Apparently Healthy Adults, $9 8 . 3 \%$ $( 9 5 \% \mathsf { C l } = 9 7 . 3 - 9 9 . 0 \% )$ EY

Study 2 - Resolved: RPR/VDRL positive samples, $1 0 0 \% ( 9 5 \% { }  C mathsf { I } = 9 8 . 2 - 1 0 0 \% )$

REPRODUCIBILITY: Reproducibility studies were performed at 3 sites using a coded panel comprised of 9 "engineered" serum samples. The same coded panel samples were tested at all 3 sites. Samples were run in 4 replicates per run for 5 days. The results expressed for Index and RLU's are summarized in the tables below. Samples 1007 and 1008 were negative samples that read below the limit of the curve so Index values were nondetectable.
