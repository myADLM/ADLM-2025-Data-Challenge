PREDICATE DEVICES

Immunetics® C6 B. burgdorferi (Lyme) ELISA TM Kit - (K003754)

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

INTENDED USE: The LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi assay and the LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi Serum Controls, use chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology for the qualitative presumptive detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum. This assay should be used only on samples from patients with signs and symptoms that are consistent with Lyme Disease. Positive or equivocal results should be supplemented by testing with a standardized Western Blot procedure. Positive supplemental results provide evidence of exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi and can be used to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme Disease. Negative results by LIAlsON® Borrelia burgdorferi assay should not be used to exclude Lyme Disease.

KIT DESCRIPTION: The method for the qualitative determination of IgG and IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). All assay steps and incubations are performed by the LIAlSON® Analyzer, with the exception of the initial magnetic particle resuspension.

Recombinant antigens specific for Borrelia (VlsE antigens) are used for coating the magnetic particles (solid phase). Two mouse monoclonal antibodies (anti-human IgG and anti-human IgM) are linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate).

During the first incubation, anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase magnetic particles. Unbound material is removed by a wash cycle and isoluminol-antibody conjugates are added. During the second incubation, the antibody conjugates react with anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgG and IgM antibodies that are already bound to the solid phase. The second incubation is followed by a wash cycle to remove unbound conjugate. Subsequently, the start reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies present in calibrators, controls or samples.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

Performance testing of the LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi Assay for comparative clinical trials consisted of running selected samples to support the intended use.

COMPARATIVE CLINICAL TRIALS: The clinical trials were conducted at two external US laboratories and at DiaSorin, Inc. Testing was performed on prospective and retrospective samples. The samples were tested by LlAlSON® Borrelia burgdorferi and the comparator assay Immunetics® C6 B. burgdorferi (Lyme) ELISA ™m kit at the trial sites per the manufacturer's instructions for use. The study consisted of the following samples types and results.

Forty-five samples were positive or equivocal by LIAISON $\circled{8}$ Borrelia burgdorferi in the 1038 prospective sample study. These 45 samples were then tested following the two step method with a standardized Western Blot assay (MarDx Marblot Western Blot IgG and IgM assay). Twenty-two of the 45 total samples were W. Blot positive. Of the 22 samples that were Western Blot positive, 6 were IgM $^ +$ 12 were lgG $^ +$ , and 4 were both IgM and IgG $^ +$

Fifty-six samples were positive or equivocal by the Immunetics® C6 B. burgdorferi (Lyme) ELISA™. These 56 samples were also tested following the two step method. Twenty-three of the 56 total samples were W. Blot positive. Of the 23

samples that were Western Blot positive 6 were IgM $^ +$ ,13 were ${ \mathfrak { l g } } { \mathsf { G } } +$ ,and 4 were both IgM and IgG $^ +$ .A summary of the results are in the following table.

Dear Ms. DePouw:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): K062473

Device Name:

LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi

Indications For Use:

The LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology on the LIAISON® Analyzer for the qualitative presumptive detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to VIsE (variable major protein-like sequence, expressed) protein antigen of Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum. This assay should be used only on samples from patients with signs and symptoms that are consistent with Lyme disease. Positive or equivocal results should be supplemented by testing with a standardized Western blot procedure. Positive supplemental results provide evidence of exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi and can be used to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease. Negative results by LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi should not be used to exclude Lyme disease.
