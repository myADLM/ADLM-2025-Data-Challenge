# I. Device Description:

The MicroScan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MICroSTREP plus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Panel is a 96-well plastic dish which contains microdilutions of each antimicrobic in various concentrations dried in aqueous solutions. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with a MuellerHinton broth supplemented with lysed horse blood $( 2 - 5 \% )$ . The target inoculum concentration for each well should be approximately $5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ colony forming units $\mathrm { ( C F U ) / m L }$ . Panels are incubated in a $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ non- $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 20-24 hours. After incubation, the panels are read manually for growth. Additionally, panels may be incubated in and read by a MicroScan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WalkAway instrument. Each panel contains a “growth” but it does not contain a “no growth” control well.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard.”

# L. Test Principle:

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in water, buffer or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with $1 1 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with $2 - 5 \%$ lysed horse blood (LHB), after inoculation of the broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. The target inoculum concentration for each well should be approximately $\bar { 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ colony forming units $\mathrm { ( C F U ) / m L }$ . After incubation in a non- $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organisms is determined by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. Panels can be read manually using indirect light or the panels can be read on the MicroScan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WalkAway instrument using optics light detection.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.

The Reproducibility studies, QC performance data, and Challenge isolates evaluated by the manual and automated reading methods are contained in this submission to demonstrate that there is no difference between manual reading and automated reading in the MicroScan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WalkAway System.

Efficacy, quality control and challenge data from the external validation of the manual read method are provided for the removal of the “Do not report” limitation for Streptococcus pneumoniae (reference K021184). The limitation was requested in the original submission for S. pneumoniae because of one very major error observed during the Efficacy testing.

# 1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3 separate days in triplicate. The study included testing on the MicroScan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WalkAway System with automated reading at 20-24 hours, and manual readings at 20-24 hours incubation. Both reading methods demonstrated $59 5 \%$ reproducibility, and no differences were observed.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or method): The recommended QC isolate S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results on all testing days with the reference method. Quality control results demonstrated the ability of the different reading parameters (manual and instrument) to produce acceptable results. The following table provides the frequency of results in each concentration with the expected range stated. Both reading methods produced the same mode.

Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter, which was verified each day of testing, was used for the turbidity inoculation method. Colony counts were performed weekly, on the ATCC S. pneumoniae with all results in the expected range of approximately $\bar { 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ .

No trending was observed.

# a. Method comparison with predicate device: Removal of limitation

Clinical efficacy testing with manual result reading was conducted and was described in submission K021184. The original efficacy data are included with this submission for the removal of the “Do no report” limitation for Streptococcus pneumoniae. The clinical protocol, panel descriptions and incubation methods were previously provided in K021184.

A total of 492 streptococcal isolates, composed of 231 fresh and 261 stock isolates, were tested at 3 sites. The limitation was requested in the original submission for S. pneumoniae because of one very major error observed during the efficacy testing. The table below displays the efficacy performance for all streptococcal isolates tested, including S. pneumoniae.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the Microscan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MICroSTREP $p l u s @$ panel agrees with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the Microscan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MICroSTREP plus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ panel interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within the test range and on scale.

There was one very major error generated by the inclusion of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates data. No additional minor errors or major errors were produced. The maj error rate is $0 . 2 \%$ (1/451). The vmj error rate is $2 . 4 \%$ (1/41). The $\mathrm { E A } \%$ of $9 7 . 8 \%$ and the $\mathrm { C A \% }$ of $9 9 . 6 \%$ are both very good.

The test device had a $59 5 \%$ growth rate, and the performance data are acceptable for removal of the limitation of Clindamycin for S. pneumoniae.

# Read method comparison

In this submission, Challenge isolates were evaluated by the manual and automated reading methods to demonstrate that there is no difference between manual reading and instrument reading on the MicroScan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WalkAway System. There were 70 challenge isolates including 53 CDC Challenge Set strains, tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result. A comparison was done with readings on the instrument after 20 hours incubation, and also read manually when incubated for 20-24 hours. Performance by the automated reading method was acceptable with no differences or trends.

The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of the use of a small amount $( 0 . 1 \% )$ of Pluronic (a wetting agent) in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of Pluronic in the frozen reference panel was conducted. QC was also performed with no difference apparent in the results.

EA-Essential Agreement R-resistant isolates

maj-major discrepancies vmj-very major discrepancies min- minor discrepancies

Essential agreement (EA) is when the Microscan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MICroSTREP plus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within the test range and on scale.

Automated reading results were the same as the manual reading results with no trending. There were no vmj, and there was 1 maj error for both reading methods; there was 1 additional minor error generated by the automated reading method. The overall $\mathrm { E A } \%$ of $9 4 . 3 \%$ and Eval $\mathrm { E A } \%$ of $9 7 . 9 \%$ for the manual read and overall $\mathrm { E A } \%$ of $9 5 . 7 \%$ and Eval $\mathrm { E A } \%$ of $9 7 . 9 \%$ for the automated reading were both very good.

The test device had a growth rate of $59 5 \%$ for both the manual reading and the automated reading methods.

The comparison of the reading methods demonstrates that the manual reading method and the automated reading on the MicroScan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ WalkAway System are no different.

The performance data currently documented in the package insert will be updated.
