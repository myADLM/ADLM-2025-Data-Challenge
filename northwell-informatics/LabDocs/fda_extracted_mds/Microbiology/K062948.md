Device Description:

The Cephcid Smart GBS Assay is a rapid, DNA test for detccting GBS DNA from vaginal/rcctal swab spccimens from pregnant women. Thc assay is performed on thc automated Cephcid SmartCycler Dx System. The SmartCycler Dx Systcm is a rapid, rcaltime thcrmal cycler uscd for identifying DNA or RNA from prepared biological samples. Each instrument contains 16 independently programmable modulcs that can perform fourcolor, real-timc fluorometric detcction. Samplcs arc amplified and measured in the SmartCycler's proprietary, scalablc rcaction tubcs that are designcd to optimizc rapid thermal transfer and optical sensitivity.

The four channel optics in the SmartCycler Dx System enables the simultancous detection of four targets within a single sample (multiplex assays) by employing multiplex PCR tcchniques and rcal-timc fluorcscent tcchnologies such as Molccular Beacons and TaqMan\* probes, Amplifluor\* and Scorpion" primers, and intercalating dycs.

The Smart GBS Assay includes an internal control (IC) to monitor the presencc of inhibitors in thc Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Thc GBS primers and probe detect a unique region of the S. agalactiae chromosomc.

A vaginal/rectal swab is collected and transported to thc laboratory. Swab processing then procceds by onc of two methods (direct mcthod or an optional enriched Lim broth mcthod). The Smart GBS Assay includes thc reagents rcquired for sample proccssing (except for the Lims Broth) and the detection of the target GBS DNA. Once sample processing is completed, an aliquot is added to thc reconstituted assay reagents. The resulting mixturc is placed into the SmartTube, and then loaded into the SmartCycler Dx System for real-time PCR. For quality control, an external positive and negative run control are provided in the Smart GBS Assay for each run.

Device Intended Usc:

Thc Ccphcid Smart GBS Assay performed on the Ccphcid SmartCycler Dx System is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed to detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from vaginal/rectal swab spccimens and Lim broth cultures. Thc test utilizes real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a unique gene-spccific sequencc amplification of Streptococcus agalactiae recovered from clinical samples and fluorogenic target specific hybridization for thc detection of thc amplificd DNA. Rcsults from the Smart GBS Assay are intended for use as a method for rapid detcction of GBS colonization in antepartum and intrapartum womcn.

The use of the Smart GBS for intrapartum scrccning should not preclude the use of other strategies (e.g., antepartum testing). Intrapartum Smart GBS rcsults arc useful to idcntify candidatcs for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis when administration of intravenous antibiotics is not delayed pending results.   
Thc Smart GBS assay docs not provide susceptibility results. Culturc isolatcs arc needed for performing susceptibility testing as rccommended for penicillin-allergic women.

Substantial Equivalence:

The Cepheid Smart GBS Assay is substantially cquivalent to thc Infectio Diagnostic Inc. IDI-Strep B assay. Both assays detcct Group B Streptococcus; both assays usc thc Cepheid SmartCycler Dx System to dcterminc thc presence of GBS through rcal-timc PCR amplification and fluorogenic target-spccific hybridization detection; both assays recommend thc usc of Copan Collection and Transport Liquid Stuarts mcdium for specimen collection.

The Smart GBS performed on the SmartCycler Dx System also has thc same intended usc and many of the samc technological characteristics, and rcagent and instrument components as thc Ccphcid Xpcrt GBS and the GeneXpert Dx Systcm. (For cxample both assays have the same primers and probc that detect the same uniquc DNA rcgion of of S. agalactiae. Both assays utilize the I-CORE thcrmal cycling module for amplification and detection. The Xpert GBS Assay [510(k) No. K060540] was clcared on July 25, 2006.

Table 5-1 shows the similaritics and differences betwcen the Smart GBS and the predicate devicc.

Non-Clinical Studics:

Analytical Scnsitivity/Limit of Detection (LOD):

The analytical sensitivity was dctermincd using 1 1 Streptococcus agalactiae strains representing nine known serotypes. Quantitatcd cultures were tested in four replicates. All 1 1 strains were detected by thc Smart GBS Assay. The LOD was cvaluated in a separate study using groups of swabs $\tan ^ { = = } 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ spiked with GBS Serotypc II $( 7 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } / \ s \ w a b )$ at 4 concentrations (100, 250, 500, and 750 CFU). The LOD was shown to bc 750 CFU/swab (20/20 detected).

Analytical Specificity:

Analytical specificity was evaluatcd using 106 strains representing 28 Strcptococci, 78 other specics including strains phylogenctically rclatcd to Streptococcus agalactiae, other microflora (bacteria and ycasts) commonly found in vaginal and anal flora, and human DNA. Rcplicates of threc were tested at 1.5 ng/25 µL reaction (\~2c5 cquivalent genome copics per rcaction). Nonc of the 28 Streptococcal isolates (non-GBS) tcsted positivc. Of the remaining 78 strains, four (Enterococcus gallinarium, Staphylococcus simulans, Micrococcus luteus, and Propionibacterium acnes) were wcakly positive in one of six replicates at $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g } / 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ reaction.

# Clinical Studics:

Performancc characteristics of the Smart GBS Assay were dctermincd in two multi-site prospectivc investigational studics. The first study evaluated the Smart GBS using the direct mcthod. The second study evaluated the Smart GBS using enriched culture mcthod.

The direct method study (antepartum and intrapartum subjects) was performcd at six institutions and the enrichcd culture study (antepartum subjects only) was performed at thrce institutions with matcrnity services in the United States. Each institution had a culturebased or nuclcic acid test (NAT) bascd scrcening program. Testing was donc in clinical laboratorics.

Study participants had to mcct inclusion and cxclusion criteria.

The method of rcference used was the culture tcchniquc recommended by the Ccnters for Discase Control and Prevention (CDC): microbiological culture in sclcctive broth medium (Lim broth, which is Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with $1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ of nalidixic acid, and $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ of colistin), followed by ovcrnight incubation and subculture onto solid blood agar medium. Specific identification of colonies suggestivc of GBS was done with slide agglutination tests.

The performance characteristics of the Smart GBS Assay werc dctcrmincd from the results of 783 maternity subjects in thc dircct study (363 antepartum and 420 intrapartum), and 306 antcpartem maternity subjects in thc cnrichcd culture study.

Total Results:

Vaginal/rectal specimens wcre collccted from cach subject using two scts of doublce-marked collection swabs. One of the swabs from thc first sct was usced in the CDC-recommended culture technique; the other swab was uscd for Smart GBS. The second sct of doublemarked swabs was dividcd: onc swab was used in the Xpert GBS Assay on the GeneXpert Dx System, the other was used in thc IDl Strcp B™M Assay on thc SmartCycle $\cdot \underline { { \widehat { \bf R } } } )$ Systcm.

To minimize swab-to-swab variation, the swabs remaining from the Smart GBS Assay and thc IDl Strcp B Assay were both culturcd. Sensitivity and spccificity were calculated relative to thc culture results.

Table 5-2 compares the overall results from thc Smart GBS Assay run on the SmartCycler Dx System and the CDC-recommended culture technique. The sensitivity and spccificity data are shown bclow the table.

Device Name: Smart GBSTM

Indications for Use:

The Ccpheid Smart GBS Assay performed on the Cepheid SmartCycler Dx System is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed to detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from vaginal/rectal swab specimens and Lim broth cultures. The test utilizes real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a unique gene-specific sequence amplification of Streptococcus agalactiae recovered from clinical samples and fluorogenic target specific hybridization for the detection of thc amplified DNA. Results from the Smart GBS Assay are intended for use as a method for rapid detection of GBS colonization in antepartum and intrapartum women.

The use of the Smart GBS for intrapartum screening should not preclude the use of other strategies (e.g., antepartum testing). Intrapartum Smart GBS results are useful to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis when administration of intravenous antibiotics is not delayed pending results.   
The Smart GBS assay does not provide susceptibility results. Culture isolates are needed for performing susceptibility testing as recommended for penicillin-allergic women.
