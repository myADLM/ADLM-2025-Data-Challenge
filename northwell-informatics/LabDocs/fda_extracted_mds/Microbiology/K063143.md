# 1.6 Device Description

The VITROS Rubella IgG assay is performed using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Rubella IgG Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Rubella IgG Calibrators on the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System for the qualitative and quantitative determination of rubella IgG antibodies to rubella virus in human serum and plasma. An immunometric technique is used. This involves the reaction of antirubella IgG present in the sample with rubella antigen coated onto the wells. After a wash step a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG) is added and this complexes with bound anti-rubella IgG. Unbound materials are removed by washing.

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of antirubella IgG present.

# 1.7 Device Intended Use

For in vitro diagnostic use only.

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Rubella IgG assay is intended for the quantitative determination of IgG antibodies to rubella virus in human serum and plasma (heparin, EDTA or sodium citrate) using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System.

The VITROS Rubella IgG assay is for use in the clinical laboratory to aid in the determination of immunity to rubella virus infection.

# 1.8 Comparison to Predicate Device

The VITROS Rubella IgG Reagent Pack and Calibrators are substantially equivalent to the ABBOTT AxSYM Rubella IgG Assay (predicate device) which was cleared by the FDA (K954045) for IVD use.

Table 1 (next page) presents the similarities and differences of both assays.

Dear Ms. Baker:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
