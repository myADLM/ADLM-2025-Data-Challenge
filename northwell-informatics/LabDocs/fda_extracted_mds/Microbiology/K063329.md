Predicate Device:

ABBOTT AxSYM® HAVAB®-M 2.0 assay. PMA Number: P790012/S011 Decision Date: February 2, 2004 Device reclassified from class III to class II (Guidance Document February 9, 2006)

# Device Description:

The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the qualitative detection of $\mathrm { I g M }$ antibody to hepatitis A virus (IgM anti-HAV) in human adult and pediatric serum and plasma and neonatal serum. The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is calibrated with ARCHITECT HAVAB-M Calibrator. ARCHITECT HAVAB-M Controls are used for monitoring the performance of the Abbott ARCHITECT i System.

# Device Intended Use:

ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the qualitative detection of IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus (IgM anti-HAV) in human adult and pediatric serum and plasma (dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, and sodium heparin) and neonatal serum. A test for IgM anti-HAV is indicated for testing of specimens from individuals who have signs and symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis. Test results are used in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or recent hepatitis A viral infection.

Warning: Not intended for use in screening blood, plasma, or tissue donors. The effectiveness of ARCHITECT HAVAB-M for use in screening blood, plasma, or tissue donors has not been established. Assay performance characteristics have not been established when the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is used in conjunction with other manufacturers' assays for specific hepatitis markers. Users are responsible for establishing their own performance characteristics.

# The Intended Use of Predicate Device:

AxSYM HaVaB $\mathbf { \nabla } . \mathbf { M } 2 . 0$ is a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) for the qualitative detection of IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus (IgM anti-HAV) in human serum or plasma (potassium EDTA, sodium heparin, sodium citrate, or lithium heparin). A test for IgM anti-HAV isindicated as an aid in the laboratory diagnosis of acute or recent hepatiis A viral infection. Assay results, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, may be used to provide presumptive evidence of infection with hepatitis A virus in persons with signs or symptoms of hepatitis and in persons at risk for hepatitis A infection. WARNING: Assay performance characteristics have not been established for testing a pediatric population less than 10 years of age.

# Instrument Percent Agreement:

A study was conducted to confirm that the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay can be used on the ARCHITECT i 2000 and ARCHITECT i 2000SR systems. One hundred $\mathbf { I g M }$ anti-HAV negative specimens and $6 7 \mathrm { I g M }$ anti-HAV positive specimens were tested on two instruments (one i 2000 and one i 2000sR) using two lots of reagents and one lot of calibrators and controls. One replicate of each specimen was tested with the same reagent lot on both instruments. The negative percent agreement was $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 6 . 3 8 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ , and the positive percent agreement was $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of 94.64 to $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ .

# Comparison of Results and Percent Agreement:

The positive percent agreement of the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay with the comparator assay for the prospectively collected population was $9 8 . 1 0 \%$ , with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 3 . 2 9 \%$ EY to $9 9 . 7 7 \%$ . The negative percent agreement of the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay with the comparator assay for the prospectively collected population was $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ , with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 9 . 3 4 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ .

The positive percent agreement of the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay with the comparator assay for the acute HAV population is $9 8 . 1 0 \%$ , with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 3 . 2 9 \%$ to $9 9 . 7 7 \%$ .

The negative percent agreement of the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay with the comparator assay for a pediatric population at low risk for hepatitis is $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ , with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 6 . 3 8 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ .

The positive percent agreement for a prospectively collected pediatric population is $9 8 . 8 8 \%$ , with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 3 . 9 0 \%$ to $9 9 . 9 7 \%$ and the negative percent agreement is $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $7 5 . 2 9 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ .

In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is as safe and effective as, and is substantially equivalent to, the Abbott AxSYM HAVAB- 2.0 assay.

Dear Mr. Orlowski:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
