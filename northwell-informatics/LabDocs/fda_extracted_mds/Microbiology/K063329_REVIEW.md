# I. Device Description:

The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is a two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of IgM anti-HAV in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the first step, prediluted sample, assay diluent, and hepatitis A virus (human) coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. IgM anti-HAV present in the sample binds to the hepatitis A virus (human) coated microparticles. After washing, the IgM anti-HAV binds to the antihuman IgM acridinium-labeled conjugate that is added in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of IgM anti-HAV in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i$ System optics. The presence or absence of IgM anti-HAV in the specimen is determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff signal determined from an active ARCHITECT HAVAB-M calibration. The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is calibrated with ARCHITECT HAVAB-M Standard Calibrator. ARCHITECT HAVAB-M Controls are assayed for the verification of the accuracy and precision of

the Abbott ARCHITECT System.

ARCHITECT HAVAB-M Reagent Kit consists of:

Hepatitis A virus coated microparticles in TRIS buffer, with preservatives and antimicrobial agents;   
Anti-human IgM (mouse, monoclonal) acridinium-labeled conjugate in MES buffer with protein additive, preservatives and other antimicrobial agents; and Assay Diluent: TRIS buffer with protein additive, preservatives and other antimicrobial agents.

The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M Controls are:

Positive control - recalcified anti-HAV positive human plasma in recalcified antiHAV negative human plasma. Contains Acid Blue No. 9 dye and preservatives. Non-reactive for HBsAg, HIV-1 Ag or HIV-1 RNA, anti-HIV-1/HIV-2, and antiHCV.   
Negative control - recalcified anti-HAV negative human plasma with   
preservatives. Non-reactive for anti-HAV, HBsAg, HIV-1 Ag or HIV-1 RNA, anti-HIV-1/HIV-2, and anti-HCV.

The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M Calibrator is recalcified anti-HAV positive human plasma in recalcified anti-HAV negative human plasma. Calibrator 1 is green and contains Acid Yellow No. 23 and Acid Blue No. 9 dyes, and preservatives. The calibrator is reactive for anti-HAV and nonreactive for HBsAg, HIV-1 Ag or HIV-1 RNA, anti-HIV-1/HIV-2, and anti-HCV.

Class II Special Control Guidance Document: Hepatitis A Virus Serological Assays, issued February 9, 2006

# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is a two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of IgM anti-HAV in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology.

First step: Sample (pre-diluted), assay diluent, and paramagnetic microparticles coated with HAV (human) are combined. IgM anti-HAV present in the sample binds to the HAV (human) coated microparticles.

Second step: After washing, the IgM anti-HAV binds to the anti-human IgM acridinium-labeled conjugate. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added, and the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs) detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.

The presence or absence of IgM anti-HAV in the specimen is determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff signal determined from an active ARCHITECT HAVAB-M calibration.

Calculations:

The ARCHITECT $i$ System calculates the cutoff RLU from the Calibrator mean RLU. The cutoff RLU is stored for each reagent lot calibration.   
Cutoff $\mathrm { R L U } = 0 . 3 7 5 { \mathrm { ~ x ~ } }$ (Calibrator mean RLU)   
The ARCHITECT $i$ System calculates the S/CO result for each sample as follows: $\mathrm { S / C O = }$ Sample RLU/Cutoff RLU

Interpretation of Results:

\* Monitoring the level of IgM anti-HAV by redrawing and retesting at approximately one week intervals will distinguish rapidly rising $\mathrm { I g M }$ anti-HAV levels associated with early acute hepatitis A infection from gradually decreasing or unchanging IgM anti-HAV levels often associated with late acute stage of HAV infection.

Assay results should be interpreted only in the context of other clinical laboratory findings and the total clinical status of the individual. It has been shown that a viremic window exists with individuals infected with HAV where the individual may be symptomatic for hepatitis but IgM anti-HAV nonreactive.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

In addition to the required preclinical studies, the testing scheme was incorporated into the Precision, Calibration Curve Storage, and Instrument Percent Agreement studies. The results from these studies confirm that the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay can be used on the ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0$ and $i 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { S R }$ .

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Within-laboratory precision:

A 20-day precision study was performed at Abbott Laboratories based on guidance from the CLSI document EP5-A2. ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0$ and $i$ $2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } }$ were used. Testing was performed using 2 instruments (one of each), 3 assay reagent lots, 3 calibrator lots, and one control lot. The ARCHITECT

HAVAB-M Negative Control (NC), Positive Control (PC), high negative panel (targeted to $0 . 8 0 \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O } )$ , and low positive panel (targeted to $1 . 2 0 { \mathrm { S } } / { \mathrm { C O } } )$ were tested in replicates of three, two times per day (separated by a minimum of two hours), for total of 20 testing days.

# Interference:

At the concentrations listed below, bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), hemoglobin, total protein, and triglycerides showed less than $10 \%$ interference in the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay for high negative samples targeted to $0 . 8 0 \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O }$ and low positive samples targeted to $1 . 2 0 \ : \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O }$ :

• Bilirubin $\leq 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ • Hemoglobin $\leq 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Total Protein $\leq 1 2 \ { \mathrm { g / d L } }$ Triglycerides $\leq 3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# f. Assay cut-off:

The presence or absence of IgM antibody to Hepatitis A virus in the sample is determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff RLU determined from an active ARCHITECT HAVAB-M calibration. The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M results are expressed as the ratio of the sample RLU to the cutoff RLU (S/CO):

$\mathrm { S / C O } = \mathfrak { s }$ Sample RLU / Cutoff RLU where the Cutoff ${ \mathrm { R L U } } =$ Calibrator 1 mean RLU x 0.375 where the cutoff multipler value has been established using a population of specimens, and ROC analysis demonstrated that the optimal sensitivity and specificity is achieved when the cutoff is set using a multiplier of 0.375. 168/173 of true positive specimens were detected, for a sensitivity of $9 7 . 1 1 \%$ and specificity of $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ (2119/2119) at the lower limit $( - 2 0 \% )$ of GZ $( \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O } = 0 . 8 0 )$ . The seroconversion sensitivity was verified with this cutoff and found to be acceptable when compared to predicate FDA approved assay, and clinical investigation data support the cutoff calculation.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Of the 658 specimens from the intended use population tested in a prospective multi-center study, 554 specimens (Population 1) were obtained from individuals living in the United States from the following populations: 253 specimens were from individuals at increased risk of HAV infection; 200 specimens were from individuals with signs and symptoms of hepatitis; 1 specimen was from an individual diagnosed with acute HAV infection; and 100 specimens were from pediatric individuals. Additionaly, 104 specimens (Population 2) were obtained from individuals living outside the United States diagnosed with acute HAV infection (including one pre-selected IgM antiHAV positive specimen).

The comparison of the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M results to the comparator IgM anti-HAV results and associated percent agreement (including $9 5 \%$ exact confidence intervals) are summarized in the following tables. Data are listed by site and population.

# Performance Cord Blood:

A study was conducted to evaluate whether neonate samples may be tested with the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay. Cord blood was used as a surrogate for neonate serum. Twenty-six matched cord blood and maternal serum samples were spiked with $\mathrm { I g M }$ HAV positive stock to yield a high negative sample (target $\mathrm { S / C O } 0 . 8 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ and a low positive sample (target S/CO 1.20). None of the samples were initially reactive. The data obtained upon spiking are summarized in the following table, showing the amount of bias for the cord blood samples from the matched maternal serum samples. All individual samples listed as having $2 1 0 \%$ bias observed with the cord blood exhibited negative bias when compared to matched maternal serum sample.

# HAV Prevalence Population

Of the 1167 specimens tested in the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M clinical study, 862 specimens were from the following populations: 509 specimens were from apparently healthy individuals, 253 specimens were from individuals at increased risk of HAV infection, and 100 specimens were from pediatric individuals.

The 509 specimens from the apparently healthy population from both low prevalence (Port Jefferson, NY and Milwaukee, WI) and high prevalence (Galveston, TX and Phoenix, AZ) areas were obtained from the following collection locations: 145 $( 2 8 . 4 9 \% )$ from Milwaukee, WI; 140 $( 2 7 . 5 0 \% )$ from Galveston, TX; 114 $( 2 2 . 4 0 \% )$ from Phoenix, AZ; and 110 ( $2 1 . 6 1 \%$ from Port Jefferson, NY. The apparently healthy population $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 5 0 9 )$ ) consisted of the following race/ethnic groups: 269 $( 5 2 . 8 5 \% )$ Caucasian, 175 $( 3 4 . 3 8 \% )$ AfricanAmerican, 40 $( 7 . 8 6 \% )$ Hispanic, 11 $( 2 . 1 6 \% )$ Asian, 5 $( 0 . 9 8 \% )$ American Indian/Alaska Native, and 9 $( 1 . 7 7 \% )$ other.

# Population at Increased Risk for HAV Infection

Expected results of asymptomatic individuals from the multi-center study described in “Performance Characteristics” are provided below. The specimens were from 253 individuals at increased risk of HAV infection due to exposure to contaminated food or water, poor sanitary conditions or hygiene, household or sexual contact with an HAV infected individual, recent travel to an HAV endemic area, lifestyle, behavior, or recipients of clotting factor concentrates.

The increased risk population $\mathrm { ( n { = } 2 5 3 ) }$ ) consisted of the following race/ethnic groups: 140 $5 5 . 3 4 \%$ Caucasian, 48 $( 1 8 . 9 7 \% )$ African-American, 47 $( 1 8 . 5 8 \% )$ Hispanic, 9 $( 3 . 5 6 \% )$ Asian, 3 $( 1 . 1 9 \% )$ American Indian/Alaska Native, and 6 $( 2 . 3 7 \% )$ other. The 253 specimens from the increased risk population were obtained from the following collection locations: 64 $( 2 5 . 3 0 \% )$ from Galveston, TX; 57 $( 2 2 . 5 3 \% )$ from Dallas, TX; 46 $( 1 8 . 1 8 \% )$ from St. Petersburg, FL; 29 $( 1 1 . 4 6 \% )$ from Denver, CO; 23 $( 9 . 0 9 \% )$ from Miami, FL; 23 $( 9 . 0 9 \% )$ from Chicago, IL; 7 $( 2 . 7 7 \% )$ from Plymouth, MA; and 4 $( 1 . 5 8 \% )$ from Colton, CA. Of the 253 specimens, 155 $( 6 1 . 2 6 \% )$ were male and 98 $( 3 8 . 7 4 \% )$ were female. The mean age was 42 years (age range: 18 to 78 years).

The distribution of ARCHITECT HAVAB-M reactive, grayzone, and nonreactive results among individuals with increased risk for HAV $\mathrm { ( n { = } 2 5 3 }$ ) is summarized by age and gender in the table below.
