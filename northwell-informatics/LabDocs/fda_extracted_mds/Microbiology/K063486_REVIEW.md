3. Special condition for use statement Prescription Use Only

BDXpert rules software will automatically suppress the final susceptibility interpretative criteria of Shigella species against minocycline.

4. Special instrument Requirements: Not Applicable

# I. Device Description: This submission is for the AST panel only. The ID system was not reviewed.

The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for the AST Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted broth containing Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation and incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The resulting AST has a final inoculum of $5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give a MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard.”

# L. Test Principle:

The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidationreduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” which contain no antibiotic.

Phoenix produced acceptable QC results as compared to the reference method results $59 5 \%$ of the time. The mode for the

Phoenix is the same as for the mode for the Reference results. No QC trending was observed.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results. Five different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the CLSI recommendation and used to compare with the Phoenix™ results. Clinical testing was performed at four sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known results. A total of 2081 isolates were tested, 109 were challenge and 1972 were Clinical isolates. The clinical isolates were comprised of $4 2 . 0 \%$ fresh, $3 4 . 5 \%$ recent isolates and $2 3 . 5 \%$ stock isolates with the following performance (see table below).

There were 2173 isolates evaluated of which 2081 were appropriate for the panel. The performance data are displayed in the table below.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within the test range and on scale.

The performance for Minocycline tested against challenge isolates produced an EA of $9 7 . 2 \%$ , the Evaluable EA was $9 8 . 6 \%$ and a CA of $8 3 . 9 \%$ . There were $1 4 \mathrm { m i n }$ generated by the Challenge set, all within EA. There were no vmj and 1 maj. The EA and the Eval. EA for the challenge set were both good. The overall performance was an EA $9 4 . 2 \%$ and a CA of $9 2 \%$ . Therefore the data are acceptable.

The test device had a growth rate of $59 5 \%$ .

# N. Proposed Labeling

The expected value range, interpretive criteria and QC for gram negative panels are included in the package insert as recommended by CLSI. BDXpert rules software will automatically suppress the final susceptibility interpretative criteria of Shigella species against minocycline. The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
