Product Name: Microdilution Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Panels Trade Name: MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels Intended Use: To determine antimicrobial agent susceptibility   
510(k) Notification: New antimicrobial - chloramphenicol   
Predicate device: MicroScan® Synergies plus™" Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels and MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive Panels

# 510(k) Summary:

MicroScan® Synergies plus™" Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels, utilizing both the MicroScan® Rapid Fluorogenic Identification and Dried Overnight Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) technologies, are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive enterococci and staphylococci.

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in water, buffer, or minute concentrations of broth, to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with Synergies plus" Pos Broth, after inoculation with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in the WalkAway® SI, or equivalent, System, for 4.5 - 18 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is read by determining the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.

The proposed MicroScan® Synergies plus" Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with a frozen Reference Panel, as defined in the FDA document "Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA", dated February 5, 2003. The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of the MicroScan® Synergies plusTM GramPositive MIC/Combo Panel with chloramphenicol.

The external validation was conducted with fresh and stock Efficacy isolates and stock Challenge strains. The external validations were designed to confirm the acceptability of the proposed Synergies plus" Gram-Positive Panel by comparing its performance with a frozen Reference panel. Challenge strains were compared to

Expected Results determined prior to the evaluation. The Synergies plus" GramPositive Panel demonstrated acceptable performance with an overall Categorical Agreement of 96.1% for chloramphenicol when compared with the frozen Reference panel.

Instrument reproducibility testing demonstrated acceptable reproducibility and precision for chloramphenicol with Turbidity inoculum preparation method and the WalkAway SI System or equivalent.

Quality Control testing demonstrated acceptable results for chloramphenicol.

Dear Mr. Eusebio:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The al ontros provisions heAct ncuderequrementsrual rgistratin,s o devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use

510k) Number (if known): K063564

Device Name: MicroScan® Synergies plus™" Grami-Positive MIC/Combo Panels with Chloramphenicol (4 - 16 μg/ml)

# Indications For Use:

The MicroScan® Synergies plus™" Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive enterococci and staphylococci. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 4.5 - 18 hours at 35°C +/- 1°C, in a WalkAway® SI, or equivalent, and read by the MicroScan® Instrumentation. Additionally, the panels may be incubated in a non-CO2 incubator and the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) portions can be read visually, according to the Package Insert.

This particular submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial chloramphenicol, at concentrations of 4 to 16 µg/ml, for enterococci and staphylococci, to the test panel.

The gram-positive organisms which may be used for chloramphenicol susceptibility testing in this panel are:

Staphylococcus aureus
