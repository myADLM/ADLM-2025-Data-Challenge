# I. Device Description:

The APTIMA CT Assay combines the technologies of target capture, TMA and HPA. Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes. The transport solution in these tubes releases the rRNA target and protects it from degradation during storage. When the APTIMA CT Assay is performed in the laboratory, the target rRNA molecule is isolated from the specimens by the use of a capture oligomer in a method called target capture; magnetic micro particles are another key feature of target capture. The capture oligomer contains a sequence complementary to a specific region of the target molecule as well as a string of deoxyadenosine residues. During the hybridization step, the sequence specific region of the capture oligomer binds to a specific region of the target molecule. The capture oligomer:target complex is then captured out of solution by decreasing the temperature of the reaction to room temperature. This temperature reduction allows hybridization to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the capture oligomer and the poly-deoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the magnetic particles. The micro particles, including the captured target molecule bound to them, are pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The particles are washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification reaction inhibitors. After the target capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for amplification. Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary oligonucleotide primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic acid strands. The Gen-Probe TMA reaction replicates a specific region of the rRNA from CT via DNA intermediates. A unique set of primers is used for the target molecule. Detection of the rRNA

amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic acid hybridization. A single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probe, which is complementary to a region of the target amplicon, is labeled with an acridinium ester molecule. The labeled DNA probe combines with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA hybrids. The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from unhybridized probe. During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA hybrids is measured as photon signals in a luminometer, and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU).

The device is similar to the Gen-Probe Aptima Assay for Chlamydia trachomatis in that the target organism is $C .$ . trachomatis. The primary difference between the two assays is the platform on which the assays are performed. The TIGRIS fully automates all steps necessary to perform the ACT Assay from sample processing through amplification, detection, and data reduction.

# DTS Systems Clinical Performance Characteristics

See TIGRIS DTS System Clinical Specimen Agreement following the DTS Systems Analytical Performance Characteristics section for TIGRIS DTS System-specific clinical performance characteristics.

# Clinical Study Results

The performance characteristics of the APTIMA CT Assay were established in three multi-center clinical investigations conducted in North America. In the first clinical investigation, two studies were conducted. One, the clinical specimen study, established the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the APTIMA CT Assay using clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal, and male urethral swab specimens, patientcollected vaginal swab specimens, and male and female urine specimens. The second study evaluated the precision of the APTIMA CT Assay when performed according to NCCLS Guidelines (16).

# Clinical Specimen Study: Endocervical Swab, Male Urethral Swab, Vaginal Swab, and Urine Specimens

Clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab, patient-collected vaginal swab, and male and female urine specimens were collected from 2,787

symptomatic and asymptomatic, male and female subjects attending OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD), teen, and family planning clinics at eight geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if symptoms such as discharge, dysuria, and pelvic pain were reported by the subject. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms. Of the 1,392 asymptomatic subjects enrolled in the study, 2 were less than 16 years of age, 237 were between the ages of 16 and 20, 423 were between the ages of 21 and 25, and 730 were greater than 25 years of age. Of the 1,395 symptomatic subjects enrolled in the study, 211 were between the ages of 16 and 20, 494 were between the ages of 21 and 25, and 690 were greater than 25 years of age. Three specimens were collected from each of the 1,322 eligible male subjects. Five specimens were collected from each of the 1,465 eligible female subjects. For male subjects, two randomized urethral swabs were collected followed by one urine specimen. For female subjects, one urine specimen was collected followed by one patient-collected vaginal swab, one clinician-collected vaginal swab, and two randomized endocervical swabs. APTIMA CT Assay and APTIMA Combo 2 Assay CT results were generated from the two vaginal swabs, one endocervical swab, one male urethral swab, and a male and female urine aliquot. The remaining endocervical swab, male urethral swab, and a male and female urine aliquot were tested using another commercially-available NAAT. Endocervical and male urethral swab specimens and male and female urine specimens tested in the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay and the other commercially available NAAT were used as the reference NAATs to determine infected status for each subject. Specimen testing was conducted either at the site of subject enrollment or at an external testing site.All performance calculations were based on the total number of APTIMA CT Assay results for endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab, and male and female urine specimens compared to a patient infected status algorithm for each gender. In the algorithm, the designation of a subject as being infected or not infected with CT was based on endocervical swab and urine specimen results from the commercially-available APTIMA Combo 2 Assay and the other commercially-available NAAT. Subjects were considered infected with CT if two of the four endocervical swab and urine specimens tested positive in the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay and the other reference NAAT (one specimen testing positive in each NAAT). Subjects were considered non-infected if less than two reference NAAT results were positive. A total of 8,406 APTIMA CT Assay results were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity and specificity for CT by gender, specimen type and symptom status are presented in Table 4. Table 6 shows the APTIMA CT Assay sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values compared to patient infected status for each clinical site and overall. Tables 7a-7d summarize the number of results from symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT according to the patient infected status algorithm.Of the 2,787 subjects enrolled, there were 13 subjects with unknown CT patient infected status. Subjects were designated with an unknown patient infected status if results were missing that prevented conclusive determination of infected status. These subjects' results were not included in any performance calculations. Of the 8,452 APTIMA CT Assay results from the multi-center clinical study, there was a small percentage ( $8 , 0 . 0 9 \%$ of specimens that initially tested invalid for CT. Upon repeat testing, there were no equivocal or invalid results.

# Clinical Specimen Study: PreservCyt Solution Liquid Pap

A prospective multi-center clinical study was conducted to evaluate the use of the PreservCyt Solution (a component of the ThinPrep 2000 System) as an alternative medium for gynecological specimens for the detection of CT by the APTIMA CT Assay. One thousand six hundred forty-seven (1,647) symptomatic and asymptomatic female subjects attending OB/GYN, family planning, public health, women's, and STD clinics were evaluated in the clinical study. Of the 1,647 evaluable subjects, 1,288 were asymptomatic subjects and 359 were symptomatic subjects. Subjects were enrolled from sites with CT prevalence that ranged from $2 . 8 \%$ to $1 4 . 0 \%$ . Two specimens were collected from each eligible subject: one PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimen and one endocervical swab specimen. PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were collected with the spatula/cyto-brush or a broom-like brush cervical sampling device. The distribution of cervical sampling devices is summarized in Table 5 by specimen collection site and overall. PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were processed in accordance with the ThinPrep 2000 Processor Operator's Manual and APTIMA Specimen Transfer Kit Package Insert. After processing the PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimen with the ThinPrep 2000 Processor, the specimen was transferred into the APTIMA Specimen Transfer Kit for testing with the APTIMA CT Assay. Sensitivity and specificity of the APTIMA CT Assay in PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were calculated by comparing results to a patient infected status algorithm. The algorithm included APTIMA Combo 2 Assay and APTIMA CT Assay results in endocervical swab specimens. Both reference NAATs were required to be positive to establish an infected patient status. At least one reference NAAT was required to be negative to establish a non-infected patient status. Table 7e summarizes the frequency of test outcomes for the two reference NAATs.

Table 5a shows the sensitivities and specificities of the APTIMA CT Assay by symptom status and overall. Overall sensitivity was $9 5 . 6 \%$ (86/90). In symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, sensitivities were $9 6 . 7 \%$ (29/30) and $9 5 . 0 \%$ (57/60), respectively. Overall specificity was $9 8 . 8 \%$ (1539/1557). In symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, specificities were $9 8 . 8 \%$ (325/329) and $9 8 . 9 \%$ (1214/1228), respectively. Table 6a shows the sensitivities and specificities of the APTIMA CT Assay by specimen collection site and overall. Sensitivities ranged from $9 2 . 9 \%$ to $100 \%$ . Specificities ranged from $9 6 . 5 \%$ to $100 \%$ .

# Precision Study

APTIMA CT Assay precision (i.e., reproducibility) was evaluated at two external clinical sites and at Gen-Probe. APTIMA CT Assay precision was evaluated across three APTIMA CT Assay kit lots, three study sites, six operators and 108 APTIMA CT Assay runs. Two operators at each of the three testing sites performed a total of six APTIMA CT Assay runs per kit lot for a total of 36 runs per kit lot. Each run was composed of a 12-member precision panel containing 0 to 2,000 fg/assay of CT rRNA. Reproducibility was established using spiked swab transport medium with rRNA. Reproducibility when testing swab and urine specimens containing target organism has not been determined. Table 8 presents the precision RLU data in terms of Mean, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation (CV), and percent agreement with expected results for calculations of inter-site, inter-lot, inter-operator, inter-run, and intra-run variability.

PreservCyt specimen intra-laboratory precision with the ACT Assay was determined by spiking PreservCyt vials with $2 0 \mathrm { C T }$ IFU per vial (0.1 IFU per reaction) and $1 0 0 \mathrm { C T }$ IFU per vial (0.5 IFU per reaction). Vials containing 1,000 CT IFU per vial (5 IFU per reaction) and unspiked PreservCyt vials were tested as positive and negative controls. Ten vials spiked at each IFU level and ten unspiked vials were divided between two operators. The operators vortexed the vials and then transferred 14 aliquots ( $\mathrm { 1 . 0 ~ m L }$ each) per vial into 14 APTIMA Transfer Tubes as per the APTIMA Specimen Transfer Kit package insert. The operators were blinded to the samples' titers. Each of the resulting Pap-STM samples was tested once in the ACT Assay. A total of five runs were performed over a five day period for 140 results at each IFU level. The results are summarized in Table 9.

# DTS Systems Analytical Performance Characteristics

See TIGRIS DTS System Analytical Performance Characteristics following the Figure TIGRIS DTS System Clinical Specimen Agreement section for TIGRIS DTS Systemspecific analytical performance characteristics.

# Analytical Sensitivity

C. trachomatis analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) was determined by directly comparing dilutions of CT organisms in cell culture and in the APTIMA CT assay. The analytical sensitivity claim for the assay is one Inclusion-Forming Unit (IFU) per assay (7.25 IFU/swab, $5 \ \mathrm { I F U / m L }$ urine, and $9 . 7 5 \ : \mathrm { I F U / m L }$ PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap) for all $1 5 \mathrm { C T }$ serovars. However, dilutions of less than one IFU/assay of all serovars tested positive.

# Analytical Specificity

A total of 154 culture isolates were evaluated using the APTIMA CT Assay. These isolates included 86 organisms that may be isolated from the urogenital tract and 68 additional organisms that represent a phylogenetic cross-section of organisms. The tested organisms included bacteria, fungi, yeast, parasites and viruses. All organisms except $C .$ . psittaci, C. pneumoniae, U. urealyticum and the viruses were tested at $1 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 6$ cells/assay in KOVA-trol/Urine Transport Media and 60 organisms were tested in Swab

Transport Media. The Chlamydia and Neisseria organisms were tested in the PreservCyt Solution media. C. psittaci VR601 was tested at 8x104 cells/assay and $C .$ . psittaci VR125 was tested at $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 5$ cells/assay. C. pneumoniaewas tested at $4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 3$ cells/assay and $U .$ . urealyticum was tested at $6 . 7 \times 1 0 6$ cells/assay. The viruses were tested as follows: (a) herpes simplex virus I: $2 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 4$ TCID50/assay, (b) herpes simplex virus II: $6 . 0 \times 1 0 4$ TCID50/assay, (c) human papillomavirus 16: $2 . 9 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 6$ DNA copies/assay and (d) cytomegalovirus: $4 . 8 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 5$ cells/assay. The list of organisms tested is shown in Table 10.

# Interfering Substances

The following interfering substances were individually spiked into swab, PreservCyt liquid Pap and/or urine specimens: $10 \%$ blood, contraceptive jelly, spermicide, moisturizer, hemorrhoidal anesthetic, body oil, powder, anti-fungal cream, vaginal lubricants, feminine spray and leukocytes ( $\mathrm { 1 \times 1 0 6 \ c e l l s / m L }$ ). The following interfering substances were individually spiked into urine specimens: $30 \%$ blood, urine analytes, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, nitrate, urobilinogen, $\mathrm { p H } 4$ (acidic), $\mathsf { p H } 9$ (alkaline), leukocytes (1 x 106 cells/mL), cellular debris, vitamins, minerals, acetaminophen, aspirin and ibuprofen. All were tested for potential assay interference in the absence and presence of CT at the estimated rRNA equivalent of 1 cell/assay (5 fg/assay). The rRNA equivalents were calculated based on the genome size and estimated DNA:RNA ratio/cell of each organism. No interference was observed with any of the tested substances. No inhibitors of amplification were observed in the APTIMA CT Assay.

# Recovery

Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 x 1 0 8 }$ cells/assay) were added to samples containing the rRNA equivalent of approximately one CT IFU (5 fg). These additions did not interfere with the amplification and detection of CT rRNA using the APTIMA CT Assay.

# Swab and Urine Specimen Stability Studies

Data to support the recommended shipping and storage conditions for endocervical, urethral and vaginal swab samples were generated with pooled negative swab samples. Pooled samples were spiked with CT at a final concentration of 1 IFU per reaction. The spiked samples were held at -70oC, -20oC, 4oC, and 30oC. Samples were tested in duplicate at days 0, 20, 77, and 117. All test conditions were positive for CT at all times and temperatures.

Data to support the recommended shipping and storage conditions for urine samples were generated with female and male negative urine samples. The urine samples were spiked with CT at a final concentration of 10 IFU per reaction. Two sets of the spiked urine samples were held at $3 0 \mathrm { o C }$ for 24 hours prior to being added to the Urine Transport Media (UTM). The two sets of UTM samples then were held at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and tested in triplicate at days 0, 1, 5, 20, and 35. All samples were positive for CT at all timepoints. The two sets of UTM samples were also tested after 116 days of storage at $- 2 0 \mathrm { o C }$ and - 70oC. All samples were positive for CT under both storage conditions. Liquid Pap Specimen Stability StudiesData to support the recommended shipping and storage conditions for PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap samples were generated with negative

processed and unprocessed liquid Pap samples. For the unprocessed samples, four pools of PreservCyt Solution samples were tested after being stored in the Cytyc PreservCyt Solution vial. Each specimen pool was spiked with 1-10 IFU CT/assay, held at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , then tested at baseline and on days 5, 7, 8, 14, 18, 21, 25 and 36. All of the spiked samples were positive for CT at all times and temperatures.For the processed samples, four pools of PreservCyt Solution samples were used to determine processed specimen stability at $2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Each negative sample pool was spiked with 1-10 IFU CT/assay, then tested at baseline. Prior to processing, the PreservCyt Solution samples were stored at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for seven (7) days to simulate the time lapse between sample collection, Pap processing and shipment to a microbiology testing lab. After seven days at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ aliquots of each pool were transferred to an APTIMA Specimen Transfer Tube and tested at baseline before being placed at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The processed samples were then tested for 17 days stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and 36 days stored at $2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ to $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . All of the spiked samples were positive for CT at all times and temperatures.Data to support longer storage conditions were generated from four pools of negative processed PreservCyt Solution samples tested at below freezing temperatures. Each pool was spiked with 1-10 IFU CT/assay, then tested at baseline. Each pool was first placed at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 14 days and then stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ over the course of 106 days. All of the spiked samples were positive for CT at all times and temperatures.

# TIGRIS DTS System Clinical Specimen Agreement TIGRIS DTS System Agreement

Agreement between APTIMA CT Assay results generated on the fully automated TIGRIS DTS System and semi-automated DTS Systems was evaluated by testing endocervical swab, male urethral swab, male and female urine, vaginal swab, and PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens. Each of the clinical specimens was tested individually with the APTIMA CT Assay on both the TIGRIS DTS System and DTS Systems at GenProbe. The order of testing was not randomized. Specimens identified for inclusion were tested on the TIGRIS DTS System followed by testing on DTS Systems.

Clinical Specimen Agreement Study - Endocervical Swab, Male Urethral Swab, Female and Male Urine, Vaginal Swab, and PreservCyt liquid Pap Specimens Female and male subjects attending STD, family planning, and OB/GYN clinics from eight geographically diverse sites with low to high prevalence for CT contributed endocervical swab, male urethral swab, female and male urine, vaginal swab, and PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens. The specimens were transferred directly to Gen-Probe for testing while the PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens were processed at 2 cytopathology laboratories before being transferred. At Gen-Probe, endocervical swab, male urethral swab, female and male urine specimens were first screened with APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the TIGRIS DTS System, and the vaginal swab and PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens were screened with APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the DTS Systems. Specimens with final invalid or equivocal results were not selected in the APTIMA CT Clinical Specimen Agreement Study.Two hundred and five female swabs (87 endocervical and 118 vaginal), 120 male urethral swab, 98 female urine, 115 male urine, and 116 PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens with APTIMA Combo 2 Assay CT positive and negative results were selected for comparison testing between the TIGRIS DTS System and the DTS Systems for the APTIMA CT Assay. Specimens with initial invalid or equivocal results were retested using the same system on which the result was

generated. One female urine specimen had an initial equivocal result on the DTS Systems; when retested, the final result was valid. One male urine specimen had an initial invalid result on the TIGRIS DTS System; when retested, the final result was valid. One female urine specimen had an initial equivocal result on the TIGRIS DTS System; this specimen was retested, however, the specimen had expired, so the final result was equivocal. Table 11 shows the positive, negative, and overall agreements for all paired results for each specimen type by symptomatic status. Specimens are relatively imbalanced by symptomatic and asymptomatic status but overall agreements for symptomatic subjects were $9 8 . 5 \%$ (131/133) for female swabs (combined endocervical and vaginal swabs), $100 \%$ (60/60) for male urethral swab, $9 8 . 2 \%$ (55/56) for female urine specimens, $100 \%$ (60/60) for male urine specimens, and $100 \%$ (81/81) for PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens. For asymptomatic subjects, overall agreements were $100 \%$ for 72 female swabs, 60 male urethral swabs, 42 female urine, 55 male urine specimens, and 35 PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens, respectively. For ‘All’ (symptomatic and asymptomatic combined) subjects, overall agreement was $9 9 . 0 \%$ (203/205) for female swab (combined endocervical and vaginal swabs), $100 \%$ (120/120) for male urethral swab, $9 9 . 0 \%$ (97/98) for female urine, $100 \%$ (115/115) for male urine, and $100 \%$ (116/116) for PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens. Due to the relatively smaller specimen number from asymptomatic subjects, these findings may not be generalizable to ACT-TIGRIS System testing with specimens from asymptomatic subjects. Refer to Tables 4 and 6 for APTIMA CT Assay sensitivity and specificity estimates from testing on the DTS Systems. Sensitivity and specificity of the APTIMA CT Assay when using the TIGRIS DTS System would be expected to be similar given the agreement findings.

# Precision Study

The effect of several factors on the variability of APTIMA CT Assay performance on the TIGRIS DTS System was evaluated using 12-member STD reproducibility panels. Panel members contained 0 to 5,000 fg CT rRNA/assay. The panel included panel members with CT concentrations at the analytical sensitivity claim of 5 fg CT rRNA/assay.The panels were tested at one external testing site and at Gen-Probe using two APTIMA CT Assay reagent lots. At Gen-Probe, two operators each performed three valid worklists per reagent lot on each of two TIGRIS DTS System instruments. At the external testing site, two operators each performed three valid worklists per reagent lot on one TIGRIS DTS

System instrument. One worklist consisted of run controls and six 12-member panels. Reproducibility was determined by calculating the agreement between the final assay results and the expected outcome for each panel member. Reproducibility was also assessed by calculating the SD and coefficient of variation (CV) of signal with respect to sites, operators, lots, and worklists. CVs were not calculated for CT-negative panel members due to low signal values that could theoretically equal zero. Table 12 shows the reproducibility results. All APTIMA CT Assay results on the TIGRIS DTS System agreed with the expected results. CV values were less than or equal to $3 . 4 \%$ .

# TIGRIS DTS System Analytical Performance Characteristics

# Analytical Sensitivity Equivalence Study

Sensitivity panels in endocervical swab pool, vaginal specimen pool, urine specimen pool, and PreservCyt liquid Pap specimen pool were prepared at CT rRNA equivalent of 1 IFU per assay (7.25 IFU/swab and $5 \ \mathrm { I F U / m L }$ urine) and tested 60 replicates on the TIGRIS DTS System. Percent positivity $9 5 \%$ C.I.) on the TIGRIS DTS System for endocervical swab specimen was $100 \%$ (95.1 - 100), for vaginal swab specimen was $100 \%$ (95.1 - 100), for urine specimen was $100 \%$ (95.1 - 100), and for PreservCyt liquid Pap specimen was $100 \%$ (95.1 - 100).

# CT rRNA Spiked Clinical Panel Study

The CT rRNA spiked clinical panel study evaluated agreement between the two systems (TIGRIS DTS System and DTS Systems) using six Gen-Probe prepared CT clinical

panels spiked with 0 to 5,000 fg rRNA/assay of CT. The CT clinical panels were created from endocervical swab, vaginal swab, urethral swab, male urine, female urine, and PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens that had negative APTIMA CT results on the DTS Systems when tested at Gen-Probe. The negative specimens were pooled by specimen type, spiked or not spiked with CT rRNA and aliquotted as replicates of each panel member. Replicates of each of 6-panel members with different spiked rRNA levels were combined to create one clinical panel for each specimen type. Each panel contained a total of 132 replicates.Table 13 shows the percent agreement for each level of rRNA in the endocervical swab, vaginal swab, urethral swab, male urine, female urine, and PreservCyt liquid Pap panels, respectively, with expected CT results for the TIGRIS DTS System and for the DTS Systems. The concentration ranged from 1 log below to 3 logs above the 5 fg rRNA/assay for CT. Also shown in Table 13 are the overall percent agreements of the clinical panel study between the TIGRIS DTS System and DTS Systems.

# Analytical Specificity Equivalence Study

For a nucleic acid amplification assay, analytical specificity with respect to individual organisms is largely determined by the chemistry of the assay (e.g. oligonucleotide sequences) rather than by the platform. Because the reagents for the APTIMA CT Assay are identical between the TIGRIS DTS System and the DTS Systems, analytical specificity experiments on the TIGRIS DTS System were designed to focus on the most challenging culture isolates. These organisms included those known to cross-react in other amplification assays. Twenty-four (24) culture isolates were selected from the panel of organisms in Table 10, including 3 organisms that are most closely related to CT. All of the organisms tested produced negative results on the TIGRIS DTS System.

# Interfering Substances Equivalence Study

Whole blood, a substance commonly found in urogenital specimens and known to interfere in some amplification assays, was used to establish that the TIGRIS DTS System tolerates similar levels of potentially interfering substances as does the DTS Systems. Fresh blood was added to clinical swab, vaginal swab, urine, and PreservCyt liquid Pap specimen pools, then tested for potential assay interference in the absence and presence of CT target at the estimated rRNA equivalent of one CT IFU/assay (5 fg/assay). The rRNA equivalents were calculated based on the genome size and estimated DNA:RNA ratio/cell of each organism. Specimens were tested on two TIGRIS DTS Systems. All samples containing target nucleic acid were positive when tested at a level of $10 \%$ blood in swab specimens, vaginal swab specimens, PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens, and $30 \%$ blood in urine specimens. All samples that did not contain target were negative for CT. These results indicate that at the levels tested, whole blood is unlikely to affect the CT result on the TIGRIS DTS System.

# Carryover Studies

To establish that the TIGRIS DTS System minimizes the risk of false positive results arising from carryover contamination, a study was conducted using spiked panels on three TIGRIS DTS Systems. The study used $20 \%$ high-target samples containing $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 6$ fg CT rRNA/mL, which were randomly spaced amongst $80 \%$ negative samples

containing swab transport media. In the study, 576 high-target samples and 2,376 negative samples were tested across the three TIGRIS DTS Systems. Table 14 shows the overall carryover rate was averaged at $0 . 2 1 \%$ (5/2364). A total of 12 negative samples were reported as invalid and were excluded from the calculation. A separate analysis was conducted on a subset of the study population comprised of the negative samples that immediately followed a high-target positive. The carryover rate for this subset of the population was averaged at $0 . 4 7 \%$ (2/424). For false positives in this subset, the carryover rate ranged from $0 \%$ to $1 . 4 3 \%$ across the three TIGRIS DTS Systems. These results demonstrate that carryover contamination is minimized on the TIGRIS DTS System.
