# Device Name

Proprietary Name: AMPLICOR CT/NG test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; Roche Scripts for use on the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Workstation (Roche Scripts Accessory)

Common name: Neisseria gonorrhoeae test system ; software accessory

Classification name: DNA reagents, Neisseria

# Device Description

The AMPLICOR CT/NG test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a qualitative in vitro test for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae DNA in urine from symptomatic or asymptomatic males, in endocervical swab specimens from symptomatic or asymptomatic females, and in urethral swab specimens from sympotmatic males as evidence infection with $N .$ gonorrhoeae. N. gonorrhoeae DNA is detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of target DNA and by hybridization capture of amplified target using the AMPLICOR analyzer.

The Roche Scripts for AMPLICOR CT/NG Test accessory consists of a compact disc (CDs) containing scripts to direct the automated Tecan Genesis RSP 150 workstation to process swab samples or control material for analysis.

# Intended use

The AMPLICOR CT/NG test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a qualitative in vitro test for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae DNA in urine from symptomatic or asymptomatic males, in endocervical swab specimens from symptomatic or asymptomatic females, and in urethral swab specimens from sympotmatic males as evidence infection with N. gonorrhoeae. N. gonorrhoeae DNA is detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of target DNA and by hybridization capture of amplified target using the AMPLICOR analyzer.

The Roche Scripts for AMPLICOR CT/NG Test are intended to provide software scripts to direct the automated Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Workstation to process swab samples or control material for analysis using either of the following $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ -cleared assay test systems:

# Performance evaluation

The Roche Scripts were developed and evaluated according to FDA Guidance documents.

The AMPLICOR CT/NG test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae with Roche Scripts accessory was evaluated for analytical performance characteristics including analytical sensitivity, cross-contamination, precision, and non-clinical specificity. Results were equivalent to those obtained with manual specimen preparation

A clinical evaluation was performed where the results obtained using the AMPLICOR CT/NG test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae with automated specimen preparation using the Roche Scripts to direct the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 workstation were compared to results obtained with the manual specimen preparation method. Results were equivalent to those obtained with manual specimen preparation

Dear Dr. Bush:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
