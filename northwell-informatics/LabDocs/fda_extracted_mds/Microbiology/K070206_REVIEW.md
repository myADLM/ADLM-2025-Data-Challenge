# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A

# L. Test Principle:

The test kit uses viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly labeled with fluorescein for rapid detection and identification of VZV which are directed against two antigenic sites on the VZV recombinant protein, glycoprotein E.

The cell cultures are fixed in acetone. The VZV DFA Reagent is added to the monolayers in cell culture to determine the presence of viral antigens. After incubating, the infected cells are stained with a fluorescein conjugated MAb while uninfected cells and are counterstained with an Evan’s Blue dye. The stained cells are subsequently rinsed, overlaid with a drop of supplied mounting fluid, and the monolayer is protected with a coverslip. Cells are then examined using a fluorescence microscope.

Interpretation of results: A result is considered positive when a cell cytoplasm and/or nucleus presents with a finely granular bright apple-green fluorescence. Uninfected cells will stain dull red due to the Evan’s Blue counter-stain which is included with this device.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Not applicable

d. Detection limit: VZV was diluted to a value of $3 5 7 { \mathrm { - T C I D } } _ { 5 0 }$ and serial 2-fold dilutions were then made to a final value of $\mathrm { 1 - T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ . Each dilution of virus was inoculated into 6 shell vials of H&V Mix or MRC-5 cells, centrifuged at $7 0 0 \mathrm { x g }$ for 60 minutes and incubated at $3 5 { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 48 hours. The Subject Kit or the Predicate Kit was used to stain 3 shell vials of each viral dilution according to the product inserts. The sensitivity of both fluorescent antibody stains is equivalent, with $\sim 1 . 4 \AA$ to $5 . 7 – \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ as the minimum viral dilution detected.

e. Analytical specificity: See results for Cross-reactivity below.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a Method comparison with predicate device: This study included two hundred and fifty-four (254) prospectively collected specimens submitted for VZV culture. Each specimen was evaluated by the ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ DFA VZV Identification Kit and compared to a currently marketed VZV identification kit. A combination of fresh (61) and frozen (193) specimens were tested. The numbers of fresh and frozen specimens tested are summarized below.

3. Clinical studies: A total of (254) prospectively collected specimens were submitted for VZV culture. Three of the fresh specimens from Site 2 were toxic to cell culture and were not evaluated by either test. One specimen from Site 3 was negative in the multi-well plate culture, but was positive in the tube culture 10-days post inoculation. These evaluations were conducted at two external laboratory sites and one in-house laboratory: (1) A reference laboratory in the Southeastern United States; (2) A reference laboratory in the Southwestern United States; and (3) Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc in-house virology laboratory.

iii Study Site 3: A total of 120 specimens were cultured for VZV. Briefly, two hundred microliters $( 2 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { L } )$ of each specimen was inoculated into one well per specimen of a multi-well plate and a single cell culture tube.

The results of this testing are summarized in Table 8a. The inoculated tubes were read for CPE daily for 14-days. Tubes exhibiting CPE were scraped and cell spots made on multiwell slides according to the comparison device’s product insert procedure (the same procedure was used for both the DHI and the comparison devices). Tubes exhibiting no CPE at 14-days were also scraped and cell spots made to confirm the absence of VZV. The cell spots were fixed with acetone in accordance with each respective product insert (DHI and comparison device).

# a. Clinical specificity:

Cross reactivity testing: This device was tested for cross-reactivity against a wide variety of cells and microorganisms compared to the predicate. No crossreactivity was observed for 55 virus strains (cultured and processed for staining) or for 20 host culture cell types. Twenty-seven (27) bacterial cultures and one (1) yeast culture were stained and examined for cross-reactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence while all other bacterial cultures were negative. [See Tables below for cross-reactivity study results.] Stringent conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using a high concentration of this device and relatively high titers of microorganisms. The DFA Reagent was prepared at $1 . 5 \mathrm { X }$ the concentration that is provided in the kit.

Fifty-five (55) virus strains were tested for cross reactivity. Depending on the particular virus, 150 to $2 1 0 0 \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ viruses were inoculated into a shell vial culture and incubated for 24 to 48 hours, to yield a $1 +$ to $3 +$ infection, processed and stained with the 1.5X DFAs according to the procedure detailed in the product insert. No cross reactivity was observed for the viruses listed below.

Twenty-eight microorganisms, including one (1) yeast culture and twenty-seven (27) bacterial cultures, were stained with the 1.5X DFA Reagent according to the procedure as detailed in this product insert, then examined for cross-reactivity. Except for Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the VZV DFA Reagent (see above), all microorganisms tested negative. Concentrations for each bacterial organism cultured by DHI for cross reactivity testing were determined from suspensions of the bacteria in PBS by spectrophotometer according to McFarland standards of 1.0 and 2.0 (equaling approximately $3 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ and $6 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U }$ per mL). Slides were prepared with spots of $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { - m L }$ of the suspensions to give either $3 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ or $6 . 0 \dot { \mathrm { ~ x ~ } } \dot { 1 0 } ^ { 4 }$ per spot. At the same time, $1 { \mathrm { - m L } }$ of each suspension was plated on an appropriate agar dish for colony confirmation. According to the confirmation agar cultures, initial concentrations of the bacterial organisms in the study ranged from $6 . 4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ to $2 . 9 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values: The clinical studies used only specimens collected and cultured for the presence of VZV. Most of the specimen types used in the clinical studies was swabs taken from skin lesions (with two taken as respiratory specimens (NP) and one CSF). This sampling is what is normally expected. Specimens were taken from the following body sites (and presented as # positive/# specimens) are described below.

Demographics by age and gender for the specimens that were tested at the 3 Study Sites are tabulated below.

Of the specimens evaluated in these studies (which had been submitted to the laboratories as swabs taken from lesions for both HSV and VZV testing), a large proportion were from patients between the ages of 18 and 40. Prevalence of VZV within the population tested was quite low (due in part to varicella vaccination programs). The patient demographics are listed below.
