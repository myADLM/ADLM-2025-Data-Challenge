Device Description

The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. $\mathsf { D } ^ { 3 }$ DFA Herpes Simplex Virus Identification and Typing Kit uses two separate blends of HSV Type-1 (HSV-1) and HSV Type-2 (HSV-2) antigen-specific murine MAbs that are directly labeled with fluorescein for the rapid detection and typing of HSV. The reagents can specifically detect and type either HSV1 or HSV-2. The HSV-1 MAbs were developed using HSV-1(f) cell lysate as immunogen - one MAb has been determined to be directed against HSV-1 glycoprotein C1; the antigen to the other is undetermined. The HSV-2 MAbs were developed using a HSV-2 recombinant glycoprotein G as immunogen.

Kit Components:

•HSV-1 DFA Reagent  One dropper bottle containing a blend of two fluorescein labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed against HSV-1 specific glycoproteins. The HSV-1 MAbs were developed using HSV-1(f) cell lysate as immunogen — one MAb has been determined to be directed against HSV-1 glycoprotein C1, the antigen to the other is undetermined. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution contains Evan's Blue as a counter-stain and $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide as preservative.

HSV-2 DFA Reagent  One dropper bottle containing a blend of two fluorescein labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed against HSv-2 specific glycoproteins. The HSV-2 MAbs were developed using a HSV-2 recombinant glycoprotein G immunogen. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution contains Evan's Blue as a counter-stain and $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide as preservative

HSV-1/HSV-2 Antigen Control Slides - Individually packaged control slides containing wells with cell culture derived positive and negative control cells. Each slide consists of four wells containing acetone fixed cells; two wells of noninfected cells and one well each of HSV-1 infected cells and HSV-2 infected cells. Each slide is intended to be stained only one time.

: PBS Concentrate - A 40X concentrate consisting of $4 \%$ sodium azide in phosphate buffered saline (after dilution to 1X in water, the concentration of sodium azide in the solution is $0 . 1 \%$ Mounting Fluid - an aqueous, buffered, stabilized solution of glycerol and $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide.

The cells to be tested, on a slide prepared from a tube culture or on a monolayer of cells cultured in a multi-well plate or a coverslip in a shell vial, are fixed in acetone. The HSV-1 DFA Reagent or HSV-2 DFA Reagent is added to the cells to detect the presence of HSV specific viral antigens. After incubating for 15 to 30 minutes at $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \complement$ , the stained cels are washed with the supplied Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). To prepare the slide for examination, a drop of the supplied Mounting Medium is added to the stained cells and a coverslip is placed on the slide. To prepare the centrifuge enhanced cell cultures for examination, a drop of Mounting Fluid is placed on a clean microscope slide. The coverslip is removed from the shell vial and placed on to the Mounting Fluid.

For multi-well plates, monolayers are fixed with an $80 \%$ aqueous acetone solution. The HSV DFA Reagent is added to the cells to detect the presence of any HSV specific viral antigens. After incubating for 15 to 30 minutes at $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \complement$ , the stained cells are washed with the supplied Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Mounting Fluid is added to each well to cover the monolayers.

The slides or wells are examined using a fluorescence microscope equipped with the correct filter combination for FITC at a magnification of 100-400X. Virus infected cells will be stained with bright apple-green fluorescence while uninfected cells will contain no apple-green fluorescence but will fluoresce red by the Evan's Blue counterstain1 which is included in the HSV DFA Reagent.

If no fluorescent cells are found, report result as, "No herpes simplex virus detected."

If fluorescent cells are found in the HSV-1 DFA Reagent stained monolayer, report result as "Herpes simplex virus type 1 isolated by cell culture". If fluorescent cells are found in the HSV-2 DFA Reagent stained monolayer, report result as "Herpes simplex virus type 2 isolated by cell culture." If fluorescent cells are found in both the HSV-1 and HSV-2 stained wells, the results should be reported as "Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 isolated by cell culture".

Included in the kit are HSV-1/HSV-2 Antigen Control Slides. A Control Slide is intended to function as an indicator that the kit reagents are working properly in the test. [The slides are prepared with wells of HSV-1 infected cells, HSV-2 infected cells, and uninfected cells.] Positive and negative controls must demonstrate appropriate staining characteristics for specimen results to be valid. Controls may also aid in the interpretation of test results.

It is recommended that cell culture positive (infected with known HSV isolate) and negative (uninfected cells) controls be run with each assay to provide a means to ensure adequate performance of the cell culture system used. If control cultures fail to perform correctly, results are considered invalid.

Intended Use

The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. $\mathsf { D } ^ { 3 }$ DFA Herpes Simplex Virus Identification and Typing Kit is intended for use in the qualitative detection and typing of human herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) in cell cultures by immunofluorescence using fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Negative results do not rule out an infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.

Performance using direct specimen testing has not been evaluated.

HSV infections in humans can cause lesions at a variety of sites, e.g., oral-facial,

genital, eye, and cutaneous sites.

When an appropriately sensitive cell line is infected with HSV, a characteristic deterioration of cells, termed cytopathic effect (CPE), can be observed. Tube culture, a classic format for virus amplification, can take several days before CPE is evident. In the case of those specimens with low titers of virus, 7 days of culture may be required sanard culebe  s

The rate of isolation may be enhanced and the time required for HSV identification and typing may be decreased by centrifugation of specimens in shell vials or multi-well plates containing appropriately sensitive cell lines (centrifuge enhanced technique)7.8,9

Even so, CPE may be difficult to interpret due to, for instance, deterioration of cells, which can result from toxic components present in the clinical specimen making microscopic examination of the infected cells problematic. Further, determination of type cannot be done with CPE alone. Because of this, immunofluorescence confirmation of cell culture is regarded as the standard for confirmation of a HSV positive result.

Technological Characteristics

Fundamental technology and intended use of the device are the same as those of the predicate devices, which are based on a standard immunofluorescence assay technique using cells inoculated with patient specimens. They employ directly labeled fluorescein monoclonal antibodies specific for HSV-1 and HSV-2 antigens enabling visualization of the infected cells. A summary is provided in the table below:

# Non-clinical Performance

Staining patterns of the conjugated monoclonal antibodies on HSV-1 and HSV-2 infected cells were similar to those of the predicate devices. Analytical specificity was evaluated by staining cultures infected with a number of ATCC reference HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains and found to react with all of them. The HSV-1 DFA Reagent and HSV-2 DFA Reagent were tested for cross-reactivity against a wide variety of other microorganisms and cells. No cross-reactivity was observed for 59 virus strains (cultured and processed for staining) or for 17 host culture cell types. Twenty-seven (27) bacterial cultures, one yeast and one protozoan culture were stained and examined for cross-reactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence while all other cultures were negative. [Protein A will specifically bind to the Fc portions of conjugated antibodies. Such binding can be distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S. aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small ( $- 1$ micron diameter), bright dots.] [Note: Results from cell cultures with bacterial contamination must, therefore, be interpreted with caution.]Stringent conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using a high concentration of the HSV-1 DFA Reagent or the HSV-2 DFA Reagent and high titers of microorganisms. The DFA Reagents were prepared at 1.5X the concentration that is provided in the kit. Depending on the particular virus, 500 to 715 $\mathsf { T C } | \mathtt { D } _ { 5 0 }$ viruses were inoculated into shell vial or multi-well plate cultures and incubated for 24 to 48 hours to yield a $^ { 1 + }$ to $^ { 3 + }$ infection, processed and stained with the $1 . 5 \times$ DFAs according to the procedure detailed in the product insert. Stained cells were examined at $2 0 0 \times$ magnification. Cell cultures were stained as confluent monolayers. Bacteria and yeast were cultured, processed as suspensions, then spotted on microscope slides (at CFUs ranging from $6 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ to $2 . 9 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ /well in a $1 0 \mu L$ dot, depending on the bacterium), then stained with the $1 . 5 \times$ DFAs according to the procedure in the product insert. Stained slides were examined at $4 0 0 \mathsf X$ magnification. Some microorganisms were procured from an external source as prepared microscope slides, intended to be used as positive controls for assays.

# Clinical Performance

Clinical studies have been conducted at three different laboratories where they compared the Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. $\mathsf { D } ^ { 3 }$ DFA Herpes simplex virus Identification and Typing Kit ( $" \mathsf { D } ^ { 3 }$ DFA HSV ID & Typing Kit") performance to that of currently marketed

HSV identification kits ("Comparison Devices") using four hundred and one (401) prospectively collected specimens submitted for Herpes simplex culture. A combination of fresh (154) and frozen (247) specimens were tested. Three specimens from site 3 were not evaluated due to bacterial contamination of the monolayers, leaving 398 for analysis.

Two study sites used tube cultures and one used multi-well plates. Specimens were processed and cultured according to each laboratory's established procedures and testing performed according to the respective tests' instructions for use. The resulting stained cells were microscopically evaluated and results reported as HSV-1 positive, HSV-2 positive, or negative for detection of HSV.

Positive and Negative Percent Agreement between the Subject and Comparison test results were calculated and reported at $9 5 \%$ confidence interval.
