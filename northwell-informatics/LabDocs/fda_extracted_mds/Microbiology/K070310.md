# Device Description

The B·R:A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® assay is a homogeneous sandwich immunoassay for detection of PCT in human serum or plasma. The B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR® analyzer is a fully automated system. The B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR® analyzer is a closed system and can only operate utilizing special reagents provided by B·R·A·H·M·S Aktiengesellschaft. The measuring principle is based on TimeResolved Amplified Cryptate Emission $( \mathrm { T R A C E } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } )$ technology, which measures the signal that is emitted from an immunocomplex with time delay.

The basis of the $\mathrm { T R A C E } ^ { \circledast }$ technology is a non-radiative energy transfer from a donor [a cage-like structure with a europium ion in the center (cryptate)] to an acceptor (XL 665). The proximity of donor (cryptate) and acceptor (XL 665) in a formed immunocomplex and the spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra on the one hand intensifies the fluorescent signal and on the other hand extends the life span of the acceptor signal, allowing for the measurement of temporally delayed fluorescence.

After the sample to be measured has been excited with a nitrogen laser at $3 3 7 { \mathrm { n m } }$ , the donor (cryptate) emits a long-life fluorescent signal in the milli-second range at 620 nm, while the acceptor (XL 665) generates a short-life signal in the range of nanoseconds at $6 6 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ . When both components are bound in an immunocomplex, both the signal amplification and the prolonged life span of the acceptor signal occur at $6 6 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ , and the life is in the microsecond range. This delayed acceptor signal is proportional to the concentration of the analyte to be measured.

The specific fluorescence which is proportional to the antigen concentration is obtained through a double selection: spectral (separation depending on wave-length) and temporal (time resolved measurement). This enables an exclusive measurement of the signal emitted by the immunological complex and the ratio between the two wave-lengths (665/620) allows a real-time correction of the variations in optic transmission from the medium.

# Intended Use

The B·R·A·H·M.·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is an immunofluorescent assay used to determine the concentration of PCT (procalcitonin) in human serum and plasma. The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is intended for use in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.

# Technological Comparison

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® and the B·R.A·H·M·S PCT LIA have similar indications for use, are quantitative assays, and are used to determine the concentration of PCT in human serum and plasma The devices utilize different technologies and instruments to obtain the results. $\mathrm { T R A C E } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ technology (immunofluorescence) is used with the B·R:A·H·M·S KRYPTOR® analyzer and chemiluminescence is used with a luminometer for B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA. Each device uses 2 antibodies, one of which is the same for both devices. The monoclonal antibody used in both devices binds to Katacalcin. For the second antibody, the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® uses a polyclonal antibody, which is directed against Calcitonin. The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA uses a monoclonal antibody directed against Calcitonin instead of a polyclonal antibody. Although the antibodies directed against Calcitonin come from different origin they bind to the same epitopes. Therefore they will bind to the same PCT molecule.

# Performance Summary

# Precision and Reproducibility

Based on CLSI testing, the analytical sensitivity was determined to be $0 . 0 2 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ and the functional assay sensitivity (FAS) was determined to be $0 . 0 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . In addition, the total precision ranges from $3 . 2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 3 . 4 \mathrm { ~ \% ~ }$ CV and the within run precision ranges from $1 . 0 - 1 3 . 6 \%$ CV.

# High Dose Hook Effect

The B·R·A·H·M-S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® assay is homogenous, and does not require separation or washing steps. It is thus possible to obtain data without interrupting the immunological reaction. High concentration samples $\mathrm { ( > 5 0 ~ n g / m l ) }$ are detected in the first few seconds of incubation and may be diluted by the appropriate dilution factor, then re-assayed automatically. This process allows for sample measurements greater than $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ up to $5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ .

# Interference and Cross Reactivity

Based on CLSI testing, the substances evaluated with the B·R:A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ assay were found not to affect the test performance at concentrations reasonably and consistently found in clinical situations. The substances included the following

• bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglycerides,   
− albumin, substances that share amino acid sequences with procalcitonin, drugs which are typically used for septic patients in intensive care units, and drugs which may be commonly used in subjects at greater risk of developing community acquired pneumonia than the general population, such as in asthma and/or COPD patients.

# Method Comparison Summary

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® and the B·R.A·H·M·S PCT LIA both detect procalcitonin (PCT) in human serum or plasma. A correlation study was performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP9-A, "Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples" between the B·R:A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® assay and the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA assay. There were 184 samples from three (3) sites, which had B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA measurements of $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ (the functional assay sensitivity of B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA) or higher and/or B·R.A·HM·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® measurements of $0 . 0 6 ~ \mathrm { \ n g / m l }$ (the functional assay sensitivity of B·R:A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR®) or higher. Passing-Bablock analysis shows a nearly perfect correlation of the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® assay and B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA assay, as demonstrated in the correlation graph below.

# Interpretation of Results

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is intended to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.

SIRS, Sepsis, Severe Sepsis, and Septic Shock were categorized according to the criteria of the consensus conference of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine.

PCT should always be interpreted in the clinical context of the patient. Therefore, clinicians should use the PCT results in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical signs of the patient.

Data support the following interpretative risk assessment criteria:

$$
\mathbf { P C T } > 2 \mathbf { \ n g / m l }
$$

PCT levels above $2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ on the first day of ICU admission represent a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

$$
\mathbf { P C T } < 0 . 5 \mathbf { \ n g / m l }
$$

PCT levels below $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ on the first day of ICU admission represent a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

Note: PCT levels below $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ do not exclude an infection, because localized infections (without systemic signs) may also be associated with such low levels. If the PCT measurement is done very early after the systemic infection process has started (usually $< 6$ hours), these values may still be low.

As various non-infectious conditions are known to induce PCT as well, PCT levels between $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ and $2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ should be reviewed carefully to take into account the specific clinical background and condition(s) of the individual patient.

# Expected Values

In normal subjects, PCT concentrations are $< 0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { \ n g / m l }$ . In a population of 151 subjects, 146 had a PCT value $< 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ .

# Specimen Collection and Handling

Serum or plasma may be used. B·R·A·H·M·S recommends the use of only one matrix, i.e., use the same material (either serum or plasma [EDTA or heparin]) throughout the patient's clinical course. It is recommended that citrate plasma not be used, since concentrations were underestimated with citrate plasma.

CLSI guidelines should be followed for collecting, transporting, and processing patient samples. The sample volume needed for an assay is $5 0 ~ \mu \updownarrow$ Testing demonstrated that there is no difference between the use of glass and plastic collecting tube types and that filling volume has no impact on the result. In any case, the results of the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® assay should be evaluated in context of all laboratory findings and the total clinical status of the patient. In cases where the laboratory results do not agree with the clinical picture or history, additional tests should be performed.

Samples may be stored up to 5 days at $2 \textrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Samples may be frozen $( - 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and thawed four times.

# Conclusions

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® Test System is substantially equivalent to legally marketed Inflammatory Response Markers.
