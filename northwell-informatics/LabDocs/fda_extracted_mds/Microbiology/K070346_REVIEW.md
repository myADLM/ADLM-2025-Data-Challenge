# J. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# K. Test Principle:

The Dade Behring LabPro AlertEX Software is a rule-based software application within the LabPro Data Management System Software. The AlertEX Software analyzes MicroScan microbial identification (ID) and antimicrobial agent susceptibility tests (AST) or other parameters (e.g. patient ID, institution, source) against a series of rules.

When panels are read on a MicroScan Instrument, entered manually, or when editing stored patient results, the software compares processed test results against rules and conditions.

The LabPro AlertEX Software is provided to the MicroScan customers in a preconfigured condition with rules pre-defined based upon standard microbiology references. These rules are defined in a table which list susceptibility and ID patterns known to be unusual. Through customization the user may inactivate the pre-configured rules, but the user cannot edit the pre-configured rules. Additionally, user-defined rules may be added to the system to provide alert messages for results (e.g. previous isolation of a resistant organism from a particular patient, address specific physicians, locations, specimen sources or biochemical reactions.)

The LabPro AlertEX will add the capability to change organism ID, and/or generate AST interpretations based on defined parameters utilizing standard microbiology references. The preconfigured alert rules with ID and AST actions are inactive upon installation and must be activated by the user through customization.
