# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

Meticillnsn tyl uri ual nd infections which have been associated with significantly higher rates of mortality and morbidity. The Bio-Rad MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic culture medium for the qualitative detection of MRSA from anterior nares specimens.

# INTENDED USE:

MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the qualitative detection of nasal colonizatio methicillin reistant Staphylococcu ureus MRA) taid in the prevent a contol  iecons nheale ttThe t can  pe n specimens from patients and healthcare workers to screen for MRSA colonization. MRSASelect is not intended to diagnose MRSA infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of infection.

# SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY:

MRSASelect is a selective medium for the detection and direct identification of MRSA. The selciviy  this med  base on the presene  n anibioic/antifugal mixture n optimized salt concentration and that inhibits the growth of yeast and the majority of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria with the exception of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Identification is based on the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate by a specific enzymatic activity of Staphylococcus aureus leading to a strong pink coloration of the Staphylococus aureus colonies.

At 24 hours incubation time methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus produce small pink colonies on MRSASelect. Coagulase negative methicillin-resistant staphylococci that do not metabolize the chromogenic substrate appear as colorless or white colonies (possibly light pink). Methicillin sensitive staphylococci (MSS) are inhibited.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

Performance of MRSASelect was evaluated at three geographically diverse hospitals with fresh surveilance specimens of the anterior nares samples. A total of 3013 nares samples were evaluated. MRSASelect was compared to routine culture which was defined as isolation on Staphylococci on Trypticase Soy Agar with 5% blood, with identification confirmed by Coagulase and Oxacillin susceptibility and BD BBLTM CHROMagarTM MRSA. Culture results and MRSASelect results were reported at 24 hours, BD ChromAgar was read at 48 hours in accordance with manufacturers instructions. Product performance is summarized below:

# Interference Study

Commonly used medicinal substances and commonly used transport devices were evaluated for potential interference of the chromogenic reaction of the MRSASelect medium. No interference was noted. Commonly used nasal sprays at concentrations may inhibit growth that is unrelated to medium performance.

# STATEMENT OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY:

MRSASelect was tested and compared to routine culture, identification and susceptibility methods, and BD CHROMagar. MRSASelect, when testing 3013 surveillance samples, demonstrated, at 24 incubation, 98% agreement to routine culture, identification and susceptibility and 99% as compared to CHROMagar.

Bio-Rad confirms that any/all data provided in this submission may be released upon request.
