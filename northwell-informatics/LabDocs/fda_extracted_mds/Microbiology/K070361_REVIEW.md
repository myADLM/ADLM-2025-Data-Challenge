# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI M100-S17 Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; CLSI M29-A2 Protection of Laboratory Workers from Occupational Acquired Infections; CLSI M40-A Quality Control of Microbiological Transport Systems; Approved Standard

# L. Test Principle:

MRSASelect is a selective medium for the detection and direct identification of MRSA. The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antibiotic/antifungal mixture and an organized salt concentration that inhibits the growth of yeast and the majority of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria with the exception of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Identification is based on the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate by a specific enzymatic activity of Staphylococcus aureus, leading to a strong pink coloration of the Staphylococcus aureus colonies.

Within 18-24 hours incubation time:

• Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus produce small pink colonies on MRSASelect.   
• Coagulase negative methicillin-resistant staphylococci do not metabolize the chromogenic substrate and appear as colorless or white colonies (possibly light pink).   
• Methicillin sensitive staphylococci (MSS) are inhibited

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility study was done at four sites. Testing was done at three sites in triplicates for three days with three lots. Duplicates were performed for three days with three lots at the fourth site. MRSA, MSSA and S. epidermidis were used. Reproducibility was $59 5 \%$ .

An additional 35 strains of bacteria and yeast were tested on three lots. No lot to lot variation was observed.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):   
Negative Control S. aureus ATCC 25923 at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 4 } - 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ CFU/plate.   
Positive Control S. aureus ATCC 43300 at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 3 } - 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / \Omega }$ plate.

There were a total of $5 6 \mathrm { Q C }$ results from the three sites tested on more than three lots. The testing followed the recommendations of the QC strains listed in the package insert and there were no product failures.

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

To confirm the level of detection of MRSASelect, 31 strains of MRSA were plated on the media with a dilution at $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U }$ of a 0.5 MacFarland bacterial suspension. All strains grew on MRSASelect as small pink colonies after 24 hours incubation time.

To demonstrate the ability of MRSASelect to suppress the growth of organisms other than MRSA, 30 strains of methicillin sensitive

Staphylococcus aureus, and 20 strains of coagulase negative methicillin sensitive Staphylococci were tested by plating a 0.5 MacFarland bacterial suspension on the medium. Pink colonies were not observed on MRSASelect after 24-hour incubation time.

# Interference Study

Two commonly used nasal sprays were evaluated for the potential interference on the performance of the MRSASelect. Three MRSA, two MSSA, two methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staph and others ( $K .$ . pneumoniae and C. albicans) were tested on phenylephrine hydrochloride $( 1 \% )$ and oxymetazoline hydrochloride $( 0 . 0 5 \% )$ . Bacterial growth was inhibited on the MRSASelect and the nonselective blood agar control medium. A limitation has been added to the package insert.

Four MRSA, three MSSA and one BORSA were used to test the interference effect of human blood, mucus and mucin (hog gastric) on MRSASelect. No significant interference was observed.

Four commonly used transport media were tested on the growth of MRSA on MRSASelect. There were no shifts of the bacterial count on either MRSASelect or TSA with $5 \%$ blood. The transport media did not impact the viability of MRSA.

# Cross Reactivity Study

A Cross reactivity study was performed using 91 Coagulase negative staphylococci and 30 other organisms (Gram negative rods, Strep pyogenes, N. meningitides, N. gonorrhoeae and Enterococci). Of the Coagulase negative staphylococci, there were thirteen S. epidermidis with a false negative rate of $1 4 . 3 \%$ and one S. capitis that provided weakly pinkish colonies. A limitation has been included in the package insert that $S .$ . epidermidis may develop a faint pink coloration. Of the gram negative organisms, there were seven strains that showed pinkish coloration. The reaction was reduced with the reduction of the inoculum size (from $1 0 ^ { 8 }$ CFU to $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U }$ ). A limitation has been added to caution the user of the potential color that might be observed with selected Gram negative rods.

$f .$ Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The MRSASelect™ culture media was evaluated at two clinical sites which included testing of 1772 anterior nares specimens. The recovery of MRSA on MRSASelect was compared to routine culture, which was defined as isolation of staphylococci on Trypticase Soy Agar with $5 \%$ blood, with identification confirmed by coagulase and oxacillin susceptibility. An additional 1241 samples were tested at a third site against a chromogenic medium, CHROMagar.

The optimum incubation time for MRSASelect™ culture media is 24 hours. At 24 hours, the culture media is visually inspected for small pink colonies which are considered as MRSA. Non-MRSA organisms appear as white or colorless colonies.

Percent agreement of MRSASelect™ for each method when compared to culture and another chromogenic media is presented in the table below.

Direct versus Indirect Inoculation

A total of 91 samples were analyzed to demonstrate that the direct and indirect inoculation procedures are equivalent. The percent agreement was $9 8 \%$ .

# Retrospective Study

A retrospective study was evaluated at one site with 99 MRSA positive nasal swabs. At 24 hours, there were six that did not grow on the MRSASelec $t ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ . The no growth rate for MRSA at 24 hrs was $6 . 0 \%$ (6/99). The percent of agreement was $94 \%$ (93/99) when comparing with the routine culture, and $9 6 \%$ (91/95) with a commercial chromogenic medium.
