BBL™ CHROMaGar™ 0157

Differential Culture Medium

21 CFR $\ S$ 866.2360 Class I

BBL ™ MacConkey II Agar with Sorbitol (K871855)

# INTENDED USE:

BBL ™ CHROMagar™ O157 is a selective medium for the isolation, differentiation and presumptive identification of Escherichia coli O157:H7 from clinical human stool specimens.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

BBL ™ CHROMagar™ O157 formulation incorporates chromogenic substrates, which allow colonies of E. coli O157:H7 to produce a mauve color for presumptive identification from the primary isolation plate and differentiation from other organisms.Specially selected Difco™ peptones are incorporated to supply nintsTheaditin potassim telurcefixiean cefsulodin reucshe numberbactee than E. coli O157:H7 that grow on this medium. The chromogen mix consists of artificial substrates (chromogens), which release an insoluble colored compound when hydrolyzed by a specific enzyme. E. coli 0157:H7 utilizes one of the chromogenic substrates producing mauve colonies.The growth of mauve colonies is considered presumptive for E. coli O157:H7 on BBL ™ CHROMagar™ O157. Non-E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria may utilize other chromogenic substrates resulting in blue toblue-green colored colonies o none of the chromogenic substrates are utilize, colonies may appear s their natural color.The visually distinct colored colonies facilitate the detection and differentiation of E. coli O157:H7 from other organisms.

# DEVICE COMPARISON:

The BBL ™ CHROMagar™ O157 medium differs from the BBL ™ MacConkey II Agar with Sorbitol medium in the following ways:

BBL CHROMagar O157 utilizes a chromogenic mix to differentiate E. coli O157:H7 from other E. coli and fecal organisms, whereas BBL MacConkey I Agar with Sorbitol utilizes sorbitol and neutral red indicator to differentiate E. coli O157:H7 from other E. coli strains. BBL CHROMagar O157 utilizes tellurite, cefixime and cefsulodin as selective agents to reduce and/or inhibit bacterial growth other than E. coli O157:H7, whereas BBL MacConkey II Agar with Sorbitol utilizes bile salts and crystal violet as selective agents to reduce and/or inhibit bacterial growth. BBL CHROMagar O157 presumptively identifies E. coli O157:H7 by its ability to hydrolyze a specific substrate that produces a mauve color, whereas BBL MacConkey Il Agar with Sorbitol presumptively identifies E. coli O157:H7 by its inability to ferment sorbitol thereby producing a colorless colony.

Although there are some differences between the BBL ™ CHROMagar™ O157 device and its predicate device (BBL MacConkey I Agar with Sorbitol), these differences do not present new issues of safety and effectiveness.The impact of these differences on the safey and effectiveness of the BBLCHROMagar 0157 device can be assessed by using accepted scientific methods.Comparative performance data are presented in this submission.

The following table shows the comparison of device characteristics of BBL CHROMagar O157 to BBL MacConkey II Agar with Sorbitol.

# SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE DATA:

# ANALYTICAL STUDIES:

# Internal Studies:

An internal evaluation of BBL ™ CHROMagar™ O157 was performed in the Research & Development Laboratory of BD Diagnostic Systems.Testing included 1) a study comparing the performance of BBL™ CHROMagar™ O157 to two commercially available, selective and differential media used for the presumptive identification for E. coli O157:H7 [BBL ™ MacConkey I Agar with Sorbitol (SMAC) and BBL ™ Sorbitol MacConkey I Agar with Cefixime and Tellurite (SMAC-CT)], 2) a Limit of Detection study, and 3) a verfication study of product performance usig a latex agglutination testThese tests demonstrate that BBL CHROMagar O157 performs as well as the predicate device, SMAC and another commercially available medium (SMAC-CT) in presumptively identifying E. coli O157:H7.

Additional analytical studies were conducted with BBL CHROMagar O157 to demonstrate the performance men aervblcith tetc crs etiviy stuy fifty-nine (59) non-E. coli O157:H7 organisms including various species from the following Geneses: Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Campylobacter and Plesiomonas, and 2) an interference study using fourteen (14) substances that may be present in stool or rectal specimens. These substances included lubricants, water, soap, laxatives, suppositories and various hemorhoidal treatments.

The results for the cross reactivity study indicated that only one of the 59 organisms, Salmonella serotype Heidelberg, exhibited mauve colonies when plated on BBL. CHROMagar O157. The results of the interference study showed that none of the substances tested interfered with the performance of the BBL CHROMagar 0157 medium.

# External Studies:

Aclinical study was conducted at an extemal centralized egional clinical laboratory that rountinely tests for E. coli O157:H7 in stool specimens.Stoll specimens were inoculated onto Sorital-MacConkey (SMAC) and BBL CHROMagar O157 media and incubated aerobically for 18-24 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ Each Plate was read by an independent technologist and confirmatory testing (indole and serotyping) was conducted on all suspected colony samples. A total of 3,136 stool specimens were cultured, of which 2,855 specimens provided acceptable results for this study while 281 specimens were determined to be noncompliant to the required testing matrix. The following table shows the breakdown of the results from this study:
