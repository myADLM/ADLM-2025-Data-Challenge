# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

BBL ™ CHROMagar $\mathbf { T M } 0 1 5 7$ formulation incorporates chromogenic substrates, which allow colonies of $E$ . coli 0157:H7 to produce a mauve color for presumptive identification from the primary isolation plate and differentiation from other organism. Specially selected Difco ™ peptones are incorporated to supply nutrients. Potassium tellurite, cefixime and cefsulodin act as selective agents which reduce the number of bacteria other than $E .$ . coli 0157:H7 that grow on this medium. The chromogenic mix consists of artificial substrates (chromogens), which release an insoluble colored compound when hydrolyzed by a specific enzyme. E. coli O157:H7 utilizes one of the chromogenic substrates which produce mauve colored colonies. The growth of mauve colored colonies is considered presumptive identification for E. coli O157:H7 on BBL ™ CHROMagar™ O157. Non- $E$ . coli O157:H7 bacteria may utilize other chromogenic substrates resulting in blue to bluegreen colored colonies or, if none of the chromogenic substrates are utilized, colonies may appear as a natural color.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility studies were conducted in triplicates at 3 sites, 2 external and 1 internal, using expected Escherichia coli O157:H7 QC isolates and a variety of Non-Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolates (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli H7 (Non O157), Shigella sonnei, and additional Escherichia coli). The intra-site and inter-site reproducibility for BBL CHROMagar O157 was $\ge 9 5 \%$ .

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Quality Control (QC) data was compiled across all three sites and all batches of BBL CHROMagar Escherichia coli O157:H7. The testing followed the recommendations of the QC strains listed in the package insert. This included the Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC ™ 700728 as positive growth: light mauve to mauve colonies, Escherichia coli ATCC ™ 25922: growth inhibition (partial to complete), and Enterobacter cloacae ATCC ™ 13047 as growth: blue-green to blue colonies. All individual QC batches passed the acceptance criteria.

d. Detection limit:

Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity:

A total of 59 organisms, representing several genera of stool pathogens and 5 E. coli 157:H7 were included in a cross reactivity testing. The stool pathogens included Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp., Plesiomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., Vibrio spp., and $E$ . coli nonO157:H7. The identification of the microorganisms was blinded from the sites. The sites tested the organisms in three different lots and interpreted the results. The $E .$ . coli O157:H7 strains grew mauve colonies 15/15 times $( 1 0 0 \% )$ . The non- $E$ . coli O157:H7 strains showed non-mauve colonies 58/59 times per each lot for a total of 174/177 times $( 9 8 . 3 \% )$ . Campylobacter fetus, BD645, which was frozen, did not grow on the original subculture media; therefore, this isolate was removed from the testing procedure. Additionally, one Salmonella spp. strain (S. Heidelberg) produced mauve colonies

resembling $E$ . coli 0157:H7. Therefore, a limitation statement indicating the possibility of false positive results with this particular strain was added to the package insert.

# Interference Study

An interference study was independently conducted in replicates five times using a variety of substances that may be present in stool or rectal specimens. Among the substances used were blood, water, K-Y Jelly, Vaseline, Hydrocortisone ointment, tucks pad, soap, Metamucil, Milk of Magnesia, Senna, Fleet Glycerin Suppository, and Dulcolax Suppository. The results showed that E. coli O157 grew on CHROMagar media within the claimed range of time in the presence of all of these substances.

f. Assay cut-off:

Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Two external studies and one internal study were conducted on BBL™ CHROMagar O157.

i. A user-based retrospective study: A collection of 3136 stool specimens were cultured, of which 2855 specimens provided acceptable results for this study. BBL CHROMagar O157:H7 were compared to SMAC media. Final results of the isolate identification were determined by additionally testing (biochemical, serology, or ID system) as recommended in the Package insert. Results produced a positive percent agreement of Escherichia coli O157:H7 of $8 6 . 4 \%$ (19/22) and a negative percent agreement of NonEscherichia coli O157:H7 of $9 9 . 8 \%$ (2828/2833). However, for 281 isolates the sponsor reported “Not Available (NA)” data because a confirmation protocol was not followed as stated in the package insert.

ii. BBL ™ CHROMagar™ O157 Field Trial in a regional hospital.

A collection of 110 frozen fecal isolates, 6 archived, frozen stools, and 10 fresh stool specimens were compared to SMAC, SMAC-CT and TSA II. Among the frozen and archived fecal isolates, 56 were Shiga toxin positive $E .$ . coli O157:H7 and the additional 60 were comprised of Shiga Toxinpositive $E$ . coli Non-O157 (8), Shiga toxin-Negative $E .$ . coli (15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella spp. (10), Enterobacter spp. (10), Serratia spp. (4), and Proteus spp. (8). Results produced a positive percent agreement of $9 8 \%$ (55/56) E. coli O157:H7 on CHROMagar O157:H7 and a negative percent agreement of $100 \%$ (60/60) for the non- $E$ . coli O157:H7 strains. Additionally, CHROMagar O157 test results demonstrated that 1/10 fresh stools were positive for $E$ . coli O157:H7 and the remaining 9/10 were negative for $E$ . coli O157:H7. These latter results were confirmed using biochemical tests, latex agglutination, and Premier EHEC.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

As described in the package insert, interpretation of plate results must be completed within 18-24 hours after inoculation of the BBL CHROMagar O157:H7 plate. A separate time detection study measuring growth in 18-24 hours range of time was independently conducted. All organisms grew within the expected range of time.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Not Applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:
