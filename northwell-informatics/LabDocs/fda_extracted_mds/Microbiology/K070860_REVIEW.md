# I. Device Description:

Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control well which contains test medium without antibiotic. Antibiotics are diluted in water, buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in $0 . 4 \%$ saline with Pluronic $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (a wetting agent), then $0 . 1 \mathrm { m l }$ transferred to $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of inoculum Synergies plus Pos Broth with Pluronic $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ) for a final inoculum concentration of $3 – 7 \mathrm { X } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ . Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System and read periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC. Alternately the panels may be incubated at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a non- $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ for 16-24 hours and read by visual observation of growth.

# L. Test Principle:

The WalkAway $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16/18 hours (overnight instrument readings, manual readings), or 24 hours depending on the growth rate of the organism being tested. No reading below 16 hours of incubation is reported. The time of final read is dependent on the user preference, the growth rate of the organism, and the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ cells/ml are not detected.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Reproducibility was demonstrated using 360 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3 separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ SI read at ${ < } 1 6$ hours, WalkAway $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 16-18 hour readings and manual readings at 16-20 hours incubation. The Reproducibility total for the Rapid read method equaled 330 isolates The WalkAway $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ SI had 30 results that were not readable at ${ < } 1 6$ hours. All results were $59 5 \%$ reproducible for the Long Dilution and the 5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence for all read methods. Performance claims are based on the Rapid read method.

There was a trend for the Rapid read method to produce slightly more susceptible results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results on all testing days with the reference method. Quality control results demonstrated the ability of the different reading parameters (manual and instrument) to produce acceptable results $59 5 \%$ of the time. The following tables provide the frequency of the results in each concentration with the expected range stated.

There is a slight trend for the ${ < } 1 6$ hour Long Dilution Sequence Rapid read method to produce QC results that were more susceptible than the reference result, if only by one dilution, for both the S. aureus ATCC 29213 and the $E .$ . faecalis ATCC 29212. This trend was not observed for the five Breakpoint Dilution Sequence QC results.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Clinical testing was conducted at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented with stock isolates. A total of 304 gram-positive isolates were tested of which 268 were fresh isolates and 36 were stock isolates. Fourteen (14) Clinical isolates for the Long Dilution and the Breakpoint Dilution Sequences were reported at ${ \ge } 1 6$ hours and were not included as Rapid read results. There were 75 challenge isolates tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel. Fourteen (14) Challenge isolates for the Long Dilution and the Breakpoint Dilution Sequences were reported at ${ \ge } 1 6$ hours and were not included as Rapid read results.

The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of incubation for $> 9 5 \%$ of the results. An additional comparison was done with readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually when incubated 16 - 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods was also acceptable with no apparent differences or trends.

The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of the use of a small amount $( 0 . 1 \% )$ Pluronic $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of Pluronic $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ in the frozen reference panels was conducted. Similar calculations for the different reading methods were performed with very little difference. QC was also performed. There was a slight trend for the Rapid read method to produce more susceptible QC results than the reference method results, if only by one dilution. This trend was also observed in the Reproducibility studies.

The chart below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods (Synergies plus™ readings at ${ < } 1 6$ hours, overnight on the WalkAway $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and manually read at 18 hours using the TouchScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ -SR) when compared to the reference method.

maj-major discrepancies vmj-very major discrepancies min- minor discrepancies

NA – Essential Agreement result are not applicable for Breakpoint format

Essential agreement (EA) is when the MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Synergies plus panel agrees with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Synergies plus panel interpretation (S-I-R) agrees exactly with the reference panel interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within the test range and on scale.

Of the 75 Challenge isolates tested, the expected results for 41 strains were Susceptible and 34 strains were Resistant. One very major error (1/7, $1 4 . 3 \% )$ occurred in the Challenge Set data. The vmj error was generated by one $S .$ . epidermidis (methicillin-resistant) by the Overnight Instrument and the Overnight Manual read methods in both the Long Dilution and the 5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence data, but a vmj error was not detected by the Rapid read method, because the read time was ${ > } 1 6$ hours. Although the expected result for this isolate was resistant, the reference result on the day of testing was susceptible and was in agreement with the Overnight Instrument and the Overnight Manual read methods results. The overall combined EA and the CA for the Challenge Set Data was $5 9 5 \%$ for all read methods and dilution combinations. There was one (1) major error $( 6 . 7 \%$ , 1/15) produced by one S. aureus (methicillin-sensitive) generated by the Rapid read method only. The overall maj error rate of $2 . 9 \%$ (1/34) for the Challenge Set Data for all read methods was in the acceptable range. Therefore, the Challenge Set performance data are acceptable.

Performance claims (in bold) that will appear in the labeling and the procedural manual are based on the clinical Rapid read $( < 1 6$ hour) method results only. The table above displays the Clinical data results compared by reading method.

The Clinical data Rapid read method EA of $9 8 . 3 \%$ and the CA of $9 9 . 3 \%$ are both very good. Overnight Instrument and Manual read methods EA and CA are both very similar to the Rapid read method results for the Long Dilution and the 5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence data results.

There were no vmj errors generated by any of the read methods. There was 1 maj error $( 1 / 2 1 3 , 0 . 5 \% )$ produced by the Overnight Instrument and the Overnight Manual read methods. This maj error was not observed in the Rapid read method results because the time-to-results was ${ > } 1 6$ hours. Because of the number of off-scale results in the Clinical data results, no real trending was observed.

The overall error rates are within acceptable limits for all reading methods. The performance data are acceptable for both the Long Dilution and for the 5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence results using the Rapid read ${ < } 1 6$ hour) method.
