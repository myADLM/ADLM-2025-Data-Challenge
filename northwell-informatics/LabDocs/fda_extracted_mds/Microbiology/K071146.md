D. Device Description The VIDAS BRAHMS PCT Assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) performed in an automated VIDAS instrument.

The assay principle combines a one-step immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR), serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips.

All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells containing anti-procalcitonin antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. This operation enables the antigen to bind with the immunoglobulins fixed to the interior wall of the SPR and the conjugate to form a sandwich. Unbound compounds are eliminated during washing steps.

Two detection steps are performed successively. During each step, the substrate (4-Methylumbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antigen present in the sample.

At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to two calibration curves corresponding to the two revelation steps and stored in memory, and then printed out.

# E. Intended Use

VIDAS BRAHMS PCT is an automated test for use on the VIDAS instruments for the determination of human procalcitonin in human serum or plasma (lithium heparin) using the ELFA (Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay). VIDAS BRAHMS PCT is intended for use in conjunction with othe laboratory findings and clinical assessments to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission, for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.
