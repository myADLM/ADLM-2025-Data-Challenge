CLASSIFICATION NAME: Antigen, CF (including CF control), influenza virus A, B, C

REGULATION: 866.3330

# INTENDED USES:

The TRU FLU is a rapid, qualitative, lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay for detecting both influenza A and influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens in human nasal wash, nasopharyngeal aspirate and nasal and nasopharyngeal swab samples from symptomatic patients. The test is not intendedf or the detection of influenza C viruses A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other clinical management decisions.

TRU FLU is a modification of, and is intended to detect the same analytes as, ImmunoCard STAT! Flu A&B PLUS (K041626), Meridian Bioscience, Inc.   
Binax NOW Influenza A&B, Inverness Medical (K062109)

# BACKGROUND:

Influenza is a highly contagious, epidemic to pandemic acute viral respiratory disease caused by several genera of the Orthomyxoviridae family.Influenza virus A and Influenza virus B are the two genera most commonly associated with disease in humans.Influenza infection rates tend to be highest in pediatric populations, while serious complications from influenza disease are more common in the elderly.Clinical signs and symptoms begin after a 1-4 day incubation period and include cough, fever, myalgia and malaise.The clinical presentation of influenza can range from asymptomatic infection to fatal pneumonia.Influenza co-circulates with other respiratory pathogens; hence it is important to differentiate influenza from other respiratory diseases. Antiviral drugs in general have shown more significant clinical benefit when administered within 48 hours of the appearance of symptoms, which oviates the need for he apid detection of influenzaNot all antiviral drugs areeffective against both influenza A and influenza B; therefore it is important to distinguish between the two.

Influenza A and B can be detected in human respiratory samples by a variety of methods including tissue culture, immunofluorescent assay and enzyme immunoassay.Tissue culture isolation remains the gold standard for the detection of influenza, yet the procedure can take 7 days to complete immunofluorescent antibody-based tests are moderately sensitive, yet highly dependent on specimen quality and preparation. The rapid detection of influenza using enzyme and microparticle-based immunoassays has become an important aspect of patient management in patients of all ages with erespaoy ia ue toinflunzThe resultosuch tst eusto spor data availe from the patient's clinical evaluation and assist the physician in determining the course of action.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND TECHNOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES

# Reagents

TRU FLU is distributed as a test kit that includes the following reagents:

1. Test Strip: A test strip attached to a plastic frame or holder enclosed in a foil pouch with desiccant. The test strip carries monoclonal anti-influenza A and influenza B capture antibodies\* for the test. The holder is used to stopper the Conjugate Tube.The paddle portion of the holder indicates where test and control lines should appear.   
2. Conjugate Tube: A capped plastic tube containing a conjugate bead. The tube is enclosed in a foil pouch. The conjugate consists of gold-conjugated anti-influenza A and anti-influenza B which serve as the detector antibodies.   
3. Sample Diluent/Negative Control:A buffered protein solution provided in a plastic vial.Sodium azide $( 0 . 0 9 4 \% )$ added as a preservative. Use as supplied.   
4. Plastic transfer pipettes with 50, 100, 200 and 300 µL volume marks.

# Equipment needed to use the device

There is no equipment needed to use this device.

# Interfering substances

Nhole blood, at concentrations greater than $0 . 5 \%$ may interfere with the interpretation of test results.

# Calibrators

There are no calibrators used with this device.

# Controls

The assay includes an internal procedural control line that is used to determine if the test has been performed correctly, proper flow has occurred and that reagents were reactive at the time of use.A clean backgroun aroun the test and control lines also serves as a procedural control.Control or test ls that are obscured by a heavy background color may invalidate the test and may be an indication of reagent deterioration, use of inappropriate sample or improper test performance.

Positive Control Reagent is supplied separately. It is used in parallel with Sample Diluent/Negative Control as external controls. These reagents also serve as indicators that the test was performed correcy, that the capture and detector antiodies were active at he time of use, and that the memrane supports proper sample flow.

Failure of the internal and external control to produce the expected results suggests the test was not performed correctly ie, incorrect volume of reagents added; incorrect incubation temperature ortimes used or that reagents were not brought to room temperature prior to testing).

# Technological principles

TRU FLU is a single use immunoassay that consists of a Conjugate Tube, a Test Strip, and Sample Diluent.The Conjugate Tube contains a lyophilized bead of colloidal gold-linked monoclonal antibodies toinfluenza A and influenza B (detector antibodies). The Test Strip carries a nitrocellulose membrane wit dri capture antodies at separate ines o influenzaAand infuenza BThe Test Stripholde the Conjugate Tube during testing and subsequent disposal to reduce exposure to potential pathogens.

The conjugate bead is rst rehydrated in the onjugate Tube with Sample Diluent, prior to the additin patient specimen.The contents are mixed before the Test Strip is added.As the test is incubated at 20- 2C, influenza A or influenza Bantigens, i present in the diluted sample, bind to the corresponding monoclonal antibody-colloidal gold conjugate as the sample moves up the Test Strip. The influenza A capure monoclonal antibody is bound to theTest Strip at the test-FLU A position of the device.When it bnthe antigen-nfluenza Aantibody-coloidal gold complex, it yields a visible pink-ed ne.Silarly, the influenza B capture monoclonal antibody bound to the assay membrane at the test-FLU B positon will result in a pink-red ne when it captures antigen-influenza B antibody-colloidal gold complexes. When o antigen is present, no complexes are formed and no pink-red line will appear at either the test FLU A or the test FLU B position of the Test Strip.An internal control line helps determine whether adequate flow hasocu through heTest Strip uringa test ru visible pink-ed ne at theControl position Tes Strip should be present each time a specimenorcontrol is tested. I no pink-ed control ne is sen, the test is considered invalid.

# PERFORMANCE EVALUATION - CLINICAL/FIELD TRIALS

# Study Objective

A clinicalfield study was conducted to demonstrate that TRU FLU was substantially equivalent in performance to the standard reference method  tissue culture — and to the predicate device Binax NOW Influenza A&B (K062109) in a clinical laboratory setting using samples submitted for influenza testing.

# Investigation Plan

The test plan was designed to evaluate the performance of prospectively collected fresh and frozen samples from the 2006-7 season. Nine independent laboratories (in different geographic regions of the US) and the manufacturer participated in the study. Patient specimens, de-linked from identification inoatin, were userial sits were nstructed ttest saples i parallel by issue culture star reference), TRU FLU and the predicate device, NOW Influenza A&B.Tissue culture (reference method) was performed by the site using the site's method.

# Sample population and selection

The sample population used in this study included respiratory samples from patients of any age provided the samples had been submitted for influenza testing. Such samples were assumed to be from symptomatic patients. The sample types included nasal wash, nasopharyngeal aspirate and nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs.

# Influence of other disease states

Thah uavczueh influenza A or B virus.

# Patient exclusion criteria

Samples from asymptomatic patients were excluded from the trials.There were no exclusions based on patient age gender or other therapies.

# Clinical trial test system

Clinical trial sites mployed full production lotsf TRU FLU test kits that were labeled or investigatal use only. TRU FLU, the predicate device and record sheets were shipped to test sites throughout the study.Unused portions of the assays were returned to Meridian at the completion of the study. When not in use, test kits were stored according to the instructions in the provisional IFU.

Patient samples were prepared according the package inserts that accompanied the test and predicate device. Viral cultures were performed by each laboratory's established internal method.Three of the nine independent laboratories completed reproducibility studies prior to testing patient samples. Repucibilitystudies are escribe later nhis ectinClinical data was analyzedusigishe'ec method and is presented in $2 \times 2$ tables.

# Clinical study data

A total of 6 prospectively collected fresh and 63 frozen samples were tested.Tissue culture tests were performed on all frozen samples at the time of their collection. As shown in Table 3, $52 \%$ (366/697) of fresh samples were wash/aspirate samples and $46 \%$ (320/697) were swab samples. Sample type was not identified for the remaining $2 \%$ (11/697). All frozen samples were wash/asp. Table 4 identifies the age groups of the patients from whom fresh samples were collected during the study. $2 7 \%$ (185/697) of the fresh samples were from patients 22 years of age or older, $64 \%$ (447/697) from patients 12 years of age or less, and $8 \%$ (59/697) from children 13 years to 21 years of age. The age of patients submitting 6 samples was not recorded. Of the 63 frozen samples only, the majority (33/63 or $52 \%$ ) were collected from patients aged 2 months to 2 years. The patient ages for the remaining frozen samples were $1 4 \%$ (9/63) for patients aged 1 month or less, $2 2 \%$ (14/63) patients aged 3-12 years, and $1 1 \%$ (7/63) patients age -1 years.Tables 5a- categorize patients by gender.Fifty three percent (367/697) of thefresh samples and $5 1 \%$ (32/63) frozen samples were from male patients, while $4 7 \%$ (325/697) fresh and $4 9 \%$ (31/63) frozen samples were from females. The gender of patients submitting 5 samples was not recorded. Neither patient age nor gender affected assay performance. The $_ 2 \times 2$ tables that summarize test results for each site are given in Table Table 7 stratifies the data by patient age.

Of the 697 prospective samples tested, 1produced invalid results in tissue culture and was excluded from the calculations for either sensitivity or specificity (see Tables 6 and 7).

# INDICATIONS FOR USE STATEMENT TRU FLU

510(K) Number: K071657

TRU FLU is a rapid, qualitative, lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay for detecting both influenza A and influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens in human nasal wash, nasopharyngeal aspirate and nasal and nasopharyngeal swab samples in symptomatic patients. This test is not intended for the detection of influenza C viruses. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other clinical management decisions.
