# a. Summary and Explanation

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are an important cause of epidemic and endemic diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The most commonly reported serotype associated with outbreaks in the United States has been O157:H7. However, as many as 50 other serotypes of E. coli have also been shown to produce Shiga toxins and have been reported to be associated with outbreaks and sporadic disease both within and outside the United States'. Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases of STEC diseases, these pathogens are now considered major public health problems of worldwide importance. STEC strains share the potential to produce a variety of virulence factors, including two Shiga toxins (Stx 1 and Stx 2). Human STEC strains can produce Stx 1 or Stx 2 alone or in combination².

The ability to control the spread of outbreaks associated with STEC depends upon the rapid detection of these pathogens. Laboratory diagnosis of diarrhea has been recommended as it may alert public health officials to a common source of illness in a community. For the affected patient, laboratory confirmation of STEC may preclude costly additional tests, allow earlier implementation of supportive treatment in impending HUS, and, while controversial, exclude administration of potentially harmful antimicrobial agents³. The method used in most clinical microbiology laboratories is based on sorbitol MacConkey agar culture (SMAC), coupled with specific detection of the O157 antigen. This approach neglects other STEC serotypes and also other Shiga toxin-producing bacteria². The cytotoxin assay described by Karmali is used to screen stool samples for evidence of STEC infections. However, this test is slow, labor-intensive, difficult to standardize, and it requires cell culture facilities, making it impractical for routine diagnostic laboratories4.

b. Principle of the Test

The OIA SHIGATOX test involves the qualitative detection of Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (Stx1 and Stx 2) produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli and other organisms. The Optical ImmunoAssay technology enables the direct visual detection of a physical change in the optical thickness of molecular thin films. This change is the result of antigen - antibody binding on an optical surface (silicon wafer). After a specimen potentially containing Shiga toxin is mixed with conjugates and placed directly on the optical surface, the immobilized surface antibodies capture the antigen/conjugate complex. After washing, the substrate is added, increasing the thickness (mass enhancement) of the molecular thin film. This change in thickness alters the reflected light path, and this alteration is visually perceived as a color change. Slight changes in the optical thickness produce a distinct visible color change. A positive result appears as a purple spot on the gold background. When antigen is not present in the specimen, no binding takes place. Therefore, the optical thickness remains unchanged, and the surface retains the original gold color indicating a negative result.

More specifically, the BioStar OIA SHIGATOX device is based on a novel thin film optical detection technology that relies on the interaction of white light with thin films to create a destructive interference phenomenon. Characteristic of this phenomenon is the generation of a reflective surface that changes color as a function of the change in optical thickness (refractive index x thickness) of the films on the surface of the device. To take advantage of this phenomenon for monitoring biological binding events, the optical surface with a special background color is coated with a capture reagent specific to the analyte of interest. In the OIA SHIGATOX device, the biological capture film is a combination of affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (Stx 1 and Stx 2). Samples suspected of containing either or both of the toxins are mixed with cocktail containing polyclonal antibodies to Stx 1 and Stx 2 that have been covalently conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Once a sample containing toxins or either toxin is applied to the surface, the immune complex of toxin(s) and the anti-toxin-HRP conjugate(s) are bound to the surface antibodies. Following a wash step, a precipitating substrate for HRP is added, and a thin film generated by the immobilized immune complex is enhanced by the precipitation of the HRP product. Once washed and dried, a simple color change relative to the gold background color is observed as an indication of the presence of Stx 1 or Stx 2 in the original specimen.

The OIA SHIGATOX device produces a qualitative result for the presence or absence of Shiga toxin as the device output. Input to the device is the simple addition of an aliquot of fecal material (direct or in transport media) or broth culture to the reagents contained in the kit. Fecal samples are routinely collected and no special collection requirements exist. Test devices within the kit are single use devices, and disposal instructions are provided in the Package Insert. The kit contains all components necessary for analysis of the range of samples approved for use in this product, with the exception of a timer.

Materials Required But Not Provided - timer

# Assay Protocol

• Liquid Specimens: The Transfer Pipette provided should be   
used for liquid fecal specimens. Semi-Solid Specimens: Dip the swab into the specimen,   
rotating gently to absorb sample. Rotate the swab gently against the wall of

the sample container to remove excess fecal material. Add 2 drops of Diluent / Negative Control to the reaction tube.

. Cary Blair Specimens: The Transfer Pipette provided should be used for Cary Blair Specimens. • Colony Collection: Wipe a swab across the first and second quadrants of the growth area on the plate and then immerse the swab into a reaction tube containing 3 drops each of Reagents 1 and 2 and follow the Assay Procedure.

Remove reagents from refrigerated storage and allow to warm to room temperature $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ Store Wash Solution at room temperature $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ after opening. If stored refrigerated, Wash Solution will take up to 2 hours to warm to room temperature.

Remove one Reaction Tube for each specimen to be tested and place it upright in a rack or holder. Label Reaction Tubes and Test Devices with appropriate patient information. Place Test Devices on a level surface while the assay is being performed. Mix all fecal specimens thoroughly before sampling.

1. Add 3 drops of Reagent 1 to the Reaction Tube.   
2. Add 3 drops of Reagent 2 to the Reaction Tube.

Note: The combined Reagents 1 and 2 in the Reaction Tube should have a blue color.

3. Thoroughly mix the fecal specimen with the Transfer Pipette. Add 2 drops of the specimen to the Reaction Tube and mix by squeezing the sides of the tube. For semi-solid specimens, an enclosed swab may be used to add specimen into the tube. Refer to "Semi-Solid Specimens" under the Test Procedure for additional information.

4. Within 1 minute of mixing, use the Transfer Pipette to place 1 to 2 drops (to cover the surface) of the sample mixture directly onto the center of the test surface. Wait 10 minutes.

5. Wash the surface vigorously with a hard squit of Wash Solution, taking care not to exceed the capacity of the absorbent material surrounding the test surface.

Note: Vigorous washing will aid in obtaining a clean test surface. Insufficient washing of the test surface may leave debris that may result in the appearance of a ring or spots surrounding the positive Internal Control dot. These effects should not be interpreted as a positive result due to the lack of color shading within the ring area.

6. Confirm that the blotter in the Test Device lid is in Position I. Close the Test Device at the corners. Leave closed for 10 seconds to remove residual moisture from the test surface.

7.Open the lid, change the blotter to Position ll, and apply 1 drop of Substrate directly to the center of each Test Device. Wait 5 minutes.

Note: Do not cover the entire surface of the Test Device with Substrate. The gold, unreacted areas surrounding the reaction circle serves as a negative Internal Control and reference for comparing signal intensity.

8. Repeat Step 5, washing the test surface vigorously with Wash Solution. Close the Test Device at the corners. Leave closed for 10 seconds. Open and examine the test surfaces for color changes (See Interpretation of Test Results).

# E. Intended Use [§807.92(a)(5)]:

The Inverness Medical BioStar OIA SHIGATOX assay is an Optical Immunoassay (OlA) test for the qualitative, rapid detection of the presence of Shiga toxins in human diarrheal fecal specimens, broth cultures, fecal specimens in Cary Blair Transport Media, or swab sampling of colonies from a culture plate. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid in the diagnosis of infection by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) both 0157 and all non - O157 Shiga toxin-producing strains.

# F. Summary of non - clinical testing [§807.92(b)(1)]

a. Analytical Sensitivity

To determine the analytical sensitivity, two-fold serial dilutions of purified Stx 1 or Stx 2 toxin were prepared. These dilutions were then spiked into buffer and the spiked samples were tested in triplicate. The Limit of Detection (LOD) was defined as the lowest toxin concentration producing at least two positive results of the three tests or at least $50 \%$ of the total number of samples tested. In an antigen diluent formulation, the limits of detection were 1 ng/mL and $0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Stx 1 and Stx 2, respectively. The same levels were tested in a liquid stool and the LOD for each toxin was determined to be 1 ng/mL. Five samples at each concentration were analyzed on 2 lots of devices.

b. Analytical Strain Recognition

# Toxigenic Strain Testing

To establish that the OIA SHIGATOX assay detects all Shiga toxin producing strains and organisms, the following studies were conducted. Clinical isolates, previously analyzed for the presence of Shiga toxin genes and serotyped, were obtained from a Department of Public Health (49 isolate strains) and a university laboratory (21 isolate strains). Lists of the isolates from each source are presented in the tables. Tubes of MacConkey broth

were inoculated with each isolate and cultured overnight at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ under aerobic conditions. A 60-L sample of the broth was then tested in the OIA SHIGATOX assay without further processing using the same protocol as was used with clinical samples after broth enrichment.

In addition, Shigella dysenteriae (ATCC 13313) was tested and produced a positive result as expected. All 70 clinical isolates produced the expected positive assay result. The OIA SHIGATOX assay detects the Shiga toxin from a wide range of toxin-producing E. coli. Similar results were observed with multiple lots of material throughout the development process.

# C. Analytical Specificity (Cross Reactivity

Bacteria were grown on appropriate media and suspended in Antigen Diluent, a bufferd prote solution, tstock onentrations $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ organisms/mL or higher. The organisms were tested with and without spiking with $2 . 5 \ : \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ Stx 1 and 2.5 ng/mL Stx 2. The exceptions were that Cryptosporidium and Giardia were tested at 1 x 106 cysts/mL, and Candida albicans was tested at 9.3 x 10' cells/mL. All members of the cross reactivity panel produced the expected negative result without the toxin spike and the expected positive result with the toxin spike.

In addition, one clinical trial site tested three stools in the OIA SHIGATOX assay that were positive in a commercial lateral flow, ElA assay for Rotavirus. All 3 samples were negative in the OIA SHIGATOX assay as expected.

d. Interfering Substances

The OIA SHIGATOX assay was tested with whole blood, mucin, liquid Imodium® AD, Pepto Bismol®, Kaopectate®, and Barium Sulfate for the potential of these materials to interfere with assay results. Clinical trial lots of product were tested, and the conjugate and test surface were specific to each lot. To test for potential nonspecific signal generation, a 30 µL aliquot of each potential interferent stock was mixed with 30 µL of Antigen Diluent or a liquid or semi - solid stool specimen and run as the sample with the standard assay protocol. To test for potential interference with the positive signal, the 30 µL aliquot was mixed with 30 µL Antigen Diluent or a liquid or semi - solid stool specimen containing 5 ng/mL of each toxin (final concentrations of Stx 1 and Stx 2 were 2.5 ng/mL). Each sample was tested in duplicate.

# e. Reproducibility Studies

Objective:

The objective of the Reprodubility Studies was to demonstrate the inter - site and intra - site reproducibility of results obtained with the OIA SHIGATOX test. Testing at the Physician Office Laboratories (POL) sites was conducted to verify the ease of use of the product and is not included as an indication that testing should be performed at a POL site.

# Materials & Methods:

The reproducibility of the OIA SHIGATOX assay was determined for six operators, one operator at each of the three clinical trial sites and three operators at two Physician Office Laboratory (POL) sites. Samples were blinded and randomized throughout the study. Samples were made by spiking stools from a healthy individual that were screened and confirmed to be negative for Shiga toxin. Two levels of each toxin (8 and $1 6 \ n g / \mathrm { m L } )$ were tested both alone and in combinations with the other toxin. This scheme led to the preparation of 9 sample types: Negative, Low Stx 1 only, Low Stx 2 only, Moderate Stx 1 only, Moderate Stx 2 only, Low Stx 1/Low Stx 2, Low Stx 1/Moderate Stx 2, Moderate Stx 1/Low Stx 2, and Moderate Stx 1/Moderate Stx 2. By testing each sample in triplicate on each day, each operator evaluated a total of twenty-seven fecal samples on 3 consecutive days. Sites were instructed to analyze the samples as normal patient samples according to the Package Insert instructions. The Sample Key is provided in Table 15, and the individual results by day are presented in Tables 16 to 18.

# Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity

1. Swab Sampling of Colonies from a Culture Plate (Colony Sweep Method)

One clinical site evaluated twenty two frozen fecal specimens in a colony sweep procedure. These samples were previously found to contain Shiga toxin producing E. coli. All samples were streaked onto Sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) and XLD (xylose lysine deoxycholate) plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. One sample failed to produce any growth. A sterile rayon swab was used to sweep the first and second quadrants of the growth area and was then immersed into a reaction tube containing 3 drops each of Reagents 1 and 2 and the standard assay protocol followed. The OIA SHIGATOX assay detected 21/21 of the colony sweeps that produced growth for 100% agreement with the previous specimen result.

# 2. Direct Stool

A prospective study was conducted at three clinical trial sites in the Eastern and Western regions of the United States to compare the performance of the BioStar OIA SHIGATOX to a commercial EIA test. Sites analyzed the stool specimens collected for direct testing from the stool sample by both assays and then placed an aliquot of the stool in MacConkey broth within 48 hours of specimen collection. Broth cultures were incubated for 20 - 30 hours and then tested by both immunoassays. A SMAC culture (Sorbitol MacConkey plates) was also plated within 48 hours of the specimen collection for the determination of E. coli O157. All positive results from either immunoassay method were confirmed by cytotoxicity testing, CTA.

A total of 272 prospective specimens from diarrheal patients were tested in the OIA SHIGATOX and the EIA method.

Of the five ${ \mathsf { O } } { \mathsf { I A } } { + } / { \mathsf { E } } { \mathsf { I A } }$ - specimens, one was positive by CTA. One of the samples that was negative by direct stool testing in both the ElA and the OIA methods was positive in the OIA broth culture sample and by CTA from the direct stool.

Two of the clinical sites also performed a study in which sixty-two additional frozen specimens were prospectively tested by OIA SHIGATOX and EIA without the operator's knowledge of the original Shiga toxin result.

The single OIA SHIGATOX $+ / E | A -$ result was confirmed to be a true positive by the CTA analysis of the direct stool.

In the prospective frozen sample study, ten of the frozen specimens were not tested in overnight MacConkey broth culture. Two of the remaining specimens failed to exhibit growth after overnight MacConkey broth culture. The percent positive agreement was $100 \%$ and the percent negative agreement was $9 6 . 4 \%$ The overall percent agreement in the study was $9 8 \%$ .

# 4. SMAC Culture

Two hundred and sixty nine (269) of the direct stool samples were analyzed by SMAC culture. The OIA SHIGATOX and EIA assays were compared to the SMAC culture results. Interpretation of the comparison between the OIA SHIGATOX or the EIA test and SMAC is confounded by the fact that, as a metabolic test, SMAC is specific for E. coli O157:H7, while OIA SHIGATOX reacts with all Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Also, SMAC requires the presence of live cells in the sample, while the OIA SHIGATOX test does not have that limitation. Based on these differences, it was anticipated that a number of samples could be SMAC-negative and OIA SHIGATOX positive.

The one apparent OIA false negative result compared to the SMAC result was not confirmed by CTA and was not positive by EIA. Of the 8 apparent false positives by the OlA method, 4 of the samples were positive by CTA. The second EIA false negative result was positive by CTA and the OIA method. One of the $\mathsf { O l A } + / \mathsf { S M A C } +$ samples was negative by CTA. The 2 EIA $- / { \mathsf { S M A C } } +$ samples were negative by CTA and one of the samples was negative by the OIÁ method as well. Three of the EIA +/SMAC - samples were positive by CTA and the OIA method. The remaining EIA $+ .$ SMAC - sample was negative by CTA but positive by the OIA method.

In addition, two of the clinical sites conducted a prospective comparison of the OIA method to SMAC culture using frozen samples. Thawed aliquots of all samples were tested in the OIA and SMAC methods for this comparison.

All thirteen of the OIA+/SMAC- samples were positive for STEC in previous testing.

# 5. CTA

In the clinical study there were 19 specimens positive by OIA, EIA, or both methods. An aliquot of the stool specimen for each of these 19 specimens was submitted for CTA along with an aliquot of the broth culture media. One sample produced an inconclusive result and was excluded from this analysis. Thirteen of the samples were positive by CTA. The OIA SHIGATOX detected 12 of these 13 samples while the EIA method detected 11. Twelve of the broth aliquots were positive by CTA. The OIA SHIGATOX assay detected all 12 of these samples as did the EIA method. Of the 13 CTA positives, SMAC was positive for only 8 samples.

# Direct Stool:

The following additions were made as a change to the previously cleared device.

Ninety-eight frozen fecal specimens were collected from 2 laboratory sites. Fecal specimens were thawed and tested directly in the BioStar OIA SHIGATOX assay and used to inoculate Cary Blair transport media. Cary Blair diluted fecal samples were tested within one and 24 hours of inoculation in the BioStar OIA SHiGATOX test. For the Cary Blair analysis, the direct fecal testing in the OlA method was used as the reference method.

# Broth Culture:

Ninety eight fecal specimens were thawed and inoculated into MacConkey (MAC) broth and Gram Negative (GN) broth. The broth tubes were incubated for 24 hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ An aliquot from each sample was tested in the OIA

SHIGATOX assay. In addition, the Cary Blair samples that were held for 24 hours at room temperature were used to inoculate both GN and MAC broths. These samples were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C, and then an aliquot was tested in the OIA SHIGATOX method. The reference method used in this evaluation was the direct fecal inoculation of the MAC broth.

# Conclusions:

Based on the results obtained during these studies, the instructions for use of the OIA SHIGATOX assay have been amended to reflect the following changes in acceptable sample type:

Cary Blair transport media inoculated with a fecal specimen for direct testing GN enrichment broth inoculated with direct fecal specimens GN enrichment broth inoculated with Cary Blair samples MAC enrichment broth inoculated with Cary Blair samples
