Real-time PCR amplification and detection system for targeted Francisella tularensis DNA sequences

Classification Name:

Reagent Kit: F. tularensis DNA Reagents (Unclassified)

# Device Description:

The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Tularemia Detection Kit is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagent kit, which, when used with the JBAIDS instrument and software, allows the qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) detection of a target DNA sequence within the pathogenic bacterium, Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. Key components of the kit include oligonucleotide primers and a fluorescent-labeled target assay probe that specifically detects $F _ { \ l }$ tularensis DNA. The kit is designed for use with the JBAIDS instrument, a portable thermocycler and real-time fluorimeter that performs PCR in glass capillaries.

Before testing, samples are purified using Idaho Technology's $1 . 2 \mathrm { - } 3 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Sample Purification Kits (or validated equivalent). The resulting purified sample is added to an Unknown reagent vial and an Inhibition Control reagent vial, along with reconstitution buffer. When the organism is present, a fragment of $F ,$ tularensis DNA is amplified. The amplicon is detected by fluorescence using a specific hydrolysis probe. The hydrolysis probe contains a short oligonucleotide that hybridizes to an internal sequence of the amplified fragment during the annealing phase of the PCR cycle. This probc has the $\zeta ^ { \prime }$ and $\ ? ^ { \dag }$ cnds labeled with a rcporter dye and a quenching dye, respectively. When the probe hybridizes to the specific DNA target, the Taq polymerase enzyme replicating the target-specific DNA

hydrolyzes the probe, separating the two fluorophores and allowing the reporter dye to fluoresce.

The JBAIDS instrument measures the level of fluorescence from each unknown sample and control. JBAIDS Software analyzes the fluorescence amplification curves and reports results as positive, negative, inhibited, or uncertain. A failure of the Positive or Negative Control will result in the entire run being called invalid. Failure of the Inhibition Control yields an inhibited result when the assiated sample has a negative result for the target assay and requires retesting of that sample.

Intended Use: The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Tularemia Detection Kit is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test system intended for the qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) detection of target DNA sequences of Francisella tularensis. The system can be used to test human whole blood collected in sodium citrate or sputum collected aseptically from individuals greater than 18 years of age suspected of having tularemia. In addition, positive blood cultures and colonies may be tested. This assay is intended to aid in diagnosis of individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of pncumonic or typhoidal tularemia. It is not intended to aid in thc diagnosis of glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, or oropharyngeal tularemia.

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is run on the JBAIDS instrument using the Diagnostic Wizard. Results are for the presumptive identification of $F$ . tularensis, in conjunction with culture and other laboratory tests. The definitive identification of $F .$ tularensis from colony growth, liquid blood culture, blood specimens, or sputum specimens requires additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with public health or other authorities for whom reports are required.

The diagnosis of tularemia infection must be made based on history, signs, symptoms, exposure likelihood, and other laboratory evidence, in addition to the identification of the target either from colonies, blood culture, whole blood specimens, or sputum specimens.

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is intended for use by trained clinical laboratory personnel who have received specific training on the use of the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection kit. The level of $F .$ tularensis that would be present in blood or sputum of individuals with early systemic or pneumonic infection is unknown. Due to the difficulty in obtaining clinical specimens, the assay was not evaluated with blood or sputum from individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of tularemia and who subsequently developed pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia.

# Substantial

Equivalence: The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is substantially equivalent to $F _ { \ l }$ tularensis antigens and antiserum used for agglutination tests. The antigens were approved under 510(k) #K952138, and the control antiserum under 510(k) #K952141. The following table compares the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit with this predicate device.

The predicate device and the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit have the same intended use. Both provide test results that aid in the diagnosis of tularemia when considered with other clinical and microbiological evidence, both test for $F _ { \ell }$ tularensis infection directly from patient specimens, and both provide qualitative test results.

While the basic intended use is the same for the predicate device and the JBAIDS Kit, the technological characteristics are quite different. The $F .$ tularensis antigen agglutination test relies on the dctection of antibodies to $F .$ tularensis, while the JBAIDS Kit detects the organism directly in the patient specimen or from cultures. Because of this, the time for diagnosis differs. Antibodies against $F .$ tularensis do not appear for 7 to 14 days after onset of symptoms. In contrast, PCR can detect $F .$ tularensis concurrent with, or within a few days of, symplom onset.

While there is no published data on the performance of the predicate device. the sensitivity of othcr antigen agglutination tests has been described in several studics. In a study by Porsch-Ozcurumez et al.. $1 0 0 \%$ (50/50) of patients diagnosed with tularemia tested positive with agglutination.' Bevanger et al. found that $91 \%$ $( 4 0 / 4 4 )$ of paticnts tested positive with the agglutination test. While the clinical sensitivity ofagglutination tests is excellent, sensitivity to all strains of $F$ tularensis is unknown.

These studies also determined the specificity of the antigen agglutination tests. In the study by Porsch-Ozcurumez, $100 \%$ (50/50) of serum samples collected from healthy individuals tested negative with the assay.' The study by Bevanger also claimed $100 \%$ specificity (50/50); however, weak cross-reactivity was noted with Brucella abortis and Yersinia enterocolitica.2

The analytic sensitivity, or inclusivity, of the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit was determined by testing colonies and purified DNA from various subtypes and strains of $F$ tularensis. Of the 27 isolates that were tested, all 27 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ were detected.

Analytic specificity, or exclusivity, of the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit was determined by testing colonies of organisms that are phylogenetically related to $F$ tularensis and colonies of unrelated organisms that are likely to be found in clinical samples. Negative results were obtained for 23/24 $( 9 5 . 8 \% )$ of the organisms. A weak cross-reaction was seen with the closely related $F$ philomiragia when testing plated colonies, which contain very high levels of organism. $F$ philomiragia is an opportunistic paen ans priariy ein near-rownig patients.To help ensue aprae diagnosis, information on the weak cross-reactivity and the incidence of F. philomiragia infection was added to the package insert.

In addition to analytic studies, a multisite clinical trial was conducted with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. Due to the near absence of clinical samples from individuals with a diagnosis of typhoidal or pneumonic tularemia, the clinical trial was limited to an assessment of clinical specificity. Blood and/or sputum samples obtained from subjects with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with systemic tularemia and for whom a blood and/or sputum culture had been ordered were tested for F. tularensis using the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. The results were compared to the gold standard technique of culture. As expected, $F$ tularensis was not identified in any of the blood or sputum cultures. Of the 132 whole blood specimens that gave valid JBAIDS results, all $( 1 0 0 \% )$ tested negative. Of the 36 sputum samples that gave valid JBAIDS results, all $( 1 0 0 \% )$ were negative.

Because $F .$ tularnsi  n extreey infeus gani, rutie culture e organism is discouraged as this practice puts laboratory workers at risk of acquiring the disease. In addition, culture lacks clinical sensitivity. In a study comparing the sensitivity of culture and PCR, Johansson et al. found that PCR was positive in 75% (30/40) of serologically confirmed cases of ulceroglandular tularemia, while culture was positive in only $6 2 \%$ (25/40).4 Johansson also found that PCR could detect cases of tularemia not detected by antibody tests. These published studies demonstrate the clinical utility of PCR assays.

Based on the limited data available for the F. tularensis antigen agglutination test, the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit appears to be as safe and effective as the predicate device. The JBAIDS offers advantages over the predicate. First, the JBAIDS software automatically interprets the assay results, reducing the opportunity for user error. and the freeze-dried assay format minimizes assay setup errors. Second, the JBAIDS Kit can more rapidly provide a diagnosis earlier in the course of the infection. The time to results for the JBAIDS Kit is less than three hours, while the antigen agglutination test takes approximately 24 hours. The JBAIDS Kit can be used as soon as symptoms appear, while the antibody agglutination reaction may require that patients be tested at least seven days after showing symptoms for sufficient antibody to be present.

In summary, the JBAIDS assay, while technologically distinct from the predicate. is as safe and effective as the predicate, but could provide a more rapid diagnosis.
