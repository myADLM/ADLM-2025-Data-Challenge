DEVICE TRADE NAME:

BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System - Daptomycin $( 0 . 0 3 1 3 - 1 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$

DEVICE COMMON NAME:

Antimicrobial susceptibility test system-short incubation

DEVICE CLASSIFICATION:

Fully Automated Short-Term Incubation Cycle Antimicrobial Susceptibility Device, 21 CFR 866.1645

# PREDICATE DEVICES:

VITEK® System (PMA No. N50510) and BD PhoenixTM Automated Microbiology System with Gatifloxacin (K020321, May 23, 2002 and K060324, May 25, 2006), Ofloxacin (K020323, April 14, 2002), and Levofloxacin (K020322, March 27, 2002).

# INTENDED USE:

The BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System is intended for the rapid identification and in vitro antinicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates from pure culture of most aerobic and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria of human origin.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Phoenix System) is an automated system for the rapid identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of clinically relevant bacterial isolates. For testing Streptococcus species the system includes the following components:

BD Phoenix instrument and software. BD Phoenix panels containing biochcmicals for organism ID testing and antimicrobial agents or AST determinations. BD Phoenix ID Broth used for performing ID tests and preparing AST Broth inoculum. BD Phoenix AST-S Broth used for performing AST tests only.   
− BD Phoenix AST-S Indicator solution added to the AST Broth to aid in bacterial growth determination.

The Phoenix panel is a sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents. Organisms for susceptibility testing must be a pure culture and preliminarily identified as a Gram-negative or Gram-positive isolate. For each isolate, an inoculation equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard is prepared in Phoenix ID broth.

The Phoenix AST method is a broth based microdilution test. The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the presence of an antimicrobial agent. Measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are used in the determination of bacterial growth. Each AST panel configuration contains several antimicrobial agents with a wide range of two-fold doubling dilution concentrations.

The instrument houses the panels where they are continuously incubated at a nominal temperature of $3 5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ The instrument takes readings of the panels every 20 minutes. The readings are interpreted to give an ientiiati the isolate, minum ihibitry conntration (MC) values and cao interpretations, S, I, R or N (susceptible, intermediate, resistant or not susceptible).

# DEVICE COMPARISON:

The BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI reference broth microdilution method. This premarket notification provides data supporting the use of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System Streptococcus ID/AST or AST only Phoenix panels with this antimicrobial agent.

# SUMMARY OF SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE TESTING:

The BD Phoenix™m Automated Microbiology System has demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared to the CLSI reference broth microdilution method (AST panels prepared according to CLSI M7). The system has been evaluated as defined in the FDA guidance document, "Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA", March 5, 2007.

# Site Reproducibility

Intra- and inter-site reproducibility of this antimicrobial agent in the BD Phoenix System was evaluatd at three sites using a panel  streptocoal isolates.Each site tested the isolates intripiate on three different days using one lot of Streptococcus Phoenix panels containing this antimicrobial agent and associated reagents.

The results of the study demonstrate for the this antimicrobial agent there was an overall intra-site reproducibility of greater than $90 \%$ and an overall inter-site reproducibility greater than $9 5 \%$ for the streptococcal isolates tested.

# Clinical Studies

Clinical, stock and challenge isolates were tested across multiple geographically diverse sites across the United States to demonstrate the performance of the Phoenix antimicrobial susceptibility test with the Streptococus Phoenix Panel format containing this antimicrobial agent. Phoenix System results for Challenge set isolates were compared to the expected results. Phoenix System results for clinical isolates were compared to the results obtained from the CLSI reference broth microdilution method.

The performance of the Phoenix System was assessed by calculating Essential Agreement (EA) and Category Agreement (CA) to expected/reference results for all isolates tested. Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when the BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System agrees exactly or within $\pm$ Y one two-fold dilution to the reference result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System agrees with the reference method with respect to the FDA categorical interpretive criteria (susceptible, intermediate, resistant or nonsusceptible).

Table 1 summarizes the performance for the isolates tested in this study.

# Conclusions Drawn from Substantial Equivalence Studies

The data collected from the substantial equivalence studies demonstrate that testing on the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System with this antimicrobial agent is substantially cquivalent as outlined in the FDA draft guidance document, "Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA," March 5, 2007. Technological characteristics of this system are substantially equivalent to those used in the VITEK" system, which received approval by the FDA undcr PMA number N50510 and BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System with Gatifloxacin (K020321, May 23, 2002 and K060324, May 25, 2006), Ofloxacin (K020323, April 14, 2002), and Levofloxacin (K020322, March 27, 2002).
