# Device Description

The BioPlex ™m 2200 ToRC IgG kit uses multiplex flow immunoassay, a methodology that greatly resembles traditional ElA, but permits simultaneous detection and identification of many antibodies in a single tube. "ToRC" is an acronym for individual tests to detect antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), Rubella, and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Three (3) different populations of dyed beads are coated with cell lysates bearing T. gondii, Rubella, or CMV antigens. :

The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent into a reaction vessel; the mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ After a wash cycle, anti-human IgG antibody, conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads, and this mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ : The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the attached PE. Raw data are calculated in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).

Three additional dyed beads, Internal Standard Bead (ISB), Serum Verification Bead (SVB) and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction vessel and the absence of significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma.

The instrument is calibrated using a set of six (6) distinct calibrator vials, the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG Calibrator Set. For T. gondii and Rubella, six (6) vials, representing six (6) different levels of antibody concentrations, are used for quantitative calibration, and results for patient samples are expressed in lU/mL. For T. gondii, results of $\leq 9$ IU/mL are negative, 10 and 11 lU/mL are equivocal, and results of ≥ 12 lU/mL are reported as positive: For Rubella, results of ≤ 7 IU/mL are reported as negative, 8 and 9 1U/mL are equivocal, and $\geq$ 10 lU/mL are reported as positive. For CMV, four (4) vials, representing four (4) different antibody concentrations, are used for qualitative calibration. CMV results are expressed as an antibody index (Al) and results of $\leq 0 . 8$ AI are negative, 0.9 and 1.0 Al are equivocal, and results of $\geq 1 . 1$ Al are reported as positive.

The BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG Control Set includes a negative control as well as two (2) multi-analyte positive controls. The BioPlex ToRC IgG Low Positive Control contains antibodies for T. gondii, Rubella and CMV and the BioPlex ToRC IgG High Positive Control contains antibodies for T. gondii and Rubella. The BioPlex ToRC IgG Positive Controls are manufactured to give positive results, with values above the cut-off for each specific analyte. The BioPlex ToRC IgG Negative Control is manufactured to give negative results, with values below the cut-off for each specific analyte. The recommended frequency for performing quality control is once every 24-hour testing period. Performing quality control is also necessary after each new assay calibration and certain service procedures.

# 7. Performance Testing

A series of studies was conducted to evaluate the performance of the BioPlex ™M 2200 ToRC IgG kit. The studies included reproducibility, linearity, interfering substances, cross-reactivity, correlation with CDC evaluation panels, expected values and performance characteristics. The results of all studies demonstrated that the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG kit performed according to its specifications.

# A. Reproducibility

Separate internal and external reproducibility studies were conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG kit on the BioPlex 2200 instrument. Reproducibility studies were based on the principles described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.

For the internal reproducibility study, three (3) panels made from serum and plasma (EDTA and heparinized) were assayed two (2) times in two (2) separate daily runs over 20 days $( n = 8 0 )$ . The data were analyzed for withinrun, between-run, between-day, and total precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% 0 V )$ were calculated. The within-run precision for positive samples, greater than their respective cut-offs, in all sample matrices ranged from $3 . 9 \%$ to $9 . 5 \%$ for $T .$ gondii IgG, $3 . 0 \%$ to $5 . 0 \%$ for Rubella IgG, and $1 . 8 \%$ to $5 . 6 \%$ for CMV IgG. The total precision for positive samples, greater than their respective cut-offs, in all sample matrices ranged from $6 . 6 \%$ to $1 2 . 3 \%$ for $T .$ gondii IgG, $5 . 2 \%$ to $9 . 9 \%$ for Rubella IgG, and $3 . 8 \%$ to $8 . 7 \%$ for CMV IgG.

An external reproducibility study was performed at each of three (3) U.S. testing facilities. Three (3) panels made from serum and plasma (EDTA and heparinized) were assayed two (2) times on two (2) separate daily runs over five (5) days at the three (3) sites $( N = 6 0 )$ . The data were analyzed for withinrun, between-run, between-day, between-site, and total precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% 0 V )$ were calculated. The within-run precision for positive samples, greater than their respective cut-offs, in all sample matrices ranged from $3 . 7 \%$ to $7 . 7 \%$ for $T .$ gondii IgG, $4 . 6 \%$ to $6 . 6 \%$ for Rubella $\mathsf { I g } \mathsf { G }$ ,and $2 . 5 \%$ to $5 . 8 \%$ for CMV IgG. The total precision for positive samples, greater than their respective cut-offs, in all sample matrices ranged from $4 . 8 \%$ to $1 7 . 6 \%$ for $T .$ gondii IgG, $7 . 2 \%$ to $10 . 3 \%$ for Rubella IgG and $4 . 4 \%$ to $1 2 . 1 \%$ for CMV IgG.

An additional external Rubella reproducibility study was performed at each of three (3) U.S. testing facilities. A. panel of, three (3). Rubella IgG samples measuring near cut-off was assayed in replicates of 40 in one run at each site. The data were analyzed for within-run precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% 0 M )$ were calculated. The within-run precision ranged from $5 . 2 \%$ to $9 . 7 \%$ .

# B. Linearity

Linearity of the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG kit was determined based on the principles described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSl) EP6-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: Statistical Approach. The assay ranges are $T .$ gondii $( 3 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 9 0 0 ~ \mathsf { \Omega } \mathsf { I U / m L } ) ,$ Rubella (1 - 250 IU/mL) and CMV $( 0 . 2 \textrm { - } 8 . 0 \textrm { } \mathsf { A l } )$ , and were established by examining the clinical relevance of reporting high value results and the ability of the calibration curve to discriminate sample dilutions. Five (5) high positive serum samples were obtained for each analyte in the kit. The samples were selected at the high end of the assay range and serial dilutions prepared using negative serum. Linear and polynomial regression analysis of $1 0 / \mathsf { m L }$ or Al vs. sample dilution was performed to determine if the dilution curves exhibit statistically significant non-linear regression. The results demonstrated acceptable dilution linearity, as all recoveries were within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the predicted value...

Linearity of BioPlex ToRC IgG T. gondii and Rubella assays was evaluated using World Health Organization (WHO) IgG standards. Dilutions of antiToxoplasma serum, 3rd International Standard (TOxM), and anti-Rubella immunoglobulin, 1st International Standard (RUBl-1-94), were prepared and tested in the respective assay. Results obtained demonstrated acceptable dilution linearity through the cut-off, as all recoveries were within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the predicted value.

# C. Interfering Substances

An interfering substances study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference of specific endogenous and exogenous substances with the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG assays. The study was conducted based on the principles described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP7-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. No significant interference was observed with any of the substances tested. The substances and the maximum levels tested are shown in the table below.

# D.Cross-Reactivity $- \frac { 1 } { i }$ ∴

A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from various disease states and other potentially interfering factors interfere with test results when tested with the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG kit. A panel of ten (10) specimens positive for each cross reactant were evaluated for possible crossreactivity with each of the three (3) BioPlex ToRC IgG assays. Samples were also tested with reference ToRC IgG assays. The results demonstrated that the various disease state samples evaluated do not cross-react with the three (3) assays in the BioPlex ToRC IgG kit. Most of the samples evaluated were high positives for each disease state. If a specific disease state did cross react to the various assays of the BioPlex ToRC IgG kit, all samples for that particular disease would elicit a positive response. The majority of the samples that elicited a positive result were also confirmed positive by the corresponding reference ToRC IgG assay. Results are shown in the table below.

# E. Correlation with CDC Evaluation Panels

A correlation study was performed to evaluate the characteristics of the BioPlex ToRC IgG kit with serum panels provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for T. gondii, Rubella and CMV. Three (3) panels were tested and the data were provided to the CDC for comparison against the CDC Reference Methods for the three (3) analytes. The results are presented in the tables below.

# F. Expected Values/Prevalence

The observed prevalence for each of the ToRC IgG assays, individually and in dual infection, was determined using samples collected from pregnant women in the U.S. and Europe as well as in clinical samples submitted for $T .$ gondii, Rubella, or CMV IgG testing. For T. gondii, results of ≤ 9 IU/mL are negative, 10 and 11 lU/mL are equivocal, and results of $\geq$ 12 IU/mL are reported as positive. For Rubella, results of ≤ 7 lU/mL are reported as negative, 8 and 9 lU/mL are equivocal, and $\geq 1 0 / \bigcup / m L$ are reported as positive. For CMV, results of $\leq 0 . 8$ Al are negative, 0.9 and 1.0 Al are equivocal, and $\geq$ 1.1 Al are reported as positive. Results from all sites are shown and summarized in the tables below.

Retrospective Study: Performance of the ToRC IgG kit was evaluated using samples with confirmed known Rubella IgG status against a commercially available Rubella IgG immunoassay. Rubella IgG status was determined in clinical laboratories using an FDA-cleared assay for Rubella IgG. Two (2) U.S. clinical sites tested a combined: 50 Rubella IgG low positive samples (10-20 lU/mL), 50 Rubella IgG high positive samples $( > 2 0 \ | \cup / \mathrm { m L } )$ and 130 Rubella IgG negative samples (< 10 IU/mL). All samples were preselected based on the assay result falling in the ranges described. Results are shown in the table below.
