# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Platelia™ Lyme IgG Assay is a qualitative test intended for use in the presumptive detection of human IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum or plasma $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA, sodium heparin or sodium citrate). The EIA system should be used to test serum or plasma from patients with a history and symptoms of infection with $B$ . burgdorferi. All positive and equivocal specimens should be re-tested with a specific second-tier test such as Western blot. Positive secondtier results are supportive evidence of infection with $B$ . burgdorferi. The diagnosis of Lyme disease should be made based on history and symptoms (such as erythema migrans), and other laboratory data, in addition to the presence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Negative results (either first or second-tier) should not be used to exclude Lyme disease.

# I. Device Description:

Platelia™ Lyme IgG Assay is a qualitative test for detection of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum or plasma. Platelia™ Lyme IgG uses an indirect ELISA immuno-enzymatic method. Inactivated antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi B31 are used for coating the microplate. A monoclonal antibody labeled with peroxidase which is specific for human gamma chains (anti-IgG) is used as the conjugate. Patients samples and controls are diluted 1/101 and then distributed to the wells of the microplate. During this incubation of one hour at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi present in the sample bind to the Borrelia antigen coated on microplate wells. After incubation, unbound non-specific antibodies and other serum proteins are removed by washings. The conjugate (peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody specific for human gamma chains) is added to the microplate wells. During this incubation of one hour at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , the labeled monoclonal antibody binds to the serum IgG captured by the Borrelia antigen. The unbound conjugate is removed by washings at the end of the incubation. The presence of immuno-complexes (Borrelia Antigen, IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, anti-IgG conjugate) is demonstrated by the addition of an enzymatic development solution to each well. After incubation at room temperature $( + 1 8 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , the enzymatic reaction is stopped by addition of 1N sulfuric acid solution. The optical density reading obtained with a spectrophotometer set at $4 5 0 / 6 2 0 \ \mathrm { \ n m }$ is proportional to the amount of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi present in the sample.

# Controls Description:

The positive and negative controls are made from human serum.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Study 1: Assay precision was established at Bio-Rad. To confirm the inter assay precision of the Platelia™ Lyme IgG assay, six samples were run twice a day for 20 days. Each sample (2 positive, 2 low positive and 2 negative samples) was tested according to the assessed kit's protocol (same batch used throughout the experiment). Coefficients of variation obtained for positive samples were less than $10 \%$ . Higher CV was obtained in the grey zone.

Study 2: Assay precision was established at Bio-Rad. To confirm the intra assay precision of the Platelia™ Lyme IgG assay two studies were run:

o Three samples close to the cut off value were tested 20 times during the same run, according to the assessed kit's protocol.   
o Various samples spanning the assay range were tested 30 times during the same run, according to the assessed kit's protocol.

The coefficient of variation was less than $10 \%$ for positive samples as well as those samples close to the cut off.

Study 3: Assay reproducibility was established at two external sites and at Bio-Rad through a panel of samples containing Lyme IgG. NYMC assayed 111 samples in triplicate and one sample in duplicate. There were six discrepancies. MDL had three technicians assay 90 samples each. There were four discrepancies.

The studies were acceptable for this type assay.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Not applicable

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

A study to confirm the analytical specificity of the assay was performed using normal blood bank donor samples. Samples were collected from endemic and non-endemic regions and tested on the Bio-Rad Platelia™ Lyme assays. Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (MDL) tested 100 samples from Nevada, Oregon, and Louisiana; all considered non-endemic areas. New York Medical College (NYMC) tested 83 samples from the northeastern United States, considered an endemic area. NYMC found a prevalence of $1 . 2 \%$ for $\mathrm { I g G }$ . MDL found no IgG positive samples. The results are summarized below.

Cross-reactivity: The cross-reactivity studies for the Platelia™ Lyme IgG Assay were done by testing a panel of sixteen disease conditions including syphilis, $H .$ pylori, viral infections (EBV, HSV, Rubella, Toxoplasmosis, Measles, Mumps, VZV, HIV, CMV), and inflammatory syndromes (CRP, SLE, HAMA, RF, ANA). One specimen (syphilis) out of a total of 161 samples tested from the cross-reaction panel was positive.

(1) Equivocal samples considered as positive (2) One sample not tested due to insufficient sample volume

# b. Matrix comparison:

Serum and plasma correlation studies were performed at Bio-Rad. Serum and plasma samples collected from a given individual were tested in parallel. Since it was impossible to obtain Lyme positive serum and plasma samples, negative samples were supplemented with high positive Lyme IgG sample in order to obtain various concentration levels. Plasma versus serum comparisons were performed with a panel of 25 samples (12 negative and 13 positive or equivocal samples). See table below for a distribution of percent difference of different types of plasma versus serum.

A large variation has been observed on negative plasma compared to negative sera but without a change in results interpretation. However, the variation within the positive or equivocal samples is small and did not change the results interpretation.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Sensitivity: A retrospective study to confirm the sensitivity of the assay was conducted at NYMC. All retrospective patient samples were from their Lyme culture studies; all were culture positive and all were seen by one of the infectious disease physicians or a nurse practitioner who specializes in Lyme disease. Skin biopsied from leading edge of the Lyme rash and/or $9 \mathrm { m l }$ plasma was cultured. Tissue was ground in a micro tissue grinder with incomplete BSK media, and a 0.3 to $0 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$ aliquot of that was cultured in $6 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of modified complete BSK media. Plasma cultures were $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of plasma to 60 mL of modified BSK. All positive cultures were confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing. The samples were run on the Bio-Rad Platelia™ Lyme IgG assay. A summary of the data is provided below.

<table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Positive</td><td>Equivocal</td><td>Negative</td><td>Total</td><td>% Sensitivity(1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Platelia™ Lyme IgG</td><td>Early Stage</td><td>55</td><td>16</td><td>49</td><td>120</td><td>59.2% (71/120)</td></tr><tr><td>Disseminated Stage</td><td>18</td><td>2</td><td>13</td><td>33</td><td>60.6% (20/33)</td></tr><tr><td>Late Stage</td><td>13</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>13</td><td>100.0% 13/13)</td></tr><tr><td>All Stages</td><td>86</td><td>18</td><td>62</td><td>166</td><td>62.7% (104/166)</td></tr></table>
