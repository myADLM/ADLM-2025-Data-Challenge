# Device Description:

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel) is a panel of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ) probes which may be used in real-time RT-PCR assays using the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument for the in vitro qualitative detcction and characterization of human influenza viruses (RNA) in respiratory specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). Detection of viral RNA not only aids in the diagnosis of illness caused by seasonal and novel influenza viruses in patients with ILI, but also provides

# Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel 510(k) 080570

epidemiologic information on influenza and aids in the presumptive laboratory identification of specific novel influenza A viruses.

# Assay Principle:

The rRT-PCR Flu Panel assay is based on real-time RT-PCR technology which is used in many molecular diagnostic assays to date. The rRT-PCR Flu Panel influenza A and B primer and probe sets are designed for universal detection of type A and type B influenza viruses. Influenza A subtyping primer and probe sets are designed to specifically detect contemporary A/H1, A/H3, and A/H5 (Asian lineage) influenza viruses in humans.

The rRT-PCR Flu Panel also includes internal positive control materials. The human RNase P (RP) primer and probe set detects human RP and is used with human clinical specimens to indicate that adequate isolation of nucleic acid resulted from the extraction of the clinical specimen. A positive result in the RP assay indicates adequate specimen was present, ensures that common reagents and equipment are functioning properly, and demonstrates the absence of inhibitory substances. A Human Specimen Control (HSC) is a noninfectious cultured human cell material that demonstrates successful recovery of RNA as well as extraction reagent integrity. The Seasonal Influenza Virus Control (SIVC) consists of three different influenza viruses representing influenza A/H1, A/H3, and influenza B viruses and cultured human cells. The SIVC demonstrates that the master mix and primer and probe sets for influenza A (InfA), influenza B (InfB), influenza A/H1 (H1), influenza A/H3 (H3), and RP are functioning properly. The Influenza Virus A/H5N1 Positive Control (H5VC) consists of a genetically modified reassortant human influenza virus (Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 x PR/8/34) (BSL2 category) and cultured human cells. The H5VC demonstrates that the master mix and primer and probe sets for InfA, influenza A/H5 (H5a, H5b), and RP are functioning properly. All controls (HSC, SIVC, and H5VC) are inactivated using betapropiolactone and are noninfectious.

# Intended Use:

The Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel) is intended for use in Real-time RT-PCR assays on an ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

for qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B in symptomatic patients from viral RNA in nasopharyngeal and/or nasal swab specimens, for determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A virus, as seasonal A/H1 or A/H3, if present, from viral RNA in nasopharyngeal and/or nasal swab specimens, for presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. to provide epidemiologic information for surveillance for influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A/H3 and $A / / H 1$ were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

Testing with the influenza I15a and H15b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspcct A/H5 spccimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional

# Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel 510(k) 080570

laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting diagnostic results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a CDC instructor or designee prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed training provided by CDC instructors or designees.

# Device comparison:

The rRT-PCR Flu Panel is substantially equivalent to the Prodesse Multiplex RT-PCR $\mathrm { P r o F l u ^ { + } } ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ Assay because it utilizes real-time PCR technology to detect influenza A and influenza B in human respiratory specimens. The rRT-PCR Flu Panel further detects and differentiates influenza A/H1 and A/H3 subtypes. The rRT-PCR Flu Panel is substantially equivalent to the influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Virus Real-time RT-PCR Primer and Probe Set because it utilizes real-time PCR technology to detect influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage). Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Virus Real-time RT-PCR Primers and Probe Set and the Prodesse Multiplex RT-PCR ProFlu $\mathbf { \nabla } + \mathbf { T M }$ Assay have been granted marketing clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following 510(k) submissions. Based on clinical and analytical data, the rRT-PCR Flu Panel device has been determined to be as safe and effective and peforms as well as legally marketed devices described below. The device has demonstrated clinical utility and supports the label claims.

# Performance characteristics:

# 1. Analytical Specificity - Inclusivity & Reactivity

Thc rRT-PCR Flu Panel analytical specificity was demonstrated by inclusivity and reactivity testing. The inclusivity tcsting utilized ten (10) influenza virus strains of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B at low virus concentrations at or near the limit of detection $( 1 0 ^ { 2 } \ : \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L } )$ to demonstrate the flexibility of the primer and probe sets to detect multiple strains of influenza virus. Thcre were 24 influenza A/H5N1 clinical samples tested retrospectively from diverse geographic locations from suspect positive cases received at CDC. The rRTPCR Flu Panel analytical specificity indicated $100 \%$ concordance with expected results for all primer and probe scts included in the device. This testing demonstrated that the primer and probe sets are highly specific for detecting and differentiating influenza viruscs A/H 1, A/I I3, A/H5 and influenza B as defined previously.

# 2. Analytical Specificity - Reactivity with Common Non-Influenza Respiratory Viral and Bacterial Pathogens

Analytical spccificity (cross-reactivity) was evaluated by testing each primer/probe set within the devicc panel with nucleic acids extracted from 27 organisms (9 viruscs, 17 bacteria, and 1

# Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel 510(k) 080570

yeast) representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in specimens collected from the nasopharynx region. All organisms tested in this study were propagated, titered, and characterized to confirm identity prior to testing. The identily of the commensal respiratory bactcria was confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA bi-directional sequencing. Commensal respiratory bacteria titers wcre determined at the CDC by standard practices. The identity of the non-influenza respiratory viruses was confirmed by bi-directional sequencing. Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations greater than or equal to106 cfu/ml with the exception of Mycobacterium tuberculosis where DNA was extracted from pure culture and quantitated by spectrophotometry (0.25 ng/ul). Non-influenza respiratory viruses were tested at concentrations greater than 106 TCID5o/ml with the exception of human parainfluenza type 2 (1031l TCID50/ml due to difficulty gencrating a high titer virus stock in culture). Total RNA was extracted from viral cultures of Coronaviruses CoV 229E and CoV OC43 and concentrations werc determined by spectrophotometry (31.6 ng/µl and E $5 0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / \mu l } }$ , respectively).

Each sample (bacteria and virus) was extracted in parallel using both the Qiagen QlAamp" Viral RNA Mini Kit and the Qiagen RNeasy® Mini Kit. Each RNA sample was tested following the testing procedure previously described for the rRT-PCR Flu Panel and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The dual extraction method was performed to demonstrate cross method equivalency and ensure no cross reactivity with the influenza primer and probe sets since negative results were expected for all samples.

# 3. Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection

Analytical sensitivity was demonstrated by determining the limit of detection (LoD) of each primer and probe set in the rRT-PCR Flu Panel. Ten-fold serial dilutions of two different influenza virus strains of each subtype wcre tested to identify an end-point for detection of each primer and probe set included in the rRT-PCR Flu Panel. RNA was extracted from each of the characterized viruses with the Qiagcn QIAamp® Viral RNA Purification kit. The LoD for each primer and probe set (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, H5a, and H5b) was calculated to determine the lowest detectable concentration range of influenza virus $\mathrm { ( E I D _ { 5 0 } / m L ) }$ at which $\ge 9 5 \%$ of all replicates tested positive. The lowest concentration of influenza virus detected

# Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel 510(k) 080570

was determined to be the end-point concentration where the type and subtype primer and probe sets had uniform detection. If the two end-points differed in concentration, the higher (or limiting) point was used.

# 4. Clinical Performance

Performance characteristics of the rRT-PCR Flu Panel were established during a prospectivc study at 4 U.S. statc public health laboratories during the 2006-2007 respiratory virus season (February-April). Samples used for this study were nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected for routine influenza testing at each site.

The reference method was rapid culture (shcll vial) followcd by direct fluorescent antibody screening and identification. Specimens tested at the public health testing sites followed routine diagnostic influenza rapid culture protocols and the rRT-PCR Flu Panel protocol to demonstrate performance and agreement.

A total of 415 total specimens were collected and tested at the 4 public health laboratory testing sites during the 2006-2007 influenza season for this prospective clinical study. Four hundred thirty-nine specimen results (415 prospectivc seasonal and 24 retrospective A/H5 influenza samples) from nasal, nasopharyngeal swabs, or cultured specimens in the case of influenza A/H5 samples were confirmed by gold standard virus culture testing. Influenza A/H5 and discrepant prospectivc seasonal influenza samples were further analyzed by bidirectional sequencing.

A formal clinical evaluation of human and/or avian influenza A/H5N1 virus was not accomplished during the CDC Clinical Evaluation Study due to the abscnce of suspcct cases within the United States. Therefore, performance specificity and detection capability of thc H5a and H5b primer and probe sets in the rRT-PCR Flu Panel could not bc evaluated at the U.S. state public health laboratorics during the clinical study. Retrospective data from twentyfour (24) suspect A/H5N1 positive specimens from human cases reccived by the CDC Influenza Division were used to demonstrate clinical performance of the H5a and H5b components of the panel.
