# 2.6 Background on Chlamydial and Gonorrheal Disease

Chlamydia are non-motile, Gram-negative, obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells. They form inclusions in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Chlamydia trachomatis, one o tree chlamydial specis, is the causative agent othe sexually transmitted disease (STD) chlamydia. Chlamydial infcctions of thc urogenital tract arc associated with salpingitis, ectopic pregnancies and tubal factor infertility in women as well as nongonococcal urethritis and epididymitis in men.'- The genital site most commonly affected in womcn is thc ccrvix, but the infection can be asymptomatic and, if untreated, is likely to ascend to the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovarics causing pelvic inflamaory disease (PID).' Neonates born of infected mothers can contract inclusion conjunctivitis, nasopharyngeal infections, and pneumonia due to Chlamydia trachomatis.° Infection by Chlamydia trachomatis in men is also often asymptomatic and, if untreated, may lead to epididymitis, a major complication. Patients infected with Chlamydia trachomatis may be co-infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, thc causative agent of gonorrhea. Further, patients with treatment indications for gonorrhea but not chlamydia often harbor Chlamydia trachomatis." Chlamydia infections may not respond well to recommended regimens for treating Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Therefore, unless chlamydial infection has beu  l e chlamydial infections is recommended.'

Cell culture, commonly used to detect Chlamydia trachomatis, has been replaced by more sensitive nucleic acid tests." Since a spccific diagnosis of chlamydia may improve treatment compliance and cnhance partner notification, the use of these highly sensitive and spccific tests is strongly recommended.7

Gonorrhea is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. Over 700,000 new infections of Neisseria gonorrhoeue are estimated to occur each year." In men, gonorrhea infection usually results in acute anterior urethritis accompanic by a purulent exudate. In women, the infection is most often found in the cervi, but the vagina and uterus also may be infected. Frequently the infcction is asymptomatic, espcially in women. Without treatment, local complications of gonococcal infection can occur including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or acute salpingitis for women and epmiaryt occal iecton G untreated patients."3

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococcus without flagellae."Culture is commonly used for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhea is based on the morphological examination, Gram stain, and oxidase measurement of thc culture isolate. Confirmation proccdures have been used for definitive identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae including sugar fermentation, fluorescent antibody staining, nucleic acid hybridization, and agglutination.Nucleic acid tests are widely available for the sensitive detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.'

# Summary of Nonclinical Studies

# Analytical Sensitivity

The analytical sensitivity of thc Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was determined by testing dilutions of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) target DNA and Neisseria ·gonorrhoeae (NG) target DNA. Testing was performed with three lots of amplification reagents on three $\pmb { m } 2 0 0 0$ Systems. Probit analysis of the data determined that thc concentration of CT DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 39 copies/assay $9 5 \%$ CI 33 - 51), and the concentration of NG DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 192 copies/assay $( 9 5 \%$ CI 176-220).

The limit of detection (LOD) claim for the RealTime CT/NG assay is 320 copies of CT target DNA and 320 copies of NG target DNA per assay. The limit of detection (LOD) is defined as the CT and NG DNA concentration detected with a probability of $9 5 \%$ or greater.

The CT/NG assay targets the Chlamydia cryptic plasmid (prcsent at approximately 7 to 10 copies per Chlamydia organism) and the multicopy opacity gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (repeated up to 1 1 times per organism). Thus, 320 copics of target DNA translatcs to approximately 30 to 40 organisms per assay.

The claimed LOD for the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was confirmed by testing a sample containing 320 copies of CT targct DNA and 320 copies of NG target DNA per assay. The detection rate was $100 \%$ (403/403) for both CT and NG in thc assay.

A study was conducted to challenge the performance of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay in samples containing high target numbers of either CT or NG in the presence of low target numbers of the opposite analyte. The detection rate of 320 copies of CT DNA in the presence of high NG target was $100 \%$ (400/400). The detection rate of 320 copies of NG DNA in the presence of high CT targct was $9 8 . 5 \%$ (398/404).

The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A through L was determined by testing dilutions of each serovar.

Serovars A through K, L1, and L2 were detected at less than 1 Inclusion Forming Units (IFU) per assay and scrovar L3 was detectcd at less than 3 IFU/assay.

The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting 28 different isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was determined by testing dilutions of cach isolate. All isolates were detected at less than | Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/assay.

# Evaluation of Potential Cross-Reactants

A total of 1 1 1 strains of bacteria, viruses, parasites, yeast, and fungi were tested for potential cross reactivity in thc Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay (Table 2.5). These included organisms that are phylogenctically related to CT and NG, and those that can be found in the urogcnital tract. Purified DNA or RNA was diluled to a final concentration of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ copies/assay. HBV DNA and HCV RNA were added directly into the PCR reaction at approximately $3 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ and $9 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ copies per reaction, respectively. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

A total of 32 culture isolates were tested for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime assay. Thesc included 27 organisms listed in Table 7.5, and Neisseria cinerea. Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria sicca, Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16, and Hela cells containing HPV 18. Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16 and Hela cells containing HPV 18 wcre tested at $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells per assay, C. pneumoniae and C. psittaci were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ EB per assay, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ genomes per assay, and the rest of the organisms were tcsted at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ Colony Forming Units (CFU) per assay. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

# 2.10 Summary of Clinical Studies

Performance charactcristics of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay were established in a multi-center clinical study conducted in the United States. Specimens werc prospectively collected from subjects at 16 geographically diverse sites that included physician private practices, public and private STD clinics, and a hospital cmergency room. A total of 3,832 malc and female, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjccts were enrolled. Study subjects were classified as symptomatic if the subject reported STD-related symptoms. Specimens collected from cach female subject included urine, endocervical swabs, selfcollected vaginal swab, and clinician-collected vaginal swabs. Specimens collected from each male subject included urine and urethral swabs. Specimen testing methods included the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay, two commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for CT and NG, and culture for NG. The NAATs and thc NG culturc were used as reference assays in the clinical study.

For females, self-collected vaginal swab and urine specimens were collected first, followed by endocervical swab for culturc. Remaining swab specimen collection was randomized to minimize bias. For males, urethral swab for culture was collected first. Remaining swab specimcn collection was randomized to minimize bias. Urine specimen was collected after thc swab specimens.

For each subject, a patient infectcd status was determined based on the combined results from the refercnce assays. A female subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positivc results (at least one from each reference NAAT) were rcported. A male subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positive results were reportcd. If the reference NG culture assay result was positive, the subject was categorized as infected regardless of NAAT results.

A female subject was categorized as not infected with CT or NG if at least one of the reference NAATs reported negative results for all sample types. A male subject was categorized as not infected with CT or NG if a total of at least two negative results were reported by the referencc NAATs.

If patient infectcd status could not be determined due to missing and/or indeterminate results from the reference assays, the subject was excluded from the analysis. Patient infected status could not be determincd for 33 subjects for CT and 35 subjects for NG.
