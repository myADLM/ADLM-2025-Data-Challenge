# Analytical Sensitivity

The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was determined by testing dilutions of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) target DNA and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) target DNA. Testing was performed with three lots of amplification reagents on three $m 2 0 0 0$ Systems. Probit analysis of the data determined that the concentration of CT DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 39 copies/assay $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } 3 3 - 5 1 )$ , and the concentration of NG DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 192 copies/assay ( $9 5 \%$ CI 176-220).

The limit of detection (LoD) claim for the RealTime CT/NG assay is 320 copies of CT target DNA and 320 copies of NG target DNA per assay. The limit of detection (LoD) is defined as the CT and NG DNA concentration detected with a probability of $9 5 \%$ or greater.

The CT/NG assay targets the Chlamydia cryptic plasmid (present at approximately 7 to 10 copies per Chlamydia organism) and the multicopy opacity gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (repeated up to 11 times per organism). Thus, 320 copies of target DNA translates to approximately 30 to 40 organisms per assay.

The claimed LOD for the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was confirmed by testing a ample containing 320 copies of CT target DNA and 320 copies of NG target DNA per assay. The detection rate was $100 \%$ (403/403) for both CT and NG in the assay. A study was conducted to challenge the performance of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay in samples containing high target numbers of either CT or NG in the presence of low target numbers of the opposite analyte. The detection rate of 320 copies of CT DNA in the presence of high NG target was $100 \%$ (400/400). The detection rate of 320 copies of NG DNA in the presence of high CT target was $9 8 . 5 \%$ (398/404).

The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A through L was determined by testing dilutions of each serovar.

Serovars A through K, L1, and L2 were detected at less than 1 Inclusion Forming Units (IFU) per assay and serovar L3 was detected at less than 3 IFU/assay.

The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting 28 different isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was determined by testing dilutions of each isolate. All isolates were detected at less than 1 Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/assay.

# Evaluation of Potential Cross-Reactants

A total of 111 strains of bacteria, viruses, parasites, yeast, and fungi were tested for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay (table below). These included organisms that are phylogenetically related to CT and NG, and those that can be found in the urogenital tract. Purified DNA or RNA was diluted to a final concentration of $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ copies/assay. HBV DNA and HCV RNA were added directly into the PCR reaction at approximately $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ and $9 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ copies per reaction, respectively. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

A total of 32 culture isolates were tested for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime assay. These included 27 organisms listed in table below, and Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria sicca, Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16, and Hela cells containing HPV 18. Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16 and Hela cells containing HPV 18 were tested at $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells per assay, $C .$ . pneumoniae and $C .$ . psittaci were tested at $\bar { 1 } 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { E B }$ per assay, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were tested at ${ 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ genomes per assay, and the rest of the organisms were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ Colony Forming Units (CFU) per assay. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

# Precision Study

A precision study was performed at three sites, two external and one internal. Each site was provided with a nine-member panel that was prepared targeting different combinations of CT and NG concentrations. The targeted concentration for CT ranged from 0 to 4,500 IFU/assay and for NG from 0 to 2,000 CFU/assay. Five replicates of each panel member were tested in each run. Thirty runs (10 per site) were performed for a total of 150 replicates of each panel member. The study included three amplification reagent lots. Each site tested two amplification reagent lots. A variance components analysis for a

nested model was performed on delta cycle (DC) values, and the results are summarized in tables below.

# Summary of Clinical Studies

Performance characteristics of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay were established in a multi-center clinical study conducted in the United States. Specimens were prospectively collected from subjects at 16 geographically diverse sites that included physician private practices, public and private STD clinics, and a hospital emergency room. A total of 3,832 male and female, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects were enrolled. Study subjects were classified as symptomatic if the subject reported STD-related symptoms.

Specimens collected from each female subject included urine, endocervical swabs, selfcollected vaginal swab, and clinician-collected vaginal swabs. Specimens collected from each male subject included urine and urethral swabs. Specimen testing methods included the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay, two commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for CT and NG, and culture for NG. The NAATs and the NG culture were used as reference assays in the clinical study.

For females, self-collected vaginal swab and urine specimens were collected first, followed by endocervical swab for culture. Remaining swab specimen collection was randomized to minimize bias. For males, urethral swab for culture was collected first. Remaining swab specimen collection was randomized to minimize bias. Urine specimen was collected after the swab specimens.

For each subject, a patient infected status was determined based on the combined results from the reference assays. A female subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positive results (at least one from each reference NAAT) were reported. A male subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positive results were reported. If the reference NG culture assay result was positive, the subject was categorized as infected regardless of NAAT results.

A female subject was categorized as not infected with CT or NG if at least one of the If patient infected status could not be determined due to missing and/or indeterminate results from the reference assays, the subject was excluded from the analysis. Patient infected status could not be determined for 33 subjects for CT and 35 subjects for NG.
