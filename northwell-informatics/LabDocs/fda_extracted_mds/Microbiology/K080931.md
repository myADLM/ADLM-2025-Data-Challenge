C.Predicate Device Name Trade Name:

VIDAS® C. difficile Toxin A & B (CDAB) assay [K072138]

D. Device Description VIDAS® C. difficile Toxin A & B (CDAB) assay is an automated test for use on the VIDAS instruments for the qualitative detection of Clostridium difficile toxin A and toxin B in stool specimens using the ELFA technique (Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay).

The assay principle combines a two-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR), a pipette tip-like device, serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. The assay reagents are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips (STRs). The individual kit components are described in detail on the following pages.

Each of the four reaction steps are performed automatically by the VIDAS instrument. The reaction medium (sample/conjugate mixture) is cyded in and out of the SPR several times. Each step is followed by a wash cycle which eliminates unbound components.

Step 1: Toxin A and/or toxin B present in the sample binds with the anti-toxin A antibodies (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-toxin B antibodies (mouse monoclonal) coated on the interior wall of the SPR.

Step 2: Binding between toxin A and anti-toxin A antibodies (mouse monoclonal) conjugated with biotin. Binding between toxin B and anti-toxin B antibodies (mouse monoclonal) conjugated with biotin.

Step 3: The presence of biotin is detected by incubation with streptavidin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase.

Step 4: Two detection steps are performed successively Alkaline phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the quantity of toxin A and/or toxin B present in the sample.

At the end of the VIDAS CDAB assay, results are automatically calculated by the VIDAS instrument. A test value as well as the qualitative result (positive, negative or equivocal) are provided on the result sheet for each sample.

# E. Intended Use

VIDAS@ C. difficile Toxin A & B (CDAB) assay is an automated test for use on the VIDAS instruments for the qualitative detection of Clostridium difficile toxin A and toxin B in stool specimens using the ELFA technique (Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay). The VIDAS C. difficile toxin A & toxin B (CDAB) assay is an aid for diagnosing Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD).

Dear Ms. Mapp:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
