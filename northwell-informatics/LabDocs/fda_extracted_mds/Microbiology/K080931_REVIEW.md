1. “Review criteria for devices assisting in the diagnosis of C. difficile associated diseases” ODE guidance 5/31/1990

2. “Protocols for determination of limits of detection and limits of quantitation.” Approved guideline CLSI EP 17-A, Vol. 24, No. 34

# L. Test Principle:

The assay principle combines a two-step immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The SPR, a pipette tip-like device serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Assay reagents are ready to use and pre dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. Each of four reaction steps is

performed automatically by the VIDAS. The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. Each step is followed by a wash cycle which eliminates unbound components. Step 1: Toxin A and/or B present in the sample binds with the anti-toxin A & B antibodies coated on the interior wall of the SPR. Step 2: Binding occurs between toxins and antibodies conjugated with biotin. Step 3: Presence of biotin is detected by incubation with streptavidin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Step 4: Two detection steps are performed successively. Alkaline phosphatase catalyzes hydrolysis of the substrate into a fluorescent product. Fluorescence is measured at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Results are automatically calculated by the VIDAS. Test values as well as the qualitative result (positive, negative or equivocal) are provided on the result sheet for each sample.

d. Detection limit:

The detection limit for Toxin A is $\geq 7 . 7 3 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ and for Toxin $\mathrm { B } \geq 4 . 5 5 \mathrm { n g / m l }$

e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity and interference studies were performed in the original submission. No changes were made from the predicate device. An additional interference study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference of antidiarrhea as well as therapeutic drugs. No interference was observed with vancomycin at $5 \mathrm { m g / m l }$ ; metronidazole at $2 \mathrm { m g / m l }$ ; Pepto-Bismol and Imodium liquid and tablets as well as their active ingredients Loperamide, bismuth subsalicylate and salicylate.

The assay cut off is as follows:

Test value $< 0 . 1 3$ is a negative result; test value ${ \ge } 0 . 1 3$ to $< 0 . 3 7$ is equivocal and test value ${ \ge } 0 . 3 7$ is a positive result. The test value is equal to the patient relative fluorescence value/ standard relative fluorescence value.

2. Comparison studies:

# N. Instrument Name:

The VIDAS PC and the miniVIDAS

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The VIDAS PC instrument cleared in 1989 under K891385 is attached to a computer and a printer. Each instrument has 5 independent sections allowing 5 different assays to be run simultaneously. Each section can process up to six samples. When fully loaded it can process 30 samples. The miniVIDAS is a smaller compact version of the VIDAS PC and was cleared under K923579 in 1993. It has a built in computer, keyboard and printer and is popular in POL’s. Two independent sections each accept six tests so twelve samples can be processed simultaneously. The VIDAS assay can be run on either instrument.

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes _ or No X

3. Specimen Identification:

All assay steps are controlled automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells. The CDAB strip consists of ten wells covered with labeled foil seal. The label comprises a bar code which indicates the assay code, kit lot number and expiration date.

# 4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The solid phase receptor (SPR) serves as both the solid phase and the pipetting device. The foil of the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ well is perforated to allow introduction of the sample into well 1. The last well (well 10) of each strip is a cuvette in which the fluorometric reading is performed. The center wells of the strip contain the various reagents required for the assay.

# 5. Calibration:

The kit contains a standard S1. It is a dilution of recombinant toxin A from C. difficile in TRIS buffered saline and BSA $5 \%$ and preservatives. It also contains 3 controls. C1 is positive control Toxin A, C2 is the negative control and C3 is positive control Toxin B.

# 6. Quality Control:

The Master curve is established at time of manufacture for each lot of reagents. It is provided with each test kit and is entered into the VIDAS instrument using the Master Lot Entry card (MLE) included in the kit. Data from the MLE card is entered once for each lot of reagents. Each lab establishes its own calibration curve (recalibration) based on the mathematical master curve data and the test results of two calibrators tested in duplicate by the lab. Recalibration serves to control for minor variations in assay signal from one VIDAS instrument to another and is therefore specific for each instrument.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

For the VIDAS CDAB assay, validation tests were performed on both the miniVIDAS and VIDAS PC instruments and no anomalies were detected. Defined acceptance criteria were met as a result of the validation studies demonstrating conformance and satisfactory performance with the miniVIDAS instrument.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The information submitted in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
