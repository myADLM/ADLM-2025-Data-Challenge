# 510(k) Summary:

MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci.

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility tcst that have been diluted in broth and dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical intcrcst. Panels are rchydrated with water after inoculation with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non- $\mathrm { . C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 16-20 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is read by determining the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.

The proposed MicroScan Dricd Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel with the Cefoxitin Screen demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI cefoxitin disk diffusion test and mecA PCR, as defined in the FDA document "Class Ⅱ Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susccptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA", dated March 5, 2007, and "Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff—Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests", dated March 13, 2007. The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of the MicroScan Dricd Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Pancl with the Cefoxitin Screen.

The external design validation (Clinical Trial) was conducted with fresh and stock Efficacy isolates and stock Challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the acceptability of the proposed Dried Gram-Positive Pancl by comparing its performance with results of the CLSI cefoxitin disk diffusion test and mecA PCR. Challenge strains were compared to Expected Results determined prior to the evaluation.

The Cefoxitin Screen demonstrated acceptable performance with an overall Catcgorical Agrecment of $9 7 . 8 \%$ when compared with the CLSI ccfoxitin disk diffusion test, and $9 8 . 7 \%$ when compared to mecA PCR. Overall sensitivity was $9 8 . 6 \%$ and specificity was $9 6 . 9 \%$ compared to cefoxitin disk diffusion results. Overall sensitivity was $9 9 . 7 \%$ and specificity was $9 7 . 7 \%$ compared to mecA PCR results.

Inoculum and instrument reproducibility testing demonstrated acceptable reproducibility and precision with the Cefoxitin Screen, regardless of which inoculum method (i.e., Turbidity and PromptTM), or instrument (autoSCAN- $\mathcal { A } ^ { \mathfrak { N } }$ and WalkAway®) was used.

Quality Control testing demonstrated acceptable results for the Cefoxitin Screen Well (CfxS), cefoxitin at a concentration of $4 \mathrm { m c g / m l }$ .

Re: k081013 Trade/Device Name: MicroScan® Dried Gram - Positive MIC/Combo Panels with Cefoxitin Screen (4 mcg/ml) Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.1640 Regulation Name: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: LRG Dated: August 25, 2008 Received: August 28, 2008

Dear Ms Warriner:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at 240-276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Offce of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events (Medical DeviceReporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems at 240-276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http:/www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): K081013

Device Name: MicroScan Dricd Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels with the Cefoxitin Screen (4 mcg/ml)

Indications For Usc:

The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 16  24 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } C + / - 1 ^ { \circ } C$ in a non$\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator, and read either visually or with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the Package Insert.

The MicroScan Cefoxitin Screen is intended to determine the susceptibility of staphylococci to the penicillinase-stable beta-lactams.

This particular submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial test the Cefoxitin Screen, at a concentration of $4 \mathrm { m i c g / m l } ,$ , to the test panel.

The gram-positive organisms which may be used for Cefoxitin Screen susceptibility testing in this panel are:

Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus lugdunensis
