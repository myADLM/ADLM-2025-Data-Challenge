# Device description:

The IVD Research, Inc. Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit is an immunochromatographic assay for the detection of Giardia lamblia antigen in human fecal samples. The test uses sample wicking to capture Giardia antigen on a discrete test line containing antibodies specific for Giardia antigen. A specimen is added to a dilution tube and mixed with a buffer solution. The mixture is dispensed into the sample well of the device which resolubilizes the Giardia specific mouse monoclonal antibody that has been conjugated to colored microparticles. This solution wicks along a membrane containing capture antibodies bound to the membrane at the Test and Control lines. The Giardia immune complex, if present, reacts with anti-Giardia antibody at the Test line. Unbound conjugate not captured at the test line is captured at the Control line containing anti-mouse antibody. If Giardia antigens are present in the fecal sample, two pink-topurple bands (one at the Sample line and one at the Control line) will appear in the test window. If no Giardia antigen is present, or if the level of antigen is below the detection limit of the assay, only one pink-to-purple band at the Control line will appear in the test window. For the test to be valid, a pink-to-purple band must always appear at the Control line position of the device test window regardless of whether the sample is positive or negative. This Control line indicates that the test is working properly.

# Intended use:

The IVD Research, Inc. Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit is a qualitative immunoassay for the detection of Giardia antigens in preserved and unpreserved human fecal specimens. This test is indicated as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of suspected Giardia infections.

# Comparison with the predicate device:

The technological characteristics of the IVD Research Inc. Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit are compared with the XpectTM Giardia Lateral Flow Assay (K03 1942) in the table below. This comparison demonstrates the substantial equivalence of this device to the predicate device. The devices are similar in intended use, assay technology and materials used to construct the test strip, and both devices use the same Giardia specific monoclonal antibodies for the conjugate. Both devices have similar clinical performance. Differences between the two devices in the sample size and materials used in the membrane are minimal.

# Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing was performed at three sites (one internal; two external) using a masked panel of ten samples of varying reactivity tested over three days along with positive and negative contols. All samples tested for Giardia produced the expected result, as summarized in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">No. Positive</td><td colspan="3">Total results</td><td rowspan="2">Percent Reproducibility</td></tr><tr><td>No. Negative</td><td>Number</td><td>Number</td></tr><tr><td>Number of tests</td><td>samples tested</td><td>samples tested</td><td>Expected</td><td>Obtained</td><td>Obtained</td></tr><tr><td>(sites x test occasions)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>6</td><td></td><td>54</td><td>54</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>36</td><td>36</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

# Analytical Sensitivity:

Analytical sensitivity was determined by diluting cultured Giardia lamblia (WB strain) in negative human stool and testing across an antigen concentration range of $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { \mathfrak { n } g / m L }$ to $8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Test results determined the limit of detection for the device to be $2 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ .

Analytical Specificity/cross-reactivity/interfering substances:

No cross-reactivity was observed using samples containing the following organisms: Entamoeba hartmanni, Endolimax nana, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Entamoeba coli, Blastocystis hominis, Dientamoeba fragilis, Chilomastix mesnili, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium, Ascaris lumbricoides, Enterobius vermicularis, Diphyllobothrium species, Hymenolepis nana, Clonorchis sinensis, Enteromonas hominis, Trichuris trichiura, Iodamoeba buetschlii, Schistosoma mansoni, rotavirus, Taenia eggs, Fasciola eggs, Isospora belli, adenovirus, rotavirus and twenty-two (22) bacterial species (Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, E. coli 43887, Campylobacter coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter fetus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter braakii, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonneii, Shigella dysenteria, E. hermanii, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella hadar, Salmonella infantis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterococcus fecalis, Helicobacter cinaedi). Additionally, six common microorganisms (Campylobacter coli, E. coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella flexneri, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enetrocolitica) spiked into preserved positive and negative fecal specimens did not affect the test result.

Human feces samples positive and negative for Giardia antigen were spiked with blood, mucin, or Imodium® prior to testing with the Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit. Testing indicated that none of these substances interfered with the test.

# Specimen stability:

Assay performance in preserved specimen types claimed in the labeling was verified during assay development using specimens from an internal QC bank as follows: fifteen positive samples preserved in either 10% formalin or sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin (SAF) with a maximum age of 7 years; twenty-three $10 \%$ formalin/SAF negative samples (maximum age 18 months); three fresh-frozen, un-preserved samples (2 positive; 1 negative) approximately 10 years old which had undergone numerous freeze/thaw cycles; and eleven fresh negative samples that had undergone three freeze/thaw cycles. All samples gave the expected result when tested according to the assay procedure.

# Unpreserved Fecal Specimens

Assay performance in unpreserved specimens was verified using a total of 42 unpreserved samples fecal samples that were positive or negative for antigens of Giardia lamblia as determined by a non-lateral flow methodology (Giardia lamblia Antigen Detection Microwell ELISA, IVD Research, Inc.). Fifteen of these samples tested positive in the ELISA test and 27 tested negative in the ELISA. All 15 of the positive samples and 20 of the negative samples were part of IVD Research's frozen sample bank and are stored at $- 1 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ or lower.

The results summarized below demonstrate that the IVD Research Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit produces acceptable test results when samples are unpreserved.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ELISA +</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ELISA-</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LF +</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LF -</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>27</td></tr></table>

Sensitivity: $100 \%$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 7 8 . 2 \%$ to $100 \%$ Specificity: $100 \%$ EY $9 5 \% \% \mathrm { C I } = 8 7 . 2 \%$ to $100 \%$ .

# Specimen collection/preparation/stability:

Fresh, unpreserved stool samples should be stored at $2 ^ { \circ } C - 8 ^ { \circ } C$ and tested within 24 hours of collection. Samples that cannot be tested within this time should be frozen at $- 1 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ to - $2 5 \%$ until use.

Stool specimens preserved in $1 0 \%$ formalin or SAF may be kept at room temperature $( 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \cdot 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and tested within 18 months of collection.

Do not freeze preserved specimens.

Do not concentrate stool specimens. The assay will not give accurate results on a concentrated sample.

# Clinical performance:

The performance of the Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit was determined in retrospective studies using well-characterized, archived samples. Performance relative to patients' clinical status has not been established.

# 1. Sensitivity and Specificity Compared to Microscopy or Direct Immunofluorescence Assay

Clinical performance was evaluated using a total of 210 human fecal specimens collected in $10 \%$ formalin or SAF and submitted to an independent laboratory for testing with the Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit. The following results were obtained.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ref+</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ref-</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LF +</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>106</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LF-</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>97</td></tr></table>

Sensitivity: $9 7 . 2 \%$ (106/109) $9 5 \% \% \% \% = 9 2 . 2 \%$ to $9 9 . 4 \%$ Specificity: $9 6 \%$ (97/101) $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 9 0 . 2 \%$ to $9 8 . 9 \%$

Four "negative" specimens gave a false positive result when tested with the Giardia LF test. These samples were re-tested using a direct immunofluorescence assay and shown to be positive.

# 2. Percent Agreement vs. Predicate Device

The Percent Agreement of the IVD Research, Inc. Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit versus the predicate device was as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Remel Xpect*</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Remel Xpect*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LF +</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>48</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LF-</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>61</td></tr></table>

Positive Agreement 98% (48/49) Negative Agreement 100% (61/61)

The results of the bench and clinical performance testing demonstrate that the IVD Research Inc., Giardia Fecal Antigen Detection Lateral Flow Kit is substantially equivalent in performance to the predicate device and to microscopic examination for the detection of Giardia in human fecal specimens.
