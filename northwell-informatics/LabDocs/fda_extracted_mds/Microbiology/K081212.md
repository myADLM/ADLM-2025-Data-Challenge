# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of nosocomial and life threatening infections which have been associated with significantly higher rates of mortality and morbidity.

The Bio-Rad MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic culture medium for the qualitative detection of MRSA from anterior nares specimens. Results can be interpreted after 18 - 28 hours incubation.

# Bio-Rad MRSASelect Culture Media 510(k) Submission

# INTENDED USE:

MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the qualitative detection of nasal colonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in healthcare settings. The test can be performed on anterior nares specimens from patients and healthcare workers to screen for MRSA colonization. MRSASelect is not intended to diagnose MRSA infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of infection. Results can be interpreted after 18 - 28 hours incubation.

# SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY:

MRSASelect is a selective medium for the detection and direct identification of MRSA. The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antibiotic/antifungal mixture and an optimized salt concentration and that inhibits the growth of yeast and the majority of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria with the exception of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Identification is based on the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate by a specific enzymatic activity of Staphylococcus aureus leading to a strong pink coloration of the Staphylococcus aureus colonies.

Within 18  28 hours incubation time methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus produce small pink colonies on MRSASelect. Coagulase negative methicillin-resistant staphylococci that do not metabolize the chromogenic substrate appear as colorless or white colonies (possibly light pink). Methicillin sensitive staphylococci (MSS) are inhibited.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

Performance of MRSASelect Extended Incubation was evaluated at two geographically diverse hospitals with fresh anterior nares surveillance specimens. A total of 200 surveillance samples were evaluated. MRSA on routine culture was defined as isolation of Staphylococci on Trypticase Soy Agar with $5 \%$ blood, with identification confirmed by coagulase and Oxacillin susceptibility using E-Test. MRSASelect plates were incubated at $3 5 - 3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ at ambient conditions. Plates were read after 18, 20, 24, 28 hours incubation. No difference in performance was noted at the defined incubation times.

# Summary Performance Data

A total of 200 samples were tested at two sites against routine culture (blood agar plate, coagulase and susceptibility), and MRSASelect. MRSASelect plates were read and results read at 18, 20, 24 and 28 hours incubation.

# STATEMENT OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY:

200 nasal swabs (surveillance samples) were tested on MRSASelect and routine culture (Trypticase Soy Agar w $1 5 \%$ blood, coagulase and susceptibility). Performance of MRSASelect was noted after 18, 20, 24 and 28 hours incubation, comparing results to culture

Dear Ms. White:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
