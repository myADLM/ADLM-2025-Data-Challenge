# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Plate Lyme IgM Assay is a qualtativ assay or he etectin  uan IgM ants to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum or plasma.

# INTENDED USE

The Platelia" Lyme IgM Assay is a qualitative test intended for use in the presumptive detection of human IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum or plasma. The EIA system should be used to test serum or plasma from patients with a history and symptoms of infection with B. burgdorferi. All positive and equivocal specimens should be re-tested with a specific, second-tier test such as Western blot. Positive second-tier results are supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi. The diagnosis of Lyme disease should be made based on history and symptoms (such as erythema migrans), and other laboratory data, in addition to the presence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Negative results (either first or second-tier) should not be used to exclude Lyme disease.

# SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY

The Platelia™M Lyme IgM Assay is an enzyme immunoassay with capture of the IgM on the solid phase. Anti-human µ-chains antibodies are coated on the solid phase (wells of the microplate). A mixture of the Borrelia B31 antigen and the monoclonal anti-Borrelia antigen antibody labeled with peroxidase is used as the conjugate.

# PERFORMANCE DATA

Bio-Rad confirms that any/all data provided in this submission may be released upon request.

# Intra-Assay Precision

To confirm the intra assay precision of the Platelia™ Lyme assay two studies were run.

O Three samples close to the cut off value were tested 20 times during the same run, according to the assessed kit's protocol.   
0 Various samples spanning the assay range were tested 30 times during the same run, according to the assessed kit's protocol.

Samples close to the grey zone (20x)

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): K081362

Device Name: Platelia™" Lyme IgM

Indications for Use:

The Platelia™ Lyme IgM Assay is a qualitative test intended for use in the presumptive detection of human IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum or plasma ( $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ EDTA, sodium heparin, or sodium citrate). The EIA test system should be used to test serum or plasma from patients with a history and symptoms of infection with $B$ burgdorferi. All positive and equivocal specimens should be re-tested with a specific, second-tier test such as Western blot. Positive second-tier results are supportive evidence of infection with $B _ { \cdot }$ burgdorferi. The diagnosis of Lyme disease should be made based on history and symptoms (such as erythema migrans), and other laboratory data, in addition to the presence of antibodies to $B$ burgdorferi. Negative results (either first or second-tier) should not be used to exclude Lyme disease.
