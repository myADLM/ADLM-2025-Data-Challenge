Light DiagnosticsTM HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit Immunofluorescence Assay Herpes simplex virus (21 CFR 866.3305, Product Code GQL)

# Intended Use

The Light DiagnosticsTM HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection and identification of herpes simplex virus type 1 and/or type 2 in direct specimens from patients with vesicular lesions and symptoms consistent with herpes infection and for culture confirmation by immunofluorescence. Negative results do not preclude an infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Specimens found negative on direct specimen detection should be confirmed by culture.

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

# Predicate Device

1)Cell Culture (used to detect the absence of the HSV 1 and/or HSV 2)

Note: MRC-5 and HNF Cell Lines were used to assist clinicians in determining if the patient specimens were infected with HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 by cytopathic effect (CPE) observation. Culture grown from cells inlated with patint specimens uses the presence or absence oPE in the cells t identi the presence absence of HSV in the originating patient specimen.

# Device Description

Light Diagnostics™M HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit is a qualitative test that uses specific typing reagents and FITC filter fluorescence microscope to detect and differentiate herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 in direct specimens from symptomatic patients with lesions and in specimens amplified by cell culture. The kit consists of HSV-1 Typing Reagent vial, HSV-2 Typing Reagent vial, two HSV Control Slides, Phosphate-Buffered Saline packet; Tween 20/Sodium Azide Solution (100X) vial, and Mounting Fluid vial. The kit utilizes specific reagents for the detection and identification of HSV-1 and HSV-2, therefore two cell spots on slides of specimens are required to identify the type of HSV. The HSV-1 Typing Reagent consists of two fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies specific for HSV-1 glycoprotein C and ICP35 respectively. The HSV-2 Typing Reagent consists of two fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind HSV-2 polypeptides. In Western blots these appear as two major bands with molecular weights of between $1 1 0 { - } 1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { k D }$ and between $7 8 { - } 8 2 \ \mathrm { k D }$ and are consistent with the monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes within glycoprotein G of HSV-2. The typing reagents will bind to HSV-1 or HSV-2 infected cells fixed on microscope slides specifically. Separate cell spots on slides should be prepared for use with each reagent. Unbound reagent is removed by rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Illumination with ultraviolet light allows visualization of the antigen-antibody complexes by fluorescence microscopy. HSV-infected cells will exhibit apple-green fluorescence with the specific reagent while cells stain a dull red due to the presence of Evans blue in the typing reagents. The controls contained in this kit are acetone fixed slides with one well containing HSV-1 infected cells, one well containing HSV-2 infected cells, and one well containing uninfected cells to verify functioning of reagents, culture methodology and functioning of the microscope.

# Technological Comparison of Methods

# Comparison with Culture:

The performance characteristics of Light DiagnosticsTM HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit will be established by direct evaluation of clinical specimens and smear made from culture specimens using the predicate device.

An FDA cleared direct immunofluorescence test for HSV-1 and HSV-2 was used in the study to confirm with the direct specimens testing, amplified culture material, and HSV typing. The reference device is a direct immunofluorescence test intended for the detection and identification of HSV-1 and HSV-2 following amplification in cell culture or by direct examination of clinical specimens prepared by cytospin. Specimens found to be negative on direct specimen examination was tested by cell culture.

\*Protein A, produced by certain bacteria, will bind the Fc portion of the monoclonal antibodies used in the Light DiagnosticsTM HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit HSV-1 and HSV-2 reagents. Staining, however, can be differentiated by size and morphology. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus, a Protein A producer, will result in small $( 0 . 8 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ fluorescent spheres.

# Clinical Evaluation:

Specimens were collected from three sites from symptomatic patients with lesions. The comparison studies were performed using Light DiagnosticsTM HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit on direct specimens and the predicate device on specimens that grew on culture. The comparison studies were also performed using both kits on specimens that grew on culture.

The results are summarized below.

A total of 454 specimens collected from 3 clinical sites were included in this study, 258 samples were from the Eastern region of the United States and 196 from the Southeastern region of the US. The specimens include fresh vesicular fluid from herpetic lesions collected from patients with lesions and exhibiting symptoms of HSV 1 or HSV 2 infections.

Clinical samples were submitted to each laboratory in viral transport media. Cells were washed in PBS, dropped onto slides, and fixed in acetone. Slides were stained with the Light DiagnosticsTM HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit reagents, and another HSV typing reagent for reference, and examined using fluorescence microscopy. All specimens were placed in MRC-5 and/or HNF standard tubes for cell culture. Slides from positive cultures were stained with the Light DiagnosticsTM HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit reagents, and reference HSV typing reagent and examined using fluorescence microscopy.

Sixteen specimens were excluded from HSV-1 direct specimen analysis and 18 specimens were excluded from HSV-2 direct specimen analysis, because of insufficient numbers of cells on the direct specimen slides. The results of the remaining direct specimen slides were compared to the results of culture isolation.

Culture results were not recorded for three specimens. Analysis was performed on the remaining specimens.

Compared to culture, direct specimen testing using the Light Diagnostics™M HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit had a sensitivity of $84 \%$ (87/104) $( 9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval of $7 5 { - } 9 0 \%$ ) and specificity of $9 9 \%$ (331/334) $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval of $9 7 \%$ to $9 9 \%$ )for the detection of HSV-1; and a sensitivity of $85 \%$ (57/67) $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval of $7 5 . 9 2 \%$ and specificity of $9 9 \%$ (367/369)) $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval of $9 8 \%$ to $9 9 \%$ for the detection of HSV-2. Refer to Table 1 and Table 2.

Data from all clinical sites was combined and summarized below.

# Conclusions Drawn from Evaluation:

Light Diagnostics™M HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit uses a standard direct immunofluorescence assay procedure for the detection of HSV type 1 and type 2 in patient specimens and in cell culture. The monoclonal antibodies used in the reagent have been characterized to ensure specificity and reliability of the product. In clinical evaluations, the performance characteristics of the reagents were shown to be substantially equivalent to cell culture and the predicate reagent.

The characterization and clinical evaluation of the Light Diagnostics™M HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of this product when used as intended as described in the product insert.

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number (fknown): K081527

Device Name: Light DiagnosticsTM HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit

Indication for Use:

The Light Diagnostics™ HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detectin and identification of herpes simplex virus type 1 and/or type 2 in direct specimens from patients with vesicular lesions and symptoms consistent with herpes infection and for culture confirmation by immunofluorescence. Negative results do not preclude an infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Specimens found negative on direct specimen detection should be confirmed by culture.
