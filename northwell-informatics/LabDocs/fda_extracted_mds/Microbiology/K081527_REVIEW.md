2. Classification: Class II (Special controls)

3. Product code: GQL: Antisera, fluorescent, herpesvirus hominis 1,2

4. Panel: Microbiology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Light Diagnostics™ HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection and identification of herpes simplex virus type 1 and/or type 2 in direct specimens from patients with vesicular lesions and symptoms consistent with herpes infection and for culture confirmation by immunofluorescence. Negative results do not preclude an infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Specimens found negative on direct specimen detection should be confirmed by culture.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements:

Fluorescence microscope with 100 watt mercury or halogen lamp, appropriate filter combination for FITC (excitation peak $= 4 9 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ , emission peak $= 5 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ), 100x, 200x and $4 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification (dry objective)

# I. Device Description:

HSV1 Typing reagent consists of two fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies specific for HSV 1 glycoprotein C and ICP35 respectively. HSV 2 Typing Reagent consists of two fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind HSV 2 polypeptides. In Western blots these appear as two major bands with molecular weights of between $1 1 0 { - } 1 2 0 \mathrm { k D }$ and between $7 8 \mathrm { - } 8 2 \mathrm { k D }$ and are consistent with the monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes within glycoprotein G of HSV 2.

# L. Test Principle:

Light Diagnostics™ HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit utilizes specific reagents for the detection and identification of HSV 1 and HSV 2. The HSV 1 Typing Reagent consists of two fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies specific for HSV 1 glycoprotein C and ICP35 respectively. HSV 2 Typing Reagent consists of two fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind HSV 2 polypeptides. In Western blots these appear as two major bands with molecular weights of between $1 1 0 { - } 1 2 0 \mathrm { k D }$ and between $7 8 \mathrm { - } 8 2 \mathrm { k D }$ and are consistent with the monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes within glycoprotein G of HSV 2. The typing reagents will bind to HSV 1 or HSV 2 infected cells fixed on microscope slides specifically. Separate cell spots on slides should be prepared for use with each reagent. Unbound reagent is removed by rinsing with

phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Illumination with ultraviolet light allows visualization of the antigen-antibody complexes by fluorescence microscopy. HSV-infected cells will exhibit apple-green fluorescence with the specific reagent while cells stain a dull red due to the presence of Evans blue in the typing reagents.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection for each reagent was tested with five (ten-fold) dilutions made from viral seed stocks. Positive results were obtained using HSV-1 reagent on HSV-1 infected cells down to $8 0 \mathrm { P F U / m l }$ of inoculum. Positive results were obtained using HSV-2 reagent on HSV-2 infected cells down to $1 4 0 \mathrm { P F U / m l }$ of inoculum. In these tests the limit of detection was defined as the lowest concentration at which $2 9 5 \%$ of replicates are positive

# e. Analytical specificity:

The analytical specificity of the HSV 1 and HSV 2 Typing Reagents has been examined on slides prepared from reference strains as well as previously typed clinical isolates after cell culture at $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } - 8 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ cells/mL. The HSV 1 and HSV 2 Typing Reagents were tested using the same formulation as the

reagents included in this kit and did not show any cross-reactivity. The Typing Reagents have been tested on slides prepared from a wide range of other viruses, bacteria, and cell lines. Depending on the particular organism, concentrations between $\geq 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { c e l l s } / \mathrm { m L }$ were tested and showed no crossreactivity.

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 454 specimens collected from 3 clinical sites were included in this study, 258 samples were from the Eastern region of the United States and 196 from the Southeastern region of the US. The specimens include fresh vesicular fluid from herpetic lesions collected from patients with lesions and exhibiting symptoms of HSV 1 or HSV 2 infections.

Clinical samples were submitted to each laboratory in viral transport media. Cells were washed in PBS, dropped onto slides, and fixed in acetone. Slides were stained with the Light Diagnostics™ HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit reagents, and another HSV typing reagent for reference, and examined using fluorescence microscopy. All specimens were placed in MRC-5 and/or HNF standard tubes for cell culture. Slides from positive cultures were stained with the Light Diagnostics™ HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit reagents, and reference HSV typing reagent and examined using fluorescence microscopy.

Sixteen specimens were excluded from HSV-1 direct specimen analysis and 18 specimens were excluded from HSV-2 direct specimen analysis, because of insufficient numbers of cells on the direct specimen slides. The results of the remaining direct specimen slides were compared to the results of culture isolation.

Culture results were not recorded for three specimens. Analysis was performed on the remaining specimens.

Data from all clinical sites was combined and summarized below.
