2. Classification: Class I

3. Product code: GNW

4. Panel: Microbiology (83)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit, is intended for the qualitative detection and identification of influenza A, while screening for influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 viral antigens, in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates or in cell culture. The assay detects viral antigens by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.

It is recommended that specimens found to be negative after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A virus detection and identification were established when influenza A H3N2 and influenza A H1N1 were the predominant influenza A strains circulating in the United States. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to a state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Fluorescence microscope with the correct filter combination for FITC (excitation peak $= 4 9 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , emission peak $= 5 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ) and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE), magnification 200 to 400X

# I. Device Description:

The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit, uses a blend of viral antigen-specific murine MAbs. MAbs for influenza A virus are directly labeled with R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) for the rapid detection and identification of influenza A virus. MAbs for influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 are directly labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), for rapid detection of these agents.

Kit components:

• D3 Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent - Rphycoerythrin-labeled murine MAbs directed against influenza A virus and a mixture of fluorescein-labeled murine MAbs directed against influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution also contains Evans Blue as a counter-stain and $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide as preservative.   
• Normal Mouse Gamma Globulin DFA Reagent - a mixture of fluorescein labeled murine gamma globulin that has been shown to be non-reactive with any of the listed respiratory viruses.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A

# L. Test Principle:

The test kit uses viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly labeled with either fluorescein or R-phycoerythrin for rapid detection of respiratory viruses and identification of Influenza A. The cells to be tested, derived from a clinical specimen or cell culture, are placed onto a glass slide, allowed to air dry, and fixed in acetone. After addition of the ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent and incubation at $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ the stained cells are washed with the diluted wash solution, a drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added and a coverslip is placed on the prepared cells. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope. The influenza A virus infected cells will fluoresce golden-yellow, while cells infected with any of the other six viruses will fluoresce apple-green. Uninfected cells will contain no fluorescence but will be stained red by the Evans Blue counterstain. If only golden-yellow fluorescent cells are present the specimen can be reported as positive for influenza A antigen. If only apple-green fluorescent cells are present, the particular virus may be identified using an FDA approved assay such as the individual reagents from the ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra™ DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra) on new, separate cell preparations. If both golden-yellow and applegreen are present, the additional virus may be identified using an FDA approved assay such as the individual reagents from the $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra on new, separate cell preparations.

It is recommended that results for specimens found to contain no fluorescent cells after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture.

# Interpretation of results:

It is recommended that controls be examined first to ensure proper test performance before examination of the specimens. The entire cell spot or monolayer of cells should be examined before reporting final results. Patient sample results should not be reported unless controls perform as expected.

Uninfected cells will fluoresce dull red due to the Evans Blue counter-stain included in the DFA Reagent.

Fluorescent staining pattern of respiratory virus infected cells:

Influenza A: A positive reaction is one in which golden-yellow fluorescence is observed in the cytoplasm, nucleus or in both. Cytoplasmic staining is often punctate with large inclusions while nuclear staining is uniformly bright. Other respiratory viruses: Green fluorescence observed in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus is suggestive of infection with a respiratory virus other than influenza A virus. The staining patterns described below are for reference only; identification of the viral antigens present in the apple-green fluorescent cells must be performed using another FDA cleared device:

a) Influenza B virus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic, nuclear or both. Cytoplasmic staining is often punctate with large inclusions while nuclear staining is uniformly bright.   
b) Respiratory syncytial virus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate with small inclusions in the syncytia.   
c) Adenovirus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate or bright nuclear or both.   
d) Parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and

punctate with irregular inclusions. Types 2 and 3 cause the formation of syncytia.

Co-infection with influenza A virus and other viruses has been reported in a number of studies. The presence of multiple viruses is indicated when a stained slide well exhibits both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells.

Results from direct specimen testing: The quality of the specimen with respect to the number of epithelial cells in the sample can be assessed by examining the different fields at a magnification of 200X. A satisfactory specimen should have at least 2 columnar epithelial cells per field. A negative result is indicated by the absence of fluorescence in a minimal sampling of 20 columnar epithelial cells. An inadequate sample is indicated by fewer than 20 columnar epithelial cells present in the sample, in which case the test is considered invalid. A new specimen should be obtained and tested or cell culture of the remaining specimen should be initiated.

A satisfactory specimen with no fluorescent cells observed should be reported as “No influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza type 1, parainfluenza type 2, or parainfluenza type 3 viral antigens detected by direct specimen testing”.

If golden-yellow fluorescent cells are found, it should be reported as “influenza A viral antigens detected by direct specimen testing.”

If only apple-green fluorescent cells are found, the identification of the virus(es), other than influenza A may be based on the follow-up assay (e.g. ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA Kit). In such cases, identification and reporting of the apple-green fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s instructions.

If co-infection of influenza A virus and one of the other respiratory viruses is detected (exhibited by both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells present) the identification of the virus(es), other than influenza A, may be based on the follow-up assay, such as ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA Kit (not provided). In such cases, it should be reported as “Influenza A viral and identification and reporting of the apple-green fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s instructions. Results from Culture Isolation / Confirmation: The entire cell spot or monolayer of cells must be examined for virus-infected, fluorescent cells. If no fluorescent cells are found, the results of testing of the specimen should be reported as, “No Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3 isolated by cell culture.”

If golden-yellow fluorescent cells are found, it should be reported as “influenza A virus isolated in cell culture”.

If only apple-green fluorescing cells are found, the identification of the virus(es), other than influenza A may be based on the follow-up assay (such as D3 Ultra DFA Kit). In such cases, identification and reporting of the apple-green fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s instructions.

4. If co-infection of influenza A virus and one of the other respiratory viruses is detected (exhibited by both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells present) the identification of the virus(es), other than influenza A, may be based on the followup assay, such as D3 Ultra DFA Kit (not provided). In such cases, it should be reported as “Influenza A viral and identification and reporting of the apple-green

fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s instructions.”

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were assessed with a panel of proficiency-level antigen control slides. The panel consisted of slides spotted with cell preparations of the following:

2. Mid level influenza A (Victoria strain)

3. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain) mixed with Mid level RSV (Washington strain)

4. Mid level influenza A (Victoria strain) mixed with Low level RSV (Washington strain)

5. Low level respiratory virus (either influenza virus B {Taiwan strain}, adenovirus type 1, Parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, or 3 (strains C35, Greer, C243 respectively). This panel member was rotated during the 5-days of testing so that each virus is tested twice.

6. Negative – no infected cells present

The low level is estimated to contain between 4 to $10 \%$ infected cells per cell spot. The mid level is estimated to contain between 20 to $2 5 \%$ infected cells per cell spot. Both levels were below the level used in quality control slides. Each panel member was re-coded daily to prevent its identification. Each panel was stained twice per day for 5-days by three different laboratories.

The following results were recorded for both the control slide and the panel slide:

1. Presence or absence of Yellow-gold fluorescence.   
2. Percent of cells exhibiting Yellow-gold fluorescence   
3. Presence or absence of Green fluorescence   
4. Percent of cells exhibiting Green fluorescence

The combined data for negative specimens – no infected cells present - from the three sites demonstrates that the R-PE labeled and FITC labeled MAbs reproducibly do not stain uninfected cells. No fluorescent cells were seen in $100 \%$ (60/60) of the wells lacking infected cells.

The combined data from the three sites demonstrates reproducible detection of influenza A virus by the R-PE labeled MAbs. The presence of influenza A virus infected cells was reported in $9 5 . 3 \%$ (143/150) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected:

The combined data from all three sites demonstrates that the presence of R-PE in the stain reproducibly does not interfere with the FITC staining of other viruses. The presence of influenza B virus infected cells was reported in $100 \%$ (36/36) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected. The presence of adenovirus infected cells was reported in $100 \%$ (36/36) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected.

# Cross-Reactivity Testing

The $\overline { { \mathrm { D } ^ { 3 } } }$ Duet Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit was tested for cross-reactivity against a variety of cells and microorganisms. Stringent conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using a high concentration of the ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent and relatively high titers of microorganisms. The ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent was prepared at 1.5X the concentration that is provided in the kit. No cross-reactivity was observed for 32 virus strains or for 17 host culture cell types. Twenty-five bacterial strains, one yeast, three Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan were evaluated for crossreactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence.

Thirty-two virus strains were tested for cross-reactivity. Depending on the particular virus, 71 to $1 { , } 4 0 0 \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ were inoculated into shell vial culture and incubated for 24 to 48 hours, to yield a $1 +$ to $^ { 3 + }$ infection, processed and stained with the 1.5X DFA Reagent according to the procedure as detailed in the PI. No cross reactivity was observed for the viruses listed below:

Thirty microorganisms, including 25 bacterial and one yeast cultures, three Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan commercially available slides, were stained with the 1.5X DFA Reagent according to the procedure as detailed in the product insert, then examined for cross reactivity. Except for Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent, all other microorganisms tested

negative. Reactivity with Staphylococcus aureus is more than likely due to binding the protein A produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Concentrations for each bacterial organism cultured by DHI for cross reactivity testing were determined from suspensions of the bacteria in PBS by spectrophotometer according to McFarland standards of levels 1.0 and 2.0 (equaling approximately $3 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ and $6 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU per mL). Slides were prepared with spots of $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { - m L }$ of the suspensions to give either $3 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ or $6 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ per spot. At the same time, $1 { \mathrm { - m L } }$ of each suspension was plated on an appropriate agar dish for colony confirmation. According to the confirmation agar cultures, initial concentrations of the bacterial organisms in the study ranged from $6 . 4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ to $2 . 9 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Direct fresh specimens:

A study was performed prospectively at three sites with 1203 fresh specimens that were received for respiratory virus testing. Each specimen was evaluated by the ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit and a cleared DSFA device for the presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2 and parainfluenza 3 in cells derived from clinical specimens. A total of nineteen specimens were excluded from analysis due to a site deviations, duplicate specimen, insufficient cell numbers, or high background. These exclusions left 1184 specimen results for analysis.

A study was performed prospectively at three sites with 1184 fresh specimens that were received for respiratory virus testing. Each specimen was evaluated for the presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2 and parainfluenza 3 in cells derived from clinical specimens. Prevalence of the respiratory viruses within this population during the 2006/2007 season is noted in the table below:
