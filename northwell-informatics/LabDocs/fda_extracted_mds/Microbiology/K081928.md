K061101, $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit

Intended Use: The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit, is intended for the qualitative detection and identification of respiratory syncytial virus, while screening for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 viral antigens, in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates or in cell culture. The assay detects viral antigens by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection

It is recommended that specimens found to be negative after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A virus detection and identification were established when influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1) were the predominant influenza A strains circulating in the United States. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to a state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens

# Device Description:

The MAbs furnished with the $\mathbf { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit $( \mathrm { D } ^ { 3 } D u e t )$ are the same MAbs that are contained in the Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. (DHI) device ${ \mathrm { D } } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit $\mathrm { ( \bar { D } ^ { 3 } }$ Ultra) [510(k) number K061101, November 20, 2006].

The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit, uses a blend of viral antigen-specific murine MAbs. MAbs for RSV are directly labeled with R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) for the rapid detection and identification of RSV. MAbs for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 are directly labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), for rapid detection of these agents.

# Kit components:

D3 Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent - R-phycoerythrin-labeled murine MAbs directed against influenza A virus and a mixture of fluoresceinlabeled murine MAbs directed against influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution also contains Evans Blue as a counter-stain and $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide as preservative. Normal Mouse Gamma Globulin DFA Reagent - a mixture of fluorescein labeled murine gamma globulin that has been shown to be non-reactive with any of the listed respiratory viruses. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution contains Evans Blue as a counter-stain and $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide as preservative. Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slides  five individually packaged control slides containing wells with cell culture-derived positive and negative control cells. Each positive well is identified with the virus infected cells present, i.e., influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3. The negative well contains uninfected cultured cells. Each slide is intended to be stained only one time.

Wash Solution Concentrate - a 40X concentrate consisting of Tween 20 and $4 \%$ sodium azide ( $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide after dilution in de-mineralized water) in a 40X phosphate buffered saline solution.

Mounting Fluid - an aqueous, buffered, stabilized solution of glycerol and $0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide.

The cells to be tested, derived from a clinical specimen or cell culture, are placed onto a glass slide and allowed to air dry. The cells are fixed in acetone. The $D ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent is added to thc cells which are then incubated for 15 to 30 minutes at $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a humidified chamber or humidified incubator. The stained cells are then washed with the diluted wash solution, a drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added and a coverslip is placed on the prepared cells. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope. The respiratory syncytial virus infected cells will fluoresce golden-yellow, while cells infected with any of the other six viruses will fluoresce apple-green. Uninfected cells will contain no fluorescence but will be stained red by the Evans Blue counter-stain. If only goldenyellow fluorescent cells are present the specimen can be reported as positive for respiratory syncytial virus antigen. If only apple-green fluorescent cells are present, the particular virus is identified using the individual reagents from the $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ UltraTM DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit $( \mathrm { D } ^ { 3 } ~ U l t r a )$ on new, separate cell preparations. If both golden-yellow and apple-green are present, the additional virus may be identified using the individual reagents from the $\mathbf { \dot { D } } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra on new, separate cell preparations.

# Technological Characteristics:

The DHI device, $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 } ~ D u e t$ , has been compared directly to the DHI device, $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { D ^ { 3 } } }$ Ultra, as the legally marketed device. The technology used in both devices is based on a standard immunofluorescence assay technique utilizing either phycoerythrin- or fluorescein-labeled MAbs. A summary is provided in Table 5.1 below:

# Non-Clinical Performance:

Staining patterns of the phycoerythrin-labeled respiratory syncytial virus MAbs on respiratory syncytial virus infected cells were similar to those of the Predicate device

# Precision/Reproducibility:

Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were assessed with a panel of proficiency-level antigen control slides. The panel consisted of slides spotted with cell preparations of the following:

1. Low level RSV (Washington strain)   
2Mid level RSV (Washington strain)   
3. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain) mixed with Mid level RSV (Washington strain)   
4. Mid level influenza A (Victoria strain) mixed with Low level RSV (Washington strain)   
5. Low level respiratory virus (either influenza virus B {Taiwan strain}, adenovirus type 1, Parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, or 3 (strains C35, Grcer, C243 respectively). This panel member was rotated during the 5-days of testing so that each virus is tested twice.

6. Negative  no infected cells present

The low level is estimated to contain between 4 to $10 \%$ infected cells per cell spot. The mid level is estimated to contain between 20 to $2 5 \%$ infected cells per cell spot. Both levels were below the levcl uscd in quality control slides. Each pancl member was re-coded daily to prevent its identification. Each panel was stained twice per day for 5-days by three different laboratories.

The following results were recorded for both the control slide and the panel slide:

1. Presence or absence of Yellow-gold fluorescence.   
2. Percent of cells exhibiting Yellow-gold fluorescence   
3. Presence or absence of Green fluorescence   
4. Percent of cells exhibiting Green fluorescence   
The combined data for negative specimens  no infected cells present - from the three sites demonstrates that the R-PE labeled and FITC labcled MAbs   
reproducibly do not stain uninfected cells. No fluorescent cells were seen in $100 \%$ (60/60) of the wells lacking infected cells.   
The combined data from the thrce sites demonstrates reproducible detection of respiratory syncytial virus by the R-PE labeled MAbs. The presence of   
respiratory syncytial virus infected cells was reported in $9 8 \%$ (147/150) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected:

The combined data demonstrates that the presence of R-PE fluorescent cells does not interfere with the detection of influenza A virus by the FITC labeled MAbs in a reproducible manner. The presence of influenza A virus infected cells was reported in 94.7% (54/57) of the wells in which the R-PE stained infected cells were present:

The combined data from all three sites demonstrates that the presence of R-PE in the stain reproducibly does not interfere with the FITC staining of other viruses. The presence of influenza B virus infected cells was reported in $100 \%$ (36/36) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected. The presence of adenovirus infected cells was reported in $100 \%$ (36/36) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected. The presence of parainfluenza virus type 1 virus infected cells was reported in $100 \%$ (36/36) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected. The presence of parainfluenza virus type 2 virus infected cells was reported in $100 \%$ (36/36) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected. The presence of parainfluenza virus type 3 virus infected cells was reported in $100 \%$ (36/36) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected.

The reproducibility study data demonstrates that the presence of R-PE in the stain reproducibly does not interfere with the detection of the 5 respiratory viruses by their respective FITC labeled MAbs.

# Detection limit:

Results for analytical detection limit for the seven viruses detected by the $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet were reported in numbers of fluorescent cells per cell monolayer. Each master stock virus preparation was diluted in a ten-fold manner. Four wells of a 96-well cell culture plate were inoculated with each dilution. The plates were centrifuged at $7 0 0 \mathrm { x g }$ for 60 minutes, and then incubated at $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24-hours. Four wells from each dilution were stained with the $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet. Each well was then examined at $2 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification and the number of fluorescent cells counted.

# Analytical specificity:

Cross-Keactivity Testing   
The $\overline { { \mathrm { D } ^ { 3 } } }$ Duet RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit was tested for cross-reactivity against a variety of cells and microorganisms. Stringent conditions for crossreactivity testing were achieved by using a high concentration of the $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent and relatively high titers of microorganisms. The D3 Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent was prepared at $1 . 5 \mathrm { X }$ the concentration that is provided in the kit. No cross-reactivity was observed for 32 virus strains or for 17 host culture cell types. Twenty-five bacterial strains, one yeast, three Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan were evaluated for cross-reactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-Aproducing bacterium. Staining of $S .$ aureus appeared as small points of   
fluorescence.

Thirty-two virus strains were tested for cross reactivity. Depending on the particular virus, 71 to 1,400 TCID50 were inoculated into shell vial culture and incubated for 24 to 48 hours, to yield a 1+ to 3+ infection, processed and stained with the 1.5X DFA Reagent according to the procedure as detailed in this product insert. No cross reactivity was observed for the viruses listed below:

Thirty microorganisms, including 25 bacterial and one yeast cultures, three Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan commercially available slides, were stained with the 1.5X DFA Reagent according to the procedure as detailed in the product insert, then examined for cross reactivity. Except for Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent, all other microorganisms tested negative. Reactivity with Staphylococcus aureus is more than likely due to binding the protein A produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Concentrations for each bacterial organism cultured by DHI for cross reactivity testing were determined from suspensions of the bacteria in PBS by spectrophotometer according to McFarland standards of levels 1.0 and 2.0 (equaling approximately $3 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ and $6 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU per mL). Slides were prepared with spots of 0.01-mL of the suspensions to give either 3.0 x 10\* or 6.0 x 104 per spot. At the same time, 1-mL of each suspension was plated on an appropriate agar dish for colony confirmation. According to the confirmation agar cultures, initial concentrations of the bacterial organisms in the study ranged from $6 . 4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ to $2 . 9 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU.

# Clinical Performance:

# Direct fresh specimens:

A study was performed prospectively at three sites with 1203 fresh specimens that were received for respiratory virus testing. Each specimen was evaluated by the $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit and a cleared DSFA device for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2 and parainfluenza 3 in cells derived from clinical specimens. Seventeen specimens were excluded from analysis due to a variety of reasons (site deviations, duplicate specimen, insufficient cell

numbers, or high background). These exclusions left 1187 specimen results for analysis.

The following tables detail the summary of the comparison of the D' Duet and the cleared DSFA comparator assay, combined for study sites 1, 2, and 3:

# Cultured specimens:

To evaluate the performance of this device using cultured clinical specimens, a fourth study was performed with 298 frozen specimens to compare performance of the $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit with that of the predicate for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 from cultured clinical specimens. At Study Site 4, 298 frozen specimens were processed for cell culture testing in accordance with the procedure in the Comparator product insert (same procedure for both Subject and Comparator devices) using R-Mix TooTM FreshCellsTM in 48/24-fill multi-well plates. All specimens at study site 4 were derived from nasopharyngeal specimens. The results of this study are presented below. The table below shows the age distribution for individuals studied at site 4:

510(k) Number (if known): k081928

Device Name: $D ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit

Indication for Use: The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, D3 Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit, is intended for the qualitative detection and identification of respiratory syncytial virus, while screening for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 viral antigens, in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates or in cell culture. The assay detects viral antigens by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.

It is recommended that specimens found to be negative after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A virus detection and identification were established when influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1) were the predominant influenza A strains circulating in the United States. Performance characteristics for influenza A virus detection and identification were established when influenza A H3N2 and influenza A H1N1 were the predominant influenza A strains circulating in the United States. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to a state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
