DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

INTENDED USE: The LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of total antibodies to hepatitis A (anti-HAV) in human serum and sodium heparinized plasma samples using the automated LIAlsoN® Analyzer. The assay is indicated as an aid in the laboratory diagnosis of current or previous HAV Infections in conjunction with other serological and clinical information and to determine the presence of an antibody response to HAV in vaccine recipients.

This assay is not intended for screening blood or solid or soft tissue donors. Assay performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients. The user is responsible for establishing their own assay performance characteristics in these populations.

The LIAISON® Control Anti-HAV (negative and positive) is intended for use as assayed quality control samples to monitor the performance of the LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay.

KIT DESCRIPTION: The method for qualitative determination of anti-HAV is a competitive sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) based on neutralization. The assay uses magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with IgG antibodies to HAV (mouse monoclonal), and a mouse monoclonal anti- HAV

antibody conjugate linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate).

The first incubation step consists of adding the HAV antigen to calibrators, samples or controls, during which anti-HAV present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to a fixed and limited amount of HAV, thus forming an HAV-antiHAV immune complex.

After this step the second incubation follows and it involves addition of magnetic microparticles and conjugate into the reaction module, during which the antibody conjugate and the solid-phase antibody compete with anti-HAV present in the specimen for HAV. This allows the conjugate to bind to the solid phase and to form a sandwich. If all HAV added is sequestered in an HAV-anti-HAV immune complex during the first incubation, no sandwich is formed during the second incubation. After the second incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.

Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminolantibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely indicative of anti-HAV present in calibrators, samples or controls.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

COMPARATIVE TESTING: Prospective and Retrospective studies were performed to evaluate he performance f the LIAISON® AntiHAV assay among individuals who were sent to the lab for Hepatitis A testing and those at high risk for viral hepatitis.

The prospective study consisted of 739 samples from individuals who were sent to the lab for HAV testing or at risk for viral hepatitis, 108 samples from a pediatric population and 73 individuals who participated in a vaccine study. The retrospective study consisted of 109 samples from adults with a current or previous hepatitis A infection and 42 pediatric patients with current hepatitis A infection.

# Prospective HAV Testing and At Risk Populations

Of the 739 samples in this study 500 were excess serum samples from individuals in the Northeastern U.S. sent to the laboratory for HAV testing. In this group $5 9 . 8 \%$ were female $( n = 2 9 9 )$ ranging in age from 20 - 101 yrs. and $40 . 2 \%$ were male $( n = 2 0 1 )$ ranging in age from 17 to 89. The remaining 239 samples were from individuals at risk for viral hepatitis due to lifestyle, behaviour or occupation. This group consisted of the following: homosexual males $( n = 3 8 )$ , healthcare workers $( n = 1 0 )$ , commercial sex workers $( n = 3 4 )$ , drug users $( n = 7 7 )$ , prison inmates $( n = 4 9 )$ , dialysis patients $( n = 2 5 )$ and hemophiliacs $( n = 6 )$ Of these subjects $2 9 . 7 \%$ were females $( n = 7 1 )$ ranging in age from 17 to 79, and $4 3 . 1 \%$ were males $( n = 1 0 3 )$ ranging in age from 16 to 79. The age and gender were unknown for the remaining $2 7 . 2 \%$ E $( n = 6 5 )$ .

Two samples were Equivocal by the Comparator ELISA assay after repeat testing per the Instructions for use.

The data for the combined populations are shown in Table 1.

# Vaccine study

The HAV antibody response to vaccination was evaluated with the three different vaccines currently licensed in the United States: TWINRIX® (Hepatitis A, Inactivated and Hepatitis B (recombinant)). HAVRIX® (Hepatitis A, Inactivated) both manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and VAQTA® (Hepatitis A, Inactivated) manufactured by MERCK & CO., INC.

For TWiNRIX® vaccine, 9 matched sets of pre- and post- vaccine samples were available.

For HAVRIX® vaccine, 32 matched sets of pre- and post- vaccine samples were available.

For VAQTA® vaccine, 32 matched sets of pre- and post- vaccine samples were available.

The data are shown in the table below.

# EXPECTED VALUES:

# Prevalence

The expected prevalence results of the LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay were determined in 802 apparently healthy adults from the Western and the Easterm regions of the U.S. Three hundred one (301) samples were from the Westem U.S. and 501 were samples from the Eastern U.S.

Of the Western U.S. individuals $5 3 . 8 \%$ were Females $( n = 1 6 2 )$ ranging in age from 9 to 87 and $4 6 . 2 \%$ were Males $( n = 1 3 9 )$ ranging in age from 16 to 76. The majority of the individuals were Caucasian $( 6 0 . 8 \% )$ , with other ethnic groups represented as follows: Hispanic $( 1 7 . 6 \% )$ , African Americans $( 1 5 . 3 \% )$ , Asian $( 6 . 0 \% )$ and Middle Eastern $( 0 . 3 \% )$ . In the study group from the Westem region, $2 6 . 3 \%$ of the individuals were found to be positive for anti-HAV antibodies.

Of the Eastern U.S. individuals $4 6 . 5 \%$ were Females $( n = 2 3 3 )$ ranging in age from 17 to 83, and $5 3 . 5 \%$ were Males $( n = 2 6 8 )$ ranging in age from 17 to 82. The majority of the individuals were Caucasian $( 6 9 . 9 \% )$ , with other ethnic groups represented as follows: Hispanic $( 1 4 . 0 \% )$ , African American $( 1 2 . 1 \% )$ and Asian $( 4 . 0 \% )$ . In the study group from the Eastern region $20 \%$ of the individuals were found to be positive for Anti-HAV antibodies.

The Expected results for the Western and Eastern regions of the U.S. are presented in he tables below.

One sample from each of the regions gave an Equivocal result after repeat testing per Instructions for use.

REPRODUCIBILITY: A 5 day reproducibility/precision study was conducted at three external laboratories. The CLSI document EP15-A2 was consulted in the preparation of the testing protocol.

A coded panel comprised of 12 frozen "engineered" serum samples was prepared by DiaSorin S.p.A. and provided to the sites. The coded panel samples were prepared by spiking positive samples into negative samples to achieve high negative, low positive and high positive results. The two negative panel samples were not spiked. The LIAISON® Control Anti-HAV set was also included in the 5 day study.

The coded panel was tested at all three sites, using four replicates per run in one run per day during five operating days. The mean Index value, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ of the results were computed for each of the tested specimens for each of the sites.

# Results,

The 5 day Index results are summarized in Table 6 (combined sites). The mean Index value, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ of the results were computed for each of the tested specimens for each of the sites.

The result of the LIAISON® Anti-HAV Negative Control read above the reportable range of the assay $> > 2 . 7$ therefore, SD and $\% C V s$ were not able to be calculated and are shown as (NA).

WARNING: Assay interference due to circulating antibodies against HIV 1/2, Antinuclear autoantibodies and rheumatoid factor may occur.

POTENTIALLY INTERFERING SUBSTANCES: Twelve samples at different anti-HAV levels (2 positive, 4 borderline, 4 equivocal, 2 high negative) were prepared with and without the potentially interfering substances hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin and albumin. All samples were tested with the LIAISON® anti-HAV assay and results were compared using a paired t-test. The testing showed that the assay performance was not affected by hemolysis at ≤1000 mg/dL hemoglobin ( $2 \%$ change, $100 \%$ concordance of results with and without interferent), lipemia at $\leq 3 0 0 0 m g / d L$ triglycerides $7 \%$ change, $92 \%$ (11/12) concordance of results with and without interferent), icterus at ≤5 mg/dL bilirubin $0 \%$ change, $100 \%$ concordance of results with and without interferent) and serum albumin at ≤5 g/dL $( 3 \%$ change, $92 \%$ (11/12) concordance of results with and without interferent).

# LIAISON® Anti-HAV and LIAISON® Control Anti-HAV

Indication For Use:

The LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of total antibodies to hepatitis A (antiHAV) in human serum and sodium heparinized plasma samples using the automated LIAISON® Analyzer.

The assay is indicated as an aid in the laboratory diagnosis of current or previous HAV infections in conjunction with other serological and clinical information and to determine the presence of an antibody response to HAV in vaccine recipients.

This assay is not intended for screening blood or solid or soft tissue donors. Assay performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients. The user is responsible for establishing their own assay performance characteristics in these populations.

The LIAISON® Control Anti-HAV (negative and positive) is intended for use as assayed quality control samples to monitor the performance of the LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay.
