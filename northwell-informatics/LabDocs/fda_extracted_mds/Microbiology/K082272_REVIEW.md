# 2. Indication(s) for use:

Use of Voriconazole $1 \ \mu \mathrm { g } .$ , BBL™ Sensi-Disc™ for in vitro agar diffusion susceptibility testing is indicated when there is a need to determine the susceptibility of pathogens to Voriconazole. The concentration of $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains for Candida species listed below, as described in the FDA approved drug insert for this agent.

Active In Vitro and in Clinical Infections Against: Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis.

The following data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

Voriconazole exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ or less against most $( \geq 9 0 \% )$ isolates of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of Voriconazole in treating clinical infections due to these Candida species have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials:

Candida lusitaniae Candida guilliermondii

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements: None

# I. Device Description:

The Voriconazole $1 \mu \ g .$ , BBL™ Sensi-Disc™ Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disk utilizes $6 { \cdot } \mathrm { m m }$ disks prepared by impregnating absorbent paper with a known concentration of Voriconazole. Each Voriconazole disk is marked on both sides with the agent (VOR) and drug content (1). Voriconazole cartridges each contain 50 impregnated disks that are packed as either a single cartridge in a single box, or in a package containing ten cartridges.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI M2-A9 “Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests; Approved Standard.” CLSI M44-A “Method for Antifungal Disk Diffusion Susceptibility Testing Yeasts; Approved Guideline”. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) pharmaceutical approved package insert, developed during clinical trial studies, was used for Interpretive Criteria and Quality Control (QC) Expected Ranges. The CDRH guidance document “Review Criteria for Assessment of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Discs” published October 30, 1996.

# L. Test Principle:

BBL™ Sensi-Disc™ utilizes dried filter paper disks impregnated with known concentrations of antifungal agents that are placed onto the test medium surface. The standard method of testing is the Kirby-Bauer method. Discs containing antifungal agents are applied to the surface of Mueller Hinton Agar supplemented with $2 \%$ Glucose and $0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ Methylene Blue Dye (GMB) plates that have been inoculated with pure cultures of clinical isolates. Following incubation, the plates are examined and the zones of inhibition surrounding the discs are measured and compared with established zone size ranges for individual antifungal agents in order to determine the agent(s) most suitable for use in antimicrobial therapy. Five colonies of approximately $1 \mathrm { m m }$ in diameter from a 24 hour old culture of Candida species grown on blood agar or Sabouraud dextrose agar are transferred to $5 \mathrm { m l }$ of a suitable broth medium. The broth is incubated at $3 5 { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ }$ C for 2 to 8 hours until a light to moderate turbidity develops. The final inoculum density should be equivalent to a $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland turbidity standard. The inoculum density may also be standardized photometrically. Within 15 minutes of inoculum preparation, the Mueller-Hinton $^ +$ GMB agar plate is streaked to obtain an even inoculation. Disks are aseptically placed onto the agar surface with a disk dispenser or sterile forceps to ensure contact with the test surface. Plates are incubated, agar side up, in an ambient air incubator at $3 5 { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Examine the plates after 20-24 hours of incubation. Read at 48 hour only when insufficient growth is observed after 24 hour incubation. After incubation the media is examined, and zones of inhibition around the disks are measured and compared against recognized zone size ranges for the antimicrobial agent being tested. A disk diffusion method for testing Candida species was developed and recommended in CLSI M44 Approved Standard document.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Descriptive characteristics are sufficient for susceptibility test discs, because the drug manufacturer performed several clinical outcome studies enrolling around 595 patients, which were evaluated by CDER to grant approval of Voriconazole. These studies generated the Interpretive Criteria and QC Expected Ranges which the susceptibility tests disc manufactures use for interpretation of results also. No additional in vitro diagnostic clinical studies are therefore required.
