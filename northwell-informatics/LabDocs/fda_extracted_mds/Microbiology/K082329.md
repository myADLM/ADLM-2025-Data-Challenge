Dear Dr. Menefee:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act includ requirements for annual registration, listig o devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class ⅢI (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labcling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): K082329

Device Name: Borrelia B31 IgM ViraStripe®

Indication for Use: The Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgM ViraStripe® is an in vitro qualitative assay for the detection of IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum. It is intended for use in the testing of human serum samples which have been found positive or equivocal using an EIA or IFA test procedure for B. burgdorferi antibodies. Positive results from this line blot assay are supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi, the causative agent for Lyme disease. The Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgM ViraStripe® can be used during the acute phase (0-4 weeks of symptoms onset) of B. burgdorfer infection. Patients who are positive by IgM but not IgG should have the test repeated a few weeks ater i they rmain il they are still positive only by IgM and have been ill longer than one month, this is likely a false positive.
