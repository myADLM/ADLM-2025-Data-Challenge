# Intended Use

The C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETETM test is a rapid membrane enzyme immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase antigen and toxins A and B in a single reaction well. The test detects C. difficile antigen, glutamate dehydrogenase, as a screen for the presence of C. difficile and confirms the presence the toxigenic C. difficile by detecting toxins A and B in fecal specimens from persons suspected of having C. difficile disease. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of C. difficile disease. As with other C. difficile tests, results should be considered in conjunction with the patient history.

# Device Description

The C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETETM test uses antibodies specific for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and Toxins A and B of C. difficile. The device contains a Reaction Window with two solid lines and a dotted line of immobilized antibodies. The Antigen line $( " A . g " )$ contains antibodies against C. difficile GDH. The Toxin line ("Tox") contains antibodies against C. difficile toxins A and B. The dotted line, representing a control line $( " C ^ { " } )$ , contains anti-HRP antibodies. The Conjugate consists of antibodies to GDH, toxin A, and toxin B coupled to horseradish peroxidase. To perform the test, the fecal specimen is diluted with Diluent, and Conjugate is added to the diluted sample. The diluted sample-conjugate mixture is added to the Sample Well and the device is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. During the incubation, any GDH, toxin A or toxin B in the sample binds to the corresponding antibody-peroxidase conjugate. The antigen-antibody complexes migrate through a filter pad to a membrane where they are captured by the immobilized anti-GDH, anti-toxin A or Anti-toxin B antibody in the line. The Reaction Window is subsequently washed with Wash Buffer, followed by the addition of Substrate. After a 10-minute incubation, the "Ag" and "Tox" reaction is examined visually for the appearance of a blue line. A blue line indicates a positive test. A positive "C" reaction, indicated by a blue dotted line, confirms that sample and all reagents were added in proper sequence and volume, that reagents were active at the time of performing the assay, and that proper sample migration occurred.

Dear Mr. Pennington:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at 240-276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at 240-276-3474.
