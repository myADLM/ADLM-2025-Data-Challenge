# INTENDED USE

The Pro $\mathrm { { h M P V } + }$ Assay is a Real Time RT-PCR in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) nucleic acid isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal swab (NP) specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection. This assay targets a highly conserved region of the Nucleocapsid gene of hMPV. The detection of hMPV nucleic acid from symptomatic patients aids in the diagnosis of human respiratory hMPV infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. This test is not intended to differentiate the four genetic sub-lineages of hMPV.

Negative results do not preclude hMPV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.

# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Pro hMPV $+$ Assay enables detection human Metapneumovirus and Internal Control nucleic acid. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are collected from patients with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection using a polyester, rayon or nylon tipped swab and placed into viral transport medium.

An Internal Control (IC) is added to each sample prior to nucleic acid isolation to monitor for inhibitors present in the specimens. The isolation and purification of the nucleic acids is performed using either a MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a NucliSENS® easyMAGTM System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).

The purified nucleic acids are added to Pro hMPV $+$ Supermix along with enzymes included in the Pro hMPV+ Assay Kit. The Pro hMPV $+$ Supermix contains oligonucleotide primers and target-specific oligonucleotide probes. The primers are complementary to highly conserved regions of genetic sequences for these respiratory viruses. The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye attached to the $5 "$ -end and a quencher dye attached to the $_ { 3 }$ -end (see table below).

Reverse transcription of the RNA in the sample into complementary DNA (cDNA) and subsequent amplification of DNA is performed in a Cepheid SmartCycler ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { \mathrm { I I } }$ instrument. In this process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer extension and amplification. The P $\mathrm { r o \ h M P V { + } }$ Assay is based on Taqman chemistry, which utilizes the $5 ' - 3 '$ exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, further increasing fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification products present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each PCR cycle by the SmartCyclerII instrument.

# Clinical Performance

Performance characteristics of the Pro hMPV $+$ Assay were established during a prospective study at 4 U.S. clinical laboratories during the 2008 respiratory virus season (January - March). Specimens used in the study represented excess nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens that were prospectively collected from symptomatic individuals suspected of respiratory infection, and were submitted for routine care or analysis by each site. Demographic details for this patient population are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Gender</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Number of Subjects (Percentage ofTotal)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Female</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>617 (48.4%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Male</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>654 (51.3%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Not Determined</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4 (0.3%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Age</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤ 5 years</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>596 (46.7%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6 - 21 years</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>254 (19.9%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22 - 59 years</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>219 (17.2%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≥ 60 years</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>206 (16.2%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Not Determined</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0 (0.0%)</td></tr></table>

Performance of the Pro hMPV $+$ Assay was assessed and compared to a predetermined algorithm that used composite reference methods. The composite reference methods consisted of two independent molecular (RT-PCR) tests for two separate gene targets of hMPV followed by bidirectional genetic sequencing. The two comparator methods targeted the Nucleocapsid gene (different region of the gene than targeted by the Pro hMPV $+$ assay) and the Fusion gene. True hMPV RNA positives were considered as any sample that had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria for one or both gene targets that matched hMPV sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBIl) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). True hMPV RNA negatives were considered as any sample that was tested negative by both of the comparator methods. Nucleic acid extractions on the clinical samples were carried out using either the Roche MagNA Pure LC system or the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG during the clinical study.

A total of 1275 eligible NP swab samples were tested with the Pro hMPV $\boldsymbol { + }$ Assay at the four clinical sites and by the composite reference methods at Prodesse. Of the Pro hMPV+ Assay run on all eligible specimens, $9 8 . 1 \%$ (1273/1298) of these specimens were successful on the first attempt. The remaining 25 specimens gave "Unresolved" results on the first attempt.

Unresolved results occur when the sample is negative for both hMPV and the Internal Control, indicating potentially PCR-inhibiting samples. Of the 25 "Unresolved" specimens on the first attempt with sufficient sample for retest, $8 . 0 \%$ (2/25) gave a valid "negative" result on the second attempt. The remaining 23 samples were "Unresolved" on the second attempt, therefore, were not included in the analysis below. All 23 samples were tested negative by the composite reference methods.

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the Pro hMP $\mathrm { V } +$ Assay was evaluated at 3 laboratory sites. Reproducibility was assessed using a panel of 9 simulated samples that included medium positive, low positive (near the assay limit of detection) and "high negative" hMPV samples. Panels and controls were tested at each site by 2 operators for 5 days (9 samples and 3 controls X 2 operators X 5 days X 3 sites $= 3 6 0 \dot { }$ ). Nucleic acid extraction on the test panel samples were carried out using either the Roche MagNA Pure LC system (Clinical Trial Site #4) or the

# bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG (Site #1 and Site #2). The overall percent agreement with the expected result for the Pro $\mathrm { { h M P V } + }$ Assay was $9 9 . 2 \%$ .
