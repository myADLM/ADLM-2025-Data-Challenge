E. System Descriptions:

1. Device Description:

The DensiCHEK™ Plus instrument is designed for use with the VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ Systems to measure the optical density of a microorganism suspension. The instrument provides values in McFarland units, proportional to microorganism concentrations. It is intended for use with the VITEK and VITEK 2 Systems during the inoculum preparation phase of the identification (ID) and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) card testing process.

# 2. Principles of Operation:

The DensiCHEK™ Plus generates a McFarland value using basic colorimetry, which is a method of measurement that relates the amount of color in a transparent medium (liquid) to the amount of a particular substance in the liquid. In the general the concentration of the substance being measured is proportional to the intensity of the color of the solution. The darker the color is, the higher the concentration.

The DensiCHEK™ Plus measures the turbidity of the saline and microorganism suspension using a single wavelength, $5 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The absorption of light determines the McFarland value generated by the instrument. The more turbid the suspension is, the higher the McFarland standard measurement. The light source in the DensiCHEK™ Plus is an LED that emits a narrow range of wavelengths, and an interference filter is used between the LED and the test tube (sample) to further narrow the wavelength of $5 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . There are 2 calibration curves pre-programmed into the DensiCHEK™ Plus, one for glass tubes and one for plastic tubes. The absorbance is different for glass and plastic. The instrument is first zeroed using a test tube filled with saline (blank). A well-mixed organism suspension is placed into the instrument and the test tube is slowly rotated. The instrument will display a series of dashes followed by a McFarland reading.

A set of verification standards consisting of a 0.0 McFarland (McF), $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ , 2.0 McF, and $3 . 0 \mathrm { M c F }$ are provided with the DensiCHEK™ Plus to verify instrument measurement performance. After zeroing the instrument with the $0 . 0 \mathrm { M c F }$ standard (blank), one or all of the standards may be used to verify the accuracy of measurements before using the DensiCHEK™ Plus to prepare inoculum suspension for VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 Test cards.

3. Modes of Operation: Manual, only one test tube can be read with the DensiCHEK™ Plus at a time.
