the cfb gene sequence of the Streptococcus agalactiae chromosome. Results from the BD MAX GBS Assay can be used as an aid in determining colonization status in antepartum women.

The BD MAX™ GBS Assay does notrprovide susceptibility results. Cultured isolates are necessary for performing susceptibliy testing as recommended for penicillin-allergic women. Subculture to solid media foradditional testing when indicated.

# SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION OF THE PROCEDURE

A vaginal and rectal swab is collected and transported to the laboratory using standard bacterial swab transport systems containing a non-nutritive transport medium (e.g. Amies or Stuart). In the lab, the swab is removed from the transport medium and placed into selective Lim Broth [Todd-Hewitt Broth supplemented with colistin $( 1 0 | \mu \ g / \ m L )$ and nalidixic acid $( 1 5 | \mu 9 / \mathrm { m L } ) ]$ . After incubation of inoculated Lim Broth culture for ${ \tt > } 1 8$ hours at $3 7 ~ \textdegree C$ in ambient air or $5 \%$ CO2, a $1 5 \mu L$ aliquot of the broth is mixed with BD MAX GBS Sample Preparation Reagent and processed on the BD MAX System using the BD MAX GBS Assay. The BD MAX System automatically extracts the target nucleic acid and amplifies a section of the cfb gene sequence of the GBS chromosome, if present. The BD MAX GBS Assay includes an Internal Process Control to monitor for the presence of potential inhibitory substances as well as system or reagent failures that may be encountered during the entire process.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram positive bacterium found in the lower intestinal tract of $10 { - } 3 0 \%$ of all healthy adults. A person who carries GBS but does not show signs of GBS disease is said to be "colonized" with GBS. GBS colonization is not contagious and GBS are commonly found bacteria associated with the human body. Under certain circumstances, GBS can invade thejaody-and cause serious infection; this is referred to as Group B streptococcal disease. $G B S$ can cause severe disease in a newborn and is known to be the leading cause of life nreatening bacterial infections in newborns. A number of strains of the pathogen circulate in the community, and approximately $80 \%$ of newborn infections are acquired during birth by vertical (mother-to-baby) transmission. Research has shown that GBS colonizes the anogenital mucosa of $2 5 { \cdot } 4 0 \ \%$ of healthy women, and despite the introduction of antibiotic prophylaxis in the US, GBS still causes approximately 2,500 cases of newborn infections per year. Of those infected, $2 5 \%$ incur serious long-term consequences such as deafness, blindness and neurological damage. Approximately 100 babies die annually in the U.S. in the first three months of life as a result of GBS infection and half of these deaths occur during the first week of life.1

The current standard of care for preventing neonatal GBS disease is screening pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation to determine their GBS colonization status.' Most GBS testing is performed by culture and can take up to 48 hours for definitive identification of GBS following the initial $> 1 8$ hour incubation of vaginal and rectal swabs in a selective broth medium. The BD MAX GBS Assay, as implemented on the BD MAX System, can provide results from up to 24 specimens in approximately 120 minutes after the initial ${ > } 1 8$ hour incubation/enrichment step. The BD MAX GBS Assay streamlines and simplifies the testing process by eliminating the need for operator intervention from the time the sample is placed onto the BD MAX System until results are available.

# PERFORMANCE DATA

# Precision

Qualitative testing was performed over a 12 day period in order to determine within laboratory precision using the BD MAX G8S Assay. Precision was determined within instrument as well as across instruments. For consistency, testing was performed using the same lot of BD MAX GBS Assay. Panel members were prepared at five levels, which included four concentrations of GBS along with True Negative (TN) samples. The levels of the panel members were determined by relation to the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the assay. The Moderate Positive (MP) sample was at a concentration of \~3X LoD, the Low Positive (LP) sample was at a level of $- 1 . 5 \times$ LoD, the High Negative 2 (HN-2) sample was at a \~10 fold dilution of the LoD and the High Negative 1 (HN-1) sample was at a $\mathord { \sim } 1 0 0$ fold dilution of the LoD. Four replicates of each panel member were tested over a 12 day period with two runs per day on three different instruments by multiple operators.

# Reproducibility

Qualitative testing was performed in order to determine reproducibility using the BD MAX GBS Assay. Reproducibility was detegmined within site as well as across sites. Panel members were prepared at four levej,which included three concentrations of GBS along with True Negative (TN) samplos. The levels of the panel members were determined by relation to the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the assay. The Moderate Positive (MP) sample was at a concentration of \~2X LoD, the Low Positive (LP) sample was at a level of \~1X LoD, the High Negative (HN) sample was at a concentration of

$\mathord { \sim } 1 0 0$ fold dilution of the LoD. Six replicates of each panel member were tested at 3 sites, across 5 runs over a minimum of a 3 day period.

# Carry over/Cross Contamination

A study was conducted to investigate within-run carry-over and between-run carry-over. All High Positive samples that gavejaatid result were accurately identified as positive while all of the True Negative samplos were accurately identified as negative. IND results were due to PCR failure as nelther Target or Process control were amplified. This study demonstrated the absence of carry-over and cross-contamination either within a run or between successive runs using the GBS assay on the BD MAX System.

# Effectiveness of Control

The BD MAX GBS Assay was performed with variations to critical assay and/or process conditions on the automated BD MAX System to demonstrate the effectiveness of the internal process controls incorporated as part of the assay. The BD MAX GBS Assay was also performed in the presence of known inhibitory factors to demonstrate the effectiveness of the internal process control to monitor for inhibition. Of the 4 critical assay conditions that were tested on the automated Jaguar system, the BD MAx GBS Assay will fail if any one of the following 3 critical assay conditions fail - (i) absence of Reagent 1, (i) absence of Reagent 2, and (ii) absence of Reagent 3 from the strip. As a result the incorporation of the internal process control controls for the occurrence of errors due to the use of 'bad' reagents or errors due to some fluidic system malfunction resulting in the non-aspiration of these reagents from the reservoirs. In.addition, the presence of an inhibitory agent (spermicidal jelly) leads to inhibition of the internal process control resulting in a higher Ct value than a sample without the agent. The data demonstrates the effectiveness of the internal process contro! to monitor for inhibition that may prevent detection of low levels of target and potentially lead to False negative errors. For the samples that had the:pecimen omitted, the internal process control was still detected at normal levels becaus@the internal process control pellet present in the test strip (and exogenous to the speclimen) amplified to give a valid result.

# Interfering Substances

The BD MAX GBS Assay was tested in the presence of both endogenous and exogenous interfering agents to characterize the ability of the assay to detect GBs DNA under these conditions. The study was performed at GBS concentrations of 300 CFU/mL and 3000 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent. Interference was also studied in the presence of high concentrations of 127 relevant non-target organisms to determine if the detection of GBS at 300 CFU/mL was affected by the presence of these organisms. The list of organisms and concentration tested are the same as listed in Analytical Specificity section. The following exogenous interfering substances were tested: miconazole (fungicide), hemorrhoid cooling gel, spermicidal foam (nonoxynol 9),spermicidal gel (nonoxynol 9), contraceptive gel, deodorant spray, lubricating gel, moisturizing lotion, body oil and body powder. A complete swab of exogenous agent, similar to the collection of a GBS swab, was added to negative LIM broth and released into the specimen. The specimen $( 1 5 \mu 1 )$ with the interfering agent was added to the Sample Preparation Reagent tube. The following endogenous substances were tested: human DNA $1 . 5 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ ng /mL Sample Preparation Reagent), whole blood $10 \%$ in Lim), urine

$30 \%$ in Lim), mucous (one Swab in Lim), amniotic fluid ( $10 \%$ in Lim), and feces (one swab in Lim).

Interference (1/3 replicates) was observed in the presence of Corynebacterium xerosis, Serratia marcescans and EBV when tested at a GBS target concentration of 300 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent.

The BD MAX GBS Assay was able to detect GBS at a concentration of 300 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent in the presence of all interfering agents tested except body powder and feces where one of the three replicates was called negative. At 3000 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent no interference was observed with these agents.

# Analytical Sensitivity Limit of Detection Study

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of theiE'MAX GBS Assay is 200 CFU/mL Sample Preparation Reagent $( 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ enriched Lim broth). Hit rate $( 9 5 \%$ positivity) method was used to determine the LoD. Pooled Clinical Negative samples spiked with GBS culture was used and individual clinical negative specimen spiked with GBS culture were used in the determination of LoD.

# Microbial Variants

The ability of the BD MAX GBS Assay to detect multiple GBS serotypes was demonstrated using 12 different strains of GBS bacteria listed in Table 4. The BD MAX GBS Assay was able to detect all major serotypes of GBS at 300 CFU/mL Sample Preparation Reagent $( 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ CFU/mL incubated Lim broth culture).

# Analytical Specificity

The BD MAX GBS Assay was performed on samples containing high levels of nontarget organisms, using the BD MAX System, to demonstrate the specificity of the assay for detection of Group B Streptococcus. A total of 127 organisms were tested (119 viable organisms and 8 genomic DNA), including 11 organisms phylogeneticaly similar to Group B Streptococcus and a wide variety of other organisms including viruses, fungi and parasites that are known to infect the urogenital tract or are part of urogenital microflora..The Internal Process Control was detected in all specimens. None of the 11 phylogenetically related streptococcal isolates tested positive with the BD MAX GBS Assay. Of the remaining strains testeonly one (Moraxella osloensis) was positive in four of nine replicates. N

# Clinical Performance

Performance characteristics of the BD MAX GBS Assay were determined in a 3-site prospective investigational study. Specimens were collected by health care providers using the procedure recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that is described as follows: "Swab the lower vagina (vaginal introitus), followed by the rectum (i.e., insert swab through the anal sphincter) using the same swab or two different swabs." Swabs were sent for culture-based analysis to be performed by laboratories at three separate metropolitan locations in the U.S. Following incubation of the vaginal and rectal swab specimens for ${ \tt > } 1 8$ hours in selective Lim Broth medium, a $1 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquot of this enriched broth was tested using the BD MAX GBS Assay to

ascertain the clinical sensitivity and'sjecificity of the BD MAX GBS Assay as compared to the reference culture method based on CDC recommendations.'

To perform the culture based analysis, the enriched Lim Broth specimens were then subcultured to a sheep blood agar plate and_incubated up to 48 hours. Colonies suggestive of GBS were then Gram stained and tested for catalase production. Gram positive/catalase negative colonies were then specifically identified by the appropriate confirmatory method. Beta hemolytic GBS colonies were confirmed using a latex agglutination test method and gamma hemolytic GBS colonies were confirmed by performing a CAMP reaction. Of the 631 clinical specimens enrolled in the study, 601 were compliant and included in the statistical analyses (Table 2).
