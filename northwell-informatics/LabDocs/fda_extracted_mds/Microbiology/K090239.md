# NAME OF DEVICE

Trade Name: ProGastro Cd Assay Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.2660 Classification Name: reagents, Clostridium difficile toxin

PREDICATE DEVICE K923463 - TechLab C. difficile toxin/Antitoxin Kit K081920  BD Geneohm CDiff Assay

# INTENDED USE

The ProGastroTM Cd Assay is a Real Time PCR in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile nucleic acids isolated and purified from liquid or soft stool specimens obtained from symptomatic patients. This test targets the Clostridium difficile toxin B gene (tcdB) and is intended for use to aid in the diagnosis of toxigenic Clostridium difficile infections.

# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The ProGastro Cd Assay detects toxigenic Clostridium difficile and an Internal Control by a process of nucleic acid extraction from patient specimens followed by PCR amplification and detection. Following collection of a soft or liquid stool sample from a symptomatic patient, a portion of the sample is diluted in Stool Transport and Recovery (S.T.A.R.) Buffer and the solids separated via centrifugation (Stool Clarification). The Internal Control is added to the sample prior to extraction to monitor for PCR inhibitors that may be present. The nucleic acids from the sample are extracted and purified using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG automated extractor. Nucleic acids are added to the C. diff Mix for subsequent PCR amplification and detection using the Cepheid SmartCycler II.

The C. diff Mix contains oligonucleotide primers and probes that target the tcdB gene of toxigenic strains of C. diff. The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye attached to the $5 ^ { \circ }$ -end and a quencher dye attached to the 3'-end (see table below). During PCR amplification the primers and probes anneal to the template (if present) followed by primer extension and template amplification. The $5 \div 3 \nobreakspace$ exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the quencher and generating an increase in fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification product present. The SmartCycler II instrument and software monitors the process, interprets the data, and presents a report upon completion.

# SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE Clinical Performance

Performance characteristics of the ProGastro Cd Assay were established during a prospective study at 3 U.S. clinical laboratories from July through October 2008. Samples used for this study were leftover raw stool specimens that were collected for routine Clostridium difficile testing from patients over two years of age by each site. The reference method was tissue culture cytotoxin assay (CTA). Demographic details for this patient population are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Number of SubjectsAge                             (Percentage of Total)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2-5 years</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60 (7.8 %)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6-21 years</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>163 (21.1%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22 - 59 years</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>292 (37.9%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≥ 60 years</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>256 (33.2%)</td></tr></table>

A total of 771 raw stool samples were tested with the ProGastro Cd Assay and by CTA.   
None of the 771 samples were inhibited when tested with the ProGastro Cd Assay.

Discrepant analysis for samples where ProGastro Cd Assay and CTA results were in disagreement was performed using a predetermined algorithm including a molecular (PCR) test (which targeted a different region of the tcdB gene than that of the ProGastro Cd Assay) followed by bidirectional genetic sequencing, enzyme immunoassay (ElA), and culture followed by PCR and bidirectional sequencing.

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the ProGastro Cd Assay was evaluated at 3 laboratory sites. Reproducibility was assessed using a panel of 6 simulated samples that included medium positive, low positive (near the assay limit of detection) and "high negative" samples. Panels and controls were tested at each site by 2 operators for 5 days (6 samples and 4 controls X 2 operators X 5 days X 3 sites $= 3 0 0$ ). The overall percent agreement with the expected result for the ProGastro Cd Assay was $9 9 . 0 \%$ .

1Average Ct value is calculated for the Internal Control (IC).

An additional reproducibility study was performed to assess samples that were at an intermediate concentration, below the assay's LoD but above the "high negatives" tested during the original reproducibility study. The percent positive for the intermediate member across all sites was $4 2 . 2 \%$ . This result was expected as the intermediate concentration should be positive in the range of $5 \cdot 9 5 \%$ as the samples were lower concentration than the LoD concentration $( \geq 9 5 \%$ positive) and higher than the "high negative" concentration $( < 5 \%$ positive).
