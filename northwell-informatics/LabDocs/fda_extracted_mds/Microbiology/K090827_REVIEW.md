The BD ProbeTec™ Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) $\mathrm { Q } ^ { x }$ Amplified DNA Assay, when tested with the BD Viper™ System in Extracted Mode, uses Strand Displacement Amplification technology for the direct, qualitative detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in clinician-collected female endocervical and male urethral swab specimens, patient–collected vaginal swab specimens (in a clinical setting), and male and female urine specimens (both UPT and Neat). The assay is also intended for use with gynecological specimens collected in PreservCyt® Solution using an aliquot that is removed prior to processing for additional gynecological testing. The assay is indicated for use with asymptomatic and symptomatic females and symptomatic males to aid in the diagnosis of gonococcal urogenital disease.

3) Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription use only

TM 4) Special instrument requirements: BD Viper System with automated nucleic acid extraction mode

I. Device Description: The BD ProbeTec GC Q Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD ViperTM System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermallycontrolled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.

In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA, a second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the $N .$ . gonorrhoeae -specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper System and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and N. gonorrhoeae -specific signals to report results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

# L. Test Principle:

The BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay is designed for use with the BD ProbeTec Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/GC) $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ specimen collection and transport devices, applicable reagents, the BD Viper System and BD Fox Extraction. Specimens are collected and transported in their respective transport devices which preserve the integrity of the N. gonorrhoeae DNA over the specified ranges of temperature and time.

Urine and swab specimens undergo a pre-warm step in the BD Viper Lysing Heater to dissolve mucus and homogenize the specimen. After cooling, the specimens are loaded onto the BD Viper System which then performs all the steps involved in extraction and amplification of target DNA, without further user intervention. The specimen is transferred to an Extraction Tube that contains ferric oxide particles in a dissolvable film and dried Extraction Control. A high pH is used to lyse the bacterial cells and liberate their DNA into solution. Acid is then added to lower the pH and induce a positive charge on the ferric oxide, which in turn binds the negatively charged DNA. The particles and bound DNA are then pulled to the sides of the Extraction Tube by magnets and the treated specimen is aspirated to waste. The particles are washed and a high pH Elution Buffer is added to recover the purified DNA. Finally, a Neutralization Buffer is used to bring the $\mathsf { p H }$ of the extracted solution to the optimum for amplification of the target.

The BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD Viper System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermallycontrolled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.

In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA, a second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the N. gonorrhoeae-specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper instrument and an automated

algorithm is applied to both the EC and $N .$ . gonorrhoeae-specific signals to report specimen results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Assay was evaluated for Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) specimens at three clinical sites on one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated specimens comprising CT and GC organisms seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing PreservCyt Solution was tested with the BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Assay. Uninoculated LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing PreservCyt Solution were used for the GC negative samples. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five days on each BD Viper System. The data are summarized in the table below.

$g .$ . Cross Contamination and Carryover: An internal study was conducted to evaluate the risk of producing a false positive result in either the same run on the BD Viper System in extracted mode (within run cross-contamination) or in a subsequent run (between run carryover). Testing was conducted using negative and positive samples on three BD Viper Systems. Negative samples consisted of CT/GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { x }$ Swab Diluent/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution. Positive samples consisted of a representative analyte $\mathrm { 1 0 ^ { 5 } C T E B / m L }$ ) spiked into CT/GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { x }$ Swab Diluent/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution. The overall rate of crosscontamination (i.e., with alternating columns of positive and negative samples and a prevalence of $50 \%$ ) was $0 . 4 1 \%$ (9/2208) for the CT/GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Swab Diluent and $0 . 4 5 \%$ (5/1104) for the LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution. The overall rate of carryover contamination (i.e., carryover between successive runs when the prevalence was $50 \%$ in the previous run) was $0 . 3 6 \%$ (8/2208) for the CT/GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Swab Diluent and $0 . 5 4 \%$ (6/1104) for the LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution.

Performance Characteristics

# PreservCyt Specimen Clinical Study

Endocervical swab specimens and PreservCyt specimens were collected from 2079 compliant female subjects attending family planning, OB/GYN, and sexually transmitted disease clinics at eleven geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they reported symptoms such as dysuria, coital pain/difficulty/bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge, or pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not report symptoms. Two subjects were excluded due to an undetermined patient infected status. Three subjects did not have a PreservCyt specimen result. Therefore there were 2074 subjects evaluated.

Three randomized endocervical swab specimens and a PreservCyt specimen were collected from each female subject. The three reference endocervical swabs were tested with the BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC assay, the BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ assay, and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test). Sensitivity and specificity for PreservCyt specimens were calculated by comparing results to a patient infected status (PIS) algorithm. The designation of positive or negative PIS was based on the endocervical swab specimen results from the three reference methods. At least two positive reference results were required to establish a subject as PIS-positive. At least two negative reference results were required to establish a subject as PIS-negative. Data are presented in the following tables.

4. Clinical cut-off: Clinical cut-off was validated during the swab and urine clinical trial (K081825). The cutoff was 125 MaxRFU $( > 1 2 5 \mathrm { { M a x R F U } = }$ positive; $< 1 2 5 \mathrm { M a x R F U } =$ negtative). The same cutoff was utilized for the clinical trial to validate the performance of the PreservCyt Solution specimens when tested with the GCQ assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A. Prevalence: The prevalence of positive $N .$ gonorrhoeae specimens in patient populations depends upon: clinic type, age, risk factors, gender, and test method. The prevalence observed with the GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { x }$ Assay during a multi-center clinical trial for PreservCyt specimens ranged from $0 . 0 \%$ to $1 3 . 3 \%$ based on the data presented in the table “GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { x }$ Assay Performance for PreservCyt Specimens Compared to Patient Infected Status (by clinical site)” under performance.

B. Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative predictive values (PPV & NPV) for the GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { x }$ Assay from the multi-center clinical trial for PreservCyt specimens are shown in the following table. These calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity and specificity (compared to the patient infected status) of $9 5 . 3 \%$ and $9 9 . 9 5 \%$ for PreservCyt specimens.
