# H. Intended Use:

The BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay, when tested with the BD Viper™ System in Extracted Mode, uses Strand Displacement Amplification technology (SDA) for the direct, qualitative detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in clinician-collected female endocervical and male urethral swab specimens, patient-collected vaginal swab specimens (in a clinical setting), and male and female urine specimens. The assay is indicated for use with asymptomatic and symptomatic female and male individuals to aid in the diagnosis of gonococcal urogenital disease.

3) Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription use only

4) Special instrument requirements: BD ViperTM System with automated nucleic acid extraction mode

I. Device Description: The BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { X } }$ Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD

ViperTMSystem pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermallycontrolled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.

In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA, a second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the $N .$ . gonorrhoeae -specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper System and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and N. gonorrhoeae -specific signals to report results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

# L. Test Principle:

The BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay is designed for use with the BD ProbeTec Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/GC) $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ specimen collection and transport devices, applicable reagents, the BD Viper System and BD Fox Extraction. Specimens are collected and transported in their respective transport devices which preserve the integrity of the N. gonorrhoeae DNA over the specified ranges of temperature and time.

Urine and swab specimens undergo a pre-warm step in the BD Viper Lysing Heater to dissolve mucus and homogenize the specimen. After cooling, the specimens are loaded onto the BD Viper System which then performs all the steps involved in extraction and amplification of target DNA, without further user intervention. The specimen is transferred to an Extraction Tube that contains ferric oxide particles in a dissolvable film and dried Extraction Control. A high pH is used to lyse the bacterial cells and liberate their DNA into solution. Acid is then added to lower the pH and induce a positive charge on the ferric oxide, which in turn binds the negatively charged DNA. The particles and bound DNA are then pulled to the sides of the Extraction Tube by magnets and the treated specimen is aspirated to waste. The particles are washed and a high pH Elution Buffer is added to recover the purified DNA. Finally, a Neutralization Buffer is used to bring the pH of the extracted solution to the optimum for amplification of the target.

The BD ProbeTec GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD Viper System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermallycontrolled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.

In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA, a second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the N. gonorrhoeae-specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper instrument and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and N. gonorrhoeae-specific signals to report specimen results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

# Performance Characteristics

Clinician-collected male urethral swab specimens and male $\mathrm { Q } x$ UPT and neat urine specimens were collected from 787 symptomatic and asymptomatic male subjects attending OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD) and family planning clinics at seven geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Thirteen male subjects were excluded from the data analysis due to age requirement violations, antibiotic treatment in the last 21 days, opting to withdraw from the study after initially consenting, failure to obtain paired swab and urine specimens, urine quantity less than $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ , or transport and storage errors related to specimen collection. Therefore, the final data analysis included 774 compliant male subjects.

# Additional Analysis: Co-infection status

To determine the effect of CT co-infection with GC, a performance analysis was conducted to assess the GCQ assay results when compared against PIS by co-infection status. Co-infection is defined as GCQ PIS positive and CTQ PIS positive. CTQ PIS positive is defined similarly as to GCQ PIS positive (two of the three reference swabs tested positive for CT). The following table displays the co-infection status of the subjects, the number of specimens, and the calculated sensitivities and specificities for the GCQ assay.

4. Clinical cut-off: Clinical cut-off was validated during the swab and urine clinical trial (K081825). The cutoff was 125 MaxRFU (> 125 MaxRFU $=$ positive; $< 1 2 5 \mathrm { M a x R F U } =$ negtative). The same cutoff was utilized for the clinical trial to validate the performance of the asymptomatic male specimens when tested with the GCQ assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

A. Prevalence: The prevalence of positive N. gonorrhoeae specimens in patient populations depends upon: clinic type, age, risk factors, gender, and test method. The prevalence observed with the GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay during a multi-center clinical trial ranged from $1 . 4 \%$ to $1 9 . 1 \%$ for female specimens and $4 . 8 \%$ to $4 0 . 5 \%$ for male specimens (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects).

B. Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative predictive values (PPV & NPV) for the GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Assay are shown in the following table. These calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity and specificity (compared to the patient infected status) of $9 9 . 3 \%$ and $9 9 . 3 \%$ , respectively. In addition, PPV and NPV based on actual prevalence, sensitivity and specificity are shown in the tables under performance characteristics section (See “GC $\mathrm { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Assay Performance Compared to Patient Infected Status (by specimen type and symptomatic status)” and “GC $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { Q } } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Assay Performance Compared to Patient Infected Status (by clinical site).” PPV was calculated using: (Sensitivity \* Prevalence) / (Sensitivity\*Prevalence $\mathrm { ~ + ~ } ( 1 \mathrm { ~ - ~ }$ Specificity) \* (1 - Prevalence)). NPV was calculated using: (Specificity \* (1 - Prevalence)/ (1-Sensitivity) \* Prevalence $^ +$ Specificity \* (1-Prevalence)).
