# Performance

Perfoance of chromlD™VRE was evaluated at four geographically diverse laboratories.Stool specimens were inoculated on chromID™ VRE agar and bile esculin azide agar with $\delta \mu \rho / \ m$ vancomycin (BEAV).Both plates were observed for growth at 24 and 48 hours. Colonies with violet or blue-to-green pigment on chromlD™ VRE agar and colonies on BEAV with brown to black pigment diffusing into the medium were identified with the following methods: Gram stain, catalase, VITEK®2 GP and 16S-500 sequencing. Vancomycin resistance was confirmed by agar dilution.

A total of 1299 stool samples were evaluated with chromID™ VRE agar. Compared to theconventional reference methods described above chromlID™ VRE identified 97.1% of the VRE positive samples and $9 9 . 7 \%$ of the VRE negative samples after 24 hours incubation.chromID™M VRE identified $9 6 . 9 \%$ of the VRE positive samples and $9 9 . 7 \%$ of the VRE negative samples after 48 hours incubation.

One sample produced blue-to-green colonies on chromlD ™ VRE and was vancomycin susceptible by MIC.

# Challenge Testing:

Seventy-five well-characterized challenge strains including vancomycin-resistant and vancomycinsusceptible E. faecalis and E. faecium, as well as Gram-positive microorganisms commonly isolated from stool, were evaluated on chromlD™ VRE agar and produced the expected results.One challenge isolate, faecalis 13029 (vanB) produced blue-purple colonies after 48 hours incubation.This was due to a r situation of activity of both enzymes (α-glucosidase and $\beta$ -galactosidase) occurring in one strain. Both enzymes reacted with the chromogen in the chromlD™ VRE agar and this mixture of activity produced the blue-purple color variation.

A second study was performed to evaluate the detection of enterococal strains with low level vancomycin resistance. Forty-nine enterococci strains characterized by intermediate or low levels of resistance to vancomycin were evaluated.E. faecium and E. faecalis with a low level of vancomycin resistance, such as those carying the vanB gene are detected on chromID™ VRE medium with their characteristic colony color if their vancomycin MIC is ≥ 4 µg/mL.For a majority of isolates, the characteristic colony coloration is oserved after48 h of incubation.. casseliflavus strains are inhibited on chromID™VRE.gal strains are inhibited on chromlD™ VRE unless they have an acquired vanA gene. In this case, characteristic violet color is observed after 48 h.

# Interference Study

Commonly used medicinal substances, blood, Cary Blair Transport medium and physiological saline were evaluated for potential interference with the chromogenic reaction of the chrom™VRE agar. None of the potentially interfering substances tested afected the performance of the chromogenic reaction of the chromlD VRE medium but decreases in the quantity of growth were observed. Cary Blair Transport medium did not interfere with the chromogenic reaction of the chromlD™ VRE agar or reduce the quantity of-growth on-the plate:-In-the-presence-of Preparation-H-Cream-or-Miconazole- $\cdot 7 _ { \overleftarrow { \imath } }$ the-detection-of-certain resistant . aecalis or . fecium isolates may benhibitedor delayed after 4 to 8 hours incubatin the chromlD™ VRE medium.Other commonly used medicinal substances, blood and physiological saline may result in decreased growth.

# Reproducibility

Ten reproducibility organisms comprised of a subset of challenge isolates representing Vancomycin susceptible and resistant E. faecalis and $\epsilon .$ faecium (both vanA & vanB), as well as quality control reference strains, were evaluated by chromlD™VRE in triplicate each day for three days at each clnical trial site and produced the expected results. Preliminary results after 24 hours of incubation show $80 \%$ reproducibility for this set of organisms. After the chromlD™ VRE plates were incubated for the full 48 hours, overall reproducibility was $100 \%$ for this set of organisms.

On rare occasions colonies may produce violet or blue-to-green pigment.

# Recovery Study

A recovery study was performed to define the lowest number of colony forming units (CFU) of vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) that could grow on the chromlD™ VRE medium. One strain each of Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and E. faecium (VRE) were evaluated.A series of 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared in saline and then plated in duplicate onto chrom!D™ VRE medium. After 48 hours incubation, the number of CFU was counted on each plate.The number of CFU obtained on the two plates from each dilution was averaged.The lowest number.of CU that can bedetected on chrom RE is equivalent to a theoretical 100 CFU per mL of sample.

# Swab Study

The impact of swabs on the detection of E. faecium or E. faecalis (VRE) with chromlD™ VRE medium was evaluatedRayon swabs and nyon flockd swabs were tested dry and with Amies transport medium.The stuy evaluated detection of VRE based on contact times of 1, 4 and 18 hours for each swab type both at room temperature and at $\pmb { 2 } \pmb { 8 } ^ { \circ } \pmb { \mathbb { C } }$ .The organism test set included 16 strains of vanA or vanB positive Enterococcus flis an Ec with varius vancomycin MCvalueResults indicated that aferh n4 of thewasint hesiivit a hosm medium.
