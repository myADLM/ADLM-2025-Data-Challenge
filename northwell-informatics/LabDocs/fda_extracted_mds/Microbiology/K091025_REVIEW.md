# L. Test Principle:

chromID™ VRE agar (patents pending) consists of a rich nutritive base including a variety of peptones. It also contains chromogenic substrates and a mixture of antibiotics including vancomycin $\mathrm { 8 \mu g / m L } )$ which enable

the specific and selective growth of VRE,   
the direct detection of $E .$ . faecium and $E .$ . faecalis through the   
characteristic color of colonies:   
- E. faecium: violet color for ß-galactosidase producing strains   
- E. faecalis: blue-to-green color for $\alpha$ -glucosidase producing strains

The selective mixture inhibits enterococcal strains that do not express acquired vancomycin resistance; enterococcal strains that express intrinsic vancomycin resistance (i.e. vanC phenotype: $E$ . gallinarum and $E .$ . casseliflavus); and most Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a set of ten organisms which were tested in triplicate each day for three days at three different sites. The study included vancomycin susceptible and vancomycin resistant $E$ . faecalis and $E .$ . faecium (both with vanA and vanB). The quality control reference strains were also included in the study.

Preliminary results at 24 hours demonstrated $80 \%$ reproducibility. After incubation for the full 48 hours, overall reproducibility was $100 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended quality control (QC) organisms, $E .$ . faecium (vanA) ATCC 700221 and $E .$ . faecalis (vanB) ATCC 51299 as positive controls, and $E .$ . faecalis ATCC 29212 as negative control were used. Quality control data was compiled across all three sites and overall QC results were acceptable.

In one instance, the negative control, $E _ { \mathrm { { ; } } }$ .faecalis ATCC 29212 exhibited breakthrough growth on the chromID™ VRE agar medium. A note was added to the table in the Quality Control section of the package insert recommending the use of a light organism inoculum in order to mitigate erroneous quality control results.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity Study

A Cross-reactivity study was performed using at total of 99 strains representing various organism groups.

One strain of Enterococcus raffinosus produced colorless colonies after 24 hours of incubation which subsequently developed violet pigmentation after 48 hours of incubation.

One strain of Citrobacter freundii produced violet Klebsiella pneumoniae pigmented colonies after 24 hours incubation. Two strains of produced violet colored colonies after 24 and 48 hours of incubation.

Two strains of $P .$ . aeruginosa, five strains of $P$ . fluorescens, and one strain each of $S .$ . maltophilia and A. baumanii grew producing colorless and/or atypically pigmented colonies.

One strain each of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, Geotrichum candidum, Saccromyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillum abeanum, all grew producing colorless or blue colonies on the chromID™ VRE medium.

The study results are reflected in the Limitation and Cross Reactivity sections of the device package insert.

# Interference Study

Commonly used medicinal substances namely, Preparation H Ointment, Boudreaux’s Butt Paste, Glycerin, Dulcolax, Vaseline and Tucks Pads, as well as human blood and physiological saline were found to decrease growth of VRE isolates on the chromID™ VRE medium in comparison to the control. However, the chromogenic reaction remained unaffected.

Testing of both Preparation H Cream and Miconazole 7 resulted inhibition or delayed growth of VRE isolates on the chromID™ VRE medium at 24 and 48 hours incubation. However, the chromogenic reaction remained unaffected.

Cary Blair transport medium was tested and found to have no detrimental effect on the growth, recovery or chromogenic reaction of VRE isolates on the chromID™ VRE medium.

# Collection Swab Study

The influence of collection swabs on the recovery of VRE was also evaluated. Rayon and nylon flocked swabs were tested dry and coupled with Amies transport media. After 1 and 4 hours of contact there was found to be no significant difference in the sensitivity of detection of VRE between dry swabs and those in Amies transport medium. After 18 hours of contact at room temperature, the nylon flocked swab with Amies transport media resulted in the best recovery for VRE, followed by nylon flocked dry swabs and rayon swab with Amies transport media. After 18 hours at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , the nylon flocked swabs with and without Amies transport medium resulted in the best recovery of VRE, followed by the rayon swabs with and without Amies transport medium.

# f. Analytical Sensitivity

# Recovery Study

A recovery study was performed to determine the lowest number of colony forming units (CFU) of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) that will grow on the chromID™ VRE medium. One strain of $E$ . faecalis (vanA) bioMerieux stock no. 05.02.228; and one strain of $E$ .faecium (vanA) ATCC 700221; were evaluated. Ten-fold serial dilutions were prepared in saline and then plated in duplicate onto chromID™ VRE medium. After 48 hours incubation, the number of CFU was counted on each plate. The number of CFU obtained on the two plates from each dilution was averaged. The percent recovery on chromID™ VRE was determined to be equivalent to 100 CFU/mL of sample.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of the chromID™ VRE agar was evaluated at four geographically diverse laboratory sites. A total of 1299 stool specimens were evaluated. Stool specimens were inoculated on chromID™ VRE agar medium and the Bile Esculin Azide Agar with $6 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l }$ of Vancomycin. (BEAV). Both plates were observed for growth at 24 and 48 hours. Colonies with violet or blue-to-green pigment (chromID™ VRE) or brown to black pigment diffusing into the medium (BEAV), were identified by a combination of conventional reference methods to include Gram stain, catalase, VITEK 2 GP, and 16S-500 sequencing. Vancomycin resistance was confirmed by agar dilution.

Percent agreement of the chromID™ VRE compared to conventional reference methods is presented in Table 1.

A challenge set of 75 well characterized isolates were tested at one external site. The challenge isolates included vancomycin resistant and vancomycin susceptible $E .$ . faecalis and $E$ . faecium, $E$ . gallinarum and $E$ . casseliflavus, and other gram positive microorganisms commonly isolated from the stools. Results of the challenge study were compared to the expected result as determined by the organism identification based on $\mathrm { \bf A P I @ }$ results or known reference strain and vancomycin resistance as determined by the vancomycin agar dilution method.

One challenge isolate $E .$ . faecalis 13029 vanB produced blue-purple colonies after 48 hours incubation. This was due to a rare situation of activity of both enzymes ( $\mathbf { \bar { a } }$ -glucosidase and $\beta$ -galactosidase) occurring in one strain. Both enzymes reacted with the chromogen in the chromID™ VRE agar medium and this combination of activity produced the blue-purple color variation.

A second study was performed to evaluate the detection of enterococcal strains with low level vancomycin resistance. Forty-nine enterococcal strains characterized by intermediate or low levels of resistance to vancomycin were evaluated. The strains tested were from several international collections such as ATCC, LMG (Gent-Laboratorium voor Microbiologie, Belgium), NCTC (National Collection of Type Culture, United Kingdom) and the bioMérieux stock collection. $E .$ . faecium and $E$ . faecalis isolates with a low level of vancomycin resistance were detected if their vancomycin MIC was greater than or equal to $4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ . For a majority of the isolates, the characteristic colony coloration was observed after 48 hours incubation. All the isolates of $E$ . casseliflavus in this study were inhibited on the chromID™ VRE medium. Most isolates of $E$ . gallinarum in this study were inhibited on the chromID™ VRE medium with the exception of two isolates, the first with the acquired vanA gene resulted in growth of violet colonies, a second with an MIC of greater than $6 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ resulted in growth of colorless colonies.
