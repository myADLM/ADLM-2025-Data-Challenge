# B. Device Name:

Formal/Trade Name:

VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin $( \leq 0 . 1 2 - \geq 8 | | g / m | )$

Classification Name:

Fully Automated Short-Term Incubation Cycle Antimicrobial Susceptibility Device, 21 CFR 866.1645

Common Name:

VITEK 2 AST-GP Daptomycin

C. Predicate Device:

VITEK 2 Gram Positive Vancomyin (K072668)

# D. 510(k) Summary:

VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Gram positive microorganisms and is intended for use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. VITEK 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin is a quantitative test. Daptomycin has been shown to be active against the microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for the antimicrobial.

Active in vitro and in clinical infections: Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible strains only) Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains)

The antimicrobial presented in VITEK 2 AST Cards is in concentrations equivalent by efficacy to standard method concentrations in mcg/ml. The VITEK 2 AST Cards are essentially miniaturized versions of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) microdilution methodology.

The bacterial isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration in $0 . 4 5 - 0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automaticallyfills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader.The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filing and sealing operation. The VITEK 2 monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MCvalue along with theinterpretive category result for each antiic contained on the card.

VITEK 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, as defined in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, Issued March 5, 2007.

The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of VITEK 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin. An external evaluation was conducted with fresh clinical isolates and stock challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the acceptability of VITEK 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin by comparing its performance with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method. The data is representative of performance on both the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact instrument platforms, as evidenced in the AST equivalency study presented in the VITEK 2 Compact 510(k), K050002. VITEK 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin demonstrated acceptable performance of $9 8 . 4 \%$ overall Category Agreement. Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.

Dear Ms Tenllado:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish urthercmets oncernin your devi th Feeal Re

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a deternination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
