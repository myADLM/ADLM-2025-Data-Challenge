K. L. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S19) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.

# M. Test Principle:

Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. The VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ Susceptibility Card test is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ system. The MIC result must be linked to organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with a MIC.

# N. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Ten gram-positive on-scale organisms were evaluated for site to site and inter site reproducibility demonstrating $59 5 \%$

reproducibility. The ten isolates study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ . The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.

Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. Results demonstrated that methods were comparable with the same mode.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A clinical study was conducted at three sites using the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ gram positive cards with daptomycin and the broth microdilution method using Mueller Hinton (MH) broth (cation adjusted) supplemented with $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ calcium. The MH broth was incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ in ambient air at $1 6 - 2 0 \mathrm { h }$ . The Inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known results. Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were evaluated. Clinical testing was performed using the automated method of inoculation and the challenge set was tested using both the manual and the automated method. The test device had a growth rate of $5 9 0 \%$ . A comparison was provided to the reference method with the following agreement.

EA-Essential Agreement NS-not susceptible

CA-Category Agreement

Essential agreement (EA) is when the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the VITEK $^ { \textregistered 2 }$ and the reference and have on-scale EA.

There appears to be a trend where the test device is slightly more resistant than the reference method as demonstrated in the Accuracy studies however results are still within essential agreement.

Manual Dilution:

The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the manual method of inoculation with the following performance that demonstrated that there is minimal difference between the two inoculation methods.
