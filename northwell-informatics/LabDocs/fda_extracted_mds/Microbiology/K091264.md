# 510(k) Summary

# 510(k) Submission Information:

Device Manufacturer: Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics   
Contact name: Shannon Popson, Regulatory Affairs Senior Technical Specialist   
Fax: 916-374-3330   
Date prepared: April 21, 2009   
Product Name: Microdilution Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Panels   
Trade Name: MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels   
Intended Use: To determine antimicrobial agent susceptibility   
510(k) Notification: Device Modification  Evaluation of reformulated Vancomycin (K05 1202) versus S. aureus interpretive criteria $( \mathrm { S } \leq 2 , \mathrm { I } = 4 - 8 , \mathrm { R } \geq 1 6 )$ .   
Predicate device: MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels

# 510(k) Summary:

MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci.

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test that have been diluted in broth and dehydrated.Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical intcrest. Panels are rehydrated with water after inoculation with a standardized suspension of thc organism. After incubation in a non- $\mathrm { C O } _ { 3 }$ incubator for 16-20 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is read by determining the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.

The proposed MicroScan Dricd Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with an CLSI frozen Reference Panel, as defined in the FDA document "Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA", dated March 5, 2007.

This Special Premarket Notification [510(k)] presents support of a request for a device modification and the updating of the product labeling with $s .$ aureus interpretive criteria of $( \mathbb { S } \le 2 , \mathbb { I } = 4 \cdot 8 , \mathbb { R } \ge 1 6 )$ .

Data collected from the external validation of vancomycin (K05 1202) was processed using the modified S. aureus interpretive criteria $( \mathrm { S } \leq 2 , \mathrm { I } = 4 - 8 , \mathrm { R } \geq 1 6 )$ . The Dried panel performance was compared with frozen Reference panels using stock and fresh isolates (Efficacy phase), and challenge strains (Challenge phase). Challenge strains were compared to Expected Results determined prior to the evaluation. The Dried Gram-Positive Panel demonstrated acceptable performance with an overall Essential Agreement of $9 9 . 3 \%$ for vancomycin when compared with the frozen Reference panel.

Re: k091264 Trade/Device Name: MicroScan® Dried Gram  Positive MIC/Combo Panels with Vancomycin (0.25 - 128 mcg/ml) Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.1640 Regulation Name: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Powder Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: LTT, LRG,JWY,LTW Dated: July 14, 2009 Received: July 15, 2009

Dear Ms Popson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number (if known):

Device Name: MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels with Vancomycin (0.25 - 128 mcg/ml)

Indication For Use:

The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 16 - 24 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } C + 1 . 1 ^ { \circ } C$ in a non- $C 0 _ { 2 }$ incubator, and read either visually or with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the Package Insert.

This particular submission is for the evaluation of antimicrobial agent vancomycin on the MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels utilizing the updated Staphylococcus aureus interpretative criteria $( \mathtt { S } \le 2 , \mathtt { I } = 4 \ { - } 8 , \mathtt { R } \ge 1 6 )$ .

The gram-positive organisms which may be used for vancomycin susceptibility testing in this panel are:

Enterococcus spp. (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis)   
Staphylococcus spp. (including Staphylococcus aureus)   
Staphylococcus epidermidis (including methicillin-resistant strains)   
Streptococcus agalactiae   
Streptococcus bovis
