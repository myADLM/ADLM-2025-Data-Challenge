TRADE NAME Clearview Advanced ™ Strep A Test

COMMON NAME Rapid Strep A test, Strep A dipstick test

CLASSIFICATION NAME   
Antigens, All Groups, Streptococcus Spp. Serological Reagents (GTY) (per 21 CFR   
866.3740)

PREDICATE DEVICES Genzyme OSOM® Ultra Strep A Test (K992658)

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The Clearview Advanced™ Strep A test is a qualitative, lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of Strep A carbohydrate antigen directly from a throat swab sample. To perform the test, Reagent 1 (R1) is added to the extraction tube which is coated with a mixture of conjugate antibodies and a lytic enzyme extraction reagent.

The lytic enzyme is mixed with colloidal gold conjugated to rabbit anti-Strep A and a second colloidal gold control conjugate antibody. The reagents are dried onto the bottom of an extraction tube forming a red spot. The extraction/conjugate pellet is resuspended with R1 and the throat swab is added to the extraction tube. The Strep A antigen is extracted from the sample and the swab is removed. The test strip is immediately placed in the extracted sample. If Group A Streptococcus is present in the sample, it wil react with the anti-Strep A antibody conjugated to the gold particle. The complex will then be bound by the anti-Strep A capture antibody and a visible red test line wil appear, indicating a positive result. To serve as an onboard procedural control, the blue line observed at the control site prior to running the assay will turn red, indicating that the test has been performed properly. If Strep A antigen is not present, or present at very low levels, only a red control line will appear. If the red control line does not appear, or remains blue, the test result is invalid.

# INTENDED USE

The Clearview Advanced Strep A test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Strep A antigen from throat swab specimens as an aid in the diagnosis of Group A Streptococcal infection.

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The Clearview Advanced Strep A test and the Genzyme OSOM Ultra Test utilize similar lateral flow immunochromatographic technology: Both tests are rapid immunoassays that employ specific antibodies immobilized onto a solid phase to capture and visualize Group A Streptococcal antigens.

# PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

# Clinical Performance

The clinical performance of the Clearview Advanced Strep A test was established in a multi-center, prospective clinical study conducted in 2008-2009 at five geographically diverse physician office, clinics; and emergency departments within the United States.

A total of 297 throat swab specimens were evaluated by comparing the Clearview. Advanced Strep A test to bacterial culture. In this study, sensitivity was 91.5% (95% Cl $8 5 . 0 \%$ to 95.3%) and specificity was $9 5 . 0 \%$ (95% CI 90.7% to $9 7 . 3 \%$ .

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)

The Clearview Advanced Strep A test limit of detection (LOD), defined as the concentration of Group A Streptococcus bacteria that produces positive Clearview Advanced Strep A test results approximately $9 5 \%$ of the time, was identified by evaluating different concentrations of Group A Streptococcus in the Clearview Advanced. Strep A test. The detection limit of the Clearview Advanced Strep A test was determined to be 1x104 organisms/test.

# Analytical Specificity (Cross-Reactivity)

To determine the analytical $\cdot ^ { - }$ specificity of the Clearview Advanced Strep A test, 38 commensal and pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and yeast that may be present in the mouth or throat were tested. All of the following microorganisms were negative when tested at a concentration of 1x10 organisms/test.

Streptococcus Group B Streptococcus salivarius Haemophilus parainfluenzae Neisseria subflava Streptococcus Group C Arcanobacterium haemolyticum Haemophilus influenzae Proteus vulgaris Streptococcus Group F Bordetella pertussis Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Streptococcus Group G. Candida albicans Moraxella catarrhalis Serratia marcescens   
Streptococcus anginosus Corynebacterium diphtheriae Moraxella lacunata Staphylococcus aureus   
Streptococcus mitis Enterococcus faecalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Staphylococcus epidermidis   
Streptococcus mutans Enterococcus faecium. Neisseria lactamica Staphylococcus haemolyticus   
Streptococcus oralis Escherichia coli Neisseria meningitides Yersinia enterocolitica   
Streptococcus pneumoniae Fusobacterium necrophorum. Neisseria mucosa   
Streptococcus sanguis Haemophilus parahaemolyticus Neisseria sicca

# Reproducibility

A blind study of the Clearview Advanced Strep A test was conducted at 3 separate sites using panels of blind coded specimens. Participants tested each sample multiple times on 5 different days, with no significant difference between runs (5 different days), between sites (3 sites), and between operators (6 operators). The results are presented below:
