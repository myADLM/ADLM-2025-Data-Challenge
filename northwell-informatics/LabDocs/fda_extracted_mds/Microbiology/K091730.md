# Device Description

The BD ProbeTec GC $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { Q } } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD ViperT™ System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is determined by calculating the peak

fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.

In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA, a second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the N. gonorrhoeae -specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper System and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and N. gonorrhoeae -specific signals to report results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

# Intended Use

The BD ProbeTecTM Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) $\mathsf { Q } ^ { x }$ Amplified DNA Assay, when tested with the BD ViperTM System in Extracted Mode, uses Strand Displacement Amplification technology for the direct, qualitative detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in clinician-collected female endocervical and male urethral swab specimens, patientcollected vaginal swab specimens (in a clinical setting), and male and female urine specimens (both UPT and Neat). The assay is also intended for use with gynecological specimens collected in BD SurePath™M Preservative Fluid using an aliquot that is removed prior to processing for the BD SurePath™M Pap test. The assay is indicated for use with asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals to aid in the diagnosis of gonococcal urogenital disease.

# Summary and Principles of Operation

When used with the BD Viper System, the BD ProbeTec GC $\mathsf { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay involves automated extraction of DNA from clinical specimens through the chemical lysis of cells, followed by binding of DNA to para-magnetic particles, washing of the bound nucleic acid and elution in an amplification-compatible buffer. When present, N. gonorrhoeae DNA is then detected by Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA) of a specific target sequence in the presence of a fluorescently labeled detector probe.

# Analytical Performance Characteristics

# Limit of Detection (Analytical Sensitivity)

The Limits of Detection (LODs) for the GC $\mathsf { Q } ^ { \boldsymbol { \mathsf { x } } }$ Assay with Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain ATCC 19424 in BD SurePath specimens when extracted on the BD Viper System were determined to be $\leq 1 0 0$ GC cells per mL. The GC $\mathsf { Q } ^ { \boldsymbol { \mathsf { x } } }$ Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode was able to detect 17 GC strains with $\ge 9 5 \%$ proportion positive at a concentration of 50 cells per mL in clean diluted BD SurePath Preservative Fluid.

# Interfering Substances

Potential interfering substances which may be encountered in BD SurePath specimens were extracted from diluted BD SurePath matrix in the absence and presence of GC target (300 GC cells/mL) and tested with the BD ProbeTec GC $\mathsf { Q } ^ { \boldsymbol { x } }$ Amplified DNA Assay on the BD Viper System. Results are summarized in Table 2.

# Clinical Performance Characteristics

Endocervical swab specimens and BD SurePath specimens were collected from 1728 compliant female subjects attending family planning, OB/GYN, and sexually transmitted disease clinics at eleven geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they reported symptoms such as dysuria, coital pain/difficulty/bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge, or pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not report symptoms.

Three randomized endocervical swab specimens and a BD SurePath specimen were collected from each female subject. The three reference endocervical swabs were tested with the BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC assay, the BD ProbeTec GC $\mathsf { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ assay, and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test). Sensitivity and specificity for BD SurePath specimens were calculated by comparing results to a patient infected status (PIS) algorithm. The designation of positive or negative PIS was based on the endocervical swab specimen results from the three reference methods. At least two positive reference results were required to establish a subject as PIS-positive. At least two negative reference results were required to establish a subject as PIS-negative. Sensitivity and specificity by symptomatic status are presented in Table 4.

The distribution of cervical sampling devices used in the clinical study according to clinical collection site is summarized in Table 3.

# Reproducibility

A reproducibility study of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec GC $\mathsf { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Assay was also evaluated for Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) specimens at three clinical sites on one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated specimens comprising CT and GC organisms seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing LBC medium was tested with the BD ProbeTec GC $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { Q } } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ Assay. Uninoculated LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing LBC medium were used for the GC negative samples. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five days on each BD Viper System. The data are summarized in Table 5.

Two additional levels were included in the panels to characterize the reproducibility of test results (i.e., proportion positive or negative) at target levels below the analytical Limit of Detection (LOD) of the BD ProbeTec GC $\mathsf { Q } ^ { \boldsymbol { x } }$ Assay. These additional specimens comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing LBC medium at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100 of the respective analytical LODs of each analyte. These levels were selected to fall within the dynamic range of the analytical LOD curves for the BD ProbeTec CT $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { Q } } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ and GC $\mathsf { Q } ^ { \mathrm { x } }$ assays. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five days across the three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in Table 6.
