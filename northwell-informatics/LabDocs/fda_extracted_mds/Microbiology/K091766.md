TRADE NAME Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test

COMMON NAME Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test, Clearview® Exact PBP2a, Clearview® PBP2a

CLASSIFICATION NAME   
System, Test, Genotypic Detection, Resistant Markers, Staphylococcus Colonies (MYI)   
(per 21 CFR 866.1640)

PREDICATE DEVICES Mueller Hinton Agar w/4% NaCl w/Antibiotics (Remel) K850291 PBP2' Latex Agglutination Test (Oxoid) K011710

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test is a rapid immunochromatographic membrane assay that uses highly sensitive monoclonal antibodies to detect the PBP2a protein directly from bacterial isolates. These antibodies and a control antibody are immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane as two distinct lines and combined with a sample pad, a blue conjugate pad, and an absorption pad to form a test strip.

Isolates are sampled directly from the culture plate and eluted into an assay tube containing Reagent 1. Reagent 2 is then added and the dipstick is placed in the assay tube. Results are read visually at 5 minutes.

# INTENDED USE

The Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test is a qualitative, in vitro immunochromatographic assay for the detection of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) in isolates identified as Staphylococcus aureus, as an aid in detecting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test is not intended to diagnose MRSA nor to guide or monitor treatment for MRSA infections.

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test and the Oxoid PBP2' Latex Agglutination Test (K011710) utilize similar technologies to detect PBP2a in MRSA. Both tests use detection with latex conjugates sensitized with a monoclonal antibody against PBP2a.

The Remel Mueller Hinton Agar (K850291) utilizes a different technology involving microbial growth on Mueller Hinton Agar with $4 \%$ NaCl and $6 \mu \ g / \mathsf { m L }$ Oxacillin.

# PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

# Clinical Performance

The clinical performance of the Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test was established in a multicenter clinical study conducted in 2009 at three geographically-diverse laboratories.

A total of 457 S. aureus samples were evaluated in the Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test, compared to results of ${ 3 0 \mu \ g }$ cefoxitin disk diffusion and interpreted according to CLSI standards. Performance results by plate type are listed in Table 1 below.

# Analytical Performance

# Analytical Reactivity and Specificity

162 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 112 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococus aureus (MSSA) were tested in the Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test with expected results. These bacterial strains were obtained from the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA), American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and a collection of strains from Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology of the Imperial College in London, England.

# Reproducibility Study

A study of the Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test was conducted at 3 separate sites using panels of blind coded specimens containing negative and positive samples. Participants tested each sample twice on 5 different days. There was $9 7 . 3 \%$ (580/596) agreement with expected test results.

Dear Ms. Vogel:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see abovc) into class Ⅱ (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
