# I. Device Description:

The Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test is a rapid immunochromatographic membrane assay that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the PBP2a protein directly from bacterial isolates. These antibodies and a control antibody are immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane as two distinct lines and combined with a sample pad, a blue conjugate pad, and an absorption pad to form a test strip.

Isolates are sampled directly from the culture plate and eluted into an assay tube containing Reagent 1. Reagent 2 is then added and the dipstick is placed in the assay tube. Results are read visually at 5 minutes.

# L. Test Principle:

The Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test is a qualitative, in vitro immunochromatographic assay. The procedure involves adding bacterial colonies to Reagent 1 to lyse the bacterial cell walls and expose the PBP2a protein. Subsequently, Reagent 2 is added to neutralize the sample. Once the test strips is placed in the extraction solution, the extraction solution is absorbed by the sample pad through to the conjugate pad by capillary action. The conjugate pad contains dried blue latex particles sensitized with mouse anti-PBP2a monoclonal antibody. When the sample reaches the conjugate pad, the sensitized latex is dissolved into the sample where an immune complex is formed if PBP2a protein is present in the sample. This mixture then flows into the nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane is coated with two lines: one of which is mouse anti-PBP2a (the test line) and the other is anti-mouse immunoglobulin (the control line). As the sample moves over the nitrocellulose

membrane, a reaction between the immune complex and the coated anti-PBP2a antibodies creates a blue test line in positive samples. Excess conjugate is trapped on the control line. This indicates that the test results are valid.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility study was done at three sites. Testing was done at three sites, using 18-24 hrs isolates that have been sub-cultured, by two operators in duplicates for five days. The reproducibility panel consists of six MRSA, and four MSSA; $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ (2) duplicates $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators $\texttt { X 5 }$ days x 3 sites $= 6 0 0$

Overall reproducibility was $59 5 \%$ b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Storage and Stability   
Product Stability Studies were performed to generate real time and accelerated stability data to support the expiration date of each lot under stated conditions, (i.e., Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Test kits should be stored at room   
temperature or under refrigeration $( 2 \small { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 must be stored refrigerated $( 2 \small { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ).

Stability conditions were set up as follows:

1. Accelerated - Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a devices and Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Reagent $1 ^ { * }$ at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ & Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Reagent 2 at $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

2. Real-time, room temperature- Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a devices and Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Reagent $^ { 1 \ast }$ at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ & Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Reagent 2 at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$

3. Real-time, refrigerated - Clearview $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a devices and Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Reagent 1 & Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Reagent 2 at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$

Three device lots were used to test all test samples and controls using the Control Assay Procedure in the package insert. (The same lot of devices, liquid controls, and kit reagents are being used for the duration of the

stability study). All devices were interpreted at 5 minutes and negative devices were interpreted at 5 and 10 minutes. All samples were run in triplicate using the same plate. Results are outlined in the table below:

For Transfer Lot 3, the device and reagents remained stable after 20 weeks (with and without desiccant) at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 5 months (with desiccant) and 12 weeks (without desiccant) of real-time storage at $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . For Transfer Lot 4, the device and reagents remain stable after 17 weeks (with desiccant) and 10 weeks (without desiccant) at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 4 months (with desiccant) and 15 weeks (without desiccant) of real-time storage at $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Stability continued on transfer lots 3 and 4. Stability testing of each individual component will continue until a 2-year expiration date is achieved.

d. Detection Limit:

A study was conducted using Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC BAA44) and the detection limit was determined to be $1 . 4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

A total of 162 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 112 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and other non-Staphylococcal strains were tested in the Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Test with expected results

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

A clinical study was conducted at three geographically diverse hospital laboratories (two U.S. sites and one non-U.S. site), using prospective and retrospective isolates identified as Staphylococcus aureus.

A total of $5 1 6 S .$ aureus fresh and stock isolates were tested from Tryptic Soy Agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood, Columbia agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood and MuellerHinton Agar induced with a $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ oxacillin disk. Results were compared to those of $3 0 ~ \mu \ g$ cefoxitin disk diffusion, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretation. Of these, $30 \%$ (225/733) were stock isolates. Retrospective S. aureus isolates were also enrolled into the study.
