# SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE'SUMMARY

# AUG 14 2009.

# Intended Use:

VITEK® 2 Gram Negative Meropenem is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gramnegative microorganisms and is intended for use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. ViITEK 2 Gram Negative Meropenem is a quantitative test. Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for the antimicrobial.

Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter species Aeromonas hydrophila

Citrobacter diversus Citrobacter freundii Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Morganella morganii

Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Salmonella species Serratia marcescens Shigella species

The VITEI ${ \hat { \mathbf { x } } } ^ { \otimes } { \boldsymbol { 2 } }$ Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems for the automated quantitative or qualitative susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant aerobic gram-negative bacill, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.

# Device Description:

The principle of the VITEK 2 AST cards is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MiC) technique reported by MacLowry and Marsh (") and Gerlach ).The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique (3).

Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which contains only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture mediaThe bacterial isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45 $- 0 . 5 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manualfilling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each wel in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MiC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.

$\textbf { s } =$ Susceptible: Attainable. levels in blood or tissue on usual usage, including oral administration when applicable.

$| =$ Intermediate: "The "Intermediate" category implies clinical efficacy in body sites where the drugs are physiologically concentrated (e.g., quinolones and B-lactams in urine), or when a higher than normal dosage of drug can be used (e.g., B-lactams). The "Intermediate" category also includes a "buffer zone" which should prevent smal, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretations, especially for drugs with narrow pharmacotoxicity margins."

$\mathsf { R } =$ Resistant to usually achievable systemic concentrations.

# Discussion:

Both devices have similar Intended Use statements. The technological characteristics are similar but not identical. Both devices are designed for susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacilli on the ViTEK 2 Systems and their technological characteristics are similar. The tests use the same base broth and are intended for use on the same VITEK 2 gram negative AST cards. The difference between the new device and the predicate device is related to the antibiotic. Concentrations of the antibiotic in the test wells and the analysis algorithms are unique for each specific antibiotic. In all other respects the two devices are identical.

The safety and effectiveness of VITEK 2 GN Meropenem is not impacted by the technology differences. Clinical studies were performed and demonstrate acceptable performance of VITEK 2 GN Meropenem. Performance is described in the following table.

Dear Ms Weaver:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devisha av beeassif rance wi e rovisions te edeal FoDr, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class [I (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
