Date prepared: June 16, 2009   
Product Name: Microdilution Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Panels Trade Name: MicroScan® MICroSTREP plus Panels   
Intended Use: To determine antimicrobial agent susceptibility   
510(k) Notification: Device Modification - Evaluation of Penicillin (K062773) versus Streptococcus pneumoniae interpretive criteria (meningitis $\mathtt { S } \le 0 . 0 6 , \mathtt { R } \ge$ 0.12 and non-meningitis $\bar { \mathbf { S } } \leq 2 , \mathrm { I } = 4 , \mathrm { R } \geq 8 )$ .   
Predicate device: MicroScan® MICroSTREP plus® Panels

# 510(k) Summary:

MicroScan MICroSTREP $p l u s ^ { \circledast }$ Panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 20-24 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } C + / - 1 ^ { \circ } C$ in a non-CO2 incubator, and read visually or with the MicroScan WalkAway instrument according to the Package Insert.

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test that have been diluted in broth and dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in water, buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with $1 1 5 \mu \vert$ Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with $2 - 5 \%$ lysed horse blood (LHB) and buffered with $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES, after inoculation with a standardized suspension of the organism in saline. After incubation in a non- $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimuin inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is read by determining the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.

The proposed MicroScan MICroSTREP $p l u s ^ { \flat }$ Panel demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with an CLSI frozen Reference Panel, as defined in the FDA document "Class  Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA", dated March 5, 2007.

This Special ${ \displaystyle 5 1 0 ( { \bf k } ) }$ presents data and information in support of updating the penicillin labeling for the updated Streptococcus pneumoniae interpretive criteria (meningitis ${ \bf S } \le 0 . 0 6$ ${ \tt R } \geq 0 . 1 2$ and nonmeningitis ${ \sf S } \leq 2 , { \mathrm { I } } = 4 , { \mathrm { R } } \geq 8 )$ .

The Streptococcus pneumoniae data from the previously cleared Penicillin external evaluations (K062773 and K020626) were compared to the performance of a CLSI frozen Reference panel utilizing the revised interpretative criteria (meningitis $\mathbb { S } \le 0 . 0 6$ , $\mathbb { R } \ge 0 . 1 2$ and non-meningitis $S \le 2$ . $\mathrm { I } = 4$ , $R \geq 8$ ). Challenge strains were compared to Expected Results determined prior to the evaluations. The MICroSTREP $p l u s ^ { \boldsymbol { \mathfrak { P } } }$ Panel demonstrated acceptable performance versus the with an overall Essential Agreement of $9 2 . 5 \%$ for Penicillin when compared with the frozen Reference panel.

Dear Ms. Popson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Iy evi as bovitcas plol) it y  u aditional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title, Codeo Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the

Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796-5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.

You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
