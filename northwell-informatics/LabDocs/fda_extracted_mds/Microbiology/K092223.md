CLASSIFICATION NAME Aritigen, CF (including CF Controls), Influenza Virus A, B, C (per 21 CFR 866.3330)

PREDICATE DEVICE Binax NOW® Influenza A & B Test; K062109

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The BinaxNOW\* Influenza A & B Test is an immunochromatographic membrane assay that uses highly sensitive monoclonal antibodies to detect influenza type A & B nucleoprotein antigens in nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, nasal swab, and nasal wash/aspirate specimens. These antibodies and a control antibody are immobilized onto a membrane support as three distinct lines and combined with other reagents/pads to construct a test strip. This test strip is mounted inside a cardboard, book-shaped binged test device.

Swab specimens require a sample preparation step, in which the sample is eluted off the swab into elution solution or transport media. Nasal wash/aspirate samples require no preparation. Sample is added to the top of the test strip and the test device is closed. Test results are interpreted at 15 minutes based on the presence or absence of pink-to-purple colored Sample Lines. The blue Control Line turns pink in a valid assay.

# INTENDED USE

The BinaxNOw Influenza A & B Test is an in vitro immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of influenza A and B nucleoprotein antigens in nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, and nasal wash/aspirate specimens. It is intended to aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. Negative test results should be confirmed by culture.

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The Expanded Claim BinaxNOw® Influenza A & B Test is exactly the same as the currently 510(k) cleared BinaxNOw® Influenza A & B Test. Both tests use identical lateral flow immunochromatographic technology. Both tests are rapid immunoassays that employ specific antibodies immobilized onto a solid phase to capture and visualize influenza nucleoprotein antigens.

# PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

CLINICAL STUDIES

# BinaxNOW Influenza A & B Test Performance vs. Cell Culture / DFA  Prospective Study

A total of 846 prospective specimens collected from children (less than 18 years of age) and adults (18 years or older) were evaluated in the BinaxNOw\* Influenza A & B Test and compared to culture/DFA. Evaluated specimens include nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal swabs collected from patients presenting with influenza-like symptoms. Forty-four percent $( 4 4 \% )$ of the population tested was male, 56% female, $5 4 \%$ pediatric $( < 1 8$ years), and $4 6 \%$ adult $( \geq 1 8$ years). No differences in test performance were observed based on patient age or gender. A/H3 and A/H1 were the predominant influenza subtypes observed during this time.

BinaxNOW A & B Test performance by sample type versus cell culture / DFA, including $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals, is listed below.

A total of 293 retrospective frozen clinical samples were evaluated in the BinaxNow Influenza A & B Test and compared to culture/DFA. All clinical samples were collected from symptomatic patients at multiple physician offices, clinics and hospitals located in the Southern, Northeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States and from one hospital in Sweden. Fifty-three percent (53%) of the population tested was male, $47 \%$ female, $6 2 \%$ pediatric $( < 1 8$ years) and $3 8 \%$ EY adult (≥ 18 years). Nasal wash/aspirate specimens comprised approximately 61% of the samples tested, while NP swabs represented 39%. No differences in test performance were observed based on patient age and gender or based on sample type tested.

# ANALYTICAL SENSITIVITY

The BinaxNOw" test limit of detection (LOD), defined as the concentration of influenza virus that produces positive BinaxNOw test results approximately $9 5 \%$ of the time, was identified by evaluating different concentrations of inactivated Flu A/Beijing and inactivated Flu B/Harbin in the BinaxNOW test.

Twelve (12) different operators each interpreted 2 devices run at each concentration for a total of 24 determinations per level. The following results identify a concentration of 1.03 x 10² ng/ml as the LOD for Flu A/Beijing and $6 . 0 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { \mathrm { { i } } } \mathrm { { \ n i } } \mathrm { { \bar { g } } / m l }$ for Flu B/Harbin.

# REACTIVITY TESTING

The influenza A and B strains listed tested positive in the BinaxNOw\* Influenza A & B Test at concentrations specified.Although the specific influenza strains causing infection in humans can vary year to year, l contain the conserved nucleoproteins targeted by the BinaxNow test. Performance characteristics of the BinaxNOw" Influenza A & B Test for detecting influenza A virus from human specimens was established when H1 and H3 subtypes were prevalent. Performance characteristics of the test when other influenza A virus subtypes are emerging as human pathogens have not been established.

Although this test has been shown to detect the Flu A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus cultured from a positive human specimen, the performance characteristics of this device with human specimens infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The BinaxNOw® test can distinguish betweeninfluenza A and B viruses, but it does not differentiate seasonal influenza A virus from the novel influenza A (i.e. 2009 H1N1) and it's ability to detect human infection with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in clinical specimens is unknown.

# ANALYTICAL SPECIFICITY (CROSS REACTIVITY)

To determine the analytical specificity of the BinaxNow Influenza A & B Test, 36 commensal and pathogenic microrganisms (27 bacteria, 8 viruses and 1 yeast) that may be present in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx were tested.

# INTERFERING SUBSTANCES

The following substances, naturally present in respiratory specimens or that may be artificially introduced into the nasal cavity or nasopharynx, were evaluated in the BinaxNow Influenza A & B Test at the concentrations listed and were found not to affect test performance. Whole blood (1%) did not interfere with the interpretation of negative BinaxNow® test results, but did interfere with the interpretation of Flu A LOD positive samples. Therefore, visibly bloody samples may not be appropriate for use in this test.

Substance   
1 OTC mouthwash   
3 OTC nasal sprays   
3 OTC throat drops   
2 OTC throat sprays

# TRANSPORT MEDIA

The following transport media were tested in the BinaxNOw Influenza A & B Test as negative samples (no virus present) and after inoculation with the LOD levels of Influenza A & B. Media did not impact BinaxNOw test performance, with the media alone testing negative in the NOW" test and media inoculated with LOD Influenza A & B testing positive on the appropriate test line in BinaxNOW test.

M4 Media   
M4-RT Media   
MS Media   
Phosphate Buffer Solution   
Saline   
Stuart's Media   
Tryptose Phosphate Broth   
UTM-RT Media

It has been determined that Sucrose-Phosphate Buffer may not be suitable for use with this test.

# REPRODUCIBILITY

A blind study of the BinaxNOw\* Influenza A & B Test was conducted at 3 separate sites using panels of blind coded specimens containing negative, low positive, and moderate positive samples. Participants tested each sample multiple times on 3 different days. There was $9 7 \%$ (242/250) agreement with expected test results, with no significant differences within run (replicates tested by one operator), between run (3 different days) or between sites (3 sites).
