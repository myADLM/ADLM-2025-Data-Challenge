# LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE

$\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit, K061101

# DESCRIPTION of DEVICE MODIFICATION

The product insert has been modified. The following has been added (see below):

Table 15 in the product insert has been updated to include reactivity data on influenza A virus Mexico/4108/2009 and California/07/2009 strains. The following language was included with the data:

"Although this test has been shown to detect the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in two cultured isolates, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical

specimens that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The $D ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot differentiate influenza subtypes."

# INTENDED USE

The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. ${ \bf D } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) RESPIRATORY VIRUS SCREENING & ID KIT is intended for the qualitative detection and identification of the Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2 and Parainfluenza 3 virus in respiratory specimens, by either direct detection or cell culture method, by immunofluorescence using fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). It is recommended that specimens found to be negative after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A/H3 and A/H1 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a ${ \mathrm { B S L } } 3 +$ fyab  ulu.

# II. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION OF THE TEST

With the addition of new antiviral drugs for the treatment of Influenza', more rapid and sensitive tests for respiratory virus detection4" and the increasing need to be more discriminating in the use of antibiotics", early detection and identification of the infecting viral agent has grown substantially in importance. Viral identification is becoming increasingly important in ruling out bacteria as the cause of respiratory infections. Virus identification by either direct antigen detection or cell culture using fluorescent monoclonal antibodies continues to be the standard method in virology laboratories.

# 35 Influenza A and B

Influenza viruses (family Orthomyxoviridae) contain a single-stranded RNA genome which is present in 8 separate segments of ribonucleoprotein. This segmentation of the genome is rare among viruses and probably contributes to the rapid development of new influenza strains through interchange of gene segments if two different viruses infect the same cell. There are 3 types of influenza, A, B and C. Type A has counterparts in birds and pigs as well as humans, while types B and C are known only in man. Due to the possibility of another pandemic caused by Influenza A, as occurred in 1918 when 25-35 million people worldwide died, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World

44 Health Organization (WHO) maintain surveillance of influenza strains and make   
45 predictions of suitable strains for vaccine production.   
46 Influenza infects an estimated 120 million people in the US, Europe and Japan each year   
47 and it is estimated that in the US there are 75,000 deaths annually from pneumonia caused   
48 by influenza. Primary viral pneumonia or pneumonia from secondary bacterial infections   
49 are the primary causes of morbidity of the viral infection.' Pandemics of influenza A   
50 occur about every 10 to 30 years and epidemics of either influenza A or B occur annually.   
51 Infections are seasonal, typically extending from November to April in the northern   
52 hemisphere. Complications tend to occur in the young, elderly and persons with chronic   
53 cardio-pulmonary diseases.   
54 Incubation time is 1-3 days with rapid spread by inhalation via aerial droplets and fomites   
55 It is characterized by fever, myalgia, headache and pharyngitis. .

Influenza A and B are most commonly isolated in A549/Mv1Lu mixtures (R-MixTM1), A549/MDCK mixtures (R-Mix TooTM1), Rhesus MK, MDCK, MRC-5 and $\mathrm { \bf A 5 4 9 \ c e l l s ^ { 8 } }$

# 58 Adenovirus

59 Adenoviruses (family Adenoviridae) are non-enveloped, double stranded DNA viruses.   
60 There are 49 serotypes, further divided into 6 groups, A to F, with most associated with   
61 respiratory and ocular infections. Generally, adenovirus infections in adults have a low   
62 morbidity with the exceptions of immunocompromised patients and individuals living in   
63 cramped quarters where infections can cause atypical pneumonia. Virus spread is   
64 commonly via aerial droplets and fomites where they infect the mucous membranes of the   
65 eye, respiratory tract and $\mathrm { g u t } ^ { 9 }$ .   
56 Adenovirus can be isolated in A549/Mv1Lu mixtures (R-Mix™M), A549/MDCK mixtures   
57 (R-Mix TooTM), HEp2, HEK, A549 and MRC-5 cell.8

# 68 Parainfluenza Viruses 1, 2 and 3

69 Parainfluenza viruses (family Paramyxoviridae) are enveloped viruses with a single,   
70 negative strand RNA genome. The 4 different types, 1 to 4, cause croup and viral   
71 pneumonia in children under the age of 5 years and cause upper respiratory illness in   
72 adults. Parainfluenza is the number 2 leading cause of lower respiratory illness in children   
73 (after RSV). Outbreaks caused by parainfluenza viruses occur during alternate years in the   
74 fall (P1 and P2) or throughout the year, with increased activity in the spring (P3)10.   
75 Parainfluenza viruses can be isolated in A549/Mv1Lu mixtures (R-Mix™M), A549/MDCK   
76 mixtures (R-Mix TooTM), Rhesus MK, MRC-5 and LLC-MK2 cells. Trypsin is helpful in   
77 the medium for recovery of types 1 and 2 but not type $3 ^ { 8 }$

# Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)

3 RSV (family Paramyxoviridae) is an enveloped virus with a single, negative strand RNA   
) genome. RSV infections cause viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and the   
1 common cold in adults". RSV is usually a seasonal (winter and early spring) infection   
2 with epidemics lasting up to 5 months. Peak mortality due to RSV occurs in 3-4 month   
3 old infants. There are two major subtypes, A and B; Subtype B is characterized as the   
1 asymptomatic strain that the majority of the population experiences. The more severe   
866   
87 Re-infections do occur but tend to be limited to minor upper respiratory infections"3. RSV   
88 is also now recognized as a significant problem in certain adult populations. These include   
89 the elderly, persons with cardiopulmonary diseases, and immunocompromised hosts14.

92 RSV is commonly detected directly in cells from the nasopharyngeal epithelium by staining with immunofluorescent reagents'2 although it can be isolated in cell cultures of 93 A549/Mv1Lu mixtures (R-Mix™M), A549/MDCK mixtures (R-Mix TooTM), HEp2, Vero, 94 LLC-MK2 and MRC-5 cells\*.

# III. PRINCIPLE OF THE PROCEDURE

98 The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. D3 Ultra DFA RESPIRATORY VIRUS SCREENING & ID   
99 KIT uses viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly labeled   
100 with fluorescein for the rapid detection and identification of respiratory viruses.   
101 The kit includes a DFA Screening Reagent that contains a blend of murine monoclonal   
102 antibodies (MAbs) directed against seven respiratory viruses (Influenza A, Influenza B,   
103 Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, and   
104 Parainfluenza 3) plus seven separate DFA Reagents, each consisting of MAb blends   
105 directed against a single respiratory virus. The kit can be used for direct specimen or cell   
106 culture screening and final virus identification.   
107 The cells to be tested, either derived from a clinical specimen or cell culture, are fixed in   
108 acetone. The DFA Screening Reagent is added to the cells to determine the presence of   
109 viral antigens. After incubating at $3 5 \%$ to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , the stained cells are rinsed with the   
110 diluted Wash Solution. A drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added and a coverslip is   
111 placed on the prepared cells. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope.   
112 Virus infected cells will be stained with viral specific apple-green fluorescence when   
113 stained with the DFA Screening Reagent while uninfected cells will contain no   
114 fluorescence but will be stained red by the Evan's Blue counter-stain. If the specimen   
115 contains fluorescent cells, the particular virus is identified using the separate DFA   
116 Reagents on new, separate cell preparations.   
117 If on examination of a direct stained specimen, no fluorescent-stained cells are found and   
118 all the cells stain red from the Evan's Blue, it is recommended that the specimen be   
119 cultured and stained using the DFA Screening Reagent. If fluorescent cells are seen, the   
120 identification of the virus is determined as described above.   
121 Cell preparations are fixed in acetone. The individual DFA reagents are added to the cell   
122 preparations. After incubating at $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 7 \%$ , the stained cells are rinsed with the diluted   
123 Wash Solution. A drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added and a coverslip is placed   
124 on the stained cells. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope for the   
125 presence of viral specific apple-green fluorescence. The unknown respiratory virus is then   
126 identified and reported.

# B. Warnings and Precautions

1. For in vitro diagnostic use.

2. Cells may have some potential to be hazardous. Personnel working with these cultures must be properly trained in safe handling techniques15,16,17, and have experience with tissue culture before attempting this procedure.

3. All procedures must be conducted in accordance with the CDC $4 ^ { 1 1 }$ edition Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 1999, and CLSI Approved Guideline M29-A, Protection of Laboratory Workers from Instrument Biohazards and Infectious Disease Transmitted by Blood, Body Fluids, and Tissue.

4. Acetone, a reagent that is required for the test but not provided in the kit, is a flammable, volatile organic solvent. Use it in a well-ventilated area and keep away from flames and other sources of ignition.

5. Sodium azide is included in the Wash Solution Concentrate at $4 \%$ , and in the other solutions in this kit at $0 . 1 \%$ .A MSDS for sodium azide or for Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc (DHI) reagents containing sodium azide is available by contacting a Diagnostic Hybrids' Technical Service Representative.

a. Reagents containing sodium azide should be considered a poison. If products containing sodium azide are swallowed, seek medical advice immediately and show product container or label. [Refer to NIOSH, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; CAS#: 2628-22-8; and also to GHS, The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals.] b. Aqueous solutions of sodium azide, when mixed with acids, may liberate toxic gas (sodium azide in water exists is ionic equilibrium with hydrazoic acid, which when mixed with acid may liberate a toxic gas).

c. Any reagents containing sodium azide should be evaluated for proper disposal. Sodium azide may react with lead and copper plumbing to form highly explosive metal azides. If products containing sodium azide are discarded into a drain, flush with a large volume of water to prevent azide build-up. Check with regulatory agencies to determine at what concentration sodium azide may cause a product to be regulated as hazardous waste.

6.Evan's Blue counter-stain is a potential carcinogen. If skin contact occurs, flush with water immediately.

The DFA Reagents are supplied at working strength. Any dilution of the DFA Reagents will decrease sensitivity.

214 8. Reagents should be used prior to their expiration date.

Each Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slide should be used only once. Do not reuse a Control Slide.

10. Microbial contamination of DFA Reagents may cause a decrease in sensitivity.

11. Store 1X Wash Solution and PBS in a clean container to prevent contamination.

12. All specimens and materials used to process them should be considered potentially infectious and handled in a manner which prevents infection of laboratory personnel. Decontamination is most effectively accomplished using a $0 . 0 5 \%$ solution of sodium hypochlorite (1:100 dilution of household bleach).

13. Although Antigen Control Slides have been shown to be non-infectious, the same precautions taken in handling and disposing of other infectious materials should be employed in their use.

14. Never pipette reagents or clinical samples by mouth; avoid all contact of clinical samples with broken skin.

5. Avoid splashing and the generation of aerosols with clinical samples.

16. Use aseptic technique and sterile equipment and materials for all tissue culture procedures.

17. Reusable glassware must be washed and thoroughly rinsed free of all detergents

8.Do not expose DFA Reagents to bright light during staining or storage.

19. Use of other reagents than those specified with the components of this kit may lead to erroneous results.

# C. Preparation of 1X Wash Solution

1. After storage at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to ${ \bf 8 ^ { \circ } C }$ , some salts in the Wash Solution Concentrate may have crystallized. Warm the solution to room temperature to re-dissolve the crystals and mix.

2. Add contents of the fully dissolved 25-mL Wash Solution Concentrate to $9 7 5 { \mathrm { - } } { \mathrm { m L } }$ of de-mineralized water.

3. · Label the 1X Wash Solution with a sixty (60) day expiration date after reconstitution and store at room temperature ( $2 0 ^ { \circ }$ to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$

# E. Stability

Reagents and components will retain their full potency through the expiration date shown on the label of each bottle when stored at recommended temperatures. Light exposure of the DFA Reagents should be kept to a minimum.   
Discard 1X Wash Solution if it becomes cloudy.

# V. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION

Proper collection and handling of the patient specimen are the most important factors in successful respiratory virus detection. Specimen collection, specimen processing, and cell culture of viruses should be attempted only by personnel that have been trained in such procedures. Care should be taken during all specimen collection and handling to avoid generation of aerosols.

# A. Specimen Collection18

Aspirates and Washes containing secretions from the nasopharyngeal epithelium provide the best specimens for direct specimen testing since they will contain large numbers of epithelial cells.

Aspirates can be collected using a sterile, soft polyethylene #8 infant feeding tube attached to a disposable aspiration trap connected to a suction device.

Washes can be collected by instilling and aspirating 1- to $2 { \tt m L }$ of saline in the patient's nostril while the patient is in a supine position.

Aspirates and washes should be diluted with equal volumes of transport medium contained in a centrifuge tube with several sterile glass beads.

Swabs from nasal, throat and nasopharyngeal areas often do not contain sufficient numbers of columnar epithelial cells to allow for direct specimen detection of respiratory viruses.

# B. Specimen Transport and Storage

All potentially infectious agents should be transported according to International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Civil Aviation Organization, (ICAO), Titles 42 and 49 of the US Code of Federal Regulations, or other regulatory requirements, as may be applicable.

Specimens should be transported on wet ice to the laboratory and processed and tested as soon as possible and then stored at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 \%$ .

Specimens should be stored at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 \%$ for no longer than 48 hours before being tested. If longer storage is required, the specimens should be frozen at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ or lower.

Freezing and thawing of specimens should be avoided since this will result in a loss of viability of viruses, leading to decreased sensitivity of the test.

# 356 C. Preliminary Comments and Precautions

1. Adhere to the recommended volumes and times in the following procedure to ensure that accurate results are obtained.

2. For specimen swabs received in transport medium with glass beads, vortex vigorously for about 15 seconds to dissociate adhered cells. For swabs not received in transport medium, transfer them to a tube of transfer medium containing glass beads and vortex vigorously for about 15 seconds to dissociate adhered cells.

3. When staining with fluorescent reagents and examining cells microscopically for fluorescence, it is very important to include controls, both positive and negative, to monitor the procedure and performance of the reagents. It is recommended that such controls be run with each batch of patient specimens.

4. The closed, humidified container for holding the slides during incubation should be kept in the incubator so it is at incubator temperature when the slides are placed in it. By doing this, the cells and antibody solution will come up to temperature more rapidly, yielding more intense stains in shorter periods of time.

REGARDING CELL CULTURE TESTING:

5Good Laboratory Practice dictates that positive and negative virus controls be run with each new batch of cells to confirm their performance in culturing specific viruses.

6. It is good practice to retain the medium removed from the positive monolayers until after staining results have been obtained. If there is any question concerning the specimen results, the medium can be passed to another monolayer for repeat testing.

7. If using cell cultures in polystyrene multi-well plates, the acetone fixative must be diluted with water to $80 \%$ by adding $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ of water to $8 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of acetone.

8. Do not allow the monolayers to dry before fixing; this can lead to high background staining and decreased sensitivity.

Do not allow the antibody reagents to dry on the monolayers; this can lead to high background.

# REGARDING IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY:

10. It is good practice to examine the positive and negative controls before examining the test specimens. If one of these fails to perform as expected, review the steps and conditions under which the test was performed to determine the cause(s). Do not report results until controls perform properly.

11. There are three aspects of the fluorescence microscope that must be functioning properly and optimally in order to achieve maximum brightness of fluorescence:

i. The activation light source has a finite life and as it ages, its output decreases, resulting in lower fluorescence intensity from the DFAs.   
ii. The light source is focused by a number of lenses and mirror(s). For maximum intensity, these must be properly aligned.   
iii. The filters used in the light path must be appropriate for the particular fluor, in this case, fluorescein.

12. There are several fluorescent artifacts that may be observed in the cell monolayers being examined:

i. Cell debris, lint, etc. can nonspecifically adsorb DFAs, resulting in highly intense fluorescence. These can be identified by their morphology, i.e., they don't have the appearance of a complete cell and typically do not appear to be a part of the monolayer like the other cells.   
ii. A low grade, yellow-green fluorescence may sometimes be seen, particularly in areas that have piled cells or are near holes in the cell monolayer. In both cases, the diffusion of the entrapped DFAs is retarded during the wash step, resulting in the nonspecific fluorescence.   
iii. Intense fluorescence around the periphery of slide wells is indicative of drying of the DFA Reagent during incubation, suggesting that it was incubated too long or the humidity was not controlled.   
iv. Inadequate removal of the mucus from direct specimens can lead to nonspecific adsorption of DFAs.   
v. Inadequate washing can lead to a general low grade fluorescence due to residual DFAs remaining on the monolayer of cells.   
vi. On direct specimens, beware of trapping of fluorescence by leukocytes and monocytes. Also, the presence of RBCs in the specimen may leave a green haze on the sample.

13. Quenching or fading of the fluorescence of the stained cells may occur on exposure to light, particularly light of high intensity. Slides should be protected as much as possible during the assay.

# D. Specimen Preparation

1. Vortex the specimen vigorously for 10 to 15 seconds.   
2. Centrifuge at 400 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { x g }$ for 5 to 10 minutes.   
3. Collect and set aside the supernatant for viral isolation. (See Step VI.G.9 below.)   
4. Add $5 \mathrm { m L }$ of PBS and vortex vigorously for 10 to 15 seconds.   
5. Centrifuge at 400 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { x g }$ for 5 to 10 minutes.   
6. Remove the supernatant and the mucus layer above the cell pellet taking care not to disturb the cell pellet.   
7. Repeat steps 4 through 6 until the mucus layer has been completely removed. NOTE: It is important to remove all the mucus since it can cause nonspecific fluorescence.   
8. Add 0.5 to $1 { \mathrm { - m L } }$ of PBS.   
9. Mix the suspension by pipetting up and down to re-suspend the cell pellet, forming a slightly cloudy suspension. This cell suspension will be used for Direct Specimen Testing (See Section VI.E., below). NOTE: The quality of the slide preparation is dependent on the concentration of cells in the suspension; too many cells make it difficult to read the result and too few decrease the sensitivity of the procedure. Specimens may also be cytofuged if a monolayer is preferred.   
10. For use in Cell Culture Testing (See Section VI. G., F., and H.), add the supernatant that was reserved in Step VI.D.3. above, to the cell suspension that remains after Direct Specimen Testing. Add a few sterile glass beads to the tube and vortex for about 15 seconds to break up the cells and release any virus. Repeat this step for each specimen.

# E. Direct Specimen Testing

1. Spot $2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the suspension on each well of a 2-well and an 8-well slide. Repeat this step for each specimen.

4. Remove the slides from the fixative and allow to air dry.   
5. Add one drop of the DFA Screening Reagent to completely cover the dried, fixed cells on one well of each of the 2-well slides.   
6. Also, to each of the wells of a fresh Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slide add one drop of the DFA Screening Reagent. An Antigen Control Slide should be stained only once, as it contains individual wells of viral infected cells and noninfected cells.   
7. Add one drop of the Normal Mouse Gamma Globulin DFA Reagent to completely cover the dried, fixed cells on the other well of each of the 2-well slides.   
8. Place the slides in a covered chamber at $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 7 \%$ for 15 to 30 minutes.

10. Discard the used wash and repeat the washing step using new 1X Wash Solution.   
11. Rinse the stained cells using de-mineralized water. For only a few slides, this can be done using a beaker of the de-mineralized water. For many slides, a slide carrier that holds 10 to 20 slides can be placed in its container with de-mineralized water. For effective rinsing, dip the slide(s) up and down a minimum of four times.   
12. Blot the excess 1X Wash Solution, add a small drop of Mounting Fluid to each cell-containing well and cover the wells with a coverslip.   
13. Examine the stained, mounted cells using a fluorescence microscope with magnifications between 100X to 400X. (See Section VI. C. 10-12, 'Regarding Immunofluorescence Microscopy')   
14. Refer to Section VII., 'Interpretation of Results'.   
15. If the result is positive for respiratory virus, the staining procedure may be repeated using the reserved 8-well specimen slides in order to identify which respiratory virus may be present. i. Add one drop of each individual virus DFA Reagent to its corresponding well on the 8-well specimen slide. Leave one well as a negative. ii. For the Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slide, add one drop of each individual virus DFA Reagent to its corresponding labeled well. An Antigen Control Slide should be stained only once, as it contains individual wells of viral infected cells and non-infected cells. iii. Continue with steps 8 through 14, above.

8. Prepare cell spots using about $2 5 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the suspension on each well of a 2-well and an 8-well slide. Repeat this step for each specimen.   
9. Air dry the wells completely.   
10. Fix the cells to the slides using fresh, chilled acetone. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes, at $2 0 ^ { \circ }$ to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ cw   
11. Remove the slides from the fixative and allow to air dry.   
12. Add one drop of the DFA Screening Reagent to completely cover the dried, fixed cells on one well of each of the 2-well slides.   
13. Also, to each of the wells of a fresh Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slide, add one drop of the DFA Screening Reagent. An Antigen Control Slide should be stained only once, as it contains individual wells of viral infected cells and noninfected cells.   
14. Place the slides in a covered chamber at $3 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ to $3 7 \%$ for 15 to 30 minutes.   
15. Rinse the stained cells using the 1X Wash Solution. For only a few slides, this can be done using a beaker of the 1X Wash Solution. For many slides, a slide carrier that holds 10 to 20 slides can be placed in its container with 1X Wash Solution. For effective rinsing, dip the slide(s) up and down a minimum of four times.   
16. Discard the used wash and repeat the washing step using new 1X Wash Solution.

An Antigen Control Slide should be stained only once, as it contains individual wells of viral infected cells and non-infected cells. iii. Continue with steps 14 through 21 above.

# G. Cell Culture Testing - Shell Vial

1. Calculate the number of vials needed based on the staining protocol to be used (this staining protocol requires 3-vials):

i. One vial is required for each day the culture will be screened with the DFA Screening Reagent (i.e. staining at 16- to 24-hours, and then at 48- to 72- hours, requires 2 vials).   
ii. One additional vial is required for preparing 8-well slides used to identify the viruses from positive screens.

16. Aspirate the DFA Screening Reagent from the monolayers.

18. Remove the 1X Wash Solution by aspiration, repeat the wash step and again remove by aspiration.

19. Add 1-mL of de-mineralized water.

20. Remove the de-mineralized water by aspiration.

22. Examine the stained monolayers using a fluorescence microscope with magnifications between 100X to 400X. (See Section VI. C. 10-12, 'Regarding Immunofluorescence Microscopy')

23. Refer to Section VII., 'Interpretation of Results'.

24. If the result is positive for respiratory virus, process a reserved replicate culture as a cell suspension and spot onto an 8-well specimen slide in order to identify which respiratory virus may be present (see Section VI.F. steps 6 through 11, for procedure to prepare a specimen slide), then:

i. Add one drop of each individual virus DFA Reagent to its corresponding well on the 8-well specimen slide. Leave one well as a negative.

ii. For the Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slide, add one drop of each individual virus DFA Reagent to its corresponding labeled well. An Antigen Control Slide should be stained only once, as it contains individual wells of viral infected cells and non-infected cells.   
iii. Continue with VI. F. steps 14 through 15.

# H. Cell Culture Testing - Multi-well Plate

1. Calculate the number of wells needed for the staining protocol to be used (this staining protocol requires 3-wells):

i. One well is required for each day the culture will be screened with the DFA Screening Reagent (i.e. staining at 16- to 24-hours, and again at 48- to 72- hours, requires 2-wells).   
ii. One additional well is required for preparing 8-well slides used to identify the viruses from positive screens.

24. If the result is positive for respiratory virus, process a reserved replicate culture as a cell suspension and spot onto an 8-well specimen slide in order to identify which respiratory virus may be present (see Section VI.F. steps 6 through 11, for procedure to prepare a specimen slide), then: i. Add one drop of each individual virus DFA Reagent to its corresponding well on the 8-well specimen slide. Leave one well as a negative. ii. For the Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slide, add one drop of each individual virus DFA Reagent to its corresponding labeled well. An Antigen Control Slide should be stained only once, as it contains individual wells of viral infected cells and non-infected cells. ii.Continue with VI.F, steps 14 through 21.

# I. Quality Control

A fresh Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slide should be stained each time the staining procedure is performed to ensure proper test performance. The positive wells will show multiple infected cells of bright apple-green fluorescence with negative cells staining a dull red due to the included Evan's Blue counter-stain. The negative well will show only negative cells staining a dull red. Positive and negative controls must demonstrate appropriate fluorescence for specimen results to have validity. Antigen Control Slides may also aid in the interpretation of patient specimens.

The use of the Normal Mouse Gamma Globulin DFA Reagent in the direct specimens is to rule out those rare instances where cells are present that bind the $\mathrm { F _ { c } }$ portion of the mouse gamma globulin which could lead to a false positive result.

# VII. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS

It is recommended that controls be examined first to ensure proper test performance before examination of the specimens. A positive reaction is one in which bright apple-green fluorescence is observed in the infected cells. Uninfected cells will stain dull red due to the Evan's Blue counter-stain included in the DFA Reagent. Technologists should not confuse cell clumps which may fluoresce due to entrapment of antibody with virusspecific staining. Occasionally, dead, rounded cells due to specimen toxicity or improper cell storage may nonspecifically stain a dull olive green due to trapped antibody. Adequate washing between steps will help to eliminate this type of nonspecific staining.

# FLUORESCENT STAINING PATTERN OF RESPIRATORY VIRUS INFECTED CELLS

The "typical" apple-green fluorescence staining pattern for each virus is as follows: Influenza A and B: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic, nuclear or both. Cytoplasmic staining is often punctate with large inclusions while nuclear staining is uniformly bright.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate with small inclusions in the syncytia.

Adenovirus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate or bright nuclear or both. Parainfluenza 1, 2. 3: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate with irregular inclusions. Types 2 and 3 cause the formation of syncytia.

Co-infection with more than one infecting virus present in the specimen has been reported in a number of studies. The presence of multiple viruses is indicated when more than one well of the 8-well slide has fluorescent cells. The identification of the viruses is based on the individual virus DFA Reagents showing fluorescence. In such a case, it should be reported as ".. and ... detected by direct specimen testing." or "... and ... isolated by cell culture."

# A. Results from Direct Specimen Testing

The quality of the specimen with respect to the number of epithelial cells in the sample can be assessed by examining the different fields at a magnification of 200X. A satisfactory specimen should have at least 2 columnar epithelial cells per field. A negative result is indicated by the absence of fluorescence in a minimal sampling of 20 columnar epithelial cells. An inadequate sample is indicated by fewer than 20 columnar epithelial cells present in the sample, in which case the test is considered invalid. A new specimen should be obtained and tested or cell culture of the remaining specimen should be initiated.

A satisfactory specimen with no fluorescent cells found should be reported as "Presumptively negative, no Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3 detected by direct specimen testing". However, such negative results should be confirmed using cell culture.

Specimens negative by direct specimen testing but yielding positive culture results should be reported as " isolated by cell culture", where 'is the appropriate virus, e. Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3 (see section VII.B, 'Results from Culture Isolation / Confirmation', below).

If fluorescent cells are found, continue with the Testing Procedure, staining with the individual virus DFA Reagents (according to section VI.E.). The individual virus DFA Reagent that yields fluorescent cells represents the identification of the respiratory virus. In such a case, it should be reported as ".. detected by direct specimen testing", where is the appropriate virus, e.. Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratry Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3.

# B. Results from Culture Isolation / Confirmation

The entire cell spot or monolayer of cells must be examined for virus-infected, fluorescent cells. If no fluorescent cells are found, the results of testing of the specimen should be reported as, "No Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3 isolated by cell culture." If fluorescent cells are found, continue with the Testing Procedure, staining with the individual virus DFA Reagents (according to the appropriate sections VI. F., G., and H.). The individual virus DFA Reagent that yields fluorescent cells represents the identification of the respiratory virus. In such a case, it should be reported as ". isolated by cell culture", where "..is the appropriate virus, e.g. Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, Parainfluenza 3, or Adenovirus.

# VIII. LIMITATIONS OF PROCEDURE

1. Inappropriate specimen collection, storage, and transport may lead to false negative culture results   
2. Assay performance characteristics have not been established for direct specimen staining on specimens other than respiratory specimens. It is the user's responsibility to establish assay performance for specimens other than respiratory specimens.   
3. Incubation times or temperatures other than those cited in the test instructions may give erroneous results.   
4. Detection of viruses will vary greatly depending upon the specimen quality and subsequent handling. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of virus infection. Results of the test should be interpreted in conjunction with information available from epidemiological studies, clinical evaluation of the patient and other diagnostic procedures.   
5. The effects of antiviral therapy on the performance of this kit have not been established.   
6. The monoclonal antibodies used in this kit are from hybridomas created using viral infected cells as the immunogen. The specific viral antigens detected by the antibodies are undetermined.   
7. Since the monoclonal antibodies have been prepared using defined virus strains, they may not detect all antigenic variants or new strains of the viruses, should they arise. Monoclonal antibodies may fail to detect strains of viruses which have undergone minor amino acid changes in the target epitope region.   
8. The monoclonal antibodies used in this kit are not group-specific and therefore cannot be used to differentiate among the different types of Adenovirus and RSV.   
9. The viral antigens detected in some direct specimens may be from non-viable virus and cannot be isolated by culture. This is particularly true of RsV which is known for its instability and loss ofviay.   
10. A negative direct specimen should be inoculated into an appropriate cell culture and incubated to isolate and identify any respiratory virus that may be present in the specimen.   
11. A negative result on a direct or cultured specimen does not rule out the presence of virus.   
12. Performance of the kit can only be assured when components used in the assay are those supplied by Diagnostic Hybrids.   
13. Prolonged storage of the DFA Reagents under bright light will decrease the staining intensity.   
14. Light background staining may occur with specimens contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus strains containing large amounts of protein A. Protein A will nonspecifically bind to the Fc portions of conjugated antibodies. Such binding can be distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S. aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small ( ${ \bf \tilde { \rho } } ^ { - 1 }$ micron diameter), bright dots. Results from cell cultures with bacterial contamination must, therefore, be interpreted with caution.

# IX. EXPECTED VALUES

Respiratory virus infections are often seasonal, with Influenza typically extending from November to April in the northern hemisphere, and Adenovirus infections occurring more often during late winter to early summer. RSV is usually a seasonal (winter and early spring) infection as well, with epidemics lasting up to 5 months, while outbreaks caused by parainfluenza viruses may occur throughout a year.

The clinical studies described in Section X ('Specific Performance Characteristics') were comprised of respiratory specimens collected during the winter to early spring months of 2005/2006. Prevalence of the respiratory viruses within the population of specimens that were prospectively collected and tested fresh are noted in Table 2 below (also, see Study 1-DS in Section X).

# X. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

This study included eight hundred and forty nine (849) original specimens evaluated by this product ("Subject" test) and a currently marketed DFA Screening & Identification Kit ("Predicate" test). All 849 specimens were studied by Direct Specimen (DS) testing with 22 of these specimens having insufficient cell numbers to be evaluated, and one other which could not be evaluated because it exhibited non-specific staining from the Normal Mouse Gamma Globulin DFA Reagent; 520 of the specimens also were studied by Cell Culture (CC) method with one specimen not evaluated because it produced a toxic cell

culture monolayer. All but 30 of the specimens were prospectively collected during the 2005-2006 season; those 30 specimens had been archived as Parainfluenza-positive. In addition, a set of 81 clinical isolates were tested by CC methods only. The evaluations were conducted at three laboratory sites: (1) A reference laboratory in northeast United States; (2) A hospital laboratory in northeast United States; and (3) An internal reference laboratory using specimens collected from an external hospital laboratory.

Percent Agreement between the Subject and Predicate tests was calculated for prospectively collected specimens. For the DFA Screening Reagent:

By DS method using fresh specimens, positive percent agreement is $9 5 . 5 \%$ and negative percent agreement is $9 8 . 3 \%$ (see Table 3). By DS method using frozen specimens, both positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement are $100 \%$ (see Table 4).

# A. Prospectively collected specimens:

Clinical Study Sites 1, 2, and 3 generated data for Direct Specimen (DS) Testing according to the study design briefly summarized for each site.

Clinical Study Sites 2 and 3 generated data for Cell Culture (CC) Testing according to study design as summarized for each site.

Study 1-DS - Direct Specimen Method: The study consisted of a total of 329 fresh specimens submitted February through May, 2006, to the laboratory for respiratory virus testing. Slides were prepared from PBS-washed cells from the fresh specimens and fixed according to the prescribed protocol. The slides were stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ until testing was performed. The slides were brought to room temperature and stained in accordance with the procedure in the Predicate product insert (same procedure for both Subject and Predicate devices). Three (3) specimens were found to contain insufficient numbers of cells for interpretation of DS stain results, leaving 326 specimens for evaluation. The results of this testing are summarized in Table 7 below:

With the exception of 4 specimens, the DS test results were concordant for both the screen and the identification of the individual viruses; the Predicate device

identified 4 specimens as being negative while the Subject device identified one as Flu B and three as Para 3 infections. All but one of the Para 3 specimens were confirmed by culture; the one Para 3, although strongly positive by the Subject assay, could not be cultured to confirm it as a Para 3. The culture method was not performed on the rest of the specimens from this site.

Study 2-DS - Direct Specimen Method: The study consisted of 192 specimens submitted to the laboratory for respiratory virus testing during December 2005 through February 2006, with residual specimen material stored at $- 7 0 \%$ from a few days to 2 months. The frozen specimens were thawed and processed between 13 February to 17 February 2006 according to the procedure in the Predicate product insert (same procedure for both Subject and Predicate devices).

Slides were prepared from the specimens according to instructions detailed in the Predicate device's product insert. These slides were stained with both the Predicate and Subject devices and interpreted according to the Predicate device's product insert procedure (same procedure for both Subject and Predicate devices). All of the frozen/thawed specimens had sufficient intact cells for interpretation. The results of this testing are summarized in Table 8 below:

The DS test results were concordant for both the Screen and the ID reagents.

Study 2-CC - Cell Culture Method: The same 192 specimens that were evaluated by DS testing were also processed according to the Predicate device's product insert procedure for cell culture (same procedure for both Subject and Predicate devices). Briefly, $2 0 0 { \cdot } \mu \mathrm { L }$ from the specimens were inoculated onto each of 4 monolayers of R-MixTM Too FreshCellsTM contained in shell vials which were centrifuged for 60 minutes at $7 0 0 \mathrm { x g }$ and incubated for 24-hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 7 \%$ .

The CC test results were concordant for both the Screen and the ID of the specific viruses.

Study 3-DS - Direct Specimen Method: The study consisted of 298 specimens originally received by a hospital laboratory in the eastern US for respiratory virus testing during January through March 2006, with residual specimen material stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ from 3 to 6 months. The frozen specimens were sent to DHI, where they were thawed and processed between 30 May and 1 June 2006, according to the predicate device's product insert. All specimens used in the studies were tested by both the DS and CC procedures as detailed in the Predicate device's product insert; however, a total of 16 specimens were inadequate for interpretation of DS stain results (15 were found to contain insufficient numbers of cells, and one other specimen exhibited non-specific staining with the Mouse Gamma Globulin DFA Reagent), leaving 282 specimens for evaluation.

# 922 B. Non-prospective archival specimens:

Due to relative low prevalence of Parainfluenza infections in populations of respirator: specimens, few specimens in the studies detailed above were reactive with the Parainfluenza DFA Reagents. In order to better demonstrate performance characteristics of the Parainfluenza DFA Reagents, frozen original specimens previously determined to contain Parainfluenza (types 1, 2, or 3) during the 2006 "respiratory season" were obtained from an additional laboratory, and were tested in an internal reference laboratory using the Subject and Predicate Tests by Direct Specimen method (Study $3 \mathbf { a }$ -DS; see Table 12, below). The same specimens were

tested by Cell Culture method (see Table 13). Original results reported by the laboratory were unknown to the study investigator. Although the study design has a selection bias, this study offers further analytical information on the assay's ability to detect Parainfluenza viruses.

Study 3a-DS - Direct Specimen Method: The study consisted of 30 specimens originally received by a hospital laboratory in Italy for respiratory virus testing during the period from October 2005 through April 2006, with residual specimen material stored at $- 7 0 \%$ from 2 to 6 months. The frozen specimens were sent to DHI, where they were thawed and processed between June 7 and 8, 2006, according to the prescribed protocol. All specimens used in the studies were tested by both the DS and CC procedures as detailed in the Predicate device's product insert; however, a total of four specimens were found to contain insufficient numbers of cells for interpretation of DS stain results, leaving 26 specimens.

The DS results for these specimens tested using the Predicate and Subject devices are summarized in Table 12 below:

With the exception of one specimen, the DS test results were concordant for both the Screen and the ID of individual viruses; the Subject device identified one specimen as positive for Para 3 while the Predicate device was negative for this specimen.

Study 3a-CC - Cell Culture Method: The same 30 frozen specimens that were evaluated by DS testing were also processed for CC testing according to the Predicate device's product insert for cell culture using $\mathbf { R } \mathbf { - } \mathbf { M i x } ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ FreshCellsTM in 48/24-fill cluster plates.

# 364 C. Non-prospective archival clinical isolates:

To further demonstrate the proficiency of the Screening and Typing Reagents in the Subject Test, a study was conducted using a collection of banked clinical isolates known to contain respiratory. viruses that had been frozen from the 2005/2006 respiratory season. These specimens were selected because they were previously shown to contain at least one of the seven virus analytes detected by the Subject Test.

Study 3b-CC- Cell Culture Method: A total of 81 clinical isolates from a frozen archival repository were processed according to the Predicate device's product insert for cell culture using R-MixTM FreshCellsTM cultures in shell vials. The results of this testing are summarized in Table 14 below:

# 982 D. Cross-reactivity Testing

Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { D } } } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA RESPIRATORY VIRUS SCREENING & ID KIT DFA Reagents were tested for cross-reactivity against a wide variety of cells and microorganisms. No cross-reactivity was observed for 64 virus strains (cultured and processed for staining) or for 18 host culture cell types. Eighteen (18) bacterial cultures were stained and examined for cross-reactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence (see Limitations of Procedure, Section 12.) while all other bacterial cultures were negative. [See Table 15 for cross-reactivity study results. The table indicates which organisms were reactive with which DFA Reagent.]

Stringent conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using high concentration DFAs and high titers of microorganisms. The DFAs (i.e. directly fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies) were prepared at $1 . 5 \mathrm { X }$ the concentration that is provided in the kit. Each of the tested viruses was prepared as infected cell monolayers (250 infected cells inoculated into a shell vial culture and incubated for 24 to 48 hours, to yield a $^ { 3 \ast }$ to $4 +$ infection), and processed and stained with the 1.5X DFAs according to the procedure detailed in this product insert. Bacterial strains were cultured, processed as suspensions, then spotted on microscope slides (yielding $> 1 5 0$ bacteria per 400X microscope field), then stained with the 1.5X DFAs according to the procedure in this product insert. Cell cultures were stained as confluent monolayers.

# LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE

$\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit, K061101

# DESCRIPTION of DEVICE MODIFICATION

The product insert has been modified. The following has been added (see below):

Table 15 in the product insert has been updated to include reactivity data on influenza A virus Mexico/4108/2009 and California/07/2009 strains. The following language was included with the data:

"Although this test has been shown to detect the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in two cultured isolates, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical

specimens that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot differentiate influenza subtypes."

# INTENDED USE

The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Ultra DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) RESPIRATORY VIRUS SCREENING & ID KIT is intended for the qualitative detection and identification of the Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2 and Parainfluenza 3 virus in respiratory specimens, by either direct detection or cell culture method, by immunofluorescence using fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). It is recommended that specimens found to be negative after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A/H3 and A/H1 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a $\mathbf { B S L 3 + }$ facility' is available to receive and culture specimens.2
