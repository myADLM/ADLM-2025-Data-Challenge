# 3. Substantial Equivalence:

The MONOLISA ™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA used with the EVOLIS ™M Automated Microplate System is substantially equivalent to the MONOLISA ™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA using the manual method (k063319)

# 4. Description of the Device:

The MONOLISA™ Anti-HAV IgM EIA is an enzyme immunoassay (IgM antibody capture format) for the detection of IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus. In the assay procedure, patient specimens, a calibrator, and controls are incubated with anti-human IgM antibodies coated on the microwells. If IgM antibodies to HAV are present in a specimen or control, they bind to the antibody. Excess sample is removed by a wash step. The HAV Viral Antigen and the Conjugate (containing horseradish peroxidase - labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to HAV) are successively added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. The presence of anti-HAV igM in the sample enables the HAV Viral Antigen and the Conjugate to bind to the solid phase. Excess Conjugate and HAV Viral Antigen are removed by a wash step, and a TMB Chromogen /Substrate solution is added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. If a sample contains anti-HAV IgM, the bound enzyme (HRP) causes the colorless tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the Chromogen solution to change to blue. The blue color turns yellow after the addition of a Stopping Solution. If a sample does not contain anti-HAV IgM, the Chromogen/Substrate solution in the well remains colorless during the substrate incubation, and after the addition of the Stopping Solution. The color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically. Absorbance value readings for patient specimens are compared to the cutoff value.

The performance of the MONOLISA™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA was evaluated in conjunction with the EVOLIS™ Automated Microplate System. The EVOLIS ™M Automated Microplate System is a fully automated microplate analyzer that performs all functions necessary for the complete processing of microplate assays. Functions include: barcode scanning, sample

pre-dilutions, sample and reagent dispensing, plate incubations, plate wash cycles, photometric measurement of completed assay plates and results evaluation. The analyzer instrument is controlled via the EVOLIS™ software, a Windows® 2000 application running on a separate dedicated PC. An operator loads the appropriate microplates, assay reagents, and patient and control samples, then selects assay parameters, loads sample information, initiates instrument processing, and generates result reports.

# 5. Intended Use:

The MONOLISA ™ Anti-HAV IgM EIA is an in vitro enzyme immunoassay kit intended for use in the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV IgM) in human (adult and pediatric) serum or plasma (EDTA, Heparin, Citrate, ACD). This assay is indicated for testing specimens from individuals who have signs and symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis. Assay results, in conjunction with other serological or clinical information, may be used for the laboratory diagnosis of individuals with acute or recent hepatitis A. The MONOLISA ™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA is intended for manual use and with the Evolis™M Automated Microplate System in the detection of IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus.

Assay performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients, and cord blood or neonatal specimens.

Warning: This assay is not intended for screening blood or solid or soft tissue donors.

# 7. Performance Characteristics:

The performance of the MONOLISA ™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA with the EVOLIS™ Automated Microplate System was compared to the MONOLISA ™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA tested manually, which had previously received marketing clearance from the Agency. Substantial equivalence of the MONOLISA™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA, using manual equipment, was determined May 3, 2007 (k063319).

# Correlation/method comparison

Studies have been performed with the MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA on the EVOLIS™ Automated System and compared to the results of testing the same kits and samples with the manual method. In this study 691 retrospective samples were tested on the MONOLISA ™ AntiHAV IgM assay using four (4) EVOLIS ™ instruments at three sites. The same samples were tested manually (reference method) on the MONOLISA™ Anti-HAV IgM assay. The positive, negative and overall percent agreement along with the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval are presented below. In determining the percent agreement on borderline results, specimens that were borderline with the reference assay and negative with EvOLIS ™m were considered as false negative for the EVOLIS ™M.

The positive percent agreement with the reference method, manual testing, is $100 \%$ (94/94) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 6 . 1 - 1 0 0 \%$ .The negative percent agreement with the reference method is $9 9 . 7 \%$ (595/597) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 8 . 8 - 9 9 . 9 \%$ The overall percent agreement is $9 9 . 7 \%$ (689/691) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 8 . 9 - 9 9 . 9 \%$

The EvOLIS ™m was also evaluated by performing a combination of 2 assays on the same plate. In this study 313 samples were tested with the MONOLISA™ Anti-HAV IgM EIA on a combination plate format on EVOLIS™M (two separate MONOLISA ™M hepatitis assays run in a single microplate frame). Results were compared to the same samples tested manually (the reference method, individual plate format) on the MONOLISA™ Anti-HAV IgM assay. In determining the percent agreement on borderline results, specimens that were borderline with the reference assay (manual individual plate) and negative with EVOLIS™ (combination plate) were considered as false negative for the EVOLIS ™M (combination plate).

The positive percent agreement with the reference method, manual testing, is $100 \%$ (49/49) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 2 . 7 - 1 0 0 \%$ . The negative percent agreement with the reference method is $9 9 . 2 \%$ (262/264) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 7 . 3 - 9 9 . 8 \%$ . The overall percent agreement is $9 9 . 4 \%$ (311/313) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 7 . 7 - 9 9 . 8 \%$

# Precision Study (Within-Laboratory)

A 21-member panel was tested: three (3) serum samples with six (6) corresponding plasma samples (EDTA K2, EDTA K3, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Heparin, Lithium Heparin, ACD) at three (3) different levels [1 low positive near the cutoff (Panel Set 1), 1 negative near the cutoff (Panel Set 2) and 1 negative (Panel Set 3)]. Two replicates each of the twenty-four (24) member panel were assayed twice a day for 20 days. The data were analyzed following the CLSl guidance EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. The mean ratio, the Standard Deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ were calculated for each panel member.

The data summary is shown in the following tables, which summarize testing with the EvOLIS ™ Automated System:

# Reproducibility Study

A 6-member panel consisting of diluted plasma specimens (negative and different levels of positive) was tested in triplicate, once a day for 5 days with the MONOLISA ™ Anti-HAV IgM EIA at 3 separate clinical trial sites. Each panel was coded with a diferent number on each day tested in order to blind the operator to the expected value of the sample. One () lot was used at each of 3 sites.

The data from al sites were combined to obtain standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (CV) for within run, between day, between site and total variance. The data were analyzed according to the principles described in the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidance EP15-A2, User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance. The summaries are shown in the following tables:

# Pipettor and washer carry-over

The pipette carryover study verified that the disposable tip pipettes on the EVOLIS ™m do not carry residuals from one sample or well to another. In a washer carryover study, it was verified that the washer on the EvOLIS™m does not carry residuals from one wel to another during the washing steps.

# Pipetting accuracy

Dye studies were performed to determine pipetting accuracy for samples and reagents. These studies were conducted using 2 different volumes for samples and controls, and demonstrated pipetting accuracy with a CV of $\leq 7 . 7 \%$ across the microwell plate.

# 8. Conclusion

The MONOLISA™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA tested with the EVOLIS™M Automated Microplate System demonstrated equivalent performance to the MONOLISA ™M Anti-HAV IgM EIA tested with the manual assay method, which had previously received FDA 510(k) clearance.

Dear Ms. Staswick:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This lelter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450.
