# K. Standard/Guidance Documents Referenced:

Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable (April 2006) Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests; Guidance for Industry and FDA Reviewers (March 2007) Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices (May 2005) Evaluation of Precision Performance of Qualitative Measurement Methods, CLSI EP5-A2 • User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance, CLSI EP15-A2

# L. Test Principle:

Patient specimens, a calibrator, and controls are incubated with anti-human IgM antibodies coated on the microwells. If IgM antibodies to HAV are present in a specimen or control, they bind to the antibody. Excess sample is removed by a wash step. The HAV Viral Antigen and the Conjugate (containing horseradish peroxidase - labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to HAV) are successively added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. The presence of anti-HAV IgM in the sample enables the HAV Viral Antigen and the Conjugate to bind to the solid phase. Excess Conjugate and HAV Viral Antigen are removed by a wash step, and a TMB Chromogen /Substrate solution is added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. If a sample contains anti-HAV IgM, the bound enzyme (HRP) causes the colorless tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the Chromogen solution to change to blue. The blue color turns yellow after the addition of a Stopping Solution. If a sample does not contain anti-HAV IgM, the Chromogen/Substrate solution in the well remains colorless during the substrate incubation, and after the addition of the Stopping Solution. The color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically. Absorbance value readings for patient specimens are compared to the cutoff value.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Six-hundred ninety-one retrospective samples were tested on the MONOLISA Anti-HAV IgM assay, using a total of four (4) EVOLIS instruments at three sites. The same samples were tested manually (reference method) on the MONOLISA Anti-HAV IgM assay. Specimens that were borderline with the reference assay and negative with EVOLIS were considered as false negative for the EVOLIS; specimens that were borderline with the

reference assay and reactive with EVOLIS were considered as false positive for the EVOLIS.

The positive percent agreement with the reference method, manual testing, is $100 \%$ (94/94) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 6 . 1 - 1 0 0 \%$ . The negative percent agreement with the reference method is $9 9 . 7 \%$ (595/597) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 8 . 8 -$ $9 9 . 9 \%$ .

The EVOLIS was also evaluated by performing a combination of 2 assays on the same plate. In this study 313 samples were tested with the MONOLISA Anti-HAV IgM assay on a combination plate on the EVOLIS (both the Anti-HAV IgM EIA and Anti-HAV EIA assays were run in a single microplate frame). Results were compared to the same samples tested manually (the reference method, individual plate format) on the MONOLISA Anti-HAV IgM assay. Specimens that were borderline with the reference assay (manual individual plate) and negative with EVOLIS (combination plate) were considered as false negative for the EVOLIS (combination plate).

# N. Instrument Name:

EVOLIS Automated Microplate System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The EVOLIS Automated Microplate System is an open tube, batch mode analyzer with a continuous load option. The reagent bottles used from the test kit are placed on the instrument with the caps removed. The sample tubes can be the primary tubes with stoppers removed or the serum/plasma can be poured off into identified test tubes.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ____X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Specimen information may be entered either by EVOLIS system barcode reading directly off the specimen tube or entered manually by the user.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The system can store and distribute samples from different types of vessels into dilution vessels and microplates. The samples can be accessed in any order. Sample addition is via a $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ disposable tip. The system can load and unload samples and assay reagents while it is operating.

The pipetting system utilizes a liquid syringe pump and system fluid. The system uses disposable tips $( 3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and $1 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ), and can aspirate and dispense fluids from a variety of different vessels. Key functions of the system are liquid level detection, using capacitive sensing, verification of fluid distribution, and the detection of clots and blocked tips. If the pipettor does not detect a sufficient volume an error is displayed. The pipettor automatically flushes with system fluid between each aspirate/dispense cycle of samples and reagent during a pipetting sequence. Mixing occurs during the transfer of sample, addition of diluents, and other reagents.

Intermediate vessels are used to dilute samples when the level of dilution exceeds the volume available in the final reaction vessel. Mixing is utilized to obtain a homogeneous mixture after preparing the dilution. The instrument has space for at least one microplate to be used as a dilution position.

# 5. Calibration:

The system performs a self-test each time EVOLIS software is launched. During the selftest the instrument hardware is initialized and the status of all instrument modules is verified. The self-test evaluates the following systems: Pipettor, washer, photometer, plate transport, incubators, system communications, and other user-defined maintenance.

Users are instructed in the Operator’s Manual to perform the following Performance Evaluation Procedures monthly: Plate Transport Check, Photometer Verification Check, Fluidics Panel Check.

6. Quality Control: Assay includes positive and negative controls that are run with each batch.
