# L. Test Principle:

Patient specimens, a Calibrator and controls are incubated with HAV antigen in microwells that have been coated with mouse monoclonal anti-hepatitis A antibodies. Antibodies to HAV present in a specimen or control will complex with the HAV antigen reagent and with antibodies coated on the microwells. Excess sample and HAV Viral Antigen reagent are removed by a wash step. The Conjugate (containing horseradish peroxidase-labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to HAV) is subsequently added to the microwells and incubated. The Conjugate binds to the HAV antigen bound to the microwell, in the absence of antibodies to HAV from the specimen. Excess Conjugate is removed by a wash step, and a TMB Chromogen/Substrate solution is added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. If a sample does not contain anti-HAV antibodies, the bound enzyme (HRP) causes the colorless tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the Chromogen solution to change to blue. The blue color turns yellow after the addition of a Stopping Solution. If a sample contains anti-HAV antibodies, the Chromogen/Substrate solution in the well remains colorless during the substrate incubation, and after the addition of the Stopping Solution. The color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically. Absorbance value readings for patient specimens are compared to the Cutoff value determined by the mean of the Calibrator absorbance values.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Six-hundred eighty-eight retrospective samples were tested on the MONOLISA AntiHAV assay, using a total of four (4) EVOLIS instruments at three sites. The same samples were tested manually (reference method) on the MONOLISA Anti-HAV assay. Specimens that were borderline with the reference assay and negative with EVOLIS were considered as false negative for the EVOLIS; specimens that were borderline with the reference assay and reactive with EVOLIS were considered as false positive for the EVOLIS.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Manual Anti-HAV Results</td><td colspan="4">EVOLIS Anti-HAV Results</td></tr><tr><td>Reactive</td><td>Borderline</td><td>Nonreactive</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Reactive</td><td>336</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td>Borderline</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Nonreactive</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>339</td><td>346</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>340</td><td>7</td><td>341</td><td>688</td></tr></table>

The positive percent agreement with the reference method, manual testing, is $9 8 . 8 \%$ (336/340) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 7 . 0 - 9 9 . 5 \%$ . The negative percent agreement with the reference method is $9 7 . 4 \%$ (339/348) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 5 . 2 - 9 8 . 6 \%$ .

The EVOLIS was also evaluated by performing a combination of 2 assays on the same plate frame. In this study 315 samples were tested with the MONOLISA Anti-HAV assay on a combination plate on the EVOLIS (both the MONOLISA Anti-HAV EIA and MONOLISA Anti-HAV IgM EIA assays were run in a single microplate frame). Results were compared to the same samples tested manually (the reference method, individual plate format) on the MONOLISA Anti-HAV assay. Specimens that were borderline with the reference assay (manual individual plate) and negative with EVOLIS (combination plate) were considered as false negative for the EVOLIS (combination plate).

# N. Instrument Name:

EVOLIS Automated Microplate System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The EVOLIS Automated Microplate System is an open tube, batch mode analyzer with a continuous load option. The reagent bottles used from the test kit are placed on the instrument with the caps removed. The sample tubes can be the primary tubes with stoppers removed or the serum/plasma can be poured off into identified test tubes.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ____X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Specimen information may be entered either by EVOLIS system barcode reading directly off the specimen tube or entered manually by the user.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The system can store and distribute samples from different types of vessels into dilution vessels and microplates. The samples can be accessed in any order. Sample addition is via a $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ disposable tip. The system can load and unload samples and assay reagents while it is operating.

The pipetting system utilizes a liquid syringe pump and system fluid. The system uses disposable tips $( 3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and $1 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ), and can aspirate and dispense fluids from a variety of different vessels. Key functions of the system are liquid level detection, using capacitive sensing, verification of fluid distribution, and the detection of clots and blocked tips. If the pipettor does not detect a sufficient volume an error is displayed. The pipettor automatically flushes with system fluid between each aspirate/dispense cycle of samples and reagent during a pipetting sequence. Mixing occurs during the transfer of sample, addition of diluents, and other reagents.

Intermediate vessels are used to dilute samples when the level of dilution exceeds the volume available in the final reaction vessel. Mixing is utilized to obtain a homogeneous mixture after preparing the dilution. The instrument has space for at least one microplate to be used as a dilution position.

# 5. Calibration:

The system performs a self-test each time EVOLIS software is launched. During the selftest the instrument hardware is initialized and the status of all instrument modules is verified. The self-test evaluates the following systems: Pipettor, washer, photometer, plate transport, incubators, system communications, and other user-defined maintenance.

Users are instructed in the Operator’s Manual to perform the following Performance Evaluation Procedures monthly: Plate Transport Check, Photometer Verification Check, Fluidics Panel Check.

6. Quality Control:

Assay includes positive and negative controls that are run with each batch.
