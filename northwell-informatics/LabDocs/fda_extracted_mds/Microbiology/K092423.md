Remel Xpect® Flu A&B

Date Prepared: Device Trade Name: Predicate Device: Device Classification: Intended Use:

Remel Xpect® Flu A&B (K031565; S&E July 17, 2003)

21 CFA 866.3330: Influenza virus serological reagents.

Remel Xpect Flu A&B is a rapid in vitro immunochromatographic test for the direct, qualitative detection of influenza A and influenza B viral antigens (nucleoprotein) from nasal wash, nasal swab, and throat swab specimens from symptomatic patients. The test is intended as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of influenza A and influenza B viral infections. Negative tests should be confirmed by cell culture.

# Device Description:

The Xpect® Flu A&B is a chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of influenza A and influenza B viral antigens. The test device incorporates separate membrane strips for influenza A and for influenza B. To perform the test, the patient specimen is diluted and added to the sample wells of the device. The mixture moves along the membranes by capillary action. If present, influenza A or 8 viral antigens in the patient sample bind anti-influenza A or B conjugated antibodies. A visible line forms as a complex of antibodyantigen-antibody coated colored particles is captured in the test region (T). Antibody coated colored particles not bound at the test line are later captured in the control region (C) containing goat anti-mouse antibody. A visible line will always appear in the control region indicating that the test is working properly. The presence of a control line combined with the absence of a visible test line is interpreted as a negative test result.

# Summary of Performance Data:

# Analytical Sensitivity:

The analytical sensitivity was evaluated using 16 influenza strains; 10 influenza A and 6 influenza 8. Each viral strain was quantitated and titrated until a positive endpoint was reached using the Xpect® Flu A&B test. The amount of virus at the endpoint dilution, expressed per test, was calculated as a measure of analytical sensitivity.

TCID - $50 \%$ tissue culture infectious dose; CEID - $50 \%$ chicken embryo infectious dose

Although this test has been shown to detect the influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus cultured from a positive human specimen, the performance characteristics of this device with human specimens infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The Xpect® Flu A&B test can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it does not differentiate seasonal influenza A virus from the novel influenza A (2009 H1N1) virus and the test's ability to detect human infection with the novel influenza A 2009 H1N1 virus in clinical specimens is unknown.

# 5Design Control Activities Summary

)Sponsor provided a signed statement that:

Al verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and   
iiThe manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.   
The method used for the Risk Analysis for the Xpect Flu A&B Test was Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FEMA). This risk analysis method provides an effective way to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components. Potential failures are identified in terms of failure modes. For each mode, the effect on the total system is then evaluated.   
c) The effects of the common biological and environmental IVD device risks were addresses with labeling.   
d) The risks of false positive and false negative test results as related to the risks to patients, were addressed with labeling, appropriate training for users, customer quality control and confirmation of all negative results by cell culture.

# A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for Use Enclosure (and Class III Summary for Class III devices).

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed.

Re: k092423 Trade/Device Name: Remel Xpect Flu A&B Test Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.3330 Regulation Name: Influenza Virus Serological Reagents Regulatory Class: Class I Product Code: GNX Dated: August 6, 2009 Received: August 7, 2009

Dear Ms. Silvius:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of August 26, 2009.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act

# Page 2 - Mary Ann Silvius

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
