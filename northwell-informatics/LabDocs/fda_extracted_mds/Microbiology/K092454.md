Voriconazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for the antifungal.

The antifungal presented in VITEK® 2 AST Cards is in concentrations equivalent by efficacy to standard method concentrations in mcg/ml. The VITEK® 2 AST Cards are essentially miniaturized versions of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) microdilution methodology.

The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration in $0 . 4 5 \%$ saline before being used to at engal m with e re  uatiall fil als an pac card into the incubato/readr.The VITE® 2 Compact has a manual filing and sealing operation. The VITEK® 2 monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 36 hours for ysAt the completion of the incubatin cycea rpor is generated that contains theMC value with the interpretive category result for each antifungal contained on the card.

VITEK® 2 Yeast Voriconazole demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI reference method, as defined in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA. Issued Feb. 5, 2003.

The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of VITEK® 2 Yeast Voriconazole.

The data is representative of performance on both the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact instrument platforms, as evidenced in the AST equivalency study presented in the VITEK® 2 Compact 510(k), K050002. VITEK® 2 Yeast Voriconazole demonstrated acceptable performance of $9 9 . 2 \%$ overall Essential Agreement and $9 9 . 2 \%$ overall category agreement with the reference method incubated for 24 hrs. With the reference method incubated 48 hrs the overall Essential Agreement was $9 6 . 9 \%$ and overall category agreement was $9 8 . 7 \%$ . Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.

Dear Ms. Weaver:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devics that avebeen reclassif i ccordance with the provisions  the Fedeal Food Dru, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 100.This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section

510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if nown): K09 2 454

Device Name: VITEK® 2 Yeast Voriconazole (0.12 - 8 μg/ml)

Indications For Use:

VITEK® 2 Yeast Voriconazole is designed for antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida species. VITEK 2 Yeast Voriconazole is a quantitative test intended for use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antifungal agents. Voriconazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for the antifungal.

Active in vitro and in clinical infections

Candida albicans Candida krusei Candida parapsilosis Candida tropicalis

Active in vitro but their clinical significance is uknown:   
Candida lusitaniae   
Candida guilliermondii

The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used with the VITEK® 2 System for the automated quantitative or qualitative susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant aerobic gram-negative bacill, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and clinically significant yeast.

Prescription Use X AND/OR Over-The-Counter Use (Part 21 CFR 801 Subpart D) (21 CFR 807 Subpart C)
