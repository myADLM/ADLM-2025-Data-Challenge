# Device Description

The BioPlex® 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit uses multiplex flow immunoassay, a methodology that greatly resembles traditional ElA, but permits simultaneous detection and identification of many antibodies in a single tube. Rubella and CMV IgM test is to detect antibodies to Rubella and Cytomegalovirus (CMV).

Two (2) different populations of dyed beads are coated with cell lysates bearing Rubella or CMV antigens. The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent into a reaction vessel; the mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle, anti-human IgM antibody, conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads, and this mixture is incubated at 37°C. The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the attached PE. Raw data are reported as relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).

Three additional dyed beads, an Internal Standard Bead (ISB), a Serum Verification Bead (SVB) and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction vessel and the absence of significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma.

The instrument is calibrated using a set of three (3) distinct serum based calibrators. A negative and CMV IgM calibrator is used to calibrate CMV assay, and a negative and rubella IgM calibrator is used to calibrate the rubella IgM assay. The cut-off value and assignment of the calibrators are determined by performing concordance and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis using the Centaur Rubella IgM and VIDAS CMV IgM predicate results as the standard. For Rubella and CMV, results of ≤ 0.8 Al are negative, 0.9 and 1.0 Al are equivocal and results of ≥ 1.1 Al are reported as positive.

The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Control Set includes a negative control as well as a CMV IgM positive control and a Rubella IgM positive control. The BioPlex Rubella and CMV IgM Positive Controls are manufactured to give positive results, with values above the cut-off for each specific analyte. The BioPlex Rubella and CMV IgM Negative Control are manufactured to give negative results, with values below the cut-off for each specific analyte. The recommended frequency for performing quality control is once every 24-hour testing period. Performing quality control is also necessary after each new assay calibration and certain service procedures.

# 7. PERFORMANCE TESTING

A series of studies was conducted to evaluate the performance of the BioPlex® 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit. The studies included reproducibility, interfering substances, cross-reactivity, expected values and method comparison. The results of all studies demonstrated that the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit performed according to its specifications.

# A. Reproducibility

Separate internal and external reproducibility studies were conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit on the BioPlex 2200 instrument. Reproducibility studies were based on the principles described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSl) EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.

For the internal reproducibility study, three (3) panels made from serum and plasma (EDTA and heparinized) were assayed two (2) times in two (2) separate daily runs over 20 days $( n = 8 0 )$ .

The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, and total precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (% CV) were calculated.

The within-run precision for rubella IgM samples ranged from 4.3% to 5.5% in a serum matrix, 6.3% to 6.9% for EDTA and 4.8% to 9.5% for heparin plasma matrices. The within-run precision for CMV IgM samples ranged from 5.3% to 9.2% in a serum matrix, 4.9% to 11.8% for EDTA and 5.2% to 12.8% for heparin plasma matrices

The external reproducibility study was performed at three (3) clinical trial sites. Three lots of reagent packs, three lots of the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Calibrator Set and three lots of BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Control Set were evaluated. Three (3) panels made from serum and plasma (EDTA and heparinized) were tested in quadruplicate over five (5) days (4 replicates x 1 run x 5 days x 3 testing sites = 60 replicates per panel member).

The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, between-site, and total precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% 0 \% )$ were calculated.

The within run precision for positive samples greater than or equal to the cut-off (z 1.1 Al) in all sample matrices ranged from 2.7% to 13.3% for Rubella laM and

2.8% to 13.5% for CMV IgM. The total precision for positive samples greater than or equal to the cut-off (≥1.1 Al) ranged from 2.3% to 13.5% for Rubella IgM and $3 . 0 \%$ to $14 . 2 \%$ for CMV IgM.

# B. Interfering Substances

An interfering substances study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference of specific endogenous and exogenous substances with the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assays. The study was conducted based on the principles described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSl) EP7-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry.

# C. Cross-Reactivity

A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from various disease states and other potentialy cross-reacting agents interfere with test results when tested with the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit. Samples known to be positive for each of the potential cross-reactants, as determined by FDA cleared devices, were evaluated with the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assay. All samples were pre-tested by the predicate devices and only those that tested negative by the predicate devices were further evaluated by the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgG. The table below summarizes the number of samples scored negative by the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assay within each of the crossreactant panels. No significant cross reactivity was observed except for potential cross reactivity of myeloma IgM samples tested with the rubella and CMV IgM assays, and EBV VCA and parvovirus B19 IgM and dsDNA samples tested with the CMV IgM assay.

# F. Expected Values

The observed prevalence for the Rubella and CMV IgM using the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assay was determined using samples submitted for Rubella (300, US) or CMV IgM (400; 300 US +100 Europe) testing. The results are presented in the tables below. The predictive values of the test are dependent on the prevalence. As rubella incidence decreases, the predicative positive value of rubella igM results decreases.

Note: Each laboratory should establish frequency distributions for their specific patient populations.

Dear Mr. Wang:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassifid in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food D, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.
