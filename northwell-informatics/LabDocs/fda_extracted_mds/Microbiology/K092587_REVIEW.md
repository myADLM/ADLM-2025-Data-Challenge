# L. Test Principle:

The BioPlex™ 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit uses multiplex flow immunoassay, a methodology that greatly resembles traditional EIA, but permits simultaneous detection and identification of many antibodies in a single tube.

The kit employs a panel of two different populations of dyed beads coated with cell lysates bearing Rubella or CMV antigens to identify the presence of IgM antibodies to Rubella, and CMV antigens as follows.

The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent into a reaction vessel; the mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After a wash cycle, anti-human IgM antibody, conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads, and this mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the

fluorescence of the attached PE. Raw data are reported as relative fluorescence intensity (RFI). Additionally, the ISB beads, SVB beads and a RBB beads are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction vessel and the absence of significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma.

The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Calibrator Set calibrates the instrument using a set of three distinct serum based calibrators. Calibrators are used in a test system to establish points of reference that are used in the determination of qualitative numeric measurement of $\mathrm { I g M }$ antibodies to Rubella, and CMV in human serum and EDTA or heparinized plasma. The Calibrator Set should be loaded and assayed at minimum in duplicate every 30 days or with each new Re-agent Pack lot.

The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Control Set includes a negative control as well as a CMV IgM positive control and a Rubella IgM positive control. The BioPlex Rubella and CMV IgM Positive Controls are manufactured to give positive results, with values above the cut-off for each specific analyte. The BioPlex Rubella and CMV IgM Negative Control are manufactured to give negative results, with values below the cut-off for each specific analyte. The recommended frequency for performing quality control is once every 24-hour testing period. Performing quality control is also necessary after each new assay calibration and certain service procedures. A BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Control Lot Data disk is available to load the necessary value assignment data into the instrument. The result for each of the tested antibodies is expressed as an antibody index (AI). For Rubella and CMV, results of $\leq 0 . 8$ AI are negative, 0.9 and 1.0 AI are equivocal and results of $\geq 1 . 1$ AI are reported as positive.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Separate internal and external reproducibility studies were conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit on the BioPlex 2200 instrument.

The internal precision study was conducted in-house by Bio-Rad Laboratories in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.

For the internal reproducibility study, three (3) panels made from serum and plasma (EDTA and heparinized) were assayed two (2) times in two (2) separate daily runs over 20 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ).

The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, and total precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% \mathrm { C V } )$ were calculated.

The within-run precision for rubella IgM samples ranged from $4 . 3 \%$ to $5 . 5 \%$ in a serum matrix, $6 . 3 \%$ to $6 . 9 \%$ for EDTA and $4 . 8 \%$ to $9 . 5 \%$ for heparin plasma matrices. The within-run precision for CMV IgM samples ranged from $5 . 3 \%$ to $9 . 2 \%$ in a serum matrix, $4 . 9 \%$ to $1 1 . 8 \%$ for EDTA and $5 . 2 \%$ to $1 2 . 8 \%$ for heparin plasma matrices.

The external reproducibility study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP15-A2 during the external clinical evaluation at each of three clinical study sites. Three lots of reagent packs, three lots of the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Calibrator Set and three lots of BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Control Set were evaluated. The sample panels made from serum and plasma (EDTA and heparinized) at varying levels of analytes, were tested in quadruplicate over five (5) days (4 replicates x 1 run x 5 days x 3 testing sites $= 6 0$ replicates per panel member).

The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, betweensite, and total precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% \mathrm { C V } )$ were calculated.

The within run precision for positive samples greater than or equal to the cutoff $( \geq 1 . 1$ AI) in all sample matrices ranged from $2 . 7 \%$ to $1 3 . 3 \%$ for Rubella IgM and $2 . 8 \%$ to $1 3 . 5 \%$ for CMV IgM. The total precision for positive samples greater than or equal to the cut-off $( \ge 1 . 1$ AI) ranged from $2 . 3 \%$ to $1 3 . 5 \%$ for Rubella IgM and $3 . 0 \%$ to $1 4 . 2 \%$ for CMV IgM.

The mean Antibody Index (AI), standard deviation (SD), and percent coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ for each panel member were calculated. The data for the serum panel is represented below:

Cross-Reactivity

A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from various disease states and other potentially cross-reacting agents interfere with test results when tested with the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit. Samples known to be positive for each of the potential cross-reactants, as determined by FDA cleared devices, were evaluated with the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assay. All samples were pre-tested by the predicate devices and only those that tested negative by the predicate devices were further evaluated by the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit. Table G summarizes the number of samples scored negative by the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assay within each of the cross-reactant panels. No significant cross-reactivity was observed except for potential cross-reactivity of Myeloma IgM samples tested with the Rubella and CMV IgM assays, and EBV VCA IgM, Parvovirus $\mathrm { B } 1 9 \mathrm { I g M }$ and dsDNA samples tested with the CMV IgM assay.

Interfering Substances

Testing for interfering substances was conducted according to CLSI Protocol EP7-A2 (Vol. 25, No. 27). Samples were prepared by blending a pool of negative human serum with samples positive for Rubella or CMV IgM to achieve values of 1.7 to 2.3 AI for Rubella and 1.7 to 2.3 AI for CMV. Interferent or solvent (negative control) was added exogenously at levels indicated in Table H below. Test and control samples were evaluated in replicates of ten. Changes in results ranged from -13.6 to $1 0 . 0 \%$ . No significant interference was observed in any of the substances tested.

# $f .$ Assay cut-off:

The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assays report results as an antibody index, (AI). AI values are calculated by using linear regression analysis of a two point assay calibration curve. The cut-off value and assignment of the calibrators are determined by performing concordance and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, using predicate results as the standard. Analyze-it software is used for the ROC analysis. This software does not employ an equivocal range for the on-test condition. Therefore, predicate equivocal results are not included in the calculations for establishing cut-off. After establishment of the cut-off, an equivocal range is set bracketing the cutoff value. Based on the results, calibrator values were adjusted such that the cut-off values equal to 1.1 AI for Rubella and CMV IgM assays. A total of 586 and 593 patient samples were evaluated to confirm rubella and CMV IgM cut-off values, respectively. ROC Analysis was performed for each analyte using this population of samples.

Results obtained using a cut-off of 1.0 AI in the BioPlex Rubella and CMV IgM assay ROC analyses demonstrated $59 8 \%$ negative agreement and $59 8 \%$ positive agreement for CMV and $59 5 \%$ negative agreement and ${ > } 8 4 \%$ positive agreement for Rubella. The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assays met the concordance specifications for both analytes.

The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM test showed comparable performance to a commercial method, except for the day 40 sample which scored equivocal in the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM test and positive (at the cutoff) in the comparison test.

# CMV IgM

Bio-Rad Laboratories Liquichek™ CMV IgM Seroconversion panel was assayed with BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kits and a commercial method. The results are shown in below. The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM test was able to detect CMV IgM in all the samples compared to a commercial test which scored equivocal at 59 days.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The observed prevalence for the Rubella and CMV IgM using the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assay was determined using samples submitted for Rubella (300, US) or CMV IgM (400; $3 0 0 \mathrm { U S } + 1 0 0$ Europe) testing. The results are presented in the tables below. The predictive values of the test are dependent on the prevalence. As rubella incidence decreases, the predicative positive value of rubella IgM results decreases.

Note: Each laboratory should establish frequency distributions for their specific patient populations.
