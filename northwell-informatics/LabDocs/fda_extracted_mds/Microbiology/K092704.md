Abbott RealTime CT/NG consists of two reagent kits:

•Abbott RealTime CT/NG Amplification Reagent Kit (List No. 8L07-91) • Abbott RealTime CT/NG Control Kit (List No. 8L07-80)

The Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay uses PCR technology with homogenous real-time fluorescence detection on the $m 2 0 0 0$ System. The Abbott $m 2 0 0 0$ System consists of the Abbott $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ and Abbott $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ instruments. The Abbott $m 2 0 0 0$ System integrates sample preparation with nucleic acid amplification and detection to generate assay results. The Abbott $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ is used for processing samples and the Abbott $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ is used for amplification and detection.

# 3.12 Background on Chlamydia and Gonorrheal Disease

Chlamydia are non-motile, Gram-negative, obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells. They form inclusions in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Chlamydia trachomatis , one of three chlamydial species, is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease (STD) chlamydia. Chlamydial infections of the urogenital tract are associated with salpingitis, cervicitis, ectopic pregnancies and tubal factor infertility in women as well as ononooccal urethritis nd epiidymit  enThe enitalmost c affected in women is the cervix, but the infection can be asymptomatic and, if untreated, is likely to ascend to the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Neonates born of infected mothers can contract inclusion conjunctivitis, nasopharyngeal infections, and pneumonia due to Chlamydia trachomatis . Infection by Chlamydia trachomatis in men is also often asymptomatic and, if untreated, may lead to epididymitis, a major complication.3 Patients infected with Chlamydia trachomatis may be co-infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae , the causative agent of gonorrhea. Further, patients with treatment indications for gonorrhea but not chlamydia often harbor Chlamydia trachomatis.' Chlamydia infections may not respond well to recommended regimens for treating Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Therefore, unless chlamydial infection has been ruled out in patients treated for gonorrhea, dual therapy for gonococcal and chlamydia infections is recommended.

Cell culture, commonly used to detect Chlamydia trachomatis, has been replaced by more sensitive nucleic acid tests. Since a specific diagnosis of chlamydia may improve treatment compliance and enhance partner notification, the use of these highly sensitive and specific tests is strongly recommended.

Gonorrhea is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. Over 700,000 new infections of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are estimated to occur each year.9 In men, gonorrhea infection usually results in acute anterior urethritis accompanied by a vagina and uterus also may be infected. Frequently the infection is asymptomatic, especially in women. Without treatment, local complications of gonococcal infection can occur including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or acute salpingitis for women and l untreated patients. 13

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococcus without flagellae.Culture is commonly used for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhea is based on the morphological examination, Gram stain, and oxidase measurement of the culture isolate. Confirmation procedures have been used for definitive identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae including sugar fermentation, fluorescent antibody staining, nucleic acid hybridization, and agglutination.14,15 Nucleic acid tests are widely available for the sensitive detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae .8

# Technological Characteristics of the Device as Compared to the Predicate

The primary functional components of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay are substantially equivalent to other legally marketed nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) intended for the qualitative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG).

The Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay has the same general intended uses as the predicate devices. Although there are some technological differences between the Abbott RealTime CT/NG and the predicate devices, these differences do not raise new types of safety or effectiveness questions.

These devices are similar in that they are designed to prepare nucleic acids for amplification, amplify specific Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) sequences, detect the amplified products, and report qualitative results.

The primary similarities and differences between the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay and the NAAT predicate devices are shown in Attachment Tables 3.1 and 3.2.

# Summary of Nonclinical Studies

# 3.14.1 Analytical Sensitivity

The Limit of Detection (LOD) claim for the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay is 320 copies of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) target DNA and 320 copies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) target DNA per assay. The assay targets the Chlamydia trachomatis cryptic plasmid (present at approximately 7 to 10 copies per Chlamydia organism) and the multicopy opacity gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (repeated up to l I times per organism). Thus, 320 copies of target DNA is equivalent to approximately 30 to 40 organisms per assay.

The LOD of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay is defined as CT and NG target DNA concentration detected with a probability of $9 5 \%$ or greater. The CT and NG DNA concentrations detected with $9 5 \%$ probability were determined by testing dilutions of CT and NG target DNA. Probit analysis of the data determined that the concentration of CT DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 21 copies/assay $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C l } 1 8 - 2 8 )$ , the concentration of nvCT DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 29 copies/assay $9 5 \%$ CI 24 - 41), and the concentration of NG DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 149 copies/assay $9 5 \%$ CI 130 - 176).

The claimed assay LOD was confirmed by testing samples that contained 320 copies of CT, nvCT and NG target DNA per assay. The detection rate was $100 \%$ (405/405) for CT, $100 \%$ (403/403) for nvCT, and $9 9 . 5 \%$ (403/405) for NG in the assay.

An additional study was conducted to challenge the performance of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay in samples containing high target numbers of CT, nvCT, or NG in the presence of low target numbers of the opposite analyte. Samples were prepared to contain $3 2 0 \mathrm { C T }$ or nvCT target DNA copies and $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { N G }$ target DNA copies per assay, or ${ \mid \mathrm {  ~ x ~ } \mid 0 ^ { \prime } \mathrm {  ~ C T ~ } }$ or nvCT target DNA copies and $3 2 0 \mathsf { N G }$ target DNA copies per assay. The detection rate of 320 copies of CT or nvCT DNA in the presence of high NG target was $100 \%$ (405/405). The detection rate of 320 copies of NG DNA in the presence of high CT or nvCT target was $100 \%$ (405/405).

The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A through L was determined by testing dilutions of each serovar. Serovars A through K and L1 through L3 were detected at less than 1 Inclusion Forming Units (IFU) per assay. Additionally, nvCT was diluted and was also detected at less than 1 IFU per assay.

The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting 28 different isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was determined by testing dilutions of each isolate. All isolates were detected at less than 1 Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/assay.

# 3.14.2 Evaluation of Potential Cross-Reactants

A total of I 1 1 strains of bacteria, viruses, parasites, yeast, and fungi were tested for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay (Table 3.6). These included organisms that are phylogenetically related to CT and NG, and those that can be found in the urogenital tract. Purified DNA or RNA was diluted to a final concentration of $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ copies/assay. HBV DNA and HCV RNA were added directly into the PCR reaction at approximately $4 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ and $6 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ copies per reaction, respectively. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

Additionally, a total of 32 culture isolates were tested for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime assay. These included 27 organisms listed in Table 3.6, and Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria sicca, Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16, and Hela cells containing HPV 18. Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16 and Hela cells containing HPV 18 were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ cells per assay, $C$ pneumoniae and $C$ psittaci were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ EB per assay, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ genomes per assay, and the rest of the organisms were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ Colony Forming Units (CFU) per assay. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

Phenazopyridine hydrochloride (the active ingredient in URISTAT) at concentrations greater than $3 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ in urine specimens.   
Mucus at concentrations greater than $0 . 1 \%$ for urine specimens and $1 \%$ for swab specimens.

# 3.14.4 Carryover

Potential carryover was determined by performing a study in which high copy CT positive samples were interspersed with negative samples arranged in a checkerboard pattern. The positive samples were CT DNA at a concentration of $\mathrm { 1 0 ^ { 7 } c o p i e s / m l }$ The carryover rate is defined as the number of CT negative samples that are reported as positive or equivocal over the total number of CT-negative samples tested. Each run included 47 negative samples and 46 positive samples. A total of 14 runs were evaluated using two lots of the RealTime CT/NG amplification reagents on four $m 2 0 0 0 s p$ and $m 2 0 0 0 r t$ instrument pairs.

A total of 656 valid negative samples were evaluated for potential carryover effect. A total of 5 false positive and 1 equivocal results were observed. The carryover rate was $0 . 9 1 \%$ .

# 3.14.5 Precision Study

A precision study was performed at three sites, two external and one internal. Each site was provided a fifteen-member panel. Nine panel members targeted different combinations of CT and NG concentrations and six panel members targeted different combinations of nvCT and NG concentrations. The source material for CT was Vero/LGV-II, strain 434. The source material for nvCT was strain 68226. The source material for NG was ATCC isolate 27628 and 31426. Five replicates of each panel member were tested in each run. Thirty runs (10 per site) were performed for a total of 150 replicates of each panel member. The study included three amplification reagent lots. Each site tested two amplification reagent lots. A variance components analysis for a nested model was performed on delta cycle (DC) values, and the results are summarized in Tables 3.8 and 3.9, respectively.

# 3.15 Summary of Clinical Studies

Performance characteristics of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay were established in a multi-center clinical study conducted in the United States. Specimens were collected from subjects at 16 geographically diverse sites that included physician private practices, public and private STD clinics, and a hospital emergency room. A total of 3,832 male and female, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects were enrolled. Study subjects were classified as symptomatic if the subject reported STD-related symptoms. Specimens collected from each female subject included urine, endocervical swabs, self-collected vaginal swab, and clinician-collected vaginal swabs. Specimens collected from each male subject included urine and urethral swabs. Specimen testing methods included the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay, two commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for CT and NG, and culture for NG. The NAATs and the NG culture were used as reference assays in the clinical study.

For females, self-collected vaginal swab and urine specimens were collected first, followed by endocervical swab for culture. Remaining swab specimen collection was randomized to minimize bias. For males, urethral swab for culture was collected first. Remaining swab specimen collection was randomized to minimize bias. Urine specimen was collected after the swab specimens.

For each subject, a patient infected status was determined based on the combined results from the reference assays. A female subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positive results (at least one from each reference NAAT) was reported. For CT, female subjects with positive results on both reference urine specimens and negative results on all three reference swab specimens (clinician-collected vaginal swab from NAAT 1 and endocervical swab specimens from both reference assays) were categorized as infected for urine and not infected for swab specimens. A male subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positive results was reported. If the reference NG culture assay result was positive, the subject was categorized as infected regardless of NAAT results.

A female subject was categorized as not infected with CT or NG if at least one of the reference NAATs reported negative results for all sample types and if the NG culture assay result was negative. A male subject was categorized as not infected with CT or NG if a total of at least two negative results were reported by the reference NAATs and if the NG culture assay result was negative.

If patient infected status could not be determined due to missing and/or indeterminate results from the reference assays, the subject was excluded from the analysis. Patient infected status could not be determined for 4 subjects for CT and 7 subjects for NG.

Tables 3.10 through 3.28 summarize the clinical trial data.

Abbott RealTime CT/NG test results were compared to the patient infected status for calculation of assay sensitivity and specificity. A total of 6,555 CT and $6 { , } 5 6 9 \mathrm { N G }$ results were used in the analysis. The results were analyzed by gender, sample type, and the presence of symptoms. The overall sensitivity and specificity for CT was $9 5 . 2 \%$ and $9 9 . 3 \%$ , respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity for NG was $9 7 . 5 \%$ and $9 9 . 7 \%$ , respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for CT for female subjects and male subjects are presented in Tables 3.10 and 3.1 1, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for NG for female subjects and male subjects are presented in Tables 3.12 and 3.13, respectively.

A comparison of patient infected status, individual test results from the reference assays and Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was performed. CT results for infected and noninfected female subjects are presented in Tables 3.14 and 3.15, and for infected and noninfected male subjects in Tables 3.16 and 3.17. NG results for infected and non-infected female subjects are presented in Tables 3.18 and 3.19, and for infected and non-infected male subjects in Tables 3.20 and 3.21.

The prevalence of CT and NG in this study was dependent on several factors including age, gender, clinic type, and the method of testing. The prevalence per collection site determined by the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for endocervical swab specimens is presented in Table 3.22, for clinician-collected and self-collected vaginal swab specimens is presented in Table 3.23; for female urine specimens in Table 3.24; and for male urethral swab and male urine specimens in Tables 3.25 and 3.26, respectively.

The Positive and Negative Predictive Values (PPV and NPV) were calculated using hypothetical prevalence rates and the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay sensitivity and specificity determined from the clinical study. The overall sensitivity and specificity for CT was $9 5 . 2 \%$ and $9 9 . 3 \%$ , respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity for NG was $9 7 . 5 \%$ and $9 9 . 7 \%$ , respectively. Estimates of the PPV and NPV for the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay are presented in Table 3.27 for CT and Table 3.28 for NG.
