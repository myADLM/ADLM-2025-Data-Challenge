# Analytical Sensitivity

The Limit of Detection (LOD) claim for the RealTime CT/NG assay is 320 copies of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) target DNA and 320 copies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) target DNA per assay. The assay targets the Chlamydia trachomatis cryptic plasmid (present at approximately 7 to 10 copies per Chlamydia organism) and the multicopy opacity gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (repeated up to 11 times per organism). Thus, 320 copies of target DNA is equivalent to approximately 30 to 40 organisms per assay. The LOD of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay is defined as CT and NG target DNA concentration detected with a probability of $9 5 \%$ or greater. The CT and NG DNA concentrations detected with $9 5 \%$ probability were determined by testing dilutions of CT and NG target DNA. Probit analysis of the data determined that the concentration of CT DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 21 copies/ assay $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } 1 8 - 2 8 )$ , the concentration of nvCT DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 29 copies/assay $9 5 \%$ CI 24 - 41), and the concentration of NG DNA detected with $9 5 \%$ probability was 149 copies/assay $9 5 \%$ CI 130 - 176). The claimed assay LOD was confirmed by testing samples that contained 320 copies of CT, nvCT and NG target DNA per assay. The detection rate was $100 \%$ (405/405) for CT, $100 \%$ (403/403) for nvCT, and $9 9 . 5 \%$ (403/405) for NG in the assay. An additional study was conducted to challenge the performance of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay in samples containing high target numbers of CT, nvCT, or NG in the presence of low target numbers of the opposite analyte. Samples were prepared to contain $3 2 0 \mathrm { C T }$ or nvCT target DNA copies and $1 \mathrm { \Delta x }$ $1 0 7 \mathrm { N G }$ target DNA copies per assay, or $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 7 \mathrm { C T }$ or nvCT target DNA copies and $3 2 0 \mathrm { N G }$ target DNA copies per assay. The detection rate of 320 copies of CT or nvCT DNA in the presence of high NG target was $100 \%$ (405/405). The

detection rate of 320 copies of NG DNA in the presence of high CT or nvCT target was $100 \%$ (405/405). The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A through L was determined by testing dilutions of each serovar. Serovars A through K and L1 through L3 were detected at less than 1 Inclusion Forming Units (IFU) per assay. Additionally, nvCT was diluted and was also detected at less than 1 IFU per assay. The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting 28 different isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was determined by testing dilutions of each isolate. All isolates were detected at less than 1 Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/assay.

# Evaluation of Potential Cross-Reactants

A total of 111 strains of bacteria, viruses, parasites, yeast, and fungi were tested for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay (table below). These included organisms that are phylogenetically related to CT and NG, and those that can be found in the urogenital tract. Purified DNA or RNA was diluted to a final concentration of $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ copies/assay. HBV DNA and HCV RNA were added directly into the PCR reaction at approximately $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ and $9 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ copies per reaction, respectively. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

A total of 32 culture isolates were tested for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime assay. These included 27 organisms listed in table below, and Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria sicca, Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16, and Hela cells containing HPV 18. Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16 and Hela cells containing HPV 18 were tested at $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells per assay, $C .$ . pneumoniae and $C .$ . psittaci were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { E B }$ per assay, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ genomes per assay, and the rest of the organisms were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ Colony Forming Units (CFU) per assay. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

# Precision

A precision study was performed at three sites, two external and one internal. Each site was provided a fifteen-member panel. Nine panel members targeted different combinations of CT and NG concentrations and six panel members targeted different combinations of nvCT and NG concentrations. The source material for CT was Vero/LGV-II, strain 434. The source material for nvCT was strain 68226. The source material for NG was ATCC isolate 27628 and 31426. Five replicates of each panel member were tested in each run. Thirty runs (10 per site) were performed for a total of 150 replicates of each panel member. The study included three amplification reagent lots. Each site tested two amplification reagent lots. A variance components analysis for a nested model was performed on delta cycle (DC) values, and the results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.

# Clinical Study Results

Performance characteristics of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay were established in a multicenter clinical study conducted in the United States. Specimens were collected from subjects at 16 geographically diverse sites that included physician private practices, public and private TD clinics, and a hospital emergency room. A total of 3,832 male and female, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects were enrolled. Study subjects were classified as symptomatic if the subject reported STDrelated symptoms. Specimens collected from each female subject included urine, endocervical swabs, self-collected vaginal swab, and clinician-collected vaginal swabs. Specimens collected from each male subject included urine and urethral swabs. Specimen testing methods included the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay, two commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for CT and NG, and culture for NG. The NAATs and the NG culture were used as reference assays in the clinical study.

For females, self-collected vaginal swab and urine specimens were collected first, followed by endocervical swab for culture. Remaining swab specimen collection was randomized to minimize bias. For males, urethral swab for culture was collected first. Remaining swab specimen collection was randomized to minimize bias. Urine specimen was collected after the swab specimens.

For each subject, a patient infected status was determined based on the combined results from the reference assays. A female subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two posive results at least one from each reference NAAT) was reported. For CT, female subjects with positive results on both reference urine specimens and negative results on all three reference swab specimens (clinician-collected vaginal swab from NAAT 1 and endocervical swab specimens from both reference assays) were categorized as infected for urine and not infected for swab specimens. A male subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positive results was reported. If the reference NG culture assay result was positive, the subject was categorized as infected regardless of NAAT results.

A female subject was categorized as not infected with CT or NG if at least one of the reference NAATs reported negative results or all sample ypes and  the NG culture assay result was netive. A male subject was categorized as not infected with CT or NG if a total of at least two negative results were reported by the reference NAATs and if the NG culture assay result was negative.

If patient infected status could not be determined due to missing and/or indeterminate results from the reference assays, the subject was excluded from the analysis. Patient infected status could not be determined for 4 subjects for CT and 7 subjects for NG.

Abbott RealTime CT/NG test results were compared to the patient infected status for calculation of assay sensitivity and specificity. A total of 6,555 CT and 6,569 NG results were used in the analysis. The results were analyzed by gender, sample type, and the presence of symptoms. The overall sensitivity and specificity for CT was $\%$ and $9 9 . 3 \% .$ respectively. The overall sensitivity and

specificity for NG was $9 7 . 5 \%$ and $9 9 . 7 \% $ , respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for CT for female subjects and male subjects are presented n Tables 5 and 6, respectively. Sensitivity and specificy for NG for female subjects and male subjects are presented in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.

A comparison of patient infected status, individual test results from the reference assays and Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was performed. CT results for infected and non-infected female subjects are presented in Tables 9 and 10, and for infected and non-infected male subjects in Tables 11 and 12. NG results for infected and non-infected female subjects are presented in Tables 13 and 14, and for infected and non-infected male subjects in Tables 15 and 16.

The prevalence of CT and NG in this study was dependent on several factors including age, gender, clinic type, presence of symptoms, and the method of testing. The prevalence per collection site determined by the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for endocervical swab specimens is presented in Table ,for clinician-collected and sel-collected vaginal swab specimens is presented in Table 18; for female urine specimens in Table 19; and for male urethral swab and male urine specimens in Tables 20 and 21, respectively.

The Positive and Negative Predictive Values (PPV and NPV) were calculated using hypothetical prevalence rates and the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay sensitivity and specificity determined from the clinical study. The overall sensitivity and specificity for CT was $9 5 . 2 \%$ and $9 9 . 3 \%$ , respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity for NG was $9 7 . 5 \%$ and $9 9 . 7 \%$ , respectively.
