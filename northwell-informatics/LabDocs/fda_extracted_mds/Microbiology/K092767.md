DEVICE TRADE NAME:

BBLTM CHROMagarTM MRSA II

DEVICE COMMON NAME:

Culture Medium

DEVICE CLASSIFICATION:

21 CFR§866.1700, Class II

# PREDICATE DEVICES:

BBLTM CHROMagarTM MRSA (K042812) BBLTM Oxacillin Screen Agar (K863821)

# INTENDED USE:

BBLTM CHROMagarT™M MRSA II is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the qualitative direct detection of nasal colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in healthcare settings. The test is performed on anterior nares swab specimens from patients to screen for MRSA colonization.

BBL CHROMagar MRSA II is not intended to diagnose, guide or monitor treatment for MRSA infections. A negative result does not preclude MRSA nasal colonization. Concomitant cultures are necessary for organism identification, susceptibility testing or epidemiological typing.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

BBLTM CHROMagarTM MRSA II (CMRSA II) permits the direct detection and identification of MRSA through the incorporation of specific chromogenic substrates and cefoxitin. MRSA strains will grow in the presence of cefoxitin' and produce mauvecolored colonies resulting from hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate. Selective agents are incorporated for the suppression of gram-negative organisms, yeast and enterococci and some other gram-positive cocci. Bacteria other than MRSA may utilize other

chromogenic substrates in the medium resulting in the growth of colonies that are not mauve.

# DEVICE COMPARISON:

# The BBLTM CHROMagarTM MRSA II (CMRSA II) differs from the BBL CHROMagar MRSA (CMRSA) (K042812) in the following ways:

CMRSA II detects and identifies MRSA within 20-26 hours; whereas, CMRSA detects and identifies MRSA at $2 4 \pm 4$ hours to $4 8 \pm 4$ hours.

# The BBLTM CHROMagar™M MRSA II differs from the BBL™M Oxacillin Screen Agar (OSA) (K863821) in the following ways:

CMRSA II is selective and differential culture medium for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of MRSA, whereas, OSA is a selective culture medium for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of MRSA.

CMRSA II is intended to identify MRSA from nares specimens; whereas, OSA is cleared for the identification of MRSA from pure clinical isolates that were identified as Staphylococcus aureus.

CMRSA II utilizes direct inoculation from specimen collection devices. OSA utilizes indirect inoculation from a broth suspension of pure S. aureus colonies isolated from18-24 hour culture.

CMRSA II utilizes cefoxitin as a selective agent to differentiate MRSA from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and other organisms; whereas, OSA utilizes oxacillin as a selective agent to identify MRSA from a pure S. aureus culture.

CMRSA II utilizes chromogenic substances to facilitate the differentiation of MRSA from MSSA and other organisms; whereas, OSA does not contain chromogenic substances to differentiate growth on the plate.

CMRSA II produces mauve colonies as an indicator of MRSA; whereas, any colony growth seen on OSA is an indicator of MRSA. .

CMRSA II detects and identifies MRSA in 20-26 hours; whereas, OSA identifies MRSA in 24 hours.

CMRSA II utilizes incubation conditions at a temperature of $3 5 . 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ whereas, OSA utilizes incubation conditions at temperature of $3 0 { - } 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

# SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE DATA:

# Analytical Studies:

# Interfering Substances

Commonly used transport devices, nasal spray and whole blood were evaluated for potential interference and inhibition of MRSA on CMRSA II.

Nasal sprays containing fluticasone propionate, azelastine hydrochloride and oxymetazoline hydrochloride as well as OTC throat drops containing menthol demonstrated antibacterial activity. No other substances or transport devices interfered with recovery of MRSA on CMRSA II.

# Reproducibility

Reproducibility testing of the CMRSA II was evaluated using 20 test strains. Three different lots of CMRSA II were tested to determine that CMRSA II reliably detects MRSA within lots and across lots. Acceptance criteria for reproducibility of $2 9 5 \%$ for both inter-lot and overall testing intervals was met.

# Recovery Rate (Limit of Detection)

BBL CROMagar MRSA II was evaluated to determine the recovery rate (limit of detection (LOD)) for recovery of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Seven test strains, representing five heterogeneous and two homogeneous MRSA were evaluated for recovery on BBL CHROMagar MRSA II. Non-selective Columbia Agar with $5 \%$ EY Sheep Blood plates were used to determine the organism concentration expressed in colony forming units (CFU) for each dilution. Analytical studies, including incubation time, analytical reactivity or sensitivity, interfering substances and reproducibility were all performed using an MRSA suspension of $\mathbf { \mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 5 } C F U / m L } }$ . Ten $\mu \mu$ of this suspension was then inoculated on to BBL CHROMagar MRSA II.

# Clinical Studies

# Reproducibility Testing

Testing of ten (10) masked strains of S. aureus was conducted at three clinical sites. The panel included seven (7) MRSA and three (3) methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Individual and combined site reproducibility agreements were $100 \%$ across three successive days.

# Challenge Strain Testing

Testing of twenty (20) challenge strains of S. aureus was conducted at three clinical sites. The panel included 14 MRSA and 6 MSSA. Individual sites and combined site agreements were $100 \%$ .

# Clinical Accuracy

The performance of BBLTM CHROMagarTM MRSA II was evaluated at three diverse clinical laboratories in the U.S. A total of 1187 compliant remnant, prospective, nares specimens were enrolled. Specimens were evaluated by comparing the recovery of MRSA on traditional culture media and BBL™M CHROMagar™M MRSA II plates. S. aureus recovered on the traditional culture media was tested by the cefoxitin disk diffusion test method. BBLTM CHROMagarTM MRSA II was interpreted as positive for MRSA at 20-26 hours based on detection of mauve colonies.

A total of 162 specimens were found to be MRSA positive. The positive percent agreement of BBLTM CHROMagarTM MRSA II to cefoxitin disk was $92 \%$ (149/162). The negative percent agreement of BBL CHROMagar MRSA II compared to cefoxitin disk $9 9 . 9 \%$ (1024/1025) (Table 1).
