# I. Device Description:

BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II medium permits the direct detection and identification of MRSA through the incorporation of specific chromogenic substrates and the antibiotic cefoxitin. MRSA strains will grow in the presence of cefoxitin and produce mauve-colored colonies resulting from hydrolysis of the chromogenic

substrate. Selective agents are incorporated for the suppression of gram-negative organisms, yeast and enterococci and some other gram-positive cocci. Bacteria other than MRSA may utilize other chromogenic substrates in the medium resulting in the growth of colonies that are not mauve.

# L. Test Principle:

BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II permits the direct detection and identification of MRSA through the incorporation of specific chromogenic substrates and cefoxitin. MRSA strains will grow in the presence of cefoxitin and produce mauve colonies resulting from hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate. Additional selective agents are incorporated for the suppression of gram-negative organisms, yeast and some other grampositive cocci. Bacteria other than MRSA may utilize other chromogenic substrates in the medium resulting in the growth of colonies that are not mauve.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility study included seven MRSA (6 heterozygous and 1 homozygous MRSA isolates), three Methicillin-Susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), tested in triplicates, on three separate days, at three clinical sites. All results were as expected.

$1 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 3$ operators x 3 days x 3 sites 270

Reproducibility was $59 5 \%$ .

The precision study was performed using three different lots over three days by three independent readers. There were nine MRSA, two Borderline Oxacillin Resistant S. aureus (BORSA), and nine non-MRSA.

All results were as expected.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended quality control (QC) organisms, S. aureus ATCC 43300 as positive control, and S. aureus ATCC 29213 as negative control were used. Quality control data were compiled across all three sites and all QC results were acceptable.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical sensitivity:

Analytical reactivity (sensitivity) study was performed on archived collection of 292 MRSA (including USA 100, 300, 400, 500, 700, 800) isolates. Each MRSA isolate was inoculated using a suspension of $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ CFU/mL on two CMRSA II plates and read by at least two readers. Three different lots were used in the analytical sensitivity study. The table below demonstrates the analytical sensitivity of CMRSA II with MRSA strains.

There were 25 false negatives with lot 1. Five MRSA strains did not grow on the CMRSA II and 20 MRSA strains produced non-mauve colonies on the CMRSA II.

There were also 25 false negatives with lot 2. Five MRSA strains did not grow on the CMRSA II and 20 MRSA strains produced non-mauve colonies on the CMRSA II.

There were 23 false negatives with lot 3. Three 3 MRSA strains did not grow on the CMRSA II and 20 MRSA strains produced non-mauve colonies on the CMRSA II.

There were a total of 27 discrepant results in the analytical reactivity study. These discrepant results were further evaluated on the CMRSA II using a suspension of $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . Ten $\mu \mathrm { l }$ of this suspension was then inoculated on to CMRSA II. Twenty-five of the twenty-seven isolates evaluated produced mauve colonies on CMRSA II at $^ { 2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at this concentration.

# Recovery Study (Limit of Detection (LoD))

The recovery study included two well characterized and recognized MRSA strains (ATCC 33592 and ATCC 43300) and two in house strains. Analytical studies such as incubation time, analytical reactivity or sensitivity, interfering substances and reproducibility study were all performed using MRSA concentration of $\mathrm { i } _ { \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { { C F U / m L } } } }$ . Challenge testing was performed at a final concentration $1 0 ^ { 7 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

# f. Analytical specificity:

Analytical specificity was performed on archived collection of 275 nonMRSA (including 96 Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 88 Coagulase negative Staphylococci and 91 miscellaneous) isolates. Each isolate was inoculated on two CMRSA II plates and read by at least two readers. Three different lots were used in the analytical specificity study. The table below demonstrates the analytical specificity of CMRSA II with nonMRSA strains.

With Lot 1, there were 11 non-MRSA strains that produced mauve colonies. Six of these strains were Methicillin Susceptible $S .$ . aureus (MSSA). $C .$ . meningosepticum, $C .$ jekeium, $R .$ . equi, $B .$ . cereus, and S. simulans also produced mauve colonies.

With Lot 2, there were 11 non-MRSA strains that produced mauve colonies.   
Five of these strains were Methicillin Susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). C.   
meningosepticum, C. jekeium, R. equi, E. faecalis (VRE), B. cereus, and S.   
simulans.

With Lot 3, there were 12 non-MRSA strains that produced mauve colonies. Seven of these strains were Methicillin Susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). C. meningosepticum, C. jekeium, R. equi, B. cereus, and S. simulans also produced mauve colonies.

Additional specificity studies were performed to include isolates of ESBL producers, KPC producers, additional Pseudomonas species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Bacillus sp. which demonstrated negative results.

# Interference Study

Interfering substances, such as, human blood, over-the -counter (OTC) nasal sprays, antihistamines, steroids, mucous, and menthol were evaluated for potential interference of growth of MRSA on BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II (CMRSA II) medium. Nasal sprays containing azelastine hydrochloride, fluticasone propionate, oxymetazoline hydrochloride and OTC throat drops containing menthol were found to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of MRSA. These substances will be listed in the proposed package insert as potentially interfering substances.

Additionally, five transport devices were evaluated for their impact on the recovery of MRSA on the CMRSA II medium. All five transport devices were found to have no effect on MRSA recovery.

# Incubation Time

An Incubation Time study was performed on 50 MRSA and 50 non-MRSA to determine the performance of CMRSA II at specified incubation times. A recommendation of 24- hour read (20 – 26 hours incubation) will be included in the package insert. A limitation statement will be included that incubation shorter than 20 hours may reduce the sensitivity of CMRSA II.

# Additional Tests

One hundred and sixty five characterized isolates were evaluated to determine whether coagulase and Staphylococcus latex agglutination testing could be performed directly from the CMRSA II plate. Each isolate was inoculated onto a blood agar plate and then onto CMRSA II. Tube coagulase and Staphylococcus latex agglutination testing was then performed from each plate and compared to the expected result. Both the blood agar plate and CMRSA II plates demonstrate expected results.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of the CMRSA II was evaluated at three sites using 1187 anterior nares specimens. Specimens were evaluated by comparing the recovery of MRSA on Trypticase Soy Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood (TSA II)

plates and each site’s routine procedure for identification of S. aureus , i.e., (Traditional Culture) to CMRSA II plates. The traditional culture method included Staphylococcal latex agglutination testing for two sites and the third site included coagulase testing. All S. aureus recovered were tested for mec-A mediated oxacillin resistance by the cefoxitin disk diffusion test. Cefoxitin disk $( 3 0 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ diffusion test results followed CLSI methods and interpretive criteria. The CMRSA II was interpreted as positive for MRSA at 20-26 hours based on detection of mauve colonies. The performance of CMRSA II vs Cefoxitin Disk is demonstrated in the table below.
