# Device Description

The POC-AS10 Auto sampler is an optional accessory to the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer. The POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer is an in vitro diagnostic device designed to measure changes in $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ content in breath $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ gas by infrared spectroscopic analysis. The POC-AS10 Auto sampler expands the number of breath collection bags that can be set up and analyzed by the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer. By connecting the POC-AS10 Auto sampler to the POCone Infrared Speohotmeer, up to ten pairs  breat collectn bags (20 bags total) can be et up at one time.

# 5. InTeNded UsE/IndiCAtiOnS foR UsE

The POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer is an in vitro diagnostic device designed to measure changes in $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ content in breath $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ gas by infrared spectroscopic analysis. The POC-AS10 Auto sampler expands the number of breath collection bags that can be set up and analyzed by the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer.

The POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer is intended for use in conjunction with commercially available Meretek $^ { 1 3 } { \cal C }$ -urea breath tests for the detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. The POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer is suitable for use in both point of care and clinical laboratory settings.

# 6TECHnologiCAl CHaracteristiCS and SuBstantial EquiValence

The POC-AS10 Auto sampler is an optional accessory to the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer. The POC-AS10 Auto sampler, connected to the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer, is substantially equivalent to the parent device based on the intended use and technological characteristics.

# 7PeRForMaNce TESTInG

Testing activities for the POC-AS10 Auto sampler consisted of electrical testing of the POC-AS10 Auto sampler unit and system level nonclinical testing with the POC-AS10 Auto sampler connected to the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer. The nonclinical testing consisted of reproducibility and carry-over studies using standard gas samples. The testing demonstrated that the POC-AS10 Auto sampler accessory to the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer successfully fulfilled prospectively defined verification and validation activities.

Re: K092817 Trade/Device Name: POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer, POC-AS10 Auto sampler Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.3110 Regulation Name: Campylobacter fetus serological reagents Regulatory Class: Class I Product Code: MSQ, JJQ Dated: February 5, 2010 Received: February 12, 2010

Dear Ms. Sinclair:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of

medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
