# I. Device Description:

The POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer is a compact analyzer designed for on-site performance of the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ -urea breath test. For the test the patient provides an initial breath sample (reference or baseline) by blowing into an Otsuka breath collection bag. After ingestion of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -labeled urea and after a specified period of time, another breath sample is provided (test or post dose) by blowing into a second breath collection bag. The bag includes a mouthpiece and port compatible with the inlet ports of the POCone. The mouthpiece end of the bag has a one way valve which prevents loss of breath sample. The POCone has 2 ports for attaching the breath collection bags. After attachment, the reference and test breath samples are automatically injected and measurements are performed by the POCone for approximately 2 minutes. User interface with the POCone is by means of a keypad and LCD screen on the front panel. An internal printer is provided to allow subject information and test results to be printed.

The POC-AS10 Auto sampler is an optional accessory that expands the number of breath collection bags that can be set and analyzed by the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer. By connecting the POC-AS10 Auto sampler to the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer, up to ten pairs of breath collection bags can be set up at one time.

# K. Standard/Guidance Documents Referenced:

• IEC 61010-1: Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use – Part 1. General requirements.

IEC 61010-2-101: Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use – Part 2-101. Particular requirements for in vitro diagnostics (IVD) medical equipment.

# L. Test Principle:

The principle of measurement of the POCone spectrophotometer is based on the utilization of the difference between the specific absorptions of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $^ { 1 2 } { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 2 }$ in the infrared region.

When breath samples collected in breath collection bags are placed on the inlet ports of the POCone, the instrument draws in samples from the 2 bags in sequence. It automatically

removes moisture from the breath and meters the samples into the measurement cell. Light from a temperature-stabilized infrared light source passes through a mechanical chopper and then through each gas sample. The intensity of the transmitted signal is measured by a cooled infrared detector. The instrument measures absorption of breath gas by calculating the ratios of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ for the reference breath gas and sample breath gas. The difference between the ratios is calculated to obtain the final measurement result, which is reported as $\Delta ^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and expressed as delta per mil $( \\\\% 0 )$ or delta over baseline (DOB). Internal algorithms calculate the isotope ratios and report the result to the display screen and on an integral printer.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was performed to assess the within-run precision of the POCone with the POC-AS10 connected by replicate measurements of standard gas samples. Four standard gas samples with different $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratios containing $3 \%$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ were used in the study. The values for the standard gas samples were determined by the conventional GIRMS method. Among these standard gas samples, the one having the lowest $\delta ^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ value $( - 3 2 . 7 \text{‰}$ was used as the reference gas and the $\Delta ^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ values were calculated for the other 3 standard gas samples $( \Delta 1 . 7 \% 0 , \Delta 1 3 . 7 \% 0 ,$ , $\Delta 2 6 . 7 \text{‰}$ in addition to $\text{‰}$ gas for zero balance check. Measurements on each of the gases were performed using three different sets of POCone with POC-AS10, paired with reference gas sample.

The standard deviation for the four gas values measured ranged from $0 . 0 6 \text{‰}$ to $0 . 1 7 \text{‰}$ . No significant difference in the standard deviations among the three devices or the gas values was evident.

When breath samples collected in breath collection bags are placed on the inlet ports of the POCone, the instrument draws in samples from the 2 bags in sequence.
