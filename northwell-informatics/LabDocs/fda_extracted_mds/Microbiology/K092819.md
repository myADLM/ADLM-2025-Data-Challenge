# Date Prepared:

September 11, 2009

Device Trade Name:

Spectra T VRE

# Predicate Device:

Remel Bile Esculin Azide Agar with $6 \mu \ g / \ m _ { \mathrm { m } } |$ Vancomycin

# Device Classification:

21 CFR 866.1700: Culture medium for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.

# Intended Use:

Remel Spectra™M VRE is a selective and differential chromogenic medium, containing 6 µg/ml of vancomycin, intended for use in the qualitative detection of gastrointestinal colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) to aid in the prevention and control of VRE in healthcare settings. The test is performed with rectal swab and fecal specimens from patients to screen for VRE colonization. Spectra™M VRE is not intended to diagnose VRE infection or to guide or monitor treatment for infections. Subculture to non-selective media (e.g. Tryptic Soy Agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood) is needed for further identification, susceptibility testing, and epidemiological typing.

# Device Description:

Remel Spectra™M VRE is an opaque medium allowing differentiation of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium from vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis by incorporation of two chromogens that are targeted by phosphatase and α- galactosidase. The action of these enzymes on the chromogens results in a build-up of color within the colony. The presence of phosphatase enzymes in both E. faecium and E. faecalis results in a light blue or blue colony. However, E. faecium also produces a-galactosidase, resulting in a mix of blué and pink chromophores within the bacterium producing navy blue or pink-purple colonies, which are distinguished from the light blue or blue E. faecalis colonies. Additional antibiotics, in combination with vancomycin, are present to suppress the growth of competing flora including E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus, both of which are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, possessing the chromosomally encoded VanC resistance mechanism.

# Summary of Performance Data:

# Clinical Accuracy:

The performance of Spectra™ VRE was evaluated at three geographically diverse regions of the United States. A total of six hundred twenty-three (623) prospective rectal swab and fecal surveillance specimens (yielding 629 data points) were evaluated. Results from Spectra™ VRE at 24 hours incubation were compared to results obtained from traditional culture on Bile Esculin Azide Agar with $6 \mu { \sf g } / { \sf m } { \sf t }$ Vancomycin (BEAV) after 48 hours incubation. Two hundred twenty VRE with minimal inhibitory concentration MiCs to vancomycin of $> 2 5 6 ~ \mu g / m |$ were recovered from six hundred twenty three specimens (191 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and 29 vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis). The overall recovery of VRE on Spectra™M VRE at 24 hours was $9 9 . 1 \%$ (218/220) compared to recovery of $9 5 . 5 \%$ (210/220) on BEAV at 48 hours.

Suspect isolates of VRE were evaluated using the Vitek® 2 system and biochemical tests, and an antibiotic gradient method for determination of vancomycin MIC. For detection of VRE by colored colonies isolated on Spectra™M VRE at 24 hours compared to identification and susceptibility testing as described, the overall agreement was $9 9 . 5 \%$ (626/629).

# Performance Compared to Commercially Available Devices:

Spectra™ VRE was compared to culture on Bile Esculin Azide with $6 \ \mu { \sf g } / \mathsf { m l }$ Vancomycin, with subsequent identification and susceptibility testing._ There was $8 2 . 7 \%$ (520/629) agreement with six hundred twenty-nine isolates. The Bile Esculin Azide with $6 \mu { \sf g } / { \sf m } !$ Vancomycin demonstrated $9 5 . 5 \%$ (210/220) agreement for the recovery of VRE (acquired resistance) and $7 5 . 8 \%$ (310/409) agreement for non-VRE.

# Interfering Substances:

The following substances were evaluated for potential interference of the chromogenic reaction of Spectra™ VRE. These substances were tested in combination with vancomycinresistant $\varepsilon$ faecalis and $\varepsilon$ faecium isolates at a concentration of 50 CFU: blood, mucous, MYLANTA Maximum Strength, Pepto-Bismol®, Imodium A-D, Kaopectate®, Fletcher's Castoria®, PEPCID® AC Maximum Strength, Tagamet HB $2 0 0 ^ { \otimes }$ Prilosec $\scriptstyle \mathtt { \Gamma } _ { \mathtt { { O T C } } } \mathtt { \otimes }$ vancomycin, metronidazole, barium sulfate, Preparation $H ^ { \phi }$ petroleum jelly, glycerin, bisacodyl, witch hazel, miconazole, nonoxynol $\Lsh$ $k ^ { \phi }$ Jelly. Hydrocortisone acetate was not evaluated. Blood, Pepto-Bismol®, glycerin, vancomycin, miconazole, and Preparation ${ \sf H } ^ { \otimes }$ may reduce the recovery of vancomycin resistant $E .$ faecalis and $E .$ faecium strains.

# Reproducibility:

Reproduciblity testing was conducted at four sites on three separate days with twenty blinded strains including vancomycin susceptible and resistant E. faecium and E. faecalis, as well as quality control reference strains. The strains produced the expected result with Spectra™ VRE $100 \%$ of the time at 24 hours.
