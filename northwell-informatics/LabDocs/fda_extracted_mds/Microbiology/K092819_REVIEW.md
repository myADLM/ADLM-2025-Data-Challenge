# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use:

Remel Spectra™ VRE is a selective and differential chromogenic medium, containing $6 \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ of vancomycin, intended for use in the qualitative detection of gastrointestinal colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) to aid in the prevention and control of VRE in healthcare settings. The test is performed with rectal swab and fecal specimens from patients to screen for VRE colonization. Spectra™ VRE is not intended to diagnose VRE infection or to guide or monitor treatment for infections. Subculture to non-selective media (e.g. Tryptic Soy Agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood) is needed for further identification, susceptibility testing, and epidemiological typing.

# 2. Indication for use:

Remel Spectra™ VRE is a selective and differential chromogenic medium, containing $6 \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ of vancomycin, intended for use in the qualitative detection of gastrointestinal colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) to aid in the prevention and control of VRE in healthcare settings. The test is performed with rectal swab and fecal specimens from patients to screen for VRE colonization. Spectra™ VRE is not intended to diagnose VRE infection or to guide or monitor treatment for infections. Subculture to non-selective media (e.g. Tryptic Soy Agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood) is needed for further identification, susceptibility testing, and epidemiological typing.

3. Special conditions for use statement: For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable

# I. Device Description:

Remel Spectra™ VRE is an opaque medium allowing differentiation of vancomycinresistant $E .$ . faecium from vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecalis by incorporation of two chromogens that are targeted by phosphatase and $\mathfrak { a }$ -galactosidase. The action of these enzymes on the chromogens results in a build-up of color within the colony. The presence of phosphatase enzymes in both $E .$ . faecium and $E .$ . faecalis results in a light blue or navy blue colony. However, $E .$ . faecium also produces $\mathfrak { a }$ -galactosidase, resulting in a mix of blue and pink chromophores within the bacterium producing navy blue, or pink-purple colonies, which are distinguished from the light blue or blue $E$ . faecalis colonies. Additional antibiotics, in combination with vancomycin, are present to suppress the growth of competing flora including $E .$ . gallinarum and $E$ . casseliflavus, both of which are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, possessing the chromosomally encoded VanC resistance mechanism.

Remel Spectra™ VRE is an opaque medium allowing differentiation of vancomycinresistant $E .$ . faecium from vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecalis by incorporation of two chromogens that are targeted by phosphatase and $\mathfrak { a }$ -galactosidase. The action of these enzymes on the chromogens results in a build-up of color within the colony.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing was conducted at four sites on three separate days with twenty blinded strains of vancomycin-sensitive enterococci and VRE. The strains produced the expected result with Spectra™ VRE $100 \%$ of the time at 24 hours.

# Clinical Accuracy:

The performance of Spectra™ VRE was evaluated at three geographically diverse regions of the United States. A total of six hundred twenty three prospective rectal swabs, and fecal surveillance specimens (yielding 629 data points) were evaluated. Results from Spectra™ VRE at 24 hours incubation were compared to results obtained from traditional culture on Bile Esculin Azide Agar with $6 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l }$ Vancomycin (BEAV) after 48 hours incubation. Two hundred twenty VRE with minimal inhibitory concentration MICs to vancomycin of $> 2 5 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ were recovered from six hundred twenty three specimens (191 vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecium and 29 vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecalis). The overall recovery of VRE on Spectra™ VRE at 24 hours was $9 9 . 1 \%$ (218/220) compared to recovery of $9 5 . 5 \%$ (210/220) on BEAV at 48 hours.

Suspect isolates of VRE were evaluated using Vitek $^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2$ system and biochemical tests, and an antibiotic gradient method for determination of vancomycin MIC. For detection of VRE by colored colonies isolated on Spectra™ VRE at 24 hours compared to identification and susceptibility testing as described, the overall agreement was $9 9 . 5 \%$ (626/629).

# Challenge Studies

Spectra™ VRE was evaluated with fifty well-characterized strains of enterococci (vancomycin susceptible and resistant enterococci) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three strains of $E$ . faecium with vancomycin MICs between $1 2 8 { - } 1 0 2 4 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ failed to grow at 24 hours. One strain of $E .$ . faecium with a vancomycin MIC of $1 6 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m l }$ grew and produced pink-purple colonies.

Cross Reactivity Study

Two hundred twenty-nine (229) microorganisms representing gram-negative rods, yeast, streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, and related organisms were evaluated with Spectra™ VRE. Six of eleven KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae developed large blue colonies on Spectra™ VRE at 24 hours. No other cross reactivity was observed following 24 hours incubation.

The study results are reflected in the Limitation and Cross Reactivity sections of the device package insert.

# Interference Study

The following substances were evaluated for potential interference of the chromogenic reaction of Spectra™ VRE. These substances were tested in combination with vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecalis and $E$ . faecium isolates at a concentration of 50 CFU: blood, mucous, MYLANTA® Maximum Strength, Pepto-Bismol®, Imodium® A-D, Kaopectate®, Fletcher’s Castoria®, PEPCID® AC Maximum Strength, Tagamet HB $2 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ , Prilosec $\mathrm { O T C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ , vancomycin, metronidazole, barium sulfate, Preparation ${ \dot { \mathrm { H } } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ , petroleum jelly, glycerin, bisacodyl, witch hazel, miconazole, nonoxynol-9, $\operatorname { K Y } ^ { \mathfrak { \textregistered } }$ Jelly. Hydrocortisone acetate was not evaluated. Blood, Pepto-Bismol®, glycerin, vancomycin, miconazole, and Preparation $\mathrm { H } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ may reduce the recovery of vancomycin resistant $E .$ . faecalis and $E$ . faecium strains.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Spectra™ VRE was compared to culture on Bile Esculin Azide with $6 \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ Vancomycin, with subsequent identification and susceptibility testing. There was $8 2 . 7 \%$ (520/629) agreement with six hundred twenty-nine isolates. The Bile Esculin Azide with $6 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l }$ Vancomycin demonstrated $9 5 . 5 \%$ (210/220) agreement for the recovery of VRE (acquired resistance) and $7 5 . 8 \%$ (310/409) agreement for non-VRE.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Information collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 2006 and 2007 showed that enterococci caused about 1 of every 8 infections in hospitals, with roughly $30 \%$ of isolates resistant to vancomycin (i.e. VRE). VRE are the third leading cause of hospital-acquired infection. Hospital-acquired enterococcal infections typically occur in very ill or debilitated patients who have been exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics. They are also the third most common cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in the U.S. The overall prevalence rate of VRE colonization in this study was $3 5 \%$ .
