# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis   
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied   
c) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity should include: i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.

The design control activities performed

Vancomycin, on MicroScan $\textcircled{8}$ Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive Panels, was evaluated and cleared (K060312) with three read methods Rapid (WalkAway $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ SI, ${ < } 1 6$ hours), Overnight Instrument (WalkAway $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ SI, 16/18 hours) and Overnight Manual (manual/visual read, 16-20 hours), by comparing Dried panel performance with frozen Reference Panels using stock and fresh isolates (Efficacy phase), challenge strains (Challenge phase), and QC strains (QC testing). Challenge strains were compared to Expected Results determined prior to the evaluation.

Data collected from the external validation of vancomycin (K060312) was processed using the modified S. aureus interpretive criteria $( \mathsf { S } \le 2 , \mathsf { I } = 4 - 8 , \mathsf { R } \ge 1 6 )$ . The Microdilution Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) interpretive standards for vancomycin were modified by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in January 2006. Reference CLSI Document M100 – S16 (Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Sixteenth Informational Supplement). These revised interpretive criteria were approved by the FDA for drug manufacturer, Baxter Healthcare, Inc., in April of 2008.

The gram-positive Vancomycin Efficacy phase was conducted with a total of five hundred and forty nine (549) isolates, including seventy three (73) stock and four hundred and seventy six (476) fresh clinical isolates. The Challenge phase was conducted with 78 challenge isolates. The combined Rapid Read results, from the Efficacy and Challenge studies, demonstrated overall Essential Agreement of $9 7 . 6 \%$ (565/579) and Categorical Agreement of $9 7 . 9 \%$ (567/579) when processed using the modified S. aureus interpretive criteria $( \mathbb { S } \le 2 , | = 4 - 8 , \mathsf { R } \ge 1 6 )$ .

Below is a summary of the performance of S. aureus with the new interpretive criteria using the different read methods

NOTE: Efficacy and Challenge total for the Rapid Instrument Read Method equaled 579 isolates. Results for 42 Efficacy isolates and 6 Challenge isolates were not reported due to read times ${ \ge } 1 6$ hours. The 3 VRSA isolates are included in the Combined Efficacy and Challenge data.

There were more minor errors observed with the new interpretive criteria for S. aureus, specifically, there were 2 minor errors with the Rapid read method ${ < } 1 6$ hours), 3 minor errors with the dried overnight instrument method, and 2 minor errors with the dried overnight manual method. However, the number of minor errors is within the acceptable limits as recommended in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. There were no minor errors observed with S. aureus using the old interpretive criteria. The number of major errors did not change when either the old or new interpretive criteria were used with all read methods. Considering the EA and CA of $59 7 \%$ , the overall performance of S. aureus with the new interpretive criteria is acceptable.

# 6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for Use Enclosure (and Class III Summary for Class III devices).

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
