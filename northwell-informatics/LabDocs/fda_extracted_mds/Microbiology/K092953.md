# Device Description:

The Cepheid Xpert vanA Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of the vanA gene sequence associated with vancomycin resistance in bacteria obtained directly from rectal swab specimens. The Xpert vanA Assay system performs real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of DNA after an initial sample processing step. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXper $\mathfrak { Q }$ Dx System.

The specimen is collected on a double swab, one of which is placed in a tube containing elution reagent. Following brief vortexing, the eluted material and two single-use reagents (Reagent 1 and Reagent 2) that are provided with the assay are transferred to different, uniquely-labeled chambers of the disposable fluidic cartridge (the Xpert vanA cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Dx System instrument platform, which performs hands-off realtime, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of DNA. In this platform, additional sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fullyautomated and completely integrated.

The GeneXpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System consists of a GeneXpert instrument, personal computer, and the multi-chambered fluidic cartridges that are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time PCR for detection of the vanA gene that is associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in.less than 45 minutes. Each instrument system has 1 to 16 randomly accessible modules that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.

The Xpert vanA Assay includes reagents for the detection of the vanA resistant gene as well as an internal sample processing control (SPC) to control for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay. The SPC also ensures the PCR conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the PCR reagents are functional. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

# Device Intended Use:

The Cepheid Xpert® vanA Assay performed in the GeneXpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Dx System is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for rapid detection of the vanA gene sequence associated with vancomycin resistance in bacteria obtained from rectal swab specimens from patients at risk for intestinal colonization with vancomycin-resistant bacteria. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the vanA gene that is frequently associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The Xpert vanA Assay is intended to aid in the recognition, prevention, and control of vancomycinresistant organisms that colonize patients in healthcare settings. The Xpert vanA Assay is not intended to diagnose infections caused by vancomycin-resistant bacteria nor to guide or monitor treatment for vancomycin-resistant bacterial infections. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for identification of vancomycin-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and for epidemiological typing.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Xpert vanA Assay is substantially equivalent to the BD IDI-VanR Assay (510(k) #K061686). Both assays detect vancomycin resistance genes directly from rectal swab specimens from patients at risk for VRE colonization. Both assays use real-time PCR amplification and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization detection.

Table 5.1 shows the similarities and differences between the Xpert vanA Assay and the BD IDI-VanR Assay.

The Xpert vanA is also substantially equivalent to the reference direct culture method. The reference culture method is the Remel Bile Esculin Azide agar with $6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ vancomycin (BEAV) [510(k) #K972359].

Performance characteristics of the Xpert vanA Assay were determined in a multi-site prospective investigation study at three US institutions by comparing the Xpert vanA Assay to reference culture followed by bi-directional sequencing confirmation on those samples positive for vanA by culture.

Table 5.2 compares the new device with the reference direct culture method. The test results showed the Xpert vanA Assay to be substantially equivalent to the current standard of care, the reference culture method.

# Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

Thirty vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains and 20 vancomycin sensitive enterococci strains, provided by the CDC, were tested using the Xpert vanA Assay. Of the 30 vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains, 10 were identified as vanA positive. Enterococci strains were selected to broadly represent the genetic diversity found in enterococci. Stock cultures were prepared by suspending the bacterial growth from agar plates in PBS buffer containing $1 5 \%$ glycerol. The concentration of each stock was adjusted to $\phantom { + } 5 . 6 \phantom { + } 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ to $2 . 1 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } \mathrm { C F U / \bar { m } L }$ .All strains were serially diluted to approximately 360 CFU/swab and tested in triplicate.

Under the conditions of this study, all 20 vancomycin sensitive strains were reported as "vanA NEGATIVE," as expected. Among the 10 vanA positive vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains tested, one strain was reported as "vanA NEGATIVE." When this strain was sequenced the data matched $100 \%$ to a reference vanB sequence, confirming that the Xpert vanA Assay accurately reported the strain "vanA NEGATIVE." The remaining 9 vanA positive vancomycin resistant enterococci strains were correctly reported as "vanA POSITIVE," as expected. Among the 20 non-vanA vancomycin resistant enterococci strains, all were reported as "vanA NEGATIVE," as expected.

# Analytical Sensitivity

Studies were performed to determine the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of Enterococcus faecium (vanA) diluted into a fecal matrix of human origin that can be detected by the Xpert vanA Assay. The fecal matrix consisted of autoclaved human liquid feces (vanA negative) diluted 1:10 in Tris buffer. The LoD is defined as the lowest number of colony forming units (CFU) per swab that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence.

The analytical LoD was estimated using 4 to 10 replicates at each dilution. The LoD was confirmed by running a total of 20 replicates at the estimated LoD concentration. Under the conditions of this study, the limit of detection for the Xpert vanA Assay on a simulated rectal swab specimen is 37 CFU.

# Linearity

A study was conducted to define the reportable range of the Xpert vanA Assay and demonstrate a linear between target input and assay output. Linearity was evaluated using Enterococcus faecium (vanA) cells serially diluted over 6 logs and processed using the Xpert vanA Assay. The diluted cells resulted in a cell concentration dose range of 50 CFU/test to $5 \mathbf { x } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU/test. Replicates of four (4) were tested at each concentration.

For enterococci cells, under the conditions of this study, the Xpert vanA Assay responds linearly $( \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 4 )$ with respect to vanA detection as a function of Enterococcus faecium cell input over 6 logs $( 5 0 - 5 \mathbf { \dot { x } } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU/test). The reportable Ct range is 12.1 to 35.3 (cutoff $\mathrm { C t } = 4 0 . 0 $ . PCR efficiency for the vanA reaction is $8 7 . 7 \%$ .

# Analytical Specificity

Forty-two bacterial and fungal strains were collected, quantitated and tested using the Xpert vanA Assay. The strains originated from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Culture Collection University of Göteborg (CCUG), German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The organisms tested were identified as Gram-positive (22), Gram-negative (18), including antibiotic-resistant strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., and yeast (2). The organisms were further classified as aerobic (24), anaerobic (14) or microaerophillic (2). Of the species tested, 2 vancomycin-sensitive strains of $E$ faecalis and $E .$ faecium were included.

Each strain was tested in triplicate at concentrations ranging from $8 . 5 { \bf x } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ to $2 . 3 \mathbf { x } 1 0 ^ { 1 0 }$ EP CFU/swab. Positive and negative controls were included in the study. Under the conditions of the study, all isolates were reported "vanA NEGATIVE". The analytical specificity was $100 \%$ .

# Interfering Substances

Sixteen exogenous substances occasionally used or found in stool were tested for interference with the Xpert vanA Assay. The substances tested are listed in Table 5.3. None of the 16 substances tested showed detectable interference for vanA. However, Hydrocortisone cream ( $1 \%$ Hydrocortisone) and Pepto-Bismol $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ $1 \cdot 5 \%$ Bismuth subsalicylate) may slightly interfere with the Xpert vanA Assay. When tested in the Interference study, Hydrocortisone cream and Pepto-Bismol® resulted in slightly higher Ct values relative to the buffer control.

# Clinical Comparison Study

Performance characteristics of the Xpert vanA Assay were determined in a multi-site prospective investigation study at three US institutions by comparing the Xpert vanA Assay to reference culture followed by bi-directional sequencing for confirmation on vancomycin-resistant $E .$ faecalis or $E .$ faecium isolates.

Subjects included individuals whose routine care called for VRE testing. One swab from a double swab set was used for patient management; the other swab was used for the Xpert vanA Assay testing. The leftover swab designated for patient management was sent to a central laboratory for reference culture.

Leftover specimen swabs designated for culture testing were stored at ${ 2 { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ and shipped on ice packs to the central culture laboratory within 48 hours of collection. Reference culture was initiated within 16 hours of receipt or within 5 days of swab collection.

Each swab was subsequently placed into bile esculin azide broth with $8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ EY vancomycin. The plates were incubated at $3 5 \%$ and examined at 48 and 72 hours. The broth was also incubated at $3 5 \%$ for 48 hours and subcultured to a bile esculin azide agar with $6 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l }$ of vancomycin.

Small, gray colonies with a black halo were considered suspicious for VRE. Presumptive identification was accomplished by performing a Gram stain, catalase and disc pyr (Lpyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide) test. Presumptive VRE specimens were Gram-positive cocci or coccobacilli and pyr positive. Presumptive VRE was definitively identified using the API20S strip (BioMérieux, France). Finally, VRE isolates were tested for their susceptibility to glycopeptides using vancomycin ε-test strips (AB Biodisk, Sweden). Susceptibility to teicoplanin for the isolates was determined by agar dilution. Following reference culture testing, DNA was prepared from vancomycin-resistant $E .$ faecilis or $E$ . faecium isolates, and sent to a second reference laboratory for bi-directional sequencing using alternative vanA specific primers (i.e., different from those used in the Xpert vanA Assay).

Performance of the Xpert vanA Assay was calculated relative to the results of direct culture with bi-directional sequencing, and enriched culture with bi-directional sequencing.

# Overall Results

A total of 1231 specimens were tested by Xpert vanA Assay, culture and bi-directional sequencing.

Performance vs. Direct Culture

Relative to direct culture with bi-directional sequencing, the Xpert vanA Assay demonstrated a percent positive agreement of $9 8 . 4 \%$ and a percent negative agreement of $9 2 . 4 \%$ (Table 5.4).

# Antibiotic Usage

Among the 1231 cases included in the main dataset, antibiotic use within the 3 weeks prior to sample collection was reported for 414 and no antibiotic use was confirmed for 483; for 334 cases, antibiotic status was unknown. Antibiotic use did not cause a statistically significant difference in assay performance.

# Reproducibility

A panel of four specimens with varying concentrations of vanA was tested on 10 different days by two different operators at each of the three sites (4 specimens $\tt { x } 2$ operators/ day $\textbf { x } 1 0$ days x 3 sites). One lot of Xpert vanA Assay was used at each of the 3 testing sites. Xpert vanA Assays were performed according to the Xpert vanA Assay procedure. Results are summarized in Tables 5.6.

# Conclusions

The results of the nonclinical analytical and clinical performance studies summarized above demonstrate that the Xpert vanA Assay is as safe, as effective, and performs as well as the current standard of care, the reference culture method with confirmation of all results by bi-directional sequence analysis. Therefore, the Xpert vanA Assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Dr. Enns:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other

Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html

Sincerely yours,

# Indications for Use Statement

510(k) Number (if known): k092953

Device Name: Xpert vanA

Indications for Use:

The Cepheid Xpert $\mathbf { \otimes }$ vanA Assay performed in the GeneXpert $\otimes$ Dx System is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for rapid detection of the vanA gene sequence associated with vancomycin resistance in bacteria obtained from rectal swab specimens from patients at risk for intestinal colonization with vancomycin-resistant bacteria. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the vanA gene that is frequently associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The Xpert vanA Assay is intended to aid in the recognition, prevention, and control of vancomycinresistant organisms that colonize patients in healthcare settings. The Xpert vanA Assay is not intended to diagnose infections caused by vancomycin-resistant bacteria nor to guide or monitor treatment for vancomycin-resistant bacterial infections. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for identification of vancomycin-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and for epidemiological typing
