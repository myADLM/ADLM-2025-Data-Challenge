# Predicate Device:

Immunoassay: RAMP® Influenza A/B Assay, k071591

# Intended Use

The RAMP® Influenza A/B Assay is a qualitative immunochromatographic assay used to identify the presence of Influenza A and influenza B nucleoprotein antigens in nasal wash, nasal aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic patients. It is an in vitro diagnostic assay that aids in the rapid differential diagnosis of influenza viral infections in symptomatic patients. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. .

The test performance characteristics for Influenza B were established primarily with retrospective, frozen specimens. Users may wish to further evaluate the sensitivity performance of this test for Influenza B using fresh samples.

# RAMP Description of the Device:

The RAMP Influenza A/B Assay is a qualitative immunochromatographic test that utilizes the RAMP 200 instrument for the differential determination of Influenza A and Influenza B in nasal wash/aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and nasopharyngeal swab samples. A wash/aspirate or swab sample is mixed with Sample buffer and applied into the sample well of the Test Cartridge. The sample migrates along the strip. Fluorescent-dyed latex (test) particles, coated with antiInfluenza A and anti-Influenza B antibodies bind to Influenza A or B antigens, respectively, i present in the sample. As the sample migrates along the strip, Influenza-bound particles are captured at either the Influenza A or the Influenza B detection zone, and additional particles are captured at the internal standard zone.

The instrument then measures the amount of fluorescence emitted by the complexes at the two detection zones (Influenza A and Influenza B) and at the internal standard zone. The instrument calculates a ratio (RAMP Ratio) using the fluorescence reading of each detection zone (A or B) and the internal standard zone. The instrument compares these ratios to pre-defined threshold limits to determine a positive or negative result for Influenza A and Influenza B in the tested sample.

# Summary of Studies:

# ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

# Analytical Reactivity

The RAMP Influenza A/B Assay was evaluated for analytical reactivity by testing an isolate strain of Influenza A (Swine NY/02/2009) prepared in Copan UTM. The isolate was tested at different dilutions to find the lowest concentration that would consistently give positive results. Five (5) replicates were tested at each concentration. The reactivity for Influenza A/Swine NY/02/2009 was determined to be $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } T C l D _ { 5 0 } / m L$ .

Although the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay has been shown to detect the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in one culture isolate, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The RAMP Influenza A/B Assay can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot differentiate influenza subtypes.

Dear Mr. Pilgrim:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls.
