Formal/Trade Name:

DensiCHEK™M Plus

Classification Name:

Fully Automated Short-Term Incubation Cycle Antimicrobial Susceptibility Device, 21 CFR 866.1645

Common Name:

DensiCHEK Plus (K083536)

# D. 510(k) Summary:

DensiCHEK™M Plus is intended for use with the VITEK® and $V / \tau E K ^ { \infty } 2$ Systems to measure the optical density of a microorganism suspension. The instrument provides values in McFarland units, proportional to microorganism concentrations. DensiCHEK Plus is indicated for use with polystyrene and glass test tubes and the reading range is $\pmb { 0 . 0 - 4 . 0 }$ McFarland. The DensiCHEK Plus has applications as an in vitro diagnostic medical device.

The intended use of the DensiCHEK Plus, as described in its labeling (DensiCHEK Plus Instrument User Manual), has not changed as a result of this modification to add VITEK 2 AST-YS to the list of products appropriate for use with DensiCHEK Plus now that performance has been established. This modification does not affect the fundamental scientific technology of this device. The device design was not altered in any way.

The DensiCHEK Plus generates a McFarland value using basic colorimetry, which is a method of measurement that relates the amount of color in a transparent medium (liquid) to the amount of a particular substance in the liquid. In general the concentration of the substance being measured is proportional to the intensity of the color of the solution. The darker the color is, the higher the concentration. Absorbance (Abs) is a commonly used measure of the amount of light absorbed by the solution. Absorbance is given by.

Abs $=$ -log T or $\mathsf { A b s } = - \mathsf { l o g } \left( \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { T } } / \mathsf { I } _ { 0 } \right)$

Where:

$\mathsf { T } =$ Transmittance

# ${ \sf I } _ { \sf T } =$ Intensity of light transmitted through the sample

$\mid _ { 0 } =$ Intensity of light entering the sample

The DensiCHEK Plus measures the turbidity of the saline and microorganism suspension using a single wavelength, $5 8 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . The absorption of light determines the McFarland value generated by the instrument. The more turbid the' suspension is, the higher the McFarland standard measurement. The light source in the DensiCHEK plus is an LED that emits a narrow range of wavelengths, and an interference filter is used between the LED and the test tube (sample) to further narrow the wavelength to 580 nm. There are 2 calibration curves pre-programmed into the DensiCHEK Plus, one for glass tubes and one for plastic tubes. The absorbance is different for glass and plastic, therefore the laboratory technician using the DensiCHEK Plus must choose the appropriate tube type setting for the inoculum suspension based on whether it was prepared in a glass or plastic test tube. The instrument is first zeroed using a test tube filled with saline (blank). The technician then places the well-mixed organism suspension into the instrument and slowly rotates the test tube. The instrument will display a series of dashes followed by a McFarland reading.

The DensiCHEK Plus modified device, to include VITEK 2 AST-YS as a product applicable for use with this device, demonstrated substantially equivalent performance during risk assessment studies when compared with the DensiCHEK Plus unmodified device cleared under K083536. Performance with VITEK 2 AST-YS and DensiCHEK Plus has now been established. This Special 510(k) Device Modification presents data in support of DensiCHEK Plus labeling change to add VITEK 2 AST-YS to the list of applicable products for which it can be used to aid in microorganism suspension prepration.

Dear Ms. Tenllado:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
