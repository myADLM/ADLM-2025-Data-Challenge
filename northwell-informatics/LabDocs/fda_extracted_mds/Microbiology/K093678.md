# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Platelia™M Aspergillus EIA is a one-stage immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assay which detects galactomannan in human serum and BAL fluid samples. The assay uses rat EBA-2 monoclonal antibodies, which are directed against Aspergillus galactomannan, and have been characterized in previous studies. The monoclonal antibodies are used, (1) to coat the wells of the microplate and bind the antigen, and.(2) to detect the antigen bound to the sensitized microplate (conjugate reagent: peroxidaselinked monoclonal antibodies).

Serum or BAL fluid samples are heat-treated in the presence of EDTA in order to dissociate immune complexes and to precipitate proteins that could possibly interfere with the test. The treated samples and conjugate are added to the wells coated with monoclonal antibodies, and incubated. A monoclonal antibody - galactomannan - monoclonal antibody / peroxidase complex is formed in the presence of galactomannan antigen.

The strips are washed to remove any unbound material. Next, the substrate solution is added, which will react with the complexes bound to the well to form a blue color reaction. The enzyme reaction is stopped by the addition of acid, which changes the blue color to yellow. The absorbance (optical density) of specimens and controls is determined with a spectrophotometer set at 450 and $6 2 0 / 6 3 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ wavelength.

# B. REPRODUCIBILITY STUDIES

# a) Reproducibility Studies In Serum

Inter-assay and Intra-assay variability for the Platelia™M Aspergillus EIA were determined in a study using a panel of 6 pooled patient serum samples (one negative, one low positive, two positive, and two high positive) obtained at three clinical trial sites in North America. Each of the 6 panel members were tested in triplicate $( \mathbf { x } 3 )$ on 3 different days, on one lot, at two sites (total number of replicates at each site $= 9$ ). Each of the 6 panel members was tested in duplicate $( \mathbf { x } 2 )$ on 3 different days, on 1 lot, at a third site (total number of replicates at the third site $= 6$ ). One (1) operator performed all precision testing at each site. The data were analyzed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)). The mean optical density (OD) and mean index value, standard deviation (SD), percent coefficient of variation $( \% 0 \mathrm { v } )$ , within run precision (intraassay) and within site (inter-assay) precision for each panel member at each site are illustrated below in the following tables.

# ) Reproducibillity Studies in BAL

Inter-assay and Intra-assay variability for the PlateliaTM Aspergillus EIA were determined in a study using a panel of 4 pooled patient BAL samples spiked with purified galactomannan (one negative, one high negative, one low positive and one medium positive) at 3 testing sites (Two US clinical testing sites and one internal site). Each of the 4 panel members and the controls were tested in duplicate $( \mathbf { x } 2 )$ in 2 runs per day on 5 different days on one lot (Total number of replicates at each site $= ~ 1 2 0 )$ . Two (2) operators performed all precision testing at each site. The data was analyzed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)). The mean optical density (OD) and mean index value, standard deviation (SD), percent coefficient of variation $( \% 0 \% )$ , within run precision (intra-assay) and between site, between day, between operator and between run (inter-assay) precision for each panel member are illustrated below in the following table:

# C. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION STUDIES

# I. SERUM SAMPLES

Clinical testing to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of the Platelia™M Aspergillus EIA was conducted on pediatric (age $\leq 2 1$ years) patients at three sites located in the United States and on adult patients at three sites located in North America. The studies were conducted using a total of 1954 serum samples collected from 129 pediatric patients and a total of 1724 serum samples collected from 172 adult patients from the following populations\*:

patients without signs of Invasive Aspergillosis (control patients)   
patients with Probable Invasive Aspergillosis   
patients with Proven Invasive Aspergillosis   
\* The Invasive Fungal Infection Cooperative Group (IFICG) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycosis Study Group (MSG) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in 2002 have defined criteria for diagnosis of Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) in patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoetic stem cell transplant.2

# SENSITIVITY

# A. Pediatrics

Results from this study have been analyzed in terms of patient sensitivity. Sensitivity testing was conducted using the PlateliaTM Aspergillus EIA at three sites on a combined total of 17 immunocompromised pediatric patients diagnosed with Proven or Probable Invasive Aspergillosis.

\*Note: 8 of the 17 patients gave negative Aspergillus galactomannan antigen results. All of the 8 patients with negative Aspergillus galactomannan antigen results received therapy with multiple antifungal agents. The concomitant use of mold-active anti-fungal therapy in some patients with Invasive Aspergillosis may result in reduced sensitivity31.

# B. Adults

Sensitivity testing was conducted using the Platelia™M Aspergillus EIA at three sites on a combined total of 29 Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) and Leukemia adult patients diagnosed with Proven or Probable Invasive Aspergillosis.
