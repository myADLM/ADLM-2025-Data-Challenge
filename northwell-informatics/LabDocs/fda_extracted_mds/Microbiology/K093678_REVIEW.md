# L. Test Principle:

The PlateliaTM Aspergillus EIA is a one-stage immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assay that detects galactomannan in human serum. The assay uses rat EBA-2 monoclonal antibodies, which are directed against Aspergillus galactomannan, and have been characterized in previous studies. The monoclonal antibodies are used to coat the wells of the microplate and bind the antigen and to detect the antigen bound to the sensitized microplate (conjugate reagent: peroxidase-linked monoclonal antibodies). Serum samples are heat-treated in the presence of EDTA in order to dissociate immune complexes and to precipitate serum proteins that could possibly interfere with the test. The treated serum samples and conjugate are added to the wells coated with monoclonal antibodies, and incubated. A monoclonal antibody-galactomannan monoclonal antibody/peroxidase complex is formed in the presence of galactomannan antigen. The strips are washed to remove any unbound material. Next, the substrate solution is added, which will react with the complexes bound to the well to form a blue color reaction. The enzyme reaction is stopped by the addition of acid, which changes the blue color to yellow. The absorbance (optical density) of specimens and controls is determined with a spectrophotometer set at 450 and $6 2 0 / 6 3 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ wavelength.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility Studies in BAL

Inter and Intra-Assay variability was determined using a panel of four pooled patient BAL fluid samples spiked with purified galactomannan (one negative, one high negative, one low positive and one medium positive) at two external clinical sites (US) and one internal site (France). Platelia™ Aspergillus EIA positive and negative kit controls were included as panel members. Each of the four panel members and two controls were tested in duplicate on two runs per day on five different days, on one lot, (total replicates at each site $= 1 2 0$ ). Two operators performed all the precision testing at each site. The total number of replicates combining all three sites was 60 per panel member and 360 total test results.

Intra-assay reproducibility was defined by the within-run variance of the mean optical density (OD) and Index. Inter-assay reproducibility was defined by the total variance of the mean optical density (OD) and Index. Total variance in this design will be the sum of the between-day, between-run, between operator, between-site and within-run variance components. The percent coefficient of variation $( \mathrm { C V } \% )$ was defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean concentration.

The sample size (n), mean optical density (OD) and Index, standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \mathrm { C V } \% )$ for each panel member were calculated according to the recommendations described in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP15-A2 Evaluation Protocol and the ISO/TR 22971 Technical Report Site

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

N/A

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Quality Control

Cut-off Control: The OD of each Cut-off Control Serum must be: $\geq 0 . 3 0 0 \mathrm { a n d } \leq 0 . 8 0 0$

Positive Control: The index of the Positive Control Serum must be greater than 2.00.

$$
\mathrm { I } = \mathrm { O D . ~ P o s i t i v e ~ C o n t r o l } \left( \mathrm { R 5 } \right) \ > 2 . 0 0
$$

Negative Control: The index of the Negative Control Serum must be less than 0.40.

Failure of any of the controls to meet the validity criteria described above renders the assay invalid, and patient specimen results should not be reported. The operator may decide to repeat the assay, after reviewing the procedure, or may contact the manufacturer for assistance. If a repeat assay is performed, then a new aliquot of the same sample should be used in the repeat assay.

# Stability

Freeze/thaw studies were performed with this assay to validate four freeze/thaw cycles for Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) fluid samples.

Three Aspergillus Galactomannan antigen negative [Low Negative ${ \mathrm { \check { < } 0 . 1 } }$ Index), Negative (0.1-0.2 Index) and High Negative (0.2-0.4 Index)] and two Aspergillus Galactomannan antigen positive [(low positive (0.5-1.5 Index), and high positive $( > 2 . 5$ Index)] patient BAL fluid samples were tested based on results from testing after thawing the selected BAL samples.

The index values of the BAL patient samples after the initial thawing above were used as reference results for the freeze/thaw study comparison. Three further freeze/thaw cycles were studied. Upon testing after thawing, the results were slightly lower than the original test results. This is not unusual in that the original results were tested at a different time and different kit lot and index values (not quantitative) can change.

Therefore, the method was revised on testing the BAL samples after the first thaw.

The revised sample ranges were low negative, negative, high negative, positive and high positive. Each BAL sample was aliquotted and labeled in eight tubes, each at $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ per tube (two tubes for each of 4 time points) and subjected to freeze-thaw treatment.

Results showed that the mean index values and the percent recovery for each sample and freeze/thaw tested compared well to the mean of the four reference (first thaw) results. In addition, the three negative samples remained negative throughout the study and there was no significant change in the index value for each of them. The two positive samples had percent recovery values that were within the acceptance criteria for the study protocol (reference index $+ 2 0 \%$ ).

In conclusion, freeze/thaw cycles do not appear to have any adverse affect on the Aspergillus galactomannan samples.

# Expected Values

The expected prevalence of Invasive Aspergillosis varies with the patient population; rates from $5 \text{‰}$ have been reported. The following results have been obtained from clinical studies conducted on pediatric (age $\leq 2 1$ years) patients in the United States and on adult patients in North America.

BAL Samples

Two US studies were conducted on a total of 449 BAL samples from 178 Solid Organ transplant (SOT) and lung transplant recipients with and without invasive aspergillosis to determine the performance characteristics of the Platelia™ Aspergillus EIA kit with Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid samples. Of these, there were 403 BAL samples from 167 solid organ and lung transplant recipients without invasive aspergillosis. Results were as follows:

# BAL

Cross-reactivity studies using BAL fluid were not performed for this assay. The EDTA/heat treatment of the samples precipitates the proteins and only the supernatant is used for testing. Galactomannan is not affected in this process since it is heatresistant.

A limitation has been added to the Package Insert as follows:

“Cross-reactivity of BAL fluid samples with Mycoplasma or anaesthetic drugs/lubricants used to numb the neck/throat area for the aspiration process has not been evaluated.”

# f. Assay cut-off

The cut-off studies for this assay with BAL fluid have not been performed for this assay. The clinical studies included in this submission were conducted using the 0.5 cut-off recommended in the package insert for the current product.

# b. Clinical Specificity

Specificity was evaluated in a total of 98 samples from 57 SOT recipients and 305 samples from 110 lung transplant recipients entered into the studies that were not diagnosed with Invasive Aspergillosis during the evaluation period. Specificity is defined as a negative (Index $< 0 . 5$ ) Bio-Rad Platelia™ Aspergillus EIA result in a BAL fluid from a patient without Invasive Aspergillosis. Specificity in BAL samples from the combined SOT and lung transplant recipients without Invasive Aspergillosis is presented in the table below. Results are presented by samples from transplant recipients with and without mold colonization.

Specificity in BAL samples from the combined SOT and lung transplant recipients without Invasive Aspergillosis is presented in the following tables .

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Positive and negative predictive values have been analyzed for the patient population in this study. Based on the actual average of $1 3 . 6 \%$ prevalence rate in pediatrics and $1 6 . 9 \%$ prevalence rate in adults observed in this study, positive and negative predictive values have been calculated as below:

# Pediatrics

Study Prevalence $1 3 . 6 \%$ PPV: $3 9 . 1 \%$ $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval : $2 2 . 2 { - } 5 9 . 2 \%$ NPV: $9 2 . 2 \%$ $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval : $8 5 . 3 \substack { - 9 6 . 0 \% }$

# Adults

Study Prevalence $1 6 . 9 \%$ PPV: $5 9 . 0 \%$ $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval: $4 3 . 4 \substack { - 7 2 . 9 \% }$ NPV: $9 5 . 5 \%$ $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval: $9 0 . 5 – 9 7 . 9 \%$

The expected prevalence of Invasive Aspergillosis varies with the patient population; rates from $5 \text{‰}$ have been reported10, 24. For patient populations on the lower end of the published prevalence, the positive and negative prevalence have been re-calculated using a $5 \%$ prevalence rate.

# Pediatrics

Calculated Prevalence $5 \%$ $\mathrm { P P V } : 1 7 . 6 \% 9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval : $6 . 5 { - } 3 9 . 8 \%$ $\mathrm { N P V } : 9 7 . 2 \% 9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval : $: 9 2 . 1 \mathrm { - } 9 9 . 1 \%$

# Adults

Calculated Prevalence $5 \%$ PPV: $2 7 . 2 \%$ $9 5 \%$ Confidence interval: $1 3 . 7 – 4 6 . 7 \%$ NPV: $9 8 . 8 \%$ $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval: $9 5 . 4 \substack { - 9 9 . 7 \% }$
