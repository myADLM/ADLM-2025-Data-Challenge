# 4. Intended Use

The CLAM software is a database application used to record, track and trend patient data pertaining to the management of anemia, and to provide a dosage recommendation. The CLAM software is intended to manage anemia in adult end stage renal failure patients.

# 5. CLAM Software Description

The CLAM software is a database application that records, tracks, trends, and analyzes patient data (Hematocrit, Oxygen Saturation, and Hemoglobin) along with current ESA dose in order to effectively manage anemia.

During dialysis treatment, the CLAM downloads initial, rea-time Hematocrit (HCT), Oxygen Saturation (SaO2), and Hemoglobin (Hb) data from the Crit Line blood monitor. The CLAM software trends this patient data along with current Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) dosage to determine the patient's Hb levels, the need (if any) for ESA dosing, and to track patient's response to treatment. The CLAM software uses a proprietary algorithm to calculate a recommendation for ESA dosage based on patient data trends and current ESA dose in order to establish and maintain predetermined patient Hb levels. The The CLAM proprietary algorithm used to determine ESA dosing for anem ia treatment is based on the current manual algorithm. In addition, the CLAM software generates and prints patient reports for review and record keeping.

The CLAM software resides on a host computer separate from the Crit Line units and acquires rea-time data from the clinic's Crit Line monitors via wireless radio signal or by a serial cable.

# A. Crit Line IITQA Blood Volume Monitor and CLAM Accessory

The Crit Line uses optical methods to measure HCT, SaO2, and then calculates Hb from HCT for patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. The Crit Line system consists of a blood monitor, optical clip and blood chamber.

# METRICS

The blood chamber is attached.to the dialysis tubing prior to treatment and the optical clip is clipped to the blood chamber, allowing optical access to the blood flow. The Crit Line monitor collects baseline (pre-treatment) readings of HCT, SaO2, and Hb levels and subsequent ongoing readings during treatment. When Crit Line units are used with the CLAM software accessory, baseline readings are transferred to the CLAM application, which establishes a baseline and subsequently performs near real-time monitoring as described above.

# B. Intended Patient Population

The CLAM software currently is intended for use in dialysis clinics which care for adult renal failure patients :(see Section 21 - Other for the study: "Use of 12x/month haemoglobin monitoring with a computer algorithm reduces haemoglobin variability").

# C. Intended User Population and Use Environment

The CLAM software is intended for use by medical personnel such as clinicians, nurses, and physicians in dialysis clinics or where ever dialysis treatment is provided and/or Crit Line is used.

# D. CLAM Software User Interface

The CLAM software interface is designed to centralize and automate many of the routine tasks performed by medical staff when collecting and handling patient data used in the management of anemia. Features of the CLAM software enables the user to collect, record, track, trend, report, analyze, and print data for review and record keeping. An additional feature of the CLAM software is the ability to calculate a recommended ESA dosage based on trending of patient Hb and current ESA dose.

6. Technological Comparisons

# A. Similarities to Predicate Devices 1 & 2

0 The CLAM software, Crit Line (predicate 1), and Vasc-Alert (predicate 2) devices provide a (pre-treatment) baseline of patient HCT readings.   
S The CLAM software and predicate 2 devices are software database applications designed to record, track, trend patient data. The CLAM software and Vasc-Alert software device perform trend analysis on patient data routinely collected during dialysis treatment All three allow the medical staff to set thresholds or limits for each patient, which when not met signal an alert. All three enable medical staff to record and track patient data with each dialysis treatment providing continual monitoring of patient status verses the standard once a month measurement protocol.   
D All three devices are intended to be a reference for patient status and when considering course of treatment For comparison of each predicate to new device see, Table 1 Similarities and Table 2 Similarities:

# C. Performance Data

A performance test was completed in September of 2009 at a dialysis center in New England where the CLAM software ESA dosage calculations were compared to ESA dosage calculations performed manually.

The test consisted of taking data from sixty-two dialysis patients for analysis. The last two weeks of a patient's Hb values were recorded and the average of Week 1 was subtracted from the average of Week 2. If the difference between the two weeks is positive then the trend is falling, and if the difference was negative the trend was rising. The average of Week 1, the absoiute value of the difference, and the rising or falling trend is then used to derive the next recommended dose. The results showed that the CLAM software calculated recommended dose and the manually calculated dose were exactly the same.

# METRICS

# D. Conclusion

The CLAM software is designed to work in tandem with the predicate device (Crit Line) to provide a more comprehensive and accurate approach to managing anemia treatment following hemodialysis.

The Crit Line uses an optical method to measure HCT and SaO2 and then calculate Hb from HCT for patients undergoing hemodialysis. Crit Line takes a baseline reading just prior to the start ofhemodialysis and then continues to take measurements during the duration of treatment. Upon completion of the hemodialysis run the CLAM software downloads these baseline readings to the CLAM database where it is stored for tracking and trending.

The current protocol used by most clinics to assess Hb levels in a dialysis patient is to draw blood one time per month from which the physician prescribes (if needed) ESA dosage for the following month or until the next blood draw. This method provides little data and does not account for the time and changes experienced by the patient between blood draws. One change experienced by the patient is the removal of excess fluid during hemodialysis. On average a dialysis patient will undergo ten to twelve dialysis treatments betweenthe once a month blood draw. The changes to HCT in relation to total blood volume are changed with each hemodialysis treatment affecting Hb levels as well.

The CLAM software provides the means to record, track, and trend these critical changes along with current ESA dose with each hemodialysis treatment This method provides up to twelve points of data per month to measure patient status compared to the one point currently used. Based on trending of Hb levels and current ESA dose the CLAM software gives an ESA dosage recommendation for the physician's consideration.

The CLAM software device, like the Crit Line monitor, is for use only under supervision of a healthcare provider and is not intended to replace the knowledge and experience of the healthcare provider when prescribing treatment

Additional safeguards are incorporated in the CLAM software interface and algorithm to mitigate or prevent harm to the patient by limiting the maximum dosage recommendation of the CLAM software to 20,000 IU per treatment, to flag those patients whose Hb levels fall outside the established limits, and to prevent interchange of Hb and HCT values when entered manually.

In conclusion, the CLAM software like the predicate devices is designed to record, track, and trend patient data for the purpose of providing accurate readings, ongoing analyses of patient data, and as a reference for physicians when determining an effective course of treatment. For these reasons the CLAM software is considered equivalent to the predicate devices and does not pose any additional safety or effectiveness issues.
