# I. Device Description:

The Sensititre HP MIC Susceptibility plate is an in vitro diagnostic product for clinical susceptibility testing of fastidious isolates.

The Sensititre 18-24 hours MIC or breakpoint Susceptibility System is an in vitro diagnostic product for clinical susceptibility testing of non fastidious isolates. It consists of a disposable plate containing dilutions of antimicrobials dried in individual wells. The test plate is inoculated with a standardized suspension of the organism to be tested. After the indicated hours of incubation, the plate is read for growth to determine the MIC either on an AutoReader or manually using the Sensititre manual viewer or SensiTouch.

A report is then generated that contains the MIC value and the interpretive category result (S,I,R) for each antibiotic contained on the card.

The MIC interpretive criteria for Telavancin are as follows:

\*Currently there are no intermediate or resistant interpretive criteria for telavancin. The absence of resistant strains precludes defining any results categories other than "susceptible." For strains yielding results suggestive of a "non-susceptible" category, organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results should be confirmed. Subsequently, the isolates should be saved and submitted to a reference laboratory that will confirm results using a reference dilution method.

$\mathrm { S } =$ Susceptible: Attainable levels in blood or tissue on usual usage, including oral administration when applicable.

$\mathrm { I } =$ Intermediate: The intermediate category implies clinical efficacy in body sites where the drugs are physiologically concentrated (e.g. quinolones and B-lactams in urine), or when a higher than normal dosage of drug can be used (e.g. B-lactams). The “intermediate” category also includes a “buffer zone” which should prevent small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretations, especially for drugs with narrow pharmacotoxicity margins.

$\mathrm { R } =$ Resistant to usually achievable systemic concentrations.

# L. Test Principle:

Sensititre susceptibility plates are multi-well plastic microtiter plates that contain doubling dilutions of antibacterial agents. Each plate is dosed with antimicrobial agents at appropriate dilutions. Results can be read manually by visual reading of growth or automatically on an Autoreader using fluorescence. The Sensititre Autoreader system utilizes fluorescence technology which involves the detection of bacterial growth by monitoring the activity of specific surface enzymes produced by the test organism. Growth is determined by generating a fluorescent product from a non-fluorescent (f1uorogenic) substrate. The substrate can be added to the inoculum broth and dispensed into the test plates at the same time as the test organism or the plates can be prepared with the substrate already added to the plate. The nonfluorescent substrate is prepared by conjugating a fluorescent compound to the specific enzyme substrates with a bond, which prevents fluorescence (i.e. the f1uorophore is quenched in this state). Enzymatic action of the bacterial surface enzymes on the specific substrates cleaves this bond releasing the fluorophore which is now capable of fluorescence. The amount of fluorescence detected is directly related to the activity of the bacterial surface enzymes and, therefore, to bacterial growth.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was conducted at three study sites. Twenty five Gram positive isolates (9 S. aureus, 5 E. faecalis, 1 E. faecium, 5 group A Streptococci, and 5 coagulase negative staphylococci) and 25 Streptococcus sp. ( $1 0 S .$ . pneumoniae, 5 S. viridans, 6 group A Streptococci, and 4 group B Streptococci) were tested at each site. These were tested one time at each of the three sites using both reading methods.

Results were read on the AutoReader and manually using the SensiTouch. Reference method plates were read visually in accordance with CLSI M-7 standard. Reproducibility was calculated as the percent of results for the combined sites which were within $+ / -$ one doubling dilution of the mode MIC value for all sites.

For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value. There were no off-scale results in this study. So, only one value for overall reproducibility is reported for each reading method.

For manual read by the SensiTouch, the overall reproducibility was $100 \%$ for Gram positive organism and $9 7 \%$ for Streptococcus sp.

For the AutoReader, the overall reproducibility was $100 \%$ for Gram positive organism and $9 9 \%$ for Streptococcus sp.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the. The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The Sensititre Susceptibility plate was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.

Quality Control was performed at all sites during the studies using both the AutoReader and the manual reading method (SensiTouch). The mode of the MIC obtained by the Sensititre manual read was similar to that obtained by the AutoReader. Results obtained by Sensititre for S. aureus and $E$ . faecalis trended towards the low end of the acceptable MIC range and were generally one dilution lower than was obtained with the reference method. Summary of the results are shown in the table below.

At least one Quality control organism was in control in the reference on all days. Quality Control results for the Sensititre Susceptibility System using either reading methods demonstrated that the system could produce the expected quality control results.

Inoculum density control for QC organisms ranged between a minimum of $1 . 0 \mathrm { X }$ $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ and a maximum of $5 . { \bar { 5 } } { \mathrm { X } } 1 0 ^ { 5 } { \mathrm { C F U } } { \mathrm { / m L } }$ . These colony count values were the result of 33 density evaluation tests with S. aureus, 30 tests with $E$ . faecalis and five tests with $S .$ . pneumoniae. All were in the expected range.

If the non-fastidious Sensititre plate is utilized for testing it does not require lysed horse blood in its testing. Therefore, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 can not be used as the QC organism for the Streptococcus spp. The recommended QC organism for this non-fastidious Sensititre plate is S. aureus ATCC 29213.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at three sites. Studies have been conducted with the Sensititre dried

susceptibility plates containing telavancin to test susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. (Sensititre Streptococcus spp. HP MIC panel) and gram positive isolates (Sensititre 18-24 hour susceptibility plate). The CLSI microdilution reference methods containing the same antimicrobial in the same dilutions were used for a comparison and evaluation of performance.

The inoculum was prepared using a Nephelometer which was calibrated at the start of each test. Plates were inoculated and incubated at $3 4 { - } 3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (in $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for S. pneumoniae). The reading was done on the AutoReader and manually using the SensiTouch at 20-24 hours.

Clinical testing was performed on 666 Gram positive isolates (263 Staphylococcus spp., 70 Enterococcus spp. and 333 Streptococcus spp.). All were freshly collected clinical isolates. In addition, testing was performed on 59 Gram positive CDC stock challenge isolates and 61 Streptococcus spp. CDC stock challenge isolates.

The growth rate for the manual and automated read methods was greater than $90 \%$ . The performance evaluations are shown in the table below.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the Sensititre panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the Sensititre panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the Sensititre and the reference and have on-scale EA.

The $\mathrm { E A } \%$ is acceptable when compared to the reference method as described in the FDA guidance document, “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”.

Auto-read results were very similar to the manual readings. Currently, there are no intermediate or resistance interpretive criteria for telavancin. No isolates in this study were noted to have MICs outside the susceptible category. Therefore, there were no minor, major or very major errors. As summarized in the table below, the combined (clinical $^ +$ challenge) EA and CA for all organisms were greater than $90 \%$ .
