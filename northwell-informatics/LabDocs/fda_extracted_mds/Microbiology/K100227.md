Substantial Equivalence:

SASTM FluAlert A Test, manufactured by SA Scientific, Ltd., San Antonio, TX.

Device Description:

The SASTM FluAlert A Test utilizes antibodies against influenza type A viral nucleoproteins. The SASTM FluAlert A test begins with an extraction of Type A nucleoproteins. After the extraction has been completed, the sample is placed into the sample well of the test. The specimen is absorbed and migrates via capillary action through miembranes that contain dried gold conjugated antibody, which is specific for influenza A viral nucleoproteins. If these nucleoproteins are present, a "half-sandwich" immunocomplex is formed. The membrane contains immobilized antibody to influenza A nucleoproteins, which binds the "half sandwich" complex. Thus, in the presence of influenza A nucleoproteins, a "whole sandwich" immunocomplex is formed and a visible, pink-colored line develops in the specimen zone of the test device. In the absence of an influenza A antigen, a "sandwich" immunocomplex is not formed and a negative result is indicated. To serve as a procedural control, a pink-colored control line will always appear in the control zone of each strip regardless of the presence or absence of influenza A nucleoproteins.

Intended Use:

SASTM FluAlert A Test is a visual and rapid assay for the presumptive in-vitro qualitative detection of influenza A viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal washes and nasal aspirates of symptomatic patients. Negative results should be confirmed via culture. This test is not intended for the detection of Influenza Type B or Influenza Type C viral antigen. This test is for professional use only.

Negative results do not preclude infection with influenza A and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. It is recommended that negative results be confirmed by cell culture.

Conditions for Use:

For prescription use only.

Quality Controls:

The SASTM FluAlert A Test provides an internal procedural quality control. It is recommended that external quality controls be assayed following the user's laboratory's standard quality control procedures and in conformance with local, state and federal regulations or accreditation organizations as applicable

Device comparison:

The SASTM FluAlert A is a rapid immunoassays utilizing immunochromatographic technology for the visualization of influenza A antigen. Each utilizes an antibody conjugated to colored particles and an antibody printed onto a membrane.

Performance Summary:

This test has been shown to detect the FluA/Califoria/04/2009 (H1N1) virus cultured from a positive human specimen however, the performance characteristics of this test with clinical specimens that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The SAS FluAlert A Test can detect influenza A virus, but cannot differentiate influenza subtypes.

Clinical Summary:

Please see K041441 for Clinical Summary

Note: Performance characteristics for detecting the 2009 H1N1 influenza vlrus from human specimens have not been established

Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection):

The analytical sensitivity of the SASTM FluAlert A Test was determined for 2009 HIN1 using strain A/California/04/09. 2009 H1N1 using strain A/California/04/09. Each strain was serially diluted in SASTM FluAlert A extraction buffer. Results for A/California/04/09 are included in the summary table below.

Conclusion:

The information presented in the premarket notification demonstrates that the SASTM FluAlert A Test reacts with a cultured strain of 2009 H1N1

(FluA/California/04/2009). Although this test has been shown to detect the 2009 H1N1 from a cultured isolate, the performance characteristics of this test with clinical specimens that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The SAS FluAlert A Test can detect influenza A viruses, but cannot differentiate influenza subtypes. This viral strain used in this study was obtained from ATCC with a known titer. SA Scientific, Ltd did not verify this titer.

Dear Ms. Perry:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices markete ininterstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.
