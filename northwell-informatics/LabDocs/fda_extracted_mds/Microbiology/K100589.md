# Substantially Equivalent Device

MRSASelect for skin and soft-tissue wounds is substantially equivalent to Bio-Rad MRSASelect — extended incubation (reference 510(k) K081212). Products are the same chromogenic media used for the detection of MRSA direct from a specimen swab.

# Product Description

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of nosocomial and life threatening infections which have been associated with significantly higher rates of mortality and morbidity. The Bio-Rad MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic culture medium for the qualitative detection of MRsA from skin or soft-tissue wound specimens. Results can be interpreted after 18 - 28 hours incubation.

# Intended Use

MRSASelectTM is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the qualitative detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from skin and soft-tissue wound specimens. The MRSASelect ™M is indicated for use in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical data available to aid in the identification and diagnosis of MRSA from patients with skin and soft-tissue infections. Concomitant cultures and susceptibility testing are necessary for all skin and soft-tissue wound specimens. MRSASelect TM is not intended to guide, or monitor treatment for MRSA infection, or provides results of susceptibility to methicillin. Results can be interpreted after 18 to 28 hours incubation.

# Summary of Technology

MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the qualitative detection of methicillin resistant Staphylocccus aureus (MRSA) from skin and soft-tissue wound specimens. The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antibiotic/antifungal mixture and an optimized salt concentration that inhibits the growth of yeast and the majority of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria with the exception of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Identification is based on the cleavge o a chromogenic substrate by a speciic enzymatic activity of Staphylococcus aureus leading to a strong pink coloration of the Staphylococcus aureus colonies.

Within 18  28 hours incubation time methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus produce small pink colonies on MRSASelect. Coagulase negative methicillin-resistant staphylococci that do not metabolize the chromogenic substrate appear as colorless or white colonies (possibly light pink). Methicillin sensitive staphylococci (MSS) are inhibited.

# Performance Data

# Interfering Substances

In order to evaluate the possible interference of common topical agents used in wound care samples of these agents were inoculated with MRSA and plated on MRSASelect media.

Jse of the following compounds has an inhibitory effect on MRSA growth that is unrelated to medium cerformance:

Bactine (Benzalkonium chloride $0 . 1 3 \%$ , Lidocaine hydrochloride $2 . 5 \%$ ); Betadine (liquid) (Povidoneiodine $1 0 \%$ ), Iodine Tincture (liquid) (Iodine $2 \%$ ), Biseptine (liquid) (Chlorhexidine Gluconate $0 . 2 5 \%$ , Benzalkonium chloride $0 . 0 2 5 \%$ ), Sodium hypochlorite (liquid), StaphAseptic (ointment) (Benzethonium Chloride $0 . 2 \%$ ,Lidocaine HCl $2 . 5 \%$ ), and silver chloride.

Cross Reactivity Testing (Analytical Specificity)

To evaluate the analytical specificity of the MRSASelect™M media 35 bacterial and fungal strains found in wound or skin samples were cultured and inoculated onto MRSASelect ™M plates at a concentration of $\ge 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

No cross-reactivity was observed on any strains tested. Most strains showed no growth on MRSASelect™M with the exception of Corynebacterium jeikeium and Candida tropicalis. With both of these organisms pinpoint white colonies were observed; these are not representative of MRSA colonies, and therefore these are not cross-reactants. No variation was seen between 24 and 28 hour incubation time.

Analytical Sensitivity To evaluate the analytical sensitivity of the MRSASelect ™M, 102 strains of MRSA, including USA100, 200, 300, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 1000 were inoculated onto MRSASelect TM plates at concentrations of $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .USA300-0114 was also tested. $9 7 \%$ (99/102) sensitivity was observed after 24 hours incubation.

# Reproducibility

A panel of 6 organisms, including MRSA, MSSA and S. epidermidis, was evaluated on MRSASelect TM It was performed at concentrations of $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for MRSA, and $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for non-MRSA. The panel was tested in triplicate each day for three days at three clinical sites. Overal reproducibility was $100 \%$ after 24 hours incubation when testing this panel.

# Method Comparison

943 skin and soft-tissue wound samples were collected and tested at four clinical laboratories in the United States. Each sample was tested on MRSASelect TM, Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) with $5 \%$ Sheep's Blood, and Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) with $6 . 5 \%$ NaCl. Samples that were positive on TSA or TSB were confirmed with Gram stain, Pastorex™M Staph Plus, and mecA mediated oxacillin resistance using 30 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ Cefoxitin disk (R $: \leq 2 1 \ \mathrm { m m }$ , $\mathbf { S } ; \ge 2 2 ~ \mathbf { m } \mathbf { m }$ )

The following results were obtained: specificity $9 9 . 4 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: [98.5, 99.8]) and sensitivity $9 1 . 7 \%$ EY $( 9 5 \%$ CI: [87.3, 94.7]). The overall prevalence of MRSA in the study was $2 4 . 2 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: [21.5, 27.0]). MRSASelectTM vs. Routine Culture and TSB

\* For 12/19 samples - MRSA were isolated only from TSB with $6 . 5 \%$ NaCl and were not isolated on initial direct culture.
