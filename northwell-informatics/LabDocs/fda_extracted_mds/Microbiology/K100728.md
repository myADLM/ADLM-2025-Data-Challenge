# Section 6: Test Principle

The Zeus Scientific, Inc. AtheNA Multi-Lyte Borrelia VIsE1/pepC10 Plus Test System is designed to detect IgG class antibodies in human sera to VIsE1 antigen and IgM class antibodies to pepC10 antigen. The test procedure involves four incubation steps:

Test sera (propery dilute are incubate in a filter plate well containing a multiplex mixture Bead Suspension-1. The multiplexed Bead Suspension-1 contains a mixture of distinguishable sets of polystyrene microspheres; one of these bead sets is conjugated with the VisE1 antigen. The bead mix also contains one bead set designed to detect non-specific binding and four separate bead sets used for assay calibration. If present in patient sera, specific antibodies will bind to the immobilized antigen on one or more of the bead sets. The microspheres are rinsed to remove non-reactive serum proteins.   
2. Conjugate-1 is added to the micro titer well and the plate is incubated. The conjugate will react with IgG antibody immobilized on the solid phase in step 1. The microspheres are rinsed to remove unbound conjugate.   
3. Bead Suspension-2 is added to the wells. The bead set contains beads conjugated with pepC10 and VisE1 antigens. A second aliquot of test sera at the same dilution as in step 1 is added to the well and mixed. The bead and specimen suspension is incubated. Following incubation, the microspheres are rinsed to remove the non-reacting serum proteins.   
4. Conjugate 2 is added to the micro titer well and the plate is incubated. The conjugate will react with IgM antibody immobilized on the solid phase in step 1 and step 3.   
5. The entire bead suspension is then analyzed by the AtheNA Multi-Lyte instrument. The bead set(s) are sorted (identified) and the amount of reporter molecule (PE conjugate) is determined for each bead set. Using the Intra-Well Calibration Technology™ (see following page for an explanation of this technology), internal calibration bead sets are used to convert raw fluorescence into intermediate AtheNA Unit values $( i A U / m L )$ These values correspond to the amount of human IgG and/or human IgM antibody bound to the VlsE-1 and/or pepC10 antigen coated beads respectively. iAU/ml values are converted to a single outcome (AtheNA Score).

All samples showed less than a $20 \%$ change in signal in the VIse-1 study with the exception of the borderline VIsE-1 sample which exhibited an increase in signal of $3 2 \%$ with the high spike of bilirubin and an increase in signal of $2 7 \%$ with the high spike of cholesterol. The negative VlsE-1 sample showed a reduction in signal of $36 \%$ EMPY with the high spike of hemoglobin, a change in signal of $23 \%$ with the low spike of bilirubin and $2 7 \%$ with the high spike of bilirubin, a change in signal of $2 5 \%$ with the low spike of cholesterol and $45 \%$ with the high spike of cholesterol and a change in signal of $45 \%$ with both the low and high spikes of triglycerides. The change of signal in these negative samples did not change the qualitative outcome, the results remained negative.

All samples showed less than a $20 \%$ change in signal in the pepC10 study with the exception of the borderline pepC10 sample which exhibited a reduction in signal of $2 4 \%$ with the high spike of hemoglobin and an increase in signal of $2 8 \%$ with the low spike of triglyceride.

# Section 7C: Cross Reactivity

A study was conducted at Zeus Scientific to assess cross reactivity with the Athena Multi-yte Borrelia VIsE-1/pepC10 Plus test system using sera that were sero-positive to EBV VCA IgG, RF, ANA, Syphilis, CMV IgG, CMV IgM, Rubella, VZV IgM and Toxoplasma. ELISA, IFA and micro-particle immunoassay test systems manufactured by various companies for commercial distribution were used to determine the sero-positivity of the samples. Ten samples for each possible cross-reactant were tested. None of the ninety samples showed cross-reactivity with any of the nine analytes tested.
