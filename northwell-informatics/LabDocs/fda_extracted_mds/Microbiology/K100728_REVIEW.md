The AtheNA Multi-lyte Borrelia VlsE-1/pepC10 Plus Test System is intended for use with the Luminex® 200 IS and the AtheNA Multi-Lyte data management package in testing serum samples from symptomatic patients or those with a history of Lyme Borreliosis. All positive specimens should be tested with a second-tier test such as Western Blot which if positive, is supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi. Diagnosis of Lyme Borreliosis should be made based on the presence of $B$ .burgdorferi antibodies, history, symptoms and other laboratory data. Negative first or second tier results should not be used to exclude Borreliosis.

# I. Device Description:

The Zeus Scientific, Inc. AtheNA Multi-Lyte Borrelia VlsE-1/pepC10 Plus Test System is designed to detect IgG class antibodies in human sera to VlsE-1 antigen and IgM class antibodies to pepC10 antigen. The test procedure involves four incubation steps.

1. Test sera (properly diluted) are incubated in a filter plate well containing a multiplexed mixture of Bead Suspension-1. The multiplexed Bead Suspension-1 contains a mixture of distinguishable sets of polystyrene microspheres; one of these bead sets is conjugated with the VlsE-1 antigen. The bead mix also contains one bead set designed to detect non-specific binding and four separate bead sets used for assay calibration. If present in patient sera, specific antibodies will bind to the immobilized antigen on one or more of the bead sets. The microspheres are rinsed to remove non-reactive serum proteins.

2. Conjugate-1 is added to the microtiter well and the plate is incubated. The conjugate will react with IgG antibody immobilized on the solid phase in step 1. The microspheres are rinsed to remove unbound conjugate.

3. Bead Suspension-2 is added to the wells. The bead set contains beads conjugated with pepC10 and VlsE-1 antigens. A second aliquot of test sera at the same dilution as in step 1 is added to the well and mixed. The bead and specimen suspension is incubated. Following incubation the microspheres are rinsed to remove the non-reacting serum proteins.

4. Conjugate 2 is added to the microtiter well and the plate is incubated. The conjugate will react with IgM antibody immobilized on the solid phase in step 1 and step 3.

5. The entire bead suspension is then analyzed by the AtheNA Multi-Lyte instrument. The bead set(s) are sorted (identified) and the amount of reporter molecule (PE conjugate) is determined for each bead set. Using the Intra-Well Calibration Technology™, internal calibration bead sets are used to convert raw fluorescence into outcome (AtheNA Score).

Detection of antigen specific IgG and IgM antibodies: After the bead set mix is allowed to react with human serum as described in steps 1 through 4, human antibodies if present, will bind to the bead sets and then will be analyzed. The amount of reporter is a direct measurement of IgM, IgG or both IgM and IgG if a patient has both IgG and $\mathrm { I g M }$ to the same antigen. The amount of IgG in such an instance can be determined by a mathematical formula of like-coated bead set results using a sequence of measurements patented by Zeus Scientific, Inc.

e. Analytical specificity: A study was conducted at Zeus Scientific to assess cross reactivity with the Athena Multi-Lyte Borrelia VlsE-1/pepC10 Plus test system using sera that were sero-positive to EBV VCA IgG, RF, ANA, Syphilis, CMV IgG, CMV IgM, Rubella, VZV IgM and Toxoplasma. ELISA, IFA and micro-particle immunoassay test systems manufactured by various companies for commercial distribution were used to determine the seropositivity of the samples. Ten samples for each possible cross-reactant were tested. The cross reactivity data has been summarized in table 12. In total, 90 samples were tested for possible cross reactivity with 9 analytes. None of the ninety samples showed cross-reactivity with any of the nine analytes tested.

Specimens known to contain potentially cross reactive antibodies to B.burgdorferi with infections to tick-borne relapsing fever, rickettsial diseases, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and leptospirosis have not been tested with this device, therefore the performance of this device is unknown if there is any cross-reactivity with these antibodies. This is indicated in the limitation section of the package insert.

Interfering Substances: The effect of potential interfering substances on sample results generated using the AtheNA Multi-Lyte VlsE-1/pepC10 Plus test system was evaluated with the following possible interfering substances: albumin, bilirubin, cholesterol, hemoglobin, triglycerides and intralipids.

The quantity of analyte in each interfering substance is as follows:

Bilirubin: $1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (low), $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (high) Albumin: $3 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ (low), $5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ (high) Cholesterol: $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (low), 250 mg/dL (high) Triglycerides: $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (low), 500 mg/dL (high) Hemoglobin: $2 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (low), $2 0 \ \mathrm { g / d L }$ (high) Intralipid: $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (low), 750 mg/dL (high)

Three samples each for VlsE-1 and pepC10 were chosen based on their performance on the AtheNA Multi-Lyte Borrelia VlsE-1/pepC10 Plus test system: (strongly reactive, weakly reactive and negative). The samples were exposed to the possible interfering substance, tested in duplicate and mean was determined.

All samples showed less than a $20 \%$ change in signal in the Vlse-1 study with the exception of the borderline VlsE-1 sample which exhibited an increase in signal of $32 \%$ with the high spike of bilirubin and an increase in signal of $2 7 \%$ with the high spike of cholesterol. All samples showed less than a $20 \%$ change in signal in the pepC10 study with the exception of the borderline pepC10 sample which exhibited a reduction in signal of $24 \%$ with the high spike of hemoglobin and an increase in signal of $2 8 \%$ with the low spike of triglyceride.

# f. Assay cut-off:

The cut off for this assay was established using 25 negative control specimens as well as 5 clinically characterized specimens for each antigen. The mean and standard deviation was established for the negative population; using a mathematical calculation involving this data, a theoretical cut-off is established and validated with the characterized specimens. Based upon the results of this testing, the manufacturer has established the following guidelines for interpretation of patient samples.

Western blot testing was done on discrepant results. 2/37 samples were negative by blot and 37/39 samples were positive by blot for sera which tested negative on the AtheNA Multi-lyte test system and positive by ELISA. 4/4 samples tested positive by blot for the discrepant samples that were positive on the AtheNA Multi-Lyte test system and negative by ELISA. \*Statistical significance evaluation can not be made on limited number of samples.

CDC Characterized Lyme Panel: 40 samples of various reactivity were acquired from the CDC and evaluated internally at the manufacturer’ site. 5 samples were from normal blood donors. 35 samples were from patients diagnosed with Borreliosis. The results of the testing are presented here as a means of conveying further information on the performance of this assay with a characterized serum panel. This does not imply an endorsement of the assay by the CDC.
