# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification ODE Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)

To: THE FILE

This $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable (delete/add items as necessary):

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device: Xpert® MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay, K082140 (09/29/2009)

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use and package labeling.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification.

3. The modification to this device consist of the revision of the product labeling as a corrective action to Cepheid MRSA/SA Blood Culture Class I Recall (Z-1898-2010). This modification has not had any effect or caused any changes to the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of this device.

a) There were no changes made to the device (composition or technological characteristics).

b) The product labeling has been revised to include the following modifications:

i) Intended Use Section:

(a) The indication/intended use statement remains the same. An additional sentence was added to the Indication/intended use statement for clarification and language consistency purposes.

(b) The addition of a warning box with the following statement under the intended use statement.

When a MRSA negative/SA positive result is obtained, the results should be interpreted as MRSA indeterminate/ Staphylococcus aureus positive, antimicrobial susceptibility testing pending. Further testing should be performed using an FDA-cleared, phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing method on isolated colonies recovered from the blood culture bottle. MRSA positive/SA positive results can still be reported as such.

ii) Interpretation of Results section:

(a) The addition of new instruction for interpretation of MRSA negative/SA positive results.

The results should be interpreted as MRSA indeterminate/ Staphylococcus aureus positive, antimicrobial susceptibility testing pending. Further testing should be performed using an FDA-cleared, phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing method on isolated colonies recovered from the blood culture bottle.

iii) Limitation section:

(a) The addition of the following statements: • The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay may generate false negative MRSA results when testing borderline oxacillin resistant S. aureus (BORSA). The mechanism of oxacillin resistance in BORSA strains is due to an increased production of B-lactamases, not the mecA gene. BORSA with oxacillin MICs of $4 { \cdot } 8 \mu \ g / \mathrm { m L }$ are considered borderline resistant but, would be reported as MRSA negative by the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. BORSA strains are rare in the United States. The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay may generate false negative MRSA results when testing modified S. aureus (MOD-SA). The mechanism of oxacillin resistance in

MOD-SA strains is due to changes in affinity of penicillin binding proteins for oxacillin, not the mecA gene. MOD-SA with oxacillin MICs of $4 { \cdot } 8 \mu \ g / \mathrm { m L }$ are considered borderline resistant but, would be reported as MRSA negative by the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood culture Assay. MOD-SA strains are rare in the United States.

As with all PCR based in vitro diagnostic tests, extremely low levels of target below the LoD of the assay may be detected, but results may not be reproducible.

Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay results may sometimes be “INVALID” due to a failed SPC control, “ERROR” or “NO RESULT”, and require retesting that can lead to a delay in obtaining final results.

4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences): The package insert was revised to add a clarification statement and a black warning box in the Intended Use section, new instruction for interpretation of the MRSA negative/SA positive results in the Interpretation of Results section and additional statements in the Limitation section.

# 6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for Use Enclosure (and Class III Summary for Class III devices).

A signed Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) summary and Indications for Use Enclosure were provided.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
