Device Trade Name:

QuickVue® RSV 10

Common Name:

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Test

Predicate Device:

QuickVue RSV test (K061008 and K070747)

Device Classification/Name:

21 CFR 866.3480 / Respiratory syncytial virus serological reagents

These tests are used to aid in the diagnosis of disease caused by respiratory syncytial viruses and provides epidemiological information on these diseases (21 CFR 866.3480). The Food and Drug Administration has classified serological test systems for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus as Class I.

# Intended Use:

The QuickVue RSV 10 test is an immunoassay that allows for the rapid, qualitative detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigen directly from nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens for symptomatic pediatric patients (less than six years old). The test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of acute RSV infection. Negative results do not preclude RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or for other management decisions. A negative test is presumptive. It is recommended that negative test results be confirmed by cell culture. The test is intended for professional and laboratory use.

# Physiologic Basis of the Test:

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a single stranded (negative strand) RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. It is the causative agent of a highly contagious, acute, viral infection of the respiratory tract in pediatric populations. Nearly half of all children become infected by their first year of life. It is also the major viral cause of nosocomial illness in children already hospitalized for other reasons. In the United States, RSV is estimated to be responsible for 73,400 to 126,300 hospitalizations annually for bronchiolitis and pneumonia alone among children younger than 1 year. In children hospitalized with RSV infection, it is believed to be the most common viral cause of death in children younger than 5 years, particularly in children younger than one year. Among children hospitalized with RSV infection, the mortality rate is estimated to be as low as $0 . 3 \%$ to $1 . 0 \%$ of hospitalized children and in the range of $2 . 5 \%$ to $4 . 0 \%$ for hospitalized children with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease.

# Device Description:

The QuickVue RSV 10 test is a lateral-flow immunoassay that uses monoclonal antibodies that are specific for RSV antigens. The test is specific to RSV antigen with no known cross-reactivity to normal flora or other known respiratory pathogens.

Nasopharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash serve as specimens for this test. For a liquid specimen such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash, the specimen is added directly to the reagent tube and rehydrates the reagent. When a nasopharyngeal swab is used, the reagent is first rehydrated with the provided reagent solution and the swab specimen is then inserted into the reagent tube.

The reagent interacts with the specimen and facilitates exposure of the appropriate viral antigens to the antibodies used in the test. The test strip is placed in the reagent tube for 10 minutes. During this time, the specimen will react with the reagents in the test strip.

If the specimen contains RSV antigens, a pink-to-red Test Line, along with a blue procedural Control Line will appear on the Test Strip indicating a positive result. If RSV antigen is not present, or is present at very low levels, only a blue procedural Control Line will appear.

# Summary of Performance Data:

Numerous studies were undertaken to document the performance characteristics and the substantial equivalence of the test to the predicate device. These studies included the following:

1. A multi-center field clinical study was undertaken to document the performance characteristics of the test. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using nasopharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens compared to viral culture.   
2. A reproducibility study was performed to demonstrate intra- and inter-operator reproducibility and intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility with a panel of test samples at various RSV concentrations.   
3. Analytical studies demonstrated specimen transport and stability, intra- and inter-lot consistency, analytical sensitivity, limit of detection, kit stability, cross reactivity, analytical specificity, lack of interference with various substances, and test robustness with variations in the test method.

# Conclusion:

These studies demonstrated the substantial equivalence of the QuickVue RSV 10 test to existing products already marketed.
