# DDevice Description

The VIDAS® TOXO IgG Avidity assay is an automated qualitative test for the determination of anti-toxoplasma IgG avidity in human serum using the ELFA technique (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay). The ViDAS® TOXO IgG Avidity assay is intended for use in conjunction with results from the VIDAS TOXO IgG II and must have a positive titer $( > 8 \ 1 1 1 / \mathrm { m L } )$ other laboratory findings and clinical information to aid in the presumptive exclusion of a recently acquired (< 4 months) Toxoplasma gondii infection in pregnant women and patients with lymphadenopathy.

The addition of a dissociating agent (such as urea) which disrupts the Ag-Ab link during an ELISA test has little effect on the high avidity Ag-Ab link, but great effect on that of weak avidity Ab. Comparison of results obtained with and without a dissociating agent corresponds to one measure of avidity.

The assay principle combines a two-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle $\{ S P R ^ { \otimes } \}$ serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and predispensed in the sealed reagent strips. VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity uses a dual strip comprising one reference strip and one test strip. The sample to be tested, after dilution, is dispensed into both sample wells of the dual strip: reference and test.

Anti-toxoplasma IgG present in the sample forms complexes with antigen coated to the solid phase. In the reference strip, non-specific antibodies are eliminated by washing, whereas specific antibodies remain coated to the solid phase. In the test strip, washing with the dissociating agent changes antigen-antibody links: high avidity antibodies remain bound to the solid phase, whereas low avidity antibodies are eliminated.

Alkaline phosphatase labeled with human anti-IgG antibody (conjugate) is then cycled in and out of the SPR, and binds with any human IgG coated on the interior of the SPR. Unbound conjugate is removed by washing.

All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. During the final detection step, the substrate (4- Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4- Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \ n m .$ . Fluorescence is measured twice in the Reagent Strip's reading cuvette for each dual reagent strip. The first reading is a background reading of the substrate cuvette before the SPR is introduced into the substrate. The second reading is taken after incubating the substrate with the enzyme remaining on the interior of the SPR. The RFV (Relative Fluorescence Value) is calculated by subtracting the background reading from the final result. The RFV for the two assays (reference and test) appear on the result sheet. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antibodies present in the sample. At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument and then printed out.

The ratio between the quantity of high avidity antibodies (test strip) and the quantity of total antibodies (reference strip) provides an index that indicates antibody avidity in the tested sample.

# E. Intended Use

The VIDAS® TOXO IgG Avidity assay is an automated qualitative test for the determination of anti-toxoplasma IgG avidity in human serum using the ELFA technique (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay). The $V / \mathsf { D A S } ^ { \otimes }$ TOXO IgG Avidity assay is intended for use in conjunction with results from the VIDAS TOXO IgG II and must have a positive titer $( \geq 8 \ | | \boldsymbol { \mathsf { U } } / \boldsymbol { \mathsf { m } } \boldsymbol { \mathsf { L } } )$ ;other laboratory findings and clinical information to aid in the presumptive exclusion of a recently acquired (≤ 4 months) Toxoplasma gondii infection in pregnant women and patients with lymphadenopathy.

VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay performance has not been established for prenatal screening, for newborn testing, for use in immunocompromised patients and in cases of endogenous or exogenous reinfection by Toxoplasma gondii. This assay has not been cleared or approved by the FDA for blood/plasma donor screening.
