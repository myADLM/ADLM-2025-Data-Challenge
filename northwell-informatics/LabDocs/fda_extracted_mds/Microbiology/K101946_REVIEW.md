# L. Test Principle:

The VIDAS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Toxo IgG Avidity assay is a two-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR) serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. The instrument performs all of the assay steps automatically. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. The VIDAS Toxo IgG Avidity uses a dual strip comprised of one reference strip and one test strip. The sample to be tested, after dilution, is dispensed into both sample wells of the dual strip: reference and test. Any antitoxoplasma IgG present in the sample form complexes with the antigen coated to the solid phase. In the reference strip, non-specific antibodies are eliminated by washing, whereas specific antibodies remain coated to the solid phase. In the test strip, washing with the dissociating agent changes antigen-antibody links.

Only antibodies with high avidity remain bound to the solid phase, whereas antibodies with low avidity are eliminated.

Alkaline phosphatase labeled human anti-IgG antibody (conjugate) is then cycled in and out of the SPR, and binds with any human IgG coated on the interior of the SPR. Unbound conjugate is removed by washing. During the final detection step, the substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antibodies present in the sample. At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument and then printed out. The ratio between the quantity of high avidity antibodies (test strip) and the quantity of total antibodies (reference strip) provides an index, which indicates antibody avidity in the tested sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision testing was performed using five serum samples (low avidity, equivocal avidity, and high avidity samples), positive and negative controls, twice daily for a total of ten days on the VIDAS instruments.

Reproducibility testing was performed using five serum samples (low avidity, equivocal avidity, and high avidity samples), positive and negative controls, and two reagent lots using the VIDAS instruments at three testing sites for ten days. Repeatability (withinrun precision), between-run, between-day, between-lot, betweensystem and total precision were calculated based on the recommendations of CLSI EP05-A2. The overall CV for the specimens range was less than $10 \%$ for both analyzers, which is acceptable. The following results were obtained for the precision and reproducibility studies:

Cross-reactivity

The cross reactive study for the VIDAS Toxo IgG Avidity assay was evaluated by testing a total of ten different analytes: ANA, CMV, EBV, HAMA, HAV, HBV, HSV-2, RF, Rubella, and VZV based on the recommendations of CLSI EP07-A2. Testing included at least 5 samples with a low (or borderline) avidity index containing high titers of antibodies to a potentially interfering disease state, and five samples with a high avidity index containing high titers of antibodies to a potentially interfering disease state. Clinically significant interference was defined as either $a > 2 0 \%$ change in index values or a result that altered assay interpretation, i.e., a low or equivocal avidity result changing to a high avidity result or a high avidity result changing to a borderline or low avidity result.

# f. Assay cut-off:

The cut-off for the VIDAS Toxo IgG Avidity assay was established by using a ROC curve to assess the clinical accuracy of the assay. Additionally, an equivocal range was established to identify low avidity samples, which have avidity indices approaching the cut-off. A total of 357 (331 fresh and 26 frozen) samples were tested and were representative of the intended study population. Results obtained with the VIDAS Toxo IgG Avidity assay can be interpreted as follows:

Low IgG avidity is $< 0 . 2 0 0$   
Equivocal IgG avidity is $0 . 2 0 0 \leq \mathrm { i n d e x } < 0 . 3 0 0$

# 3. Clinical Studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity:

The clinical performance of the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay was studied in a single study of samples from 386 subjects, enrolled prospectively or from samples previously collected for toxoplasmosis testing (‘retrospective’).

# Study Design Population

A total of 386 subjects provided samples; all patients were required to have a VIDAS TOXO IgG II assay positive result (i.e. result $\ge 8 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ), and either be pregnant or have acute lymphadenopathy due to suspected or confirmed toxoplasmosis infection. Samples were obtained from four clinical sites: Palo Alto, CA, Grenoble and Marseille, France and Cali, Colombia. Testing was performed at 3 US sites: Palo Alto, CA, Hackensack, NJ and Albuquerque, NM.

Of the 386 subjects, 104 subjects had initially equivocal results on composite reference testing. Thirty-one subjects had an additional sample available for repeat composite reference testing and are included in the primary analysis; results for the remaining 73 subjects without an evaluable response on the composite reference standard were excluded. Of the 313 total subjects analyzed (283 frozen samples and 30 fresh samples), 271 samples were from pregnant women, 42 from patients with lymphadenopathy (both males and females); 14 of the 271 pregnant women also had acute lymphadenopathy. Among the 313 subjects included in the final analysis, 31 had an initial equivocal result but a follow-up sample was available.

Of the 271 samples from pregnant women, 142 were from subjects enrolled prospectively and 129 subject samples were retrospectively tested samples; of the 56 patients with lymphadenopathy (including 14 pregnant women), 7 were from prospectively enrolled subjects and 49 were from retrospective samples.

All specimens were tested by both the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay and a composite reference method; the composite reference method was used for determining whether infection occurred recently or was more distant, and included the Sabin-Feldman Dye Test (DT), the VIDAS TOXO IgM ELISA assay, and the Differential Agglutination (AC/HS) test. Toxoplasmosis IgA and IgE ELISA assays were also performed and used as supportive information. All reference testing was performed at a Palo Alto, CA laboratory. ‘Diagnostic truth’ was assigned by results from the composite reference method and assigned as whether infection occurred $\leq 4$ months or $> 4$ months previous to sample collection.

VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay and composite referencing testing were performed on an initial specimen from each subject; if the initial specimen was equivocal by the composite reference method, a second follow up sample was tested in parallel with the initial specimen by the composite reference method to assist in determining a final diagnostic classification. Patients for whom a follow up sample was required but was unavailable were not included in the results below.

# Study Results

The comparison between the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay and the Composite Reference Method was analyzed as follows: all samples (tables 1 and 2), frozen samples (tables 3 and 4), pregnant women (tables 5 and 6) and lymphadenopathy patients excluding pregnant women (tables 7 and 8). The results and interpretation are shown below.

\* Samples equivocal by either the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay or the Composite Reference Method were analyzed as $\leq 4$ months not excluded for their respective category.

Additional analyses: Of the 31 subjects included in the analysis with initial results that were equivocal on composite reference testing, results for testing additional samples available for these patients by the composite reference method were as follows: 13 $( 4 1 . 9 \% )$ were interpreted as consistent with acute disease, 5 patients $( 1 6 . 1 \% )$ again had equivocal results, and 13 $( 4 1 . 9 \% )$ were interpreted as consistent with chronic disease. All of the 13 samples by composite reference testing $( 1 0 0 \% )$ had low avidity on the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay; however, of the 13 samples consistent with chronic infection, on composite reference testing, 7 $( 5 3 . 8 \% )$ had low avidity, 1 $( 7 . 7 \% )$ had equivocal results, and 5 $( 3 8 . 5 \% )$ had high avidity on the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay. An exploratory analysis where the results from these 31 samples were extrapolated to the 73 samples with equivocal composite reference testing (and not included in the analyses above) and combined with the 313 analyzed samples to approximate results for the original 386 subjects yielded a similar overall sensitivity of $9 4 . 6 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI 90.3 – 97.4) but a noticeable drop in specificity to $8 0 . 5 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI $7 4 . 3 \ - \ 8 5 . 8 )$ . These latter estimates may more closely approximate the results that would have been observed had repeat testing been possible on all initially equivocal composite reference samples.

In the overall lymphadenopathy population, the composite reference method results established that an infection occurring $\leq 4$ months could not be excluded in 33 patients. In 32 $( 9 7 . 0 \% )$ of these 33 patients, VIDAS TXGA test results were Low or Equivocal at $< 0 . 3 0 0$ . Thus the sensitivity of the VIDAS TXGA for the diagnosis that an acute infection $\leq 4$ months) cannot be ruled out was $9 7 . 0 \%$ .

These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

b. Clinical specificity: See Clinical sensitivity section M.3.a c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected Values/Reference Range:

The TOXO IgG Avidity assay was tested with 148 prospectively collected specimens (fresh and frozen) representing subjects for whom the VIDAS TOXO IgG II result $\mathrm { w a s } \ge 8 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . Of the 148 serum samples, 142 corresponded to pregnant women, and 6 to patients with lymphadenopathy. The percentage of high avidity results in these populations as determined by the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay was $8 5 . 2 \%$ for the pregnant women population and $6 6 . 7 \%$ for the lymphadenopathy population.
