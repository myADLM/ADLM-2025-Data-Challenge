# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Focus Diagnostics SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay is intended for use on the 3M Integrated Cycler instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and discrimination of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral infections in humans and is not intended to detect influenza C.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2010 influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use

For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements:

To be used with the 3M Integrated Cycler with Integrated Cycler Studio Software version 2.1 or higher and either a Roche MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a NucliSENS® easyMAGTM System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).

# I. Device Description:

The Focus Diagnostics SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay is a multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR test that detects and differentiates influenza A ,influenza B, and RSV RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs from human patients with signs and symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection.

Patient specimens are collected and placed in sterile viral transport medium containing protein stabilizer, antibiotics to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth, and buffer solution. An Internal Control (RNA IC) is added to each sample prior to nucleic acid extraction by either the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or the Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux). In the case of the MagNA Pure kit, it is recommended that extraction be carried out with qualified MagNA Pure reagent lots only; a list of these qualified extraction reagents will be maintained at www.focusdx.com.

A sample of the extracted nucleic acid is added to the SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay reagents that contain four sets of a primer and a bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer. Each set of primer and bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer recognizes a specific target, namely, influenza A matrix gene, influenza B matrix gene, RSV M gene, and RNA IC. PCR amplification is carried out on the 3M Integratede Cycler. The fluorescence output is is analyzed and test results are determined using the Integrated Cycler Studio Software.

The SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV kit contains Primer Mix (PM), Master Mix (MM), RT Mix (RT), RNA Internal Control (RNA IC), No Template Control (NTC), Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control (PC), Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Barcode Card, and Package Insert.

# Interpretation of Sample Results:

Reporting results is a three step process.

1. Determine if the run is valid by examining the Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control, No Template Control, and RNA Internal Control.

Criteria for a Valid Control (simplified)\*   

<table><tr><td>Control</td><td>Flu A Ct</td><td>Flu B Ct</td><td>RSV Ct</td><td>RNA IC Ct</td></tr><tr><td>No Template Control</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>≤40, ≠0</td></tr><tr><td>Positive Control</td><td>≤40, ≠0</td><td>≤40, ≠0</td><td>≤40, ≠0</td><td>Not Applicable (N/A)</td></tr></table>

\* See notes below for full description.

a. No Template Control:

i. If the No Template Control is Positive ( $\mathrm { C t }$ value ${ \le } 4 0$ , $\neq 0$ for Flu A, Flu B or RSV), then this indicates possible contamination of prepared samples. The control is invalid and all patient specimens must be re-assayed. ii. If the RNA IC is not detected in the No Template Control, the assay run is invalid and all patient specimens must be re-assayed. iii. If the No Template Control is Negative for Flu A, Flu B or RSV detector $\mathrm { C t } = 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) AND If the RNA IC is detected for the No Template Control, then this control is valid and acceptable. b. Positive Control i. If the Positive Control result is a $\mathrm { C t } = 0$ for Flu A, Flu B or RSV, the assay run is considered invalid and unacceptable. All patient specimens must be re-assayed. ii. If the Ct values for Flu A, Flu B and RSV A are ${ \le } 4 0$ , $\neq 0$ the assay run is considered valid and acceptable. c. RNA Internal Control:

i. Detection of the Simplexa™ RNA Internal Control is required to report a negative result.   
ii. Detection of the Simplexa™ RNA Internal Control is not required to report a positive result.

2. Examination of Patient Specimen Results.

Examination of clinical specimen results should be performed after the Positive and No Template Controls have been examined and determined to be valid and acceptable. Flu A, Flu B, RSV and RNA IC results must be examined for each patient specimen.

a. Amplification plots should be examined for every result with a “Data Quality” message. From the Data tab, the user selects the curve to review and then clicks Refresh. The software will draw the selected curves and adjust the scale of the graph. A valid amplification curve shows a smooth, exponential increase. An invalid amplification curve may be a nonexponential or linear curve or a curve with data “spikes” where the curve may cross the threshold. If the curve is valid after examination, the Ct value reported may be used to determine if Flu A, Flu B, or RSV targets are detected.   
b. If the amplification curve is valid for Flu A, Flu B, or RSV, the RNA IC is not required to be detected to report a positive result.

# L. Test Principle:

The SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay is a nucleic acid amplification assay that uses Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) amplification to enable simultaneous and distinct detection of viral RNA from influenza A, influenza B and RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.

The assay combines real-time PCR amplification with fluorescent signal detection technology. A bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer is used together with a reverse primer to amplify a specific target (for each analyte and internal control). A fluorescent signal is generated after the separation of the fluorophore from the quencher as a result of the binding of a probe element to the extended RNA fragment synthesized during amplification.

The 3M Integrated Cycler is a rapid real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction thermocycler used for the identification of nucleic acid from prepared biological samples. The instrument utilizes disk media to contain and to process samples. The instrument uses real time flourometric detection to identify targets within the sample wells. The instrument is controlled by an external computer running the Integrated Cycler Studio Software. Together, the instrument, software and test kit are referred to as the “Microfluidic Molecular System.”

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Inter-lot Precision

Inter-lot precision was assessed by testing three (3) samples and a positive control for each target across three different lots. The panel of samples consisted of high negative, low positive, and moderately positive samples for each of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The samples were generated from swabs and were run in triplicate. One operator at one study site made one extraction of each sample and tested across lots.

The variability attributable to lot-to-lot imprecision was found by fitting the appropriate general linear mixed model, with “lot” as a random variable, and partitioning out the variance. Total variability was split into inter-lot variability, and intra-lot variability (the unexplained variability, or error term of the model). The inter-lot variability component is summarized in the tables below. Imprecision estimates $( \% C V )$ for all samples in the panel were ${ \leq } 5 . 4 \%$ .

1 For the purposes of calculating averages and variance components, samples that offered a negative result $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { C t = 0 } )$ were assigned to a value of 40.0, as a value of 40.0 is more representative of negative samples which have $\mathrm { C t }$ values at the upper limit of the range.

# Inter-laboratory, Inter-assay and Intra-assay Reproducibility

Sample pools of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV were created by spiking concentrated stock of each virus into a matrix generated from negative swabs. Three sample pools were generated per virus corresponding to high negative, low positive, and medium positive levels of virus. Each sample was tested in triplicate at three separate sites: one run per operator, per day, two operators per site, at three sites for 5 days. Nine sample pools corresponding to the three viruses, each at the three levels described earlier, were tested along with No Template Control and Positive Control. No Template Control and Positive Control were also tested in triplicate. A total of 990 samples were tested in the reproducibility studies. Estimates of variability were determined with a random effects model that includes run and site as predictors, with run nested within site. This allowed for partitioning of the total variance to provide best estimates of inter-assay, intra-assay, and inter-lab variability.

Three sites assessed the device's inter-laboratory reproducibility and inter/intra-assay reproducibility. Site 1 performed the extraction using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit and Sites 2 and 3 performed the extraction step using the NucliSENS® easyMAGTM System (bioMérieux). All sample results were included in the analysis. The total $\% \mathrm { C V }$ at each site for positive samples ranged from $0 . 6 \%$ to $2 . 1 \%$ for FLU A, from $0 . 5 \%$ to $6 . 7 \%$ for FLU B, and from $2 . 0 \%$ to $4 . 5 \%$ for RSV

# Controls

The following controls are provided in the Focus Diagnostics SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay kit:

Positive Control (PC): The kit contains a Positive Control consisting of a mixture of inactivated influenza A virus, inactivated influenza B virus, and inactivated RSV. The PC, in conjunction with the SimplexaTM RNA Internal Control, is used to verify reagent and system performance. The Positive Control is meant to be a control for global failure of the assay (missing reaction component, instrument failure, etc.). A Positive Control should be included in each run.

RNA Internal Control (RNA IC): The RNA IC is an encapsulated RNA sequence. The RNA IC is incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification. The RNA IC is intended to monitor for PCR inhibition.

No Template Control (NTC): The NTC consists of nuclease-free water and, after addition of RNA IC, is taken through the RNA extraction process and subsequent amplification and detection. The NTC reaction should not exhibit fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line in any of the FLU A, FLU B, or RSV detection channels but must provide a valid $\mathrm { C t }$ value $\mathrm { ( C t \leq 4 0 }$ , $\neq 0 )$ for the RNA IC. If any of the FLU A, FLU B, or RSV channels provide a Ct value ${ \le } 4 0$ , $\neq 0$ for the NTC, contamination may have occurred in one or more components of the system. The NTC should be included in each run.

Quality control ranges have been established as indicated in the table below. If the controls are not within these parameters, patient results should be considered invalid and the assay repeated. Each laboratory should establish its own Quality Control ranges and frequency of QC testing based on applicable local laws, regulations and standard good laboratory practice.

# d. Detection limits:

Analytical sensitivity was estimated for two strains of influenza A (A/PR/8/34 H1N1, A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2), two strains of influenza B (B/Great Lakes/1739/54, B/Malaysia/2506/2004), and two strains of RSV (RSV A2, RSV B2). The Limit of Detection (LoD) for each strain of virus was determined by limiting dilution studies using quantified stocks of the viruses. The viruses used in this study were grown, re-titered, and diluted with negative swab matrix. A preliminary estimate of the LoD for each virus was carried out by testing four dilutions of each virus around the theoretical LoD with each dilution extracted three times using the Roche MagNA Pure LC System. A single extraction of Positive Control (PC) and No Template Control (NTC) were included in each extraction cartridge. Each extracted sample and control was assayed in a single well. The lowest concentration at which all three replicates were positive were taken as the tentative LoD.

Confirmation of LoD was determined over multiple runs. Each strain was spiked into negative swab at the level of the preliminary LoD and extracted using both the Roche MagNA Pure LC System and the NucliSENS easyMAG extraction method. A single extraction of Positive Control (PC) and No Template Control (NTC) was included in each run.

The LoD was determined as the lowest concentration that was detected $2 9 5 \%$ of the time (i.e. concentration at which at least 19 out of 20 replicates were determined to be positive). The tables below summarize the data obtained during estimation of the preliminary LoD and confirmation of LoD for the six viral strains.

# Cross reactivity

A panel of thirty-two (32) potentially cross reacting microorganisms representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in the nasopharynx was evaluated for cross reactivity. Each potential cross reactant was individually spiked at a high level into a negative swab matrix. The level of each microorganism was determined by growing and titering the microorganism listed. The unspiked matrix was also tested to serve as a baseline. Samples were extracted with the Roche MagNA Pure LC System and tested in triplicate to screen for cross reactivity. According to the study protocol, if influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or RSV was detected in any of the three replicates, an additional 5 replicates were to be tested for confirmation. One extraction was used to make the original three replicates and the confirmatory five replicates.

No confirmatory testing was required as all initial replicates gave negative results for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The results are summarized in the table below.

1) The EBV virus is grown in a transformed cell line (marmoset leukocytes). Transformed cells are not an appropriate cell line for quantitation using $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ , instead, copies $/ \mathrm { m L }$ is calculated using a quantitative PCR method.

# Reactivity

In addition to the six viral strains tested for LoD, ten additional influenza A strains, nine additional influenza B strains, and four additional strains of RSV were tested for reactivity with the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV assay. A strain of $2 0 0 9 \mathrm { H } 1 \mathrm { N } 1$ influenza A virus was included in the study. Each virus tested for reactivity was diluted in negative swab matrix at $1 . 0 { \overset { \cdot } { \mathrm { x } } } 1 0 ^ { 2 }$ $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ and extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC instrument. Each strain was extracted in triplicate and assayed to provide an estimate of LoD. If 3/3 replicates did not provide a positive result in the correct channel, an additional dilution to provide a two-fold higher level of virus was created and tested. The following table summarizes the additional strains of virus tested for reactivity and the level of each strain of virus that provided 3/3 positive results.

# f. Interference Studies:

# Interfering Substances

The performance of the SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay was evaluated with potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal swab specimens at the concentrations indicated in the table below. The potentially interfering substances were evaluated in influenza A (influenza A/Hong

$\mathrm { K o n g } / 8 / 6 8 )$ and influenza B (influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004), each at a level of $5 0 \ \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ , and RSV A2 at a level of 5 $\mathrm { \Delta ) T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ . All samples of virus plus potential interferent were extracted with the Roche MagNA Pure LC instrument and tested in triplicate.

# Interfering Microorganisms

A study was carried out to determine if any of the panel of thirty-two potentially cross-reacting microorganisms (listed in Section M.1.e (Analytical specificity)) could inhibit detection of influenza A, influenza B, or RSV by the SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay. These potentially inhibitory microorganismsms were individually spiked into a pool containing a low level (2 x LoD) of influenza A (A/PR/8/34), influenza B (B/Malaysia/2506/2004) and RSV (A2). Each sample was tested in triplicate. The results from the study are summarized in the table below. No inhibitory effects on detection of influenza A, influenza B, or RSV were confirmed.

# Competitive Interference

The Competitive Interference study evaluated the effects of clinically relevant co-infections with each of the analytes probed by the assay. The study assessed whether a high concentration of one virus in the specimen could potentially affect the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay performance for another target present at low levels in the multiplex assay. A low positive sample was contrived at approximately 4 to 6 times the LoD for each target (influenza A, influenza B and RSV), and a baseline Ct was determined for each sample. A high level of each potential concomitant infecting virus was spiked into the low level specimen as summarized in the table below.

<table><tr><td>(Concentration)</td><td>Competitive Stra</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Influenza A/PR/8/34 (8.80 × 101 TCID50/mL)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">RSV A2 (1.60 × 104 TCID50/mL)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (1.29 × 102 TCID50/mL)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">RSV A2 (1.60 × 104 TCID50/mL)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="2">RSV A2 (&lt;10 TCID50/mL)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Influenza A/PR/8/34 (2.50 × 105 TCID50/mL)*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (2.58 × 105 TCID50/mL)</td></tr></table>

\*When very high levels of influenza A are present with low levels of RSV the signal from the RSV reaction may not be adequate to be detected, due to competitive interference. When all three viruses are present at moderate levels (as in the Positive Control) there is no evidence of competitive interference.

# g. Assay cut-off:

Forty-five cycles of amplification were performed during assay development to allow for the appropriate determination of assay cut off. Analysis of the Limit of Detection study showed that all Ct values at the Limit of Detection were ${ < } 4 0$ with the exception of one influenza A sample which gave a Ct result ${ > } 4 0$ . The Limit of Detection is defined as the lowest concentration of sample where $\ge 9 5 \%$ of twenty replicates are detected. A review of the Method Comparison (Clinical Performance) data showed that $59 5 \%$ of the positive clinical specimens had a $\mathrm { C t }$ value ${ \le } 3 5$ . Specimens that were positive for influenza A had Ct values in the range 15.2 to 37.3. Specimens that were positive for influenza B had $\mathrm { C t }$ values in the range 16.5 to 34.0. Specimens that were positive for RSV had $\mathrm { C t }$ values in the range 16.0 to 41.4 with one specimen giving a Ct value ${ > } 4 0$ . The data thus indicate that $\mathrm { C t } { = } 4 0$ is an appropriate assay cut-off

# h. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination

The study was designed by alternately placing high positive and high negative $\left( 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \right.$ dilution of high positive) samples on both the MagNA Pure cartridge for extraction and the Universal Disc for amplification. A total of 180 high negative samples were tested across 5 runs. The sample size of 180 was chosen to provide $80 \%$ power of detecting a carry over/contamination effect of $5 \%$ or greater, with alpha $= 0 . 0 5$ . The carryover effect was evaluated by comparing the observed positive rate for the high negative samples with the expected rate under normal reproducibility conditions. The purpose of analysis was to determine if the positive rate for the high negative samples was elevated beyond what was probable. A one sample, one sided test for a proportion (binomial) was used to test for significance for all three FLU A, FLU B, and RSV channels.

The baseline negative samples were positive $0 \%$ (0 of 90 replicates) of the time for the FLU B and RSV channels and $1 . 1 \%$ (1of 90 replicates) of the time for the FLUA channel. When tested with high positive samples, no significant carry-over contamination effect was seen in any of the channels. The data from the study are summarized in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with reference methods:

The performance of the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay was compared with reference methods during testing of clinical specimens. For influenza A and influenza B, the reference method was a high performance FDA cleared nucleic acid test. For RSV, the reference method was culture/DFA.

b. Matrix Comparison:

Not applicable

c. Performance in Fresh vs. Frozen Clinical Specimens:

The performance of the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay was determined by comparing fresh (never frozen, unextracted and tested within 72 hours of collection) versus frozen (unextracted) clinical specimens. A panel of one hundred and eighty (180) nasopharyngeal swab specimens including sixty (60) positive swabs for each virus (influenza A, influenza B, RSV) was contrived for testing so that they covered the range expected from clinical specimens. Three aliquots of each sample were prepared, representing fresh, short-term frozen (at least 2 hours frozen at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and long-term frozen (at least 7 days frozen at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ ) states. All testing was performed at Focus Diagnostics using one Simplexa ™ Flu A/B & RSV lot.

The plots of short-term frozen Ct values and long-term frozen $\mathrm { C t }$ values vs.   
fresh Ct values visually show the existence of a linear relationship.

Additionally, for all comparisons, the value of the coefficient of determination $( \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } )$ is greater than 0.95, meaning that at least $9 5 \%$ of the variation seen in the frozen (short-term and long-term) Ct values are explained by the variation seen in fresh $\mathrm { C t }$ values.

The slopes, along with the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval and percent bias for the above comparisons, are summarized in the following table. The $9 5 \%$ confidence interval indicates that slope estimates are not statistically significant at $5 \%$ level of significance. The observed bias for both short-term and long-term frozen Ct values is small and is not clinically significant. This indicates that short-term and long-term frozen samples are stable in comparison with fresh samples.

1 For the purposes of regression analysis, samples that offered a negative result $\displaystyle ( \mathrm { C t = 0 } )$ were assigned to a value of 40.0, as a value of 40.0 is more representative of negative samples which have Ct values at the upper limit of the range.

# d. Extraction Efficiency:

Assessment of the equivalence of the two extraction methods was determined by several approaches: (1) One clinical testing site performed Clinical Performance and Reproducibility studies using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit and two sites used the NucliSENS easyMAg system and (2) Determinations of Limit of Detection were carried out using both extraction systems. Based on the results from these studies, there does not appear to be any significant difference in the performance of the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay using either the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit or the NucliSENS easyMAg system.

# 3. Clinical studies:

Three external testing sites participated in the Clinical Agreement Study. Reference results for influenza A and influenza B viruses were generated using a high performance FDA cleared nucleic acid test (NAT). Reference results for RSV were generated using culture/DFA. Culture/DFA results were carried forward from the results obtained at the time of sample collection or banking. A total of 735 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens were obtained from a combination of prospectively collected specimens $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { T } 1 0 = 5 5 8 \mathrm { \Delta }$ and retrospective, banked specimens $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 1 7 7 )$ from patients with signs and symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection.

Prospective samples were collected in Southern United States from 26-February2010 to 24-March-2010 and in Australia from 04-July-2010 to 17-August-2010. Three (3) samples were excluded from the prospective analysis due to “Unresolved” status on the reference nucleic acid assay and two (2) samples were excluded due to “invalid” status on the Simplexa assay. The samples remained unresolved or invalid upon repeat testing. One (1) sample was excluded from the prospective analysis due to lack of culture/DFA result for RSV. Due to the low prevalence rate of influenza during the collection period and the rareness of RSV in the adult population, retrospectively collected specimens from the, 2008 – 2009 and early 2010 influenza and RSV seasons in Eastern and Mid-Western United States from patients with signs and symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection were also evaluated ${ \mathrm { ( n = 1 7 7 } }$ ); of the 177 samples collected 47 were not analyzed by culture/DFA for influenza A or influenza B.

The clinical samples were tested at three sites. One site extracted specimens using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit and the other two sites used the NucliSENS easyMAg system. No apparent different difference in clinical performance was observed for the two extraction systems. The clinical performance of the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay is summarized in the following tables.

# N. Instrument Name:

Integrated Cycler with Integrated Cycler Studio Software version 2.1 or higher (3M)

MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche)

NucliSENS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ easyMAG™ System (bioMérieux)

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Microfluidic Molecular System includes the computer, related peripherals, handheld barcode scanner, Integrated Cycler, Integrated Cycler Studio software and operator manual. The Integrated Cycler is a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) thermocycler used for detection of nucleic acid from prepared biological samples. The instrument utilizes disc media to contain and to process samples and real-time fluorometric detection to identify targets within the sample wells. The instrument’s operation parameters are controlled by the use of an external personal computer and associated software. The disc can process up to 96 independent samples.

The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and purification system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has the capability to process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is purified in multiple plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that include cell lysis and binding of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles, wash steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic acid from the glass particles.

The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run. Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis and binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash steps and heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads.

3. Specimen Identification: User manually enters Patient ID/Sample ID.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Not applicable

5. Calibration: Not applicable

6. Quality Control:

The following controls are provided:

Positive Control (PC): A mixture of inactivated influenza A virus, inactivated influenza B virus, and inactivated RSV. The PC, in conjunction with the RNA IC is used to verify reagent and system performance. The positive control is meant to be a control for global failure of the assay (missing reaction component, instrument failure, etc.). A positive control should be included in each run.

RNA Internal Control (RNA IC): The RNA IC is an encapsulated RNA sequence. The RNA IC is incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification. The RNA IC is intended to monitor for PCR inhibition..

No Template Control (NTC): The NTC consists of nuclease-free water and, after addition of RNA IC, is taken through the RNA extraction process and subsequent amplification and detection. The NTC reaction should not exhibit fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line in any of the FLU A, FLU B, or RSV detection channels but must provide a valid $\mathrm { C t }$ value $( \mathrm { C t } \leq 4 0 , \neq 0 )$ for the RNA IC. If any of the FLU A, FLU B, or RSV channels provide a $\mathrm { C t }$ value ${ \le } 4 0$ , $\neq 0$ for the NTC, contamination may have occurred in one or more components of the system. The NTC should be included in each run.
