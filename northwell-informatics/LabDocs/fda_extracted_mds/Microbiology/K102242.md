# 3. Predicate Device

# K041951  Remel Xpect® Clostridium difficile Toxin A/B

# 4. Device Description

The OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test is a rapid test which can detect the presence of Clostridium difficile toxins A and B in human stool samples: A test kit contains 25 OSOM test stick devices and 25 disposable pipettes. The OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test is a qualitative assay that employs immunochromatographic, dipstick technology. The test format is a sandwich immunoassay, with a single test zone on the nitrocellulose dipstick to detect Toxin A and/or Toxin B ("blue/gray" line) and a single control line zone to indicate proper sample flow ("red" line). The test procedure involves binding of C. difficile Toxin A and/or Toxin B from a patient stool sample to blue colored latex particles conjugated to a monoclonal antibody against Toxin B or a polyclonal antibody against Toxin A. When Toxin A and/or B is present in the sample, it will form a partial immune complex with the antibody-conjugated colored particles. The OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test stick, when placed in the sample mixture, initiates sample migration along the nitrocellulose membrane. If C. difficile toxin A or toxin B is present, a blue/gray line will appear in the test line region indicating a positive result. A red control line must appear for the results to be valid. If C. difficile toxins are not present, only the red control line will appear. An invalid test occurs when no control line appears.

# 5. Intended Use

The OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test is an immunochromatographic assay intended for the qualitative detection of Clostridium difficile toxins A and/or B in human stool samples. This test is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) in patients with symptoms of CDAD.

# 7. Summary of Performance Data

Clinical Performance. A clinical trial was conducted at five sites in the United States to establish the clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test in detecting Clostridium difficile toxins A and/or B in human stool samples. Qualitative results obtained using the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test were compared with those determined by cytotoxicity assay.

De-identified excess loose or watery stool specimens were obtained from patients at or over the age of 18 years whose stool specimen had been submitted to the laboratory for C. difficileassociated disease (CDAD) testing. Specimens were tested with the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test within 72 hours of receipt. The cytotoxicity assay was performed at Genzyme using a standard C. difficile toxin cytotoxicity assay. Those performing the cytotoxicity assay testing were blinded to the OSOM test results.

The total incidence rate observed in this study for C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) based on the cytotoxicity assay results was $8 . 0 \%$ (102/ 1274). The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the OSOM test compared to cytotoxicity assay are shown in the table below.

Discrepant testing was performed with a commercially available PCR-based molecular method which detects the tcdB gene. Note this PCR method does not detect biologically active protein or Toxin A gene. Twelve of twelve specimens that were cytotoxin positive and OSOM C. difficile

Toxin A/B negative were positive for the presence of tcdB gene. Of the 37 specimens that were cytotoxin negative and OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B positive, 30 of 36 were negative for the tcdB gene, 6 were positive for the tcdB gene, 1 specimen was not available for testing by PCR.

# Performance of OsOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test and the Predicate Device Compared to Cytotoxicity Assay .

The performance of the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test and a commercially available predicate device were compared to cytotoxicity assay results (see Table 3). All immunoassay device testing was performed at a clinical trial site. A total of 250 paired sample results (OSOM and Predicate Device) were included in this comparison. The performance of the Predicate Device and OSOM tests were compared to the results from the cytotoxicity assay.

Reproducibility. Reproducibility studies were performed by two laboratory personnel per day at two external clinical laboratories and one internal site, on a coded panel that contained synthetic stool samples representing both negative and positive C. difficile Toxin A and Toxin B samples. Testing occurred twice per day over a period of 5 days for 120 total test results for each of the three sites. Each operator tested a coded panel of 12 samples: 3 negative samples, 3 high negative samples, 3 low positive samples and 3 moderate positive samples. The OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test gave the expected result $9 9 . 2 \%$ (357/360) of the time.

# 8. Conclusion

The information presented in this Premarket Notification demonstrates the performance of the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test for use with human stool samples is substantially equivalent in intended use, technological characteristics, and performance to the predicate device, thereby supporting 510(k) clearance.

Equivalence was demonstrated using manufactured reagents along with patient and quality control samples containing C. difficile toxins A and B.

The studies in this submission demonstrate the substantial equivalence of the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test to products already marketed for the qualitative detection of Clostridium difficile in human stool specimens.
