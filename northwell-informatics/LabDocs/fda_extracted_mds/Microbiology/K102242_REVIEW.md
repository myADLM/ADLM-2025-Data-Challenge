# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The OSOM C. difficile toxin A/B test is a qualitative assay using immunochromatographic dipstick technology. It is a sandwich immunoassay with a single test zone on the nitrocellulose dipstick to detect toxin A and/or toxin B and a single control line zone to indicate proper sample flow. If the toxins are present in the sample, they will bind to blue colored latex particles conjugated to a monoclonal antibody against toxin B or a polyclonal antibody against toxin A and will form a partial immune complex. The test stick, when placed in the sample mixture, initiates sample migration along the nitrocellulose membrane. If toxin A or toxin B is present, a blue/gray line will appear in the test line region indicating a positive result. A red control line must appear for the results to be valid. If C. difficile toxins are not

present, only the red control line will appear. An invalid test occurs when no control line appears.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility study was conducted by 2 lab personnel per day at 3 sitesone in-house site and two health centers (a small and large hospital clinical laboratory). A coded panel of 12 samples was prepared in a stool matrix and included C. difficile toxin A and toxin B. The panel was comprised of 3 negative, 3 high negative, 3 low positive and 3 moderate positive samples. Each set was run twice per day for a period of 5 days at the three sites. Positive and negative assay controls were included. The two runs on any given day at each site were performed by a different operator. The OSOM $C .$ . difficile Toxin A/B test gave the expected result $9 9 . 2 \%$ (357/360) of the time.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Shelf life for the OSOM C. difficile toxin $\mathrm { A } / \mathrm { B }$ test was initially estimated by accelerated stability testing with 2 lots at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 37 and $4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 35 days of testing. Testing included 6 replicates on Day 0 and 3 replicates on all other days using in-house $C .$ . difficile Toxin A and Toxin B QC controls (Toxoid A and Toxoid B standards purified from $C .$ difficile strain (ATCC: VPI 10643) with immunoreactivity confirmed by commercially available ELISA. Observed results predicted ${ > } 2 4$ months stability for both the OSOM test kit and the kit controls. Real time stability was examined for 2 kit lots stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 2.2 years. Stability for external controls was also examined when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Observed results showed all positive control results remained positive and all negative control results remained negative for all lots and all time points. The test kit and controls have a stability in excess of 24 months.

Stool sample storage conditions were also established in a study using 2 reagent lots with 3 toxin-positive and 3 toxin-negative stool samples. Results from the study showed that stool samples for the test can be stored up to 4 hours at room temperature, up to 72 hours when refrigerated at $\left( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ , or up to 2 months if stored frozen $( - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The OSOM C. difficile toxin A/B test detected $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for toxin A and 40 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ for toxin B. These studies were conducted with 3 representative lots using a serial dilution series prepared from purified $C .$ . difficile toxin A and toxin B in a buffer matrix.

The limit of detection was also examined in a stool matrix dilution series. An antigen dilution series was prepared by spiking the stool matrix with $C .$ . difficile toxin A & B standard diluted to a concentration of $4 8 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Twofold dilutions of the toxin-stool-matrix were prepared to generate the series (480, 240, 120, 60, 30, 15, $8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). Stool matrix by composition is a nonhomogenous mixture which can introduce variability in a dilution series. The limit of detection results in the stool matrix were consistent with those determined in the buffer matrix.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross-Reactivity

The OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test was evaluated with bacterial and viral isolates. All testing was performed in a diarrhea matrix except where noted. Cross-reactivity testing was performed with materials obtained from ATCC. Bacterial isolates were tested at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { c f u / m L }$ except where noted. All viruses were cultured to ensure viability and tested at the specified concentrations. All bacteria listed gave negative responses. All viruses listed produced negative responses.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Stool samples were collected from a total of 1274 adult patients at 5 sites in the United States. The specimens were tested for C. difficile by cytotoxicity assay (CTA) and the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test. The samples were de-identified, excess, loose or watery stool specimens obtained from patients ranging from 18 yrs. to $> 9 0$ years old. Of the 1274 stool specimens in the study, 577 were from males and 697 were from females. Stool consistency was observed as 547 loose stools and 727 watery stools. The specimens were submitted to the lab for $C .$ difficile-associated disease (CDAD) testing. Specimens were tested with the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B test within 72 hrs of receipt. A standard C. difficile toxin cytotoxicity assay was also performed. The performance of the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test was determined for clinical sensitivity and specificity against the results from the reference method, CTA. The results from this analysis with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals are summarized in the Table below.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Clostridium difficile is the most frequently identified cause of nosocomial diarrhea, accounting for $1 5 \% - 2 5 \%$ of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and more than $9 5 \%$ of cases of pseudomembranous colitis.1, 3 CDI is primarily a nosocomial disease, and therefore the rate of infection may vary from location to location. Risks for infection include length of hospitalization, patient age, antibiotic use, severity of underlying disease and gastrointestinal surgery or procedures.8 Test results should be used in conjunction with the patient’s clinical information as asymptomatic colonization with $C .$ . difficile and its toxins can be seen in some healthy adults, up to $50 \%$ of cystic fibrosis patients and up to $50 \%$ of infants.4 In a prospective clinical study involving the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test at 5 independent sites, an overall prevalence rate of $8 . 0 \%$ (102/1274)

was observed in freshly acquired diarrhea samples submitted to the laboratory for CDI testing.
