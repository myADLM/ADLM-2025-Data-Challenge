# Section 6: Test Principle

The ZEUS ELISA Treponema pallidum IgG Test System is designed to detect IgG class antibodies in human sera to Treponema pallidum. Wells of plastic microwel strips are sensitized by passive absorption with T. pallidum antigen. The test procedure involves three incubation steps:

Test sera are diluted with SAVE Diluent. During sample incubation, any antigen specific IgG antibody in the sample will bind to the immobilized antigen. The plate is washed to remove unbound antibody and other serum components.   
Peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human IgG is added to the wells and the plate is incubated. The conjugate will react with IgG antibody immobilized on the solid phase in step 1. The wells are washed to remove unbound conjugate.   
The microwells containing immobilized peroxidase conjugate are incubated with peroxidase substrate solution. Hydrolysis of the substrate by peroxidase produces a color change. After ten minutes have elapsed, the reaction is stopped and the color intensity of the solution is measured photometrically. The color intensity of the solution depends on upon the antibody concentration in the original test sample.

# Section 7: Linearity

The WHO International Standard was diluted serially. Each dilution was tested in duplicate, the mean calculated and the result plotted.

# Section 8: Analytical Specificity

Interfering Substances

The effect of potential interfering substances on sample results generated using the test system was evaluated with the following possible interfering substances: albumin, bilirubin, cholesterol, hemoglobin, triglycerides and intralipids.

The quantity of analyte in each interfering substance is as follows:

Bilirubin: 1mg/dL (low), 15 mg/dL (high) Albumin: 3.5 g/dl (low), 5 g/dL (high) Cholesterol: 150 mg/dL (low), 250 mg/dL (high) Triglycerides: 150 mg/dL (low), 500 mg/dL (high) Hemoglobin: 20 g/dL (low), 20 g/dL (high) Intralipid: 300 mg/dL (low), 750 mg/dL (high)

Three samples for Treponema pallidum IgG were chosen based on their performance on the Treponema pallidum IgG ELiSA test system: positive, borderline and negative. The samples were exposed to the possible interfering substances and tested. An increase or reduction of signal equal to or less than $20 \%$ is considered acceptable. The negative sample may have a signal change greater than $20 \%$ if there is no change in the qualitative result of the sample. All signal changes greater than $20 \%$ must be specified in the package insert.

All positive samples showed less than a $20 \%$ recovery of signal.

The borderline samples showed a recovery of signal $\textless 2 0 \%$ of with the exception of the high spike of hemoglobin $( 2 5 . 2 \% )$ .

The negative sample showed a change of signal $( > 2 0 \% )$ with the high and low spikes of albumin, hemoglobin, intralipid, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides. The negative sample results in each instance stayed below the cut-off and the change in signal did not affect the qualitative result.

# Cross Reactivity

# Reproducibility

Reprducibility was evaluateinternally and at two external clinical sies. The study was conduce as fos:teen spls we enti andr repar y Zeus Scinti Inc.or se he uy based upon their activity on the assay. Three samples each were selected that were negative, high neative, near cu- low positive and hih positiveTo assess reproducibility, on each day of teting p was iu twican  i wasn pliThs was peat  c by a secnd tcnologist resultng in twelve esults per day.This was repeated or five days at ea e and the resulting data used. Reproducibility is considered acceptable for the reactive samples if the Total CV is $< 1 5 \%$ and if the Total CV for the borderline and positive samples do not congregate at the high end of acceptability but show a spread of results of at least $3 \%$ The reproducibility for the negative sample is considered acceptable if the Total CV is $1 5 0 \%$ and shows no change in the qualitative outcome.
