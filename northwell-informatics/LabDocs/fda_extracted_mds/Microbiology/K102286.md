Immuno-Mycologics' Latex-Cryptococcus Antigen Detection System 510(k) # K791382

# Intended Use:

The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay is an immunochromatographic test system for the qualitative or semi-quantitative detection of capsular polysaccharide antigens of Cryptococcus species complex (Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gatti) in serum.

The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay is a prescription-use laboratory assay, which can aid in the diagnosis of Cryptococcosis.

# Device Description:

Explanation:

Detection of cryptococcal antigen in serum has been used for over forty years to aid in the diagnosis of cryptococcosis with very high sensitivity and specificity (9,14,15). Current guidelines for the management of cryptococcal disease partially base treatment recommendations on cryptococcal antigen presence and more specifically on cryptococcal antigen titers (16).

Cryptococcosis is caused by both species of the Cryptococcus species complex (Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gatti) (5,6,12,13). Individuals with impaired cell-mediated immune (CMI) function due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (19),

lymphoproliferative disorders (18), steroid therapy (8), and organ transplantation (7) are at increased risk of cryptococcosis. AIDS accounts for $80 - 9 0 \%$ of cryptococcal infections (11). The incidence of cryptococcosis in AIDS patients in the United States is estimated to be 5-10% (11), while the incidence of cryptococcosis in other parts of the world, such as Africa, is as high as $30 \%$ (3). Cryptococcosis is the fourth most common opportunistic, life-threatening infection among AIDS patients (10).

# Description:

The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay is a dipstick sandwich immunochromatographic assay, which detects cryptococcal antigen in serum. For the qualitative procedure, specimens are diluted 1:2 in 1x Specimen Diluent and analyzed. For the semi-quantitative procedure, specimens are diluted 1:5 in 1x Specimen Diluent followed by 1:2 serial dilutions. All dilutions are then analyzed as in the qualitative procedure. Specimens are placed into an appropriate reservoir, such as a test tube or microtiter plate, and the lateral flow device is then placed into the reservoir allowing the specimen to come into contact with the test membrane. The test uses specimen wicking to capture gold-conjugated, anti-cryptococcal monoclonal antibodies and gold-conjugated control antibodies that are deposited onto a membrane. If cryptococcal antigen is present in the specimen, it binds to the gold-conjugated, anti-cryptococcal antibodies. The gold-labeled antibody-antigen complex will continue to wick up the membrane where it will interact with the Test Line (T). The Test Line is immobilized anti-cryptococcal monoclonal antibodies. If the specimen contains cryptococcal antigen, a sandwich is created with the gold-labeled antibodies and the immobilized antibodies, causing a visible line to evelop at the test lne sie .  proper fow occurs and the reagents are reactive at the tme of use, the wicking of any specimen, positive or negative, will cause the gold-conjugated control goat IgG antibody to move to the Control Line (C) which is immobilized bovine anti-goat IgG antibody. The immobilized anti-goat antibody will bind to the gold-conjugated goat IgG Control ady and will cause a visible lie to develop ).A posiive est result wil create two es, while a negative test result will create one line (Figure . If the control line fails to develop a line, then the test is not valid.

# Performance Summary

Precision Studies (Repeatability & Reproducibility)

Serum: Repeatability and reproducibility with serum specimens were determined by spiking a serum specimen pool that was negative by the IMMY Latex-Cryptococcus Antigen Detection

System with cryptococcal antigen at four concentrations: Negative, high negative $( C _ { 5 } )$ , low positive (near $\cos$ , and medium positive. The samples were analyzed on the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay in triplicate on five different days, at three different sites with a total of five different operators, on one lot, according to EP5-A2. One site was internal (Site 1) and the remaining two were a US reference laboratory (Site ) and a US hospital laboratory (Site 3). For repeatability, percent positive and percent negative detected were calculated for each site (Table 2). For reproducibility, overall percent positive and percent negative detected were calculated by combining the data from all three sites (last two rows of Table 2).

\* Rheumatoid factor concentrations tested ranged from 112lU/ml to 64791U/ml.

Additionally, cross-reactivity was assessed by testing crude culture filtrate antigens at a range of concentrations using the $C r A E$ Lateral Flow Assay. At high concentrations $_ { \{ > 0 . 1 \} }$ $m g / m l )$ , antigens from Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis exhibitied some cross-reactivity. Antigens from Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus did not exhibit cross-reactivity.

Ineren tstig was a performed on ve iteric,fiv hemolyzed and fve lipeic serum specimens. Each specimen was spiked with cryptococcal antigen at three times the C95 concentration. All specimens were then tested at IMMY, on one lot of CrAg Lateral Flow assay in triplicate: spiked and unspiked. Percent positivity was determined for each condition. Al of the unspiked specimens had negative results on the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay. All spiked specimens were positive, thus, these types of serum specimens do not interfere with the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay. However, it is possible that hemolyzed samples could lead to false negatives due to the high background color on the strip.

The effect of pronase on the CrAg LFA was determined by pronase-treating 5 Cryptococcal ElA positive specimens and 5 Cryptococcal EIA negative specimens. The samples were analyzed both untreated and pronase-treated. All treated, positives samples remained positive and all treated, negative samples remained negative. Therefore, pronase does not affect the CrAg LFA.

Due to specimen availability, the following conditions were not tested in the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay: Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsidosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Cladosporium trichoides, Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella typhi, Pneumocystis carinii, Trichosporon beigelii, Zygomycetes, ANA+, HAV, HCV, Staph, and Strep.

between 20 and 500ug/ml. Each concentration was tested in triplicate at IMMY on one lot of CrAg Lateral Flow Assay, according to the package insert. It was determined that serum specimens with a cryptococcal antigen concentration higher than 200ug/ml can produce a high dose hook effect and therefore may produce a false negative result.

F. Method Comparison

# Method Comparison: Cryptococcal Antigen EIA

The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay was compared to a Cryptococcal Antigen ElA, which detects cryptococcal antigens in serum.

A panel of 197 serum specimens that were submitted to a US reference laboratory for cryptococcal antigen testing, using the Cryptococcal Antigen ElA, were collected and stored frozen until method comparison studies were performed. Specimens were then thawed and tested concurrently in the CrAg LFA and in a latex agglutination test [See "Predicate Method Comparison - Latex-Cryptococcal Antigen Detection System (K791382)]. The resulting data is presented in a $2 \times 2$ contingency table (Table 4). The percent agreement positive, percent agreement negative, and $9 5 \%$ confidence interval are also presented (Table 5).

# Semi-Quantitative Serum

Sixty-two serum specimens that tested positive by the IMMY Latex-Cryptococcus Antigen Detection System during the qualitative method comparison were stored frozen $( - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C )$ then analyzed in the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) to determine the specimens' titers (Semiquantitative analysis). Concurrently, the specimens were tested in the IMMY LatexCryptococcus Antigen Detection System (LA) to determine the latex titer for each specimen. The entire panel was tested at IMMY according to each test's package insert. Cryptococcus Antigen Latex titer versus CrAg Lateral Flow Test titer was plotted and regression analysis performed. The data show a strong correlation between the two tests $\{ R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 0 5 \}$ .
