# Predicate (Unmodified) Device

Device Name: ADVIA Centaur® Toxoplasma IgG (Toxo G) Assay Manufacturer: Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. (previously Bayer Diagnostics Corp.) 510(k) Number: K012183

# Intended Use of Predicate (Unmodified) Device

The ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma IgG assay is an IgG antibody capture microparticle direct in vitro diagnostic immunoassay intended for the quantitative and qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to the Toxoplasma gondii parasite in human serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin) using the ADVIA Centaur systems. The measurement of Toxoplasma IgG may be used to aid in the assessment of a patient's immunological response from individuals including women of childbearing age. This assay may be utilized with an IgM Toxoplasma result to determine recent serological response to Toxoplasma.

WARNING: The use of the ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma IgG assay to diagnose recent infection by testing acute and convalescent samples is not recommended. The calculated values for toxoplasma IgG in a given specimen, as determined by assays from different manufacturers, can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the toxoplasma IgG assay used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably.

This assay has not been cleared or approved by the FDA for the screening of blood or plasma donors. Testing should not be performed as a screening procedure for the general population.

# 9. Substantial Equivalence

The modified ADVIA Centaur Toxo G assay has the same operating principles, assay performance characteristics and intended use as the predicate device.

The results of performance testing, and verification and validation activities demonstrate that the design modifications to the ADVIA Centaur Toxo G assay do not impact its safety or effectiveness and do not alter its performance claims. The modified assay is substantially equivalent to the currently-marketed predicate ADVIA Centaur Toxo G assay.

Dear Mr. Gee

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Acl. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a deternination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specitic advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
