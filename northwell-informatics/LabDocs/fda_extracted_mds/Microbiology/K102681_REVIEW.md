# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma G assay is an immunoglobulin class-capture sandwich immunoassay using direct, chemiluminescent technology. The anti-human $\mathrm { I g G } _ { \mathrm { F c } }$ monoclonal antibody is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase. In the Lite Reagent, the purified T. gondii antigen is bound to an anti-p30 monoclonal antibody $( \mathrm { F } ( \mathrm { a b } ) _ { 2 }$ fragment) labeled with acridinium ester. Antibody-antigen complexes will form if toxoplasma $\mathrm { I g G }$ is present in the sample.

The system automatically performs the following actions:

• Dispenses $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample into a cuvette.   
• Dispenses $2 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of Solid Phase and incubates the mixture for 18 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .   
• Separates the Solid Phase from the mixture and aspirates the unbound reagent.   
• Washes the cuvette with Wash 1.   
• Dispenses $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ Lite Reagent and incubates the mixture for 18 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .   
• Separates the Solid Phase from the mixture and aspirates the unbound reagent. Washes the cuvette with Wash 1. Dispenses $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ each of Acid Reagent and Base Reagent to initiate the chemiluminescent reaction.   
• Reports results according to the selected option, as described in the system operatin instructions or in the online help system.

A direct relationship exists between the amount of toxoplasma IgG activity present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system. A result of reactive (positive) or nonreactive (negative) is determined using a clinical cutoff value of $1 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision

Assay imprecision (within run and total) of the Toxo G assay was evaluated on ADVIA Centaur. A 20-day precision study (as per CLSI EP5-A2) was performed using two (2) reagent pilot lots (Pilot 1 and Pilot 2) with respective calibrators and controls. Samples included three in-house Medical Decision Pools and two controls (i.e. Negative and Positive), and two runs per day were performed.

The acceptance criteria, as defined by the sponsor, were as follows:

# Within-Run CV:

15 to $3 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } - \leq 4 . 0 \%$ 50 to $1 7 5 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L - } \leq 6 . 0 \%$ $> 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L } - \leq 6 . 0 \%$

Total CV: 15 to $3 0 \mathrm { I U / m L - } \leq 8 . 0 \%$ 50 to $1 7 5 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L - \leq 1 0 . 0 \% }$ $> 2 5 0 \mathrm { I U / m L - } \leq 1 0 . 0 \%$

Pilot Lot 1 (Pooled)   

<table><tr><td>n</td><td>Mean (IU/mL)</td><td>Within Run CV</td><td>Total CV</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>28.07</td><td>2.6</td><td>3.7</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>10.96</td><td>3,2</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>120.5</td><td>2.6</td><td>4.6</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>455.3</td><td>2.5</td><td>4.8</td></tr></table>

Pilot Lot 2 (Pooled)   

<table><tr><td>n</td><td>Mean (IU/mL)</td><td>Within Run CV</td><td>Total CV</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>28.07</td><td>2.7</td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>10.96</td><td>3,7</td><td>4.6</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>120.5</td><td>2.5</td><td>3.7</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>455.3</td><td>2.9</td><td>3.9</td></tr></table>

These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability:

Assay performance was assessed for control recovery of the “Rocked/Pierced” reagent packs stored on-system relative to day zero recovery. A fresh reagent pack was used as the control for each time point and it was compared with the Rocked/Pierced and Rocked/Sealed reagent packs started on Day 0. A lot-specific Master Curve was used. The study was completed on (2) ADVIA Centaurs. Adjusted SD (ADSD) is calculated from Total SD (TSD) and Within Run SD (WRSD) from the precision claims in the IFU. The ADSD is given by the following equation where n is the number of replicates per run:

$$
4 d j u s t e d S D \ ( A D S D ) = S Q R T \ \{ ( T S D ^ { \wedge } 2 \ – [ ( n - I ) / n ] ) ^ { * } W R S D ^ { \wedge } 2 \}
$$

Acceptance criteria were Positive control recoveries for rocked pierced packs $\pm 1 0 . 0 \%$ of Day 0. The minimum targets are 28 days for onboard stability and 14 days for calibration interval, as is claimed for the current Toxo G assay.

Results were as follows:

Pilot Lot 1 on System AR - All positive control recoveries were within $10 \%$ of Day 0 value up to (and including) Day 30, with a 14-day calibration interval Pilot Lot 2 on System AR - All positive control recoveries were within $10 \%$ of Day 0 value up to (and including) Day 30, with a 14-day calibration interval.

These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

During initial development of the ADVIA Centaur Toxo G (K012183), the clinical cut-off of the assay was established to be $1 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The assay was standardized and calibrators were value assigned in order to meet this cut-off. The device modifications did not impact standardization or calibrator value assignments, and did not alter method parameters (i.e. instructions to the instrument to run assay). Therefore, the cutoff of the Toxo G assay continues to be $1 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference:

The following substances were spiked into Toxo IgG nonreactive and reactive specimens:

 Human IgG (16 mg/mL)  Human IgG (25 mg/mL)  Low Protein (3.5 g/dL)  High Protein (12 g/dL)  Hemoglobin $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$  Conjugated Bilirubin $( 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$  Unconjugated Bilirubin $( 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$  Triglycerides $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 m g / d L } )$

Nine samples per interferent were tested for nonreactive specimens, and 27 samples per interferent were tested for reactive specimens. Testing was performed by measuring samples with and without spiked interferent, as calculated by the following equation:

$$
\% I n t e r f e r e n c e = S p i k e d / U n s p i k e d X I O O \%
$$

Testing was performed using Pilot Lot 3 of the revised version of the Toxo G assay, and Lot 68 of the current assay. For Toxo IgG reactive samples, the current and revised assay versions were compared by calculating the difference in percent interference using both methods.

The acceptance criteria were as follows:

Toxo IgG nonreactive samples - No change in interpretation from the current assay.

Toxo IgG reactive samples - Less than an average of $10 \%$ difference between the current and revised ADVIA Centaur Toxo G assay.

Results were as follows:

<table><tr><td>Substance</td><td>% Matching Current Assay Results (Nonreactive Samples)</td><td>Average % Difference from Current Assay (Reactive Samples)</td></tr><tr><td>Human IgG (16 mg/mL)</td><td>100</td><td>2.8</td></tr><tr><td>Human IgG (25 mg/mL)</td><td>100</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td>Low Protein (3.5 g/dL)</td><td>100</td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr><td>High Protein (12 g/dL)</td><td>100</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>Hemoglobin (500 mg/dL)</td><td>100</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Conjugated Bilirubin (40 mg/dL)</td><td>100</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Unconjugated Bilirubin (60 mg/dL)</td><td>100</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>Triglycerides (1000 mg/dL)</td><td>100</td><td>1.5</td></tr></table>

These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

Cross-Reactivity: The following cross-reacting samples were tested:

• ANA • AMA • HAMA • RF

Ten samples per cross-reacting substance were tested on one lot of the current Toxo G assay and three lots of the revised assay. Diagnostic interpretations, based on testing results, were compared across all lots.

The acceptance criterion, as defined by the sponsor, was that there was no change in interpretation from the current assay. These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

# Percent Agreement:

The performance of the ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma G assay was determined by testing a total of 1804 samples at three U.S. sites. The ADVIA Centaur results were compared to test results generated on a commercially available, automated toxoplasma IgG EIA. Five hundred fresh samples and 1304 frozen samples from the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States were used. The samples included the following populations: prenatal $( \mathrm { N } = 4 9 4 )$ ), asymptomatic blood donors $\left( \mathrm { N } = 4 1 8 \right)$ ), asymptomatic hospital patients $( \mathrm { N } = 8 0 6 )$ ), and 86 patients with confirmed toxoplasma IgG positive status. Positive status was determined utilizing a commercial EIA method. Of the 1804 specimens tested, 39 were equivocal by either the ADVIA Centaur or the predicate EIA. Discordant results were found on 32 specimens, which were further evaluated using other commercially available tests for toxoplasma IgG.

Positive Percent Agreement:

Using the alternative method, 388 tested positive for toxoplasma IgG antibody. Of the specimens that tested positive, 12 were equivocal, 363 were positive, and 13 were negative using the ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma G assay. The positive percent agreement was $9 6 . 5 \%$ .

# Negative Percent Agreement:

Using the alternative method, 1400 tested negative for toxoplasma IgG antibody. Of the specimens that tested negative, 11 were equivocal, 19 were positive, and 1370 were negative using the ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma G assay. The negative percent agreement was $9 8 . 6 \%$ . NOTE: Samples giving equivocal results were not included in the calculation of positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and total percent agreement.
