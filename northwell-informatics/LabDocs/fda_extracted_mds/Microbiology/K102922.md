# Device Trade Name

# HardyCHROMTM MRSA

# Intended Use

HardyCHROMTM MRSA is a selective and differential chromogenic medium recommended for the qualitative detection of nasal colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in health care settings. The test is performed on anterior nares swabs from patients and healthcare workers to screen for MRSA colonization. HardyCHROMTM MRSA is not intended to diagnose MRSA infection nor to guide or monitor therapy for MRSA infections. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for susceptibility testing or epidemiological typing. A negative result does not preclude MRSA nasal colonization.

# Device Description

HardyCHROMTM MRSA is translucent and light amber in color and contains chromogens that release chromophores when cleaved by enzymes produced by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. Based on colony color, HardyCHROMTM MRSA allows for the reliable detection of most MRSA from clinical specimens in less than 24 hours based on the appearance of a pink/magenta colored colony. NonMRSA strains are either inhibited by the addition of selective agents or utilize different chromogenic substrates in the media to produce different colored colonies. If none of the substrates are utilized, natural or white colored colonies will be present. If plates are negative for growth after 24 hours, it is recommended to re-incubate for an additional 24 hours.

# Summary of Performance Data

# Interference Studies

Substances that were expected to be associated with MRSA strains in a healthcare setting were evaluated for potential interference of the chromogenic reaction and growth of MRSA strains on HardyCHROMTM MRSA. To serve as a control for this portion of the study, growth was also evaluated on nonselective Trypticase Soy Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood (Blood Agar) plates and a commercial chromogenic MRSA medium. Testing included commonly used nasal sprays, bacterial transport devices, mucin, and human blood. Isolates used in these studies included ATCC® control strains of MRSA $\left( \mathbf { A T C C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } 3 3 5 9 \mathbb { I } \right.$ , ATCC 43300) and ten clinical well characterized clinical MRSA isolates. The mucin study also included ten well characterized clinical MSSA isolates. The clinical isolates (challenge strains) were obtained from a private culture collection. All isolates were coagulase positive and were characterized by PBP2' and cefoxitin $( 3 0 ~ \mu \varrho )$ testing.

# Interference Study Results - Nasal Sprays

Commonly used nasal sprays that contain a concentration of $1 \%$ Phenylephrine Hydrochloride did show an minimal inhibitory affect for microbial growth on the nonselective Blood Agar plates, the HardyCHROM™M MRSA plates, and the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium. Nasal sprays that did not contain this ingredient showed no interference for growth or chromogenic reactions. The sensitivity and specificity criteria of $2 9 8 \%$ were met for the HardyCHROMTM MRSA plates as compared to the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium and Blood Agar plates.

# Interference Study Results - Human Blood

Human blood could potentially be associated with MRSA strains in a healthcare setting and therefore was evaluated for potential interference of the chromogenic reaction and growth. Isolates used in this study included $\mathbf { A T C C } ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ control strains of MRSA $( \mathsf { A T C C } ^ { \otimes } 3 3 5 9 \mathsf { l }$ , $\mathsf { A T C C } ^ { \mathfrak { P } } 4 3 3 0 0 )$ and ten clinical well characterized clinical MRSA isolates. All strains were evaluated for growth and performance on HardyCHROMTM MRSA, a commercial chromogenic MRSA medium, and Blood Agar plates.

Results demonstrated that none of the MRSA strains were inhibited on the three types of media evaluated, and there was a $100 \%$ recovery rate for all strains after exposure to human blood. No discernible difference was observed between the growth and performance testing of HardyCHROMTM MRSA in comparison with nonselective blood agar plates and the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium.

# Interference Study Results - Mucin

Nasal swabs containing mucous or mucin were evaluated determine if there was an effect on the chromogenic reaction and the growth of MRSA strains. Isolates used in this study included ATCC® control strains of MRSA $\langle \mathbf { A } \mathbf { T C C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } 3 3 5 9 |$ $\mathsf { A T C C } ^ { \otimes } 4 3 3 0 0 )$ , ten clinical well characterized clinical MRSA isolates and ten well characterized clinical MSSA isolates.

All of the strains were evaluated for growth and performance on HardyCHROMTM MRSA and Blood Agar plates. No discernible differences were noted in performance testing of the MRSA strains when compared to the growth on the blood agar plates. Colonies of the MRSA strains grown on HardyCHROM MRSATM were typical for coloration and size. Counts were stable at 18 hours with no additional growth detected at 24 or 48 hours. All MSSA strains that were tested showed growth only on the blood agar plate and were completely inhibited at 24 and 48 hours on HardyCHROM MRSATM. The results of this study indicate that there is no inhibitory effect of mucin on growth and performance of HardyCHROM MRSATM medium.

# Interference Study Results - Transport Media

Various types of transport media expected to be associated with MRSA strains in a healthcare setting were evaluated for potential interference of the chromogenic reaction and growth. . Isolates used in this study included $\mathbf { A T C C ^ { \otimes } }$ control strains of MRSA (ATCC® 33591, $\mathsf { A T C C } ^ { \otimes } 4 3 3 0 0 )$ and ten clinical well characterized clinical MRSA isolates. All of the strains were evaluated for growth and performance on HardyCHROM™M MRSA, a commercial chromogenic MRSA medium, and Blood Agar plates. Testing included the following commonly used types transport media: Stuart's Gel, Stuart's Liquid, Amies Liquid, Amies Gel, and Amies Charcoal. Each transport device tested contained rayon-tipped, plastic shaft swabs.

Results demonstrated that none of the MRSA strains were inhibited on the three types of media evaluated, and there was a $100 \%$ recovery rate for all transport media devices tested. No discernible difference was observed between the growth and performance testing of HardyCHROMTM MRSA in comparison with nonselective blood agar plates and the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium.

# Cross-Reactivity Study

Common types of nasal flora were evaluated for growth and performance on nonselective blood agar plates, HardyCHROMTM MRSA, and a commercial chromogenic MRSA medium. Fresh suspensions were prepared in Tryptic Soy Broth at concentrations of approximately $1 0 ^ { 5 } 1 0 ^ { 1 0 ^ { 6 } }$ for the MRSA strains and $1 0 ^ { \dot { 6 } } 1 0 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ for non-MRSA strains. $1 0 \mu \mu \mu$ of these suspensions was used to inoculate the media. A total of 121 strains were tested and included the following genera: Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Candida, Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Leuconostoc, Micrococcus, Moraxella, Neisseria, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus and Staphylococus. Staphylococcus strains included MRSA, MSSA, and 20 different species of coagulase negative staphylococci (including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis). HardyCHROMTM MRSA and the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium showed no discernible difference for performance and growth.

Acceptance reproducibility rate of $5 9 9 \%$ for both inter-lot and overall testing intervals was achieved with the HardyCHROM™M MRSA media. On HardyCHROM™M MRSA medium all of the MRSA strains tested were detected with 24 hours following aerobic incubation at 35- $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ due to their unique pink to magenta colony coloration. Non-MRSA strains that were methicillin resistant either did not grow (i.e. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis) or produced blue-colored colonies (S. intermedius) that were easily discernible from MRSA strains based on colony color.

Corynebacterium jeikeium had breakthrough growth in the first quadrant at 24 hours with development of a dark purple colored film. Upon further incubation, small dark purple colored colonies were seen at 48 hours. Other strains of bacteria and yeast were inhibited by the selective agents included in the media.

# Recovery Study (Limit of Detection (LoD))

On HardyCHROMTM MRSA medium, MRSA strains tested were detected beginning at 16 hours with final counts being reported at 24 hours following aerobic incubation at $3 5 \textdegree$ . Pink to magenta colonies were detected on all dilutions at 16 hours and colony counts were stable from 21 to 24 hours with no increase in the number of colonies counted. All dilutions plated showed typical pink to magenta colony coloration. There was no significant difference in counts noted between the two observers.

Staphylococcus aureus ATCC® 43300 resulted in a $6 7 . 6 \%$ recovery when present at $1 0 ^ { 2 }$ concentration and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC® 33591 resulted in a $3 4 . 6 \%$ recovery at the same dilution. At $1 0 ^ { 1 }$ , there was $80 \%$ recovery and $5 2 . 3 \%$ recovery respectively. At $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ there was no discernible difference in recovery.

# Mixed Infection Study

Suspensions of the non-MRSA organisms (Staphylococcus aureus MSSA $\boldsymbol { \mathbf { A } } \mathrm { T C C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2 5 9 2 3$ and $E .$ coli $\mathtt { A T C C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2 5 9 2 2 )$ were prepared at $1 0 ^ { 8 }$ and $1 0 ^ { 9 }$ and mixed with suspensions of the MRSA strains (Staphylococcus aureus MRSA strains $\{ \mathbf { A } \mathbf { \hat { I C C } } ^ { \oplus } \ 3 3 5 9 1$ and 43300)) at the detection limit concentration $( 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ and plated in duplicate on Blood Agar and on HardyCHROMTM MRSA. On HardyCHROMTM MRSA medium, the MRSA strains tested were detected beginning at 16 hours with final counts being reported at 24 hours following aerobic incubation at $3 5 \textdegree C$ .Pink to magenta colonies were detected on all dilutions at 16 hours and colony counts were stable at 21 to 24 hours with no increase in the number of colony forming units (CFU) counted. All dilutions plated showed typical pink to magenta colony coloration and colony morphology was consistent with the MRSA strains. No breakthrough was noted of any of the non-MRSA strains. Plates were held for 48 hours and there was no change in CFU of MRSA strains nor was there any breakthrough of non-MRSA.

# Incubation Study

When compared to traditional culture, 127 of 132 positive MRSA cultures $( 9 6 . 2 \% )$ were detected on HardyCHROMTM MRSA at less than or equal to 24 hours. The remaining five MRSA isolates were detected at approximately 48 hours. All testing (clinical and in-house testing) was incubated aerobically (non- $C 0 _ { 2 } \mathrm { , }$ at 35 to 37 degrees C.

# Reproducibility Study with Characterized MRSA & MSSA strains

Reproducibility testing of HardyCHROM™M MRSA was conducted with twenty wellcharacterized test strains (fifteen MRSA strains that included Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) types USA100, USA200, USA300-0114, USA400, USA500, USA600, USA700, USA800, USA1000, USA1100, five a dditional MRSA strains that are representative of prevalent HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA, and five MSSA (including including Hypervirulent MSSA (NRS72) were selected from the most medically important S. aureus lineages(1-5). SF8300 is a wound isolate of pulse-field type USA300-0114, a subtype implicated in severe disease and in numerous outbreaks (). All of the characterized test strains were obtained from the University of San Francisco and DNA restriction patterns were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.

The fifteen strains of MRSA were tested using a suspension containing approximately $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ and the five strains of MSSA were tested at a concentration of approximately ${ 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 7 }$ .Ten $\mu \iota$ of these suspensions were inoculated onto HardyCHROMTM MRSA. The performance of the HardyCHROMTM MRSA at recovery rate (LoD) was not been evaluated.

Three different lots of HardyCHROM™M MRSA plates were tested to determine that the HardyCHROMTM MRSA plates reliably detected MRSA strains across different lots at different time intervals. A commercial chromogenic MRSA medium was also evaluated with the same strains and served as a performance standard.

Acceptance reproducibility rate of $100 \%$ for both inter-lot and overall testing intervals was achieved with the HardyCHROMTM MRSA plates media. All of the characterized MRSA strains showed growth and pink to magenta colony coloration within 24 hours following aerobic (non- $\mathbf { \bar { C O _ { 2 } } }$ incubation at $3 5 ^ { \circ } { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ All of the MSSA strains were inhibited with no growth evident after 24 and 48 hours of aerobic incubation at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .No discernible difference was observed between the performance testing of HardyCHROMTM MRSA in comparison with the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium.

# CLINICAL STUDIES

# Performance Data

HardyCHROMTM MRSA plates were evaluated at three geographically diverse hospitals and clinics using surveillance specimens of anterior nasal swab samples. A total of four hundred forty-three (443) samples were evaluated overall for this study. Positive and negative controls were tested each day of use. Clinical study sites reported the use of rayon tipped plastic shaft Stuart's gel without charcoal, Liquid Stuarts, Amies Charcoal. One test site reported the use of nylon flocked Amies Eswabs.

For the purpose of this study one nasal specimen swab was used to inoculate a Blood Agar plate first followed by a HardyCHROMTM MRSA plate. A second swab from the same patient was used to inoculate a plate of commercial chromogenic MRSA medium. All of the plates were incubated following standard lab procedures for the Blood Agar and the manufacturer's instructions for the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium and for HardyCHROMTM MRSA plates. Both types of chromogenic plates were incubated aerobically at $3 5 ^ { \circ } { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (non- $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ) and were read at both 24 and 48 hours of incubation.

Results from HardyCHROMTM MRSA plates after 24 hours of incubation were compared to the traditional culture method of Trypticase Soy Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood (Blood Agar). With the Blood Agar plates, colonies suspected to be S. aureus were confirmed with a StaphTEX latex agglutination test. Further testing to characterize colonies of MRSA was performed using a PBP2' test for the detection of penicillin-binding protein 2a and antibiotic disk diffusion methods using an oxacillin disk $( 1 \mu \ g )$ and also a cefoxitin disk $( 3 0 \mu \varrho )$ .Disk susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted according to CLSl guidelines contained in M100-S20. HardyCHROM™M MRSA plates were also compared with a commercial chromogenic MRsA medium for overall evaluation of growth and chromogenic performance.

# Quality Control

Quality control was performed by each of the three testing sites on receipt of each shipment of the medium and on each day of use. Fresh suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) $\mathbf { A T C C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } 4 3 3 0 0$ and Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) $\mathsf { A T C C } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2 5 9 2 3$ were prepared in Tryptic Soy Broth at concentrations of approximately $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { t o l } 0 ^ { 6 }$ for the MRSA strain and $1 0 ^ { 6 } 1 0 1 \bar { 0 } ^ { 7 }$ for MSSA. $\{ 0 \mu \}$ of these suspensions were used to inoculate HardyCHROMTM plates. Plates were incubated and examined for 24 and 48 hours for growth of the MRSA strain and inhibition of the MSSA strain. All QC results testing results provided expected reactions at each of the three testing sites on each day tested.

# Performance Compared to PBP2', Oxacillin, and Cefoxitin Disk Diffusion

HardyCHROMTm MRSA was also compared to other laboratory test methods commonly used to identify MRSA strains. In this study each clinical testing site evaluated pink/magenta colored colonies growing on the _HardyCHROMTM MRSA plates with PBP2' Latex agglutination. Cefoxitin disk $( 3 0 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ and oxacillin disk $( 1 \mu \ g )$ diffusion testing was performed to confirm results. Cefoxitin and oxacillin disk susceptibility was performed and interpreted according to CLSI M100-20. Interpretive zone sizes for oxacillin are $\geq 1 3$ (Susceptible), 11- 12 (Indeterminate), and ${ \le } 1 0$ (Resistant). Zone sizes for cefoxitin are ${ \ge } 2 2$ (Susceptible) and ${ \leq } 2 1$ (Resistant). No differences in the interpretation of susceptibility/resistance were noted between the two disk types.

Sensitivity and specificity compared to these additional methods are shown in Table 6  11.

# Reproducibility Testing in Clinical Laboratory Setting

Testing of HardyCHROMTM MRSA was evaluated at all three testing sites for three days in triplicate by three different operators using three different lots of media. The challenge strains were clinical isolates obtained from a private culture collection and included ten well characterized MRSA strains and ten well characterized MSSA strains. All isolates were coagulase positive and were characterized by PBP2' and cefoxitin testing. All of the isolates showed expected results.

Fresh suspensions of the well-characterized _clinical strains were prepared in Tryptic Soy Broth at concentrations of approximately $1 0 ^ { 5 } ~ { \mathrm { t o l } } 0 ^ { 6 }$ for the MRSA strains and $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { i } 0 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ for

MSSA strains. $1 0 \mu \up$ of these suspensions were used to inoculate HardyCHROMTM plates.   
The performance of the HardyCHROM™M MRSA at recovery rate (LoD) was not been evaluated.

A reproducibility rate of $100 \%$ for both inter-lot and overall testing intervals was achieved with the HardyCHROMTM MRSA media. At each clinical trial site, sensitivity was $100 \%$ for the MRSA strains tested with growth and formation of magenta colored colonies within 24 hours on HardyCHROMTM MRSA following aerobic (non- $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubation at $3 5 ^ { \circ } { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The specificity was $100 \%$ for MSSA strains which showed no growth after 48 hours of aerobic (non- $C O _ { 2 }$ incubation at $3 5 ^ { \circ } - 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

No discernible differences were observed between performance testing of HardyCHROM™M MRSA in comparison with the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium.

# Quality Control Results

Quality control results for both inter-lot and daily testing achieved a $100 \%$ acceptance rate with the HardyCHROMTM MRSA medium at each individual site and across all three clinical test sites. Quality control testing was performed upon receipt of the medium and on each day of testing. Fresh suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC® 43300 and Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) $\mathbf { A T C } \mathbf { \dot { C } } ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ 25923 were prepared in Tryptic Soy Broth at concentrations of approximately $1 0 ^ { 5 } 1 0 ^ { 1 } 0 ^ { 6 }$ for the MRSA strain and $1 0 ^ { 6 } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ for MSSA. $1 0 \mu \up$ of these suspensions were used to inoculate HardyCHROM™M plates. The control strain, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC® 43300 produced growth with typical magenta colony coloration within 24 hours on HardyCHROM™M MRSA following aerobic $\left( \mathsf { n o n - C O } _ { 2 } \right)$ incubation at $3 5 ^ { \circ } { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ . The control strain Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) ATCC® 25923 was inhibited and showed no growth after 48 hours aerobic (non- $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubation at $3 5 ^ { \circ } - 3 7 ^ { \circ }$ EY C.

# Statement of Efficacy and Safety

HardyCHROM™M MRSA was tested and compared to traditional culture identification and susceptibility methods as well as a commercial chromogenic MRSA medium. HardyCHROMTM MRSA demonstrated $9 3 . 3 \%$ agreement to traditional culture at 24 hours and $9 7 . 0 \%$ agreement at 48 hours for mecA mediated MRSA. Agreement was $9 9 . 7 \%$ for non-MRSA at both 24 and 48 hours. When compared to the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium, HardyCHROMTM MRSA demonstrated $9 8 . 3 \%$ agreement at 24 hours and $9 8 . 4 \%$ at 48 hours for mecA mediated MRSA and $9 7 . 5 \%$ agreement at 24 hours and $9 6 . 9 \%$ agreement for non-MRSA at 48 hours.

Agreement with PBP2', cefoxitin $( 3 0 \mu \ g )$ and oxacillin $( 1 \mu \ g )$ disk testing was $9 3 . 3 \%$ at 24 hours and $9 7 . 0 \%$ at 48 hours for mecA mediated MRSA. Percent agreement was $9 9 . 7 \%$ for non-MRSA at both 24 and 48 hours.

# Indication for Use Statement

510(k) Number (if known): K102922

Device Name: HardyCHROMTM MRSA

Indication for Use:

HardyCHROMTM MRSA is a selective and differential chromogenic medium recommended for the qualitative detection of nasal colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in health care settings. The test is performed on anterior nares swabs from patients and healthcare workers to screen for MRSA colonization. HardyCHROMTM MRSA is not intended to diagnose MRSA infection nor to guide or monitor therapy for MRSA infections. Concomitant cultures are necessary for susceptibility testing or epidemiological typing. A negative result does not preclude MRSA nasal colonization.
