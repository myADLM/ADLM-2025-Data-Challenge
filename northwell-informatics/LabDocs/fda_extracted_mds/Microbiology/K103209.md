# Performance Characteristics of the RV+ Test

Analytical and methods comparison studies to establish the performance of the test on the Verigene System were performed.

A.Analytical Studies for the ${ \mathsf { R V } } +$ Test - Overview

In order to establish analytical performance characteristics of the $\mathsf { R V } +$ , various analytical studies were conducted by following recommendations delineated in FDA Guidance Documents. The studies included Analytical Sensitivity Determination, Analytical Reactivity Studies, Analytical Specificity Studies, Interference Studies, Competitive Inhibition Studies, Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination Studies, Fresh-vsFrozen Comparison Studies, and Assay Design and Cut-Off Determination. The results from these studies supported a claim of safety and effectiveness and support the proposed labeling of the ${ \mathsf { R V } } +$ .

B. Methods Comparison Studies for the RV+ Test

A Methods Comparison study was conducted at three sites. The study was conducted under IRB supervision.

The Verigene System, including the Verigene Processor $s P$ , the Verigene Reader, the Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus Nucleic Acid Test Cartridges $( R V + )$ , Amplification Trays and Extraction Trays used inemethods comparison studies were identical tothe devices ntended ormarket with respect he functional features and reagent composition.

Clinical samples for methods comparison study were collected prospectively at three collection hospital sites during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 respiratory seasons. Each site saved prospectively-collected residual specimens that were then de-identified on-site, frozen at $\boldsymbol { \cdot } 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , and shipped on dry ice to Nanosphere. Nanosphere stored the specimens at $\boldsymbol { \cdot } 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , labeled the specimens with a random number generatenique entifir whiremoving he collectin se dentifer, and shipped the specimens to he testing sites overnight on dry ice.The sites stored the specimens at $\boldsymbol { \cdot } 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ before and after testing.

One thousand and twenty-two (1022) prospectively-collected specimens were tested at the three external study sites. All tests were performed by laboratory personnel using the $\mathsf { R V } +$ on the Verigene System. The Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV results in the methods comparison study were compared to results obtained for the samples using culture-based methods confirmed with a FDA-cleared DFA test. Influenza A subtyping and RSV subtyping results were compared to results obtained for the specimens utilizing bidirectional sequencing.Discordant results were resolved utilizing bi-directional sequencing and/or the NAAT. Seven (7) samples that were deemed discrepant for the $\mathsf { R V } +$ test compared to culture/DFA were tested on the NAAT for further clarification of results.

The age distribution of the 1022 samples tested during the methods comparison study is presented below.

During the methods comparison study, across al three sites, there were a total of 25 processing errors $( 2 . 4 \% = 2 5 / 1 0 2 2 )$ ("pre-analysis error" (pre-ae] results). There were 34 initial "no call" results $( 3 . 3 \% = 3 4 / 1 0 2 2 )$ .Both the "no call" and "pre-ae" specimens were repeated and only 2 resulted in a final "no call" result $( 0 . 2 \% = 2 / 1 0 2 2 )$

Combined results for the method comparison study across the three sites are presented below. They reflect the results after all"no call" results were repeated per the protocol and the proposed package insert guidance. Results from the ${ \mathsf { R V } } +$ were initially compared to results from culture-based - DFA methods and the NAAT test.Bi-directional sequencing was used to subtype Influenza A, differentiate RSV A and RSV B, and for discordant testing. The tables show results for Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV both compared to culture-based methods and the NAAT and after resolution using sequencing. RSV A and RSV B results are shown after resolution by sequencing.

Percent positive and negative agreement for each table are provided as well as the lower and upper twosided $9 5 \%$ confidence limits that were calculated using the exact binomial method.

# C.Reproducibility/Precision Studies for the $R V +$ Test

The Reproducibility/Precision study was conducted at three sites (two external and one internal) to gate he nte-atory pucbily  eRVThe eprucibily panes  ab ow were developed by using 6 unique virus strains that together represented all of the analytes in the RV+. The 6 virus strains were combined to generate combinations such that each virus strain was represented at 3 levels: HN- High Negative, LP - Low Positive, and MP - Moderate Positive. For two of the unique samples, virus strains were combined as in the case of INFAH3 and RSVA and Influenza B and RSV B. For the Reproducibility/Precision study, the Test Panel comprised the 12 unique samples in duplicate for a total of 24 samples. The Test Panel samples were then divided equally into Panel A (12 samples) and Panel B (12 samples).

At the two external study sites, Test Panel A and Test Panel B were tested on separate days. Testing ea day involved 2 operators testing the same Test Panel in two replicate runs. Both Test Panels A and B were tested for a total testing period of six non-consecutive days.

The internal site ran a 12-day precision study and utilized the same four unique samples at the three levels. The complete Test Panel (Test Panel A and B) was tested separately by two operators each day. The precision study was run for a total testing period of 12 non-consecutive days.The cumulative reults fr the Reproducibility/Precision Studies are summarizedData is presented or each individual si n then combined to provide collective results.
