3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: None

# I. Device Description:

The GIARDIA/CRYPTOSPORIDIUM QUIK CHEK™ test device contains 25 pouches, each containing a membrane filter pad. Each device has a Reaction Window with three vertical lines of immobilized antibodies. The Giardia test line (“Giar”) contains mouse monoclonal antibodies against Giardia. The Crypto test line (“Cryp”) contains mouse monoclonal antibodies against Cryptosporidium. The control line $( ^ { 6 6 } \mathbf { C } ^ { 7 } )$ is a dotted line that contains anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies. The

Conjugate consists of polyclonal antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The antigen-antibody-conjugate complexes migrate through a filter pad to a membrane where they are captured by the immobilized Giardia and/or Cryptosporidium-specific antibodies in the test lines. After addition of substrate and proper incubation, the reaction is examined visually for the appearance of a vertical blue line on either side of the Reaction Window. A blue line indicates a positive test. A positive “control” reaction, indicated by a vertical dotted blue line under the “C” portion of the Reaction Window, confirms that the test is working properly and the results are valid.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The GIARDIA/CRYPTOSPORIDIUM QUIK CHEK™ test is a membrane enzyme immunoassay that uses monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to cell-surface antigens of the organisms. The polyclonal antibodies are coupled to horseradish peroxidase which are contained in the diluent. Specific mouse monoclonal antibodies against Giardia and Cryptosporidium antigens are bound on different location of the membrane. A fecal specimen is added to the diluent and transferred to the sample well and incubated. During the incubation, cyst and/or oocyst antigens in the sample bind the antibody-peroxidase conjugates. The antigen-antibody-conjugate complexes migrate through a filter pad to a membrane where they are captured by the immobilized Giardia and/or Cryptosporidium-specific antibodies in the test lines.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A total of 22 fecal specimens were pre-characterized by commercially available predicate devices. The samples included six Giardia-positive specimens (three mid-range positives), six Cryptosporidium-positive specimens (three low positives), and four Giardia/Cryptosporidium-positive specimens (two of which were low Giardia-positives and two of which were low Cryptosporidium-positives), and six specimens negative for both parasites. All specimens were coded to prevent their identification during testing. Testing was performed at three sites. The samples were tested, twice a day over a 5-day period by multiple technicians at each site using two different kit lots. A positive and negative control was run with each panel of the masked samples. The results were consistent among the different locations, and exhibited a correlation of $100 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Not applicable.

d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity of the GIARDIA/CRYPTOSPORIDIUM QUIK CHEK test was determined by spiking various dilutions of purified Giardia cysts or Cryptosporidium oocysts into negative human stool. The cyst/oocyst preparations were quantified using the reference assay of IFA microscopy. Test results determined the limit of detection to be 6000 Giardia cysts per mL (133 cysts/test) and 6000 Cryptosporidium oocysts/mL (133 cysts/test).

e. Analytical specificity:

b. Clinical specificity: See section M.3.a   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Normal healthy individuals should not be infected with Giardia or Cryptosporidium and should test negative in the GIARDIA/CRYPTOSPORIDIUM QUIK CHEK test. A positive test result in the GIARDIA/CRYPTOSPORIDIUM QUIK CHEK test indicates that the person is shedding detectable amounts of Giardia and/or Cryptosporidium antigen. The incidence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium infection varies significantly between populations and geographic regions. Children in daycare settings have exhibited higher rates of infection with Giardia than the normal population. In addition, homosexual men have shown higher rates of infection. In general, laboratory-confirmed incidence of cryptosporidiosis in developed countries ranges from 1 to $2 \%$ overall with a higher incidence in children.

Prospective studies to evaluate the GIARDIA/CRYPTOSPORIDIUM QUIK CHEK test were conducted at an Asian hospital specializing in diarrheal diseases. The studies included 129 freshly collected fecal specimens. A positive test result in the

GIARDIA/CRYPTOSPORIDIUM QUIK CHEK test was obtained in $2 2 . 5 \%$ for Giardia and in $5 . 4 \%$ for Cryptosporidium antigen.
