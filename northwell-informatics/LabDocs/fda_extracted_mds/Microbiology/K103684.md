Recovery Study The minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect TM is $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

To determine the percent recovery for the VRESelect TM media a panel of eighteen vancomycin-resistant enterococci - 8 VREfm and 10 VREfs - were tested at varying dilutions. For each strain to be tested a 0.5 MFr antreeSepla n  BlooarplatTe pla cba $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ambient air and read at 24 and 28 hours. The color and number of colonies were recorded. The Blood Agar plates were used to confirm the inoculum concentration at each dilution. Data confirmed that the minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect TM is $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

# Reproducibility

In order to confirm the reproducibility of the VRESelect™ medum a blinded panel of 6 ATCC reference strains (2 VREfs, 3 VREfm, and 1 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus) were tested at three sites. At each site three pan  c  T results with VRESelecrTM $100 \%$ of the time at 24 and 28 hours.

Dear Ms. White:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactmient date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such aitnal conolExis aor gulatns ffeig your device an  un T, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with allthe Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450.Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97).

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): K103684

Device Name: VRESelect ™M Culture Media

Indications for Use:

VRESelect TM is a selective and differential chromogenic medium, containing $8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ of vancomycin, for the qualitative detection of gastrointestinal colonization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs) and to aid in the prevention and control of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in healthcare settings. The test is performed on rectal swabs from patients to be screened for VRE colonization. VRESelect TM is not intended to diagnose VRE infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of infection. Results can be interpreted after 24 to 28 hours incubation. Subculture to non-selective media (e.g., trypticase soy agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood) is need for susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.
