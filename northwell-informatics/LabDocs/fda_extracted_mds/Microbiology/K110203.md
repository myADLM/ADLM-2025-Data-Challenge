# Device Description:

The Cepheid Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of toxin producing Clostridium difficile directly from unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens of patients suspected of having Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The assay detects the toxin B gene $( t c d B )$ , the binary toxin gene (CDT), and the single base pair deletion at nucleotide 117 within the gene encoding a negative regulator of toxin production (tcdCΔ117). The combined presence of the genes encoding toxin B and binary toxin and the tcdCA117 deletion have been associated with a

# CONFIDENTIAL

hypervirulent C. difficile strain known as 027/NAP1/BI, which has been associated with severe disease outbreaks in healthcare facilities worldwide. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Dx System.

The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay system performs sample preparation and real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of target-specific DNA.

The GeneXpert Dx System consists of a GeneXpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ instrument, personal computer, and disposable fluidic cartridges. Each instrument contains 1-16 randomly accessible modules that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR tests for detection of C. difficile toxin B and binary toxin gene sequences, and the tcdCA117 deletion, in less than 45 minutes. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and I-CORE $\otimes$ EY thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.

A swab is inserted into the stool specimen and then is placed in a tube containing elution reagent. Following brief vortexing, the eluted material and two single-use reagents (Reagent 1 and Reagent 2) that are provided with the Assay are transferred to different, uniquely-labeled chambers of the disposable fluidic cartridge (the Xpert C. difficile/Epi cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Dx System instrument platform, which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of DNA. In this platform, additional sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fullyautomated and completely integrated.

The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay includes reagents for the detection of toxigenic $C .$ difficile and the presumptive detection of sequences found in 027/NAP1/BI strains. In addition, the assay reagents include an internal sample processing control (SPC) to ensure adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR Assay. The SPC also ensures that the PCR conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the PCR reagents are functional. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

# Device Intended Use:

The Cepheid Xpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ C. difficile/Epi Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for rapid detection of toxin B gene sequences and for presumptive identification of 027/NAP1/BI strains of toxigenic Clostridium difficile from unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens collected from patients suspected of having C. difficile infection (CDI). Presumptive identification of 027/NAP1/BI strains of C. difficile is by detection of binary toxin (CDT) gene sequences and the single base pair deletion at nucleotide 117 in the tcdC gene. The tcdC gene encodes for a negative regulator in C. difficile toxin production. The test is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Dx System and utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect toxin gene sequences associated with toxin producing C. difficile. The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay is intended

# CONFIDENTIAL

as an aid in the diagnosis of CDI. Detection of 027/NAP1/BI strains of C. difficile by the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay is presumptive and is solely for epidemiological purposes and is not intended to guide or monitor treatment for C. difficile infections. Concomitant culture is necessary only if further typing or organism recovery is required.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay is substantially equivalent to the Cepheid Xpert C. difficile Assay and the BD Diagnostics GeneOhm Cdiff Assay. All three assays qualitatively detect C. difficile toxin B gene (tcdB) in unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens and use real-time PCR amplification and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization detection.

Table 5.1 shows the similarities and differencs between the Xpert C. ifile/Epi Assy and the predicate devices.

The Xpert C. difficile/Epi is also substantially equivalent to the C. difficile reference culture method followed with strain identification of all C. difficile isolates as shown in a multi-center clinical comparison study.

The multi-center clinical comparison study was conducted on 2293 patients to evaluate the performance of the Xpert C. difficile Assay relative to the reference culture method and cytotoxin B isolate testing. Following culture testing, the toxigenic C. difficile isolates were sent to three central laboratories for strain typing by PCR Ribotyping, PFGE and REA methods for the identification of 027/NAP1/BI hypervirulent strains.

The test results showed the Xpert C. difficile Assay to be substantially equivalent to the current standard of care, the C. difficile reference culture method followed with strain identification of all toxigenic C. difficile isolates.

# Analytical Inclusivity

The analytical inclusivity of the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay was determined using 13 Clostridium difficile strains of different toxinotypes selected to represent the range of genetic diversity found in C. difficile. Toxinotypes O, I, III, IV, V, VI, VIII, IX, X, XII, XIV, XXI, and XXII were tested. All strains were tested in triplicate with 900 CFU/swab. All tested toxinotypes were correctly reported as Toxigenic C. difficile positive. In addition, all strains were reported either as 027/NAP1/BI presumptive negative or presumptive positive. In three toxinotypes X, IV and XIV, one to three replicates were incorrectly reported as 027/NAP1/BI presumptive positive, respectively. All other strains were correctly identified as 027/NAP1/BI presumptive positive or negative.

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)

Studies were performed to determine the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of C. difficile diluted into a fecal matrix of human origin that can be detected by the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay. The fecal matrix consisted of human liquid feces (C. difficile negative by Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay) diluted in PBS with $1 5 \%$ E glycerol. The LoD is defined as the lowest number of colony forming units (CFU) per swab that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence.

Replicates of 20 were evaluated at each C. difficile concentration tested (CFU/swab) for 7 different C. difficile strains representing toxinotypes 0 (two strains), III (two strains), IV, V and VIII (one of each strain).

The estimate and confidence intervals were determined using logistic regression with data (number of positive results per number of replicates at each level) over the range of CFU loadings. The confidence intervals were determined using maximum likelihood estimates on the logistic model parameters using the large sample variance-covariance matrix. The LoD point estimates and $9 5 \%$ upper and lower confidence intervals for each C. difficile toxinotype tested are summarized in Table 5.2.

The results of this study indicate that the Xpert $C .$ difficile/Epi Assay will produce a positive C. difficile result $9 5 \%$ of the time for a fecal sample containing 460 CFU/swab and a presumptive positive 027/NAP1/BI result $9 5 \%$ of the time for a swab containing 75 CFU.

In addition to the LoD determination, eighteen C. difficile strains representing toxinotypes 0 plus 12 variant toxinotypes, including four 027/NAP1/BI toxinotype III isolates, were tested using the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay. C. difficile strains were selected to broadly represent the majority of C. difficile toxinotypes encountered in practice. Stock cultures were prepared by suspending the bacterial growth from agar plates in PBS buffer containing $1 5 \%$ glycerol. The concentration of each stock was adjusted to 1.4-5.9 McFarland units. All strains were serially diluted to approximately 900 CFU/swab and tested in triplicate.

Under the conditions of this study, the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay correctly identified all 18 strains tested as "Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE". Included in the panel were 8 toxinotypes reported to be positive for binary toxin (CDT) production as well. All were CDT positive using the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay. All four 027/NAP1/BI isolates representing toxinotype III were correctly identified as "Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE; 027-NAP1-BI PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE".

# Linearity

A study was conducted to define the reportable range of the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay and demonstrated a linear relationship.

# Analytical Specificity

Fifty-five (55) strains were collected, quantitated and tested using the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay. The strains originated from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Culture Collection University of Göteborg (CCUG), German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Institute of Public Health, Maribor, Slovenia and Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI).

Of the tested species, ten (10) non-toxigenic C. difficile strains and eleven (1 1) non $C .$ difficile Clostridium species were included. The organisms tested were identified as either Gram positive (37) or Gram negative (18). The organisms were further classified as aerobic (24), anaerobic (29) or microaerophilic (2).

Each strain was tested in triplicate at concentrations ranging from $1 . 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ to $2 . 2 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 1 0 }$ . Positive and negative controls were included in the study. Under the conditions of the study, all isolates were reported "Toxigenic C. diff NEGATIVE; 027/NAP1/BI PRESUMPTIVE NEG". The analytical specificity was $100 \%$ .

# Interfering Substances

Twenty-one (21) biological and chemical substances occasionally used or found in stool specimens were tested for interference with the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay. Potentially interfering substances include, but are not limited to, Vagisil cream and zinc oxide paste. The 19 substances listed in Table 5.3 showed no detectable interference with the Xpert $C .$ difficile/Epi Assay.

# Clinical Studies

# Clinical Comparison Study

Performance characteristics of the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay were determined in a multi-site prospective investigation study at seven US and Canadian institutions by comparing the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay to reference culture followed by cell cytotoxicity testing on the isolates and strain typing on the toxigenic strains by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and PCR ribotyping methods.

Subjects included individuals whose routine care called for C. difficile testing. A portion of each leftover unformed stool specimen was obtained for testing by the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay. The remaining excess specimen was sent to a central laboratory for reference culture and cytotoxin B isolate testing. Each stool specimen was inoculated onto pre-reduced CCFA-D (cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar -direct plate) and Cycloserine cefoxitin mannitol broth with taurocholate lysozyme cysteine (CCMB-TAL). After 24 hours the CCMB-TAL was subcultured on to a second CCFA-E plate (CCFAEnriched). This direct-enriched culture method is referred to hereafter as "reference culture".

If C. difficile was isolated from the CCFA-D plate and the isolate was positive by cell cytotoxicity assay, the specimen was classified as "toxigenic C. difficile positive" and CCFA-E plate was not further analyzed. If no C. difficile was isolated from the CCFA-D plate or if the isolate was negative by cell cytotoxicity assay, the CCFA-E plate was further analyzed.

If CCFA-E was positive for C. difficile and the isolate was positive for cell cytotoxicity assay, the specimen was classified as "toxigenic C. difficile positive". The specimen was reported as "negative" if CCFA-E was negative for C. difficile or the isolate was tested negative by cell cytotoxicity assay.

Following central culture testing, the toxigenic C. difficile positive isolates were sent to a second set of central laboratories for strain identification by REA, PFGE and PCR ribotyping.

Performance of the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay was calculated relative to the results of direct culture with strain typing, for each of the three strain typing methods, and reference culture with strain typing, for each of the three strain typing methods.

# Overall Results

A total of 2293 specimens were tested by Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay, culture, and strain typing.

Performance vs. Direct Culture

Relative to direct culture with REA strain typing, the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity for toxigenic C. difficile of $9 8 . 7 2 \%$ and $9 0 . 8 6 \%$ , respectively. The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay also demonstrated $9 8 . 5 5 \%$ positive agreement and $9 7 . 6 5 \%$ negative agreement for BI (Table 5.4).

# Performance vs. Reference Culture

Reference (enriched) culture is a more sensitive method for detection of C. difficile in symptomatic patients, for example it allows detection of low number of organism due to prior antibiotic treatment and potential loss of viability due to specimen transport.

Relative to reference culture with REA strain typing, the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity for toxigenic C. difficile of $9 3 . 3 5 \%$ and $9 4 . 0 2 \%$ , respectively. The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay also demonstrated $9 6 . 5 1 \%$ positive agreement and $9 8 . 3 1 \%$ negative agreement for BI (Table 5.7).

# 4.0 Indications for Use Form

510(k) Number (if known): _K110203

Device Name: Xpert® C. difficile/Epi Assay

Indications for Use:

The Cepheid Xpert® C. difficile/Epi Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for rapid detection of toxin B gene sequences and for presumptive identification of 027/NAP1/BI strains of toxigenic Clostridium difficile from unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens collected from patients suspected of having C. difficile infection (CDI). Presumptive identification of 027/NAP1/BI strains of C. difficile is by detection of binary toxin (CDT) gene sequences and the single base pair deletion at nucleotide 117 in the tcdC gene. The tcdC gene encodes for a negative regulator in C. difficile toxin production. The test is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Dx System and utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect toxin gene sequences associated with toxin producing C. difficile. The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of CDI. Detection of 027/NAP1/BI strains of C. difficile by the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay is presumptive and is solely for epidemiological purposes and is not intended to guide or monitor treatment for C. difficile infections. Concomitant culture is necessary only if further typing or organism recovery is required.
