# L Test Principle:

Premier C. difficile GDH is a qualitative enzyme immunoassay screening test to detect Clostridium difficile antigen, glutamate dehydrogenase, in fecal specimens from symptomatic persons suspected of having C. difficile infection (CDI). Breakaway microwells are coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-GDH antibodies. Diluted patient specimen and a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-GDH antibody are added to the microwells and incubated to allow any antigen in the patient sample to bind the antibody conjugate and the immobilized microwell antibody. Upon completion of the incubation, a wash step is performed to remove unbound material. If C. difficile GDH is present, an antibody-enzyme complex is formed. A chromogenic substrate is added to the microwells and incubated. A blue color develops in the presence of bound enzyme. Stop solution is added, changing the initial blue reaction to yellow. Test results are interpreted spectrophotometrically.

Premier C. difficile GDH is based on the well-established, widely used microplate enzyme immunoassay platform. The predicate device, TECHLAB C. DIFF CHEK-60, is also built on this platform.

Premier C. difficile GDH Positive Control: Non-toxigenic C. difficile strain 11186 is grown in liquid media, harvested, and filtered to remove organisms. Bulk manufacture of Positive Control includes dilution of C. difficile GDH antigen in a buffered protein solution containing Gentamicin and ProClinTM as preservatives.

Rabbit polyclonal anti- $C .$ . difficile Common Antigen antibody is used in the manufacture of Premier $C .$ . difficile GDH Enzyme Conjugate and Premier C. difficile GDH Microwells. The antibody is specific for $C .$ . difficile Common Antigen (GDH) and is internally manufactured at Meridian Bioscience. The antibody is purified using Protein-A, and is qualified for use by Meridian using internally qualified enzyme immunoassay (EIA) methods.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Reproducibility:

Reproducibility studies were performed by three clinical laboratories using blind coded panels. Samples were randomly sorted within each panel to mask identities. Each panel consisted of three contrived moderately positive specimens, three contrived low-positive specimens, three contrived high-negative specimens, and one natural negative specimen. The moderately-positive, low-positive, and high-negative samples were prepared from negative stool spiked with C. difficile GDH antigen. Panels were tested at three independent laboratories by two operators at each laboratory, twice each day over 5 non-consecutive days. Results were read at single $\mathrm { ( O D } _ { 4 5 0 } \mathrm { ) }$ ) and dual $\mathrm { ( O D _ { 4 5 0 / 6 3 0 } ) }$ wavelengths. The expected results were obtained with all samples by all technologists at all test sites at each time interval. Reproducibility of the assay is $100 \%$ for moderate positives, low-positives, high-negatives, and weak negatives.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): No calibrators are supplied or used with this assay.

# External Controls:

Two External Control reagents are included with the Premier C. difficile GDH assay. External Controls aid the user in detection of reagent deterioration, adverse environmental or test conditions, washing failures, or variance in operator performance that can cause test errors. External Controls are required for routine Quality Control and should be included with each test run.

Positive Control: C. difficile GDH antigen is in a buffered protein solution containing $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$

and

$0 . 0 3 \%$ gentamicin as preservatives. Non-toxigenic C. difficile 11186 is grown in liquid media, harvested, and filtered to remove organisms. Bulk manufacture of Positive Control includes dilution of $C .$ . difficile antigen in a buffered protein solution containing Gentamicin and $\mathrm { P r o C l i n @ }$ as preservatives. Negative Control: Buffered protein solution containing $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ and $0 . 0 3 \%$ Gentamicin as preservatives.

# Storage Conditions:

A Sample Storage study was designed to verify the adequacy of the sample age, preservation, handling, and storage criteria included in the Premier C. difficile GDH package insert. Aliquots of unpreserved contrived positive and negative samples were stored at the following temperatures to determine the worst case storage time for each temperature range: room (19-30 C), refrigerated (2-8 C), conventional freezer (-16 to -28 C), and ultralow freezer (-66 to -84 C). A total of 10 samples were tested, with the Limit of Detect (LoD), Low Positive (LP), and High Negative (HN) samples consisting of manufactured specimens. Results suggest that the Control reagents should optimally be stored at 2-8 C when not in use.

# Stability:

Dating is provisionally set with data derived from accelerated stability studies. Results are confirmed with real-time shelf-life studies. Accelerated Stability performed with three lots of Positive and Negative Controls has verified the stability for at least 18 months under normal conditions of use and storage. Real-time studies are ongoing.

# Expected Values:

Expected Values for $\mathrm { O D } _ { 4 5 0 }$

Positive Control: $\geq 0 . 6 0 0$ Negative Control: ${ < } 0 . 1 5 0$

Expected Values for $\mathrm { O D } _ { 4 5 0 / 6 3 0 }$

Positive Control: $\geq 0 . 6 0 0$

# Validation:

The performance of the Positive and Negative Controls was validated as part of clinical trials.

# d. Detection limit:

In order to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of $C .$ . difficile GDH antigen diluted in a human stool matrix, purified GDH antigen was spiked into negative stool matrix and diluted serially two-fold. A minimum of 45 replicates of each concentration were tested to determine the concentration that represents the Limit of Blank, or the dilution that produces approximately $50 \%$ positive and $50 \%$ negative results. The next higher two-fold concentration from the Limit of Blank that produced a minimum of $9 5 \%$ positive results was determined to be the Limit of Detection. The next lower two-fold concentration from the Limit of Blank that produced a minimum of $9 5 \%$ negative results was determined to be the High Negative value.

Results: Limit of Blank $\it { \Delta } = 4 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Limit of Detection $= 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ High Negative $= 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference Studies:

Selected drugs and other non-microbial substances that might be present in stool samples from healthy persons or patients suspected of having C. difficile associated disease were added to three negative stool samples and three positive stool samples. The contrived positive specimens were prepared from a pool of donor stools that were confirmed as negative. The samples were inoculated with $C .$ . difficile strain 11186 at 8 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , which is the limit of detection for this assay. Potentially interfering substances were added at final concentrations of $5 \% \mathrm { V / V }$ or greater. Dilution Controls for each sample were prepared by adding a phosphate-buffered saline solution in place of the potentially interfering substance. Each sample was tested in triplicate.

The following substances, at the specified saturated solvent/diluent concentrations, do not interfere with Premier $C .$ difficile GDH test results in the final concentrations listed: Barium sulfate $( 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), Fecal fat $2 . 6 5 \mathrm { m g }$ stearic acid and $1 . 3 \mathrm { m g }$ palmitic acid/mL), Hemoglobin $( 3 . 2 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), Imodium $\mathbf { A D } @$ (Loperamide HCl) $( 6 . 6 7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ $\mathrm { m g / m L ) }$ , Kaopectate $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (Bismuth subsalicylate) $\mathrm { 0 . 8 7 \ m g / m L ) }$ , Metronidazole (12.5 $\mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), Mucin ( $3 . 3 3 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ , Mylanta $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (Aluminum hydroxide w/ magnesium hydroxide) $( 4 . 2 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), Pepto-Bismol $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (Bismuth subsalicylate) $( 0 . 8 7 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , Polyethylene glycol $( 7 9 . 0 5 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ), Prilosec $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (Omeprazole) $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), Simethicone $( 0 . 6 2 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ), Tagamet $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (Cimetidine) $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , Tums $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (Calcium carbonate) $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ , Vancomycin HCl $( 2 . 5 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ), Whole blood $( 2 5 \% )$ , White

blood cells $( 5 \% )$

# Cross-reactivity Studies:

Potentially cross-reactive microorganisms that might be present in stool samples from healthy persons or patients suspected of having $C .$ . difficile associated disease were added to a natural negative and contrived positive sample. The contrived positive specimens were prepared from a pool of donor stools that was confirmed negative. The contrived positive sample was prepared by spiking a confirmed negative sample with $C .$ difficile strain 11186 at $8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , which is the limit of detection for this assay. Potentially cross-reactive microorganisms were added at final concentrations of $1 . 2 \mathrm { x }$ $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / \mathrm { m L } }$ (bacteria or fungi) or final concentrations greater than $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ (viruses). Dilution controls for each sample were prepared by adding a $0 . 8 5 \%$ saline solution in place of the potentially cross-reactive organisms.

The following microorganisms, at the indicated concentrations, do not interfere with Premier C. difficile GDH test results: Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacteroides fragilis, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter fetus, Campylobacter jejuni, Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium tetani, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Escherichia hermannii, Escherichia fergusonii, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactococcus lactis, Listeria monocytogenes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Porphyromonas asaccharolyctica, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella Group B, Salmonella Group C, Salmonella Group D, Salmonella Group E, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Shigella boydii, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Adenovirus Type 40, Adenovirus Type 41, Coxsackievirus Strain B4, Echovirus Strain 11, Rotavirus Strain WA.

Stools spiked with Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan strain I) and Clostridium sporogenes were found to be cross-reactive with Premier C. difficile GDH.

# Strain Reactivity Studies:

C. difficile stock cultures from different sources were tested and produced positive reactions at a concentration of $5 . 7 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ cells/mL with the Premier C. difficile GDH assay. Strains tested were as follows: 8864, 10463, 43598, 2004052, 2004111, 2004118, 2004205, 2004206, 2005070, 2005257, 2005325, 2006240, 2007431, 2007435, 2007858, 2008016, 2008029, 2008162, 2008188, 2008341, 2008351, 2009018, 2009065, 2009066, 2009099, 2009132, 2009155, 2009277, 11186, B1, BI8, BI17, BK6, CF1, G1, J7, K12, Y1, 234, 586, 611, 620, 2C62, 2C165, C122, UNC 19904, X15076.
