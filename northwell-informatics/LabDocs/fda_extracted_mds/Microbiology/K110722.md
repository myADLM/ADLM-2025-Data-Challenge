# 5.5 Device Description

Components

The RPS Adeno Detector Plus ™ consists of three (3) parts: a Sample Collector, an immunoassay test strip in a plastic Test Cassette housing, and a Buffer. The Sample Collector is used to take a sample of ocular fluid. The separately packaged and sterile Sample Collector has a contoured end with a Dacron fleece to collect the samples. The plastic housing of the Test Cassette body protects the strip from unintended physical influence. Additionally the housing guarantees correct sample transfer onto the lateral flow assay strip. The Buffer is a buffered salt solution containing proteins, detergents and preservatives. The Buffer functions as the solution that initiates the test, extracts the Adenoviral

proteins, filters unwanted cellular debris, and transports the immune complex and the control conjugate to the Test and Control Lines on the test strip membrane.

# Mechanism of action -

RPS Adeno Detector Plus ™m is based on the principle of lateral flow immunoassays using Direct Sampling Micro-filtration technology. Viral particles or virus antigens are captured by an antigen specific antibody. A single monoclonal antibody highly specific to the Adenoviral hexon protein is labeled with colloidal gold and also is immobilized as the Test Line.

The speed and simplicity of the test enables more appropriate and timely treatment for the patient.

# 5.6 Intended Use

The RPS Adeno Detector Plus is a rapid immunoassay test for the visual, qualitative in vitro detection of Adenoviral antigens (hexon protein) directly from human eye fluid. The test is intended for professional use as an aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of acute conjunctivitis.

Negative results do not preclude Adenovirus infection nor are they intended to rule out other microbial-caused infections of the conjunctiva, and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions.

# 5.7 Substantial Equivalence

RPS Adeno Detector Plus has substantially equivalent indications to the RPS Adeno Detector (K052092) predicate in that they are indicated for the rapid, visual qualitative in vitro detection of Adenovirus and its serotypes directly from eye fluid on the conjunctiva.

The RPS Adeno Detector Plus uses the same technology as RPS Adeno Detector. The subject device and the predicate device are made from materials which have demonstrated satisfactory biocompatibility and are sterile, single use devices.

# 5.8 Performance Testing

Biocompatibility Testing - supported by literature.

In vitro Testing -   
The RPS Adeno Detector Plus completed a series of analytical bench tests for sensitivity and specificity.

Animal Studies - Not Applicable.

Clinical Studies -

A Clinical Trial was performed by Rapid Pathogen Screening, Inc. to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the RPS Adeno Detector Plus at detecting the presence of Adenovirus as compared to Cell Culture. The study design was a prospective, sequential, masked, clinical trial with eight (8) Clinical Trail Sites.

# 6.0 Conclusion

Rapid Pathogen Screening, Inc. believes that, as a result of the in vitro testing, clinical testing, and literature references supporting biocompatibility, the RPS Adeno Detector Plus is for the rapid, visual, qualitative in vitro detection of Adenovirus and its serotypes directly from eye fluid on the conjunctiva. The RPS Adeno Detector Plus is

substantially equivalent to the predicate device, RPS Adeno Detector (K052092).

Dear Dr. Sambursky:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class I (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket

notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
