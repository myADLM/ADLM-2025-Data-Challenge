Common Name or Classification Name: Campylobacter pylori

Product Code: LYR

Legally marketed device to which the submitter claims equivalence:

Micro Detect, Inc. Pylori Detect IgG ELISA for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies against $H ,$ EPY pylori in human serum. The test is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of infection by $H .$ pylori in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. K973508.

# Description of the device:

The assay requires a total of 90 minutes incubation time. The test uses purified antigen coated on microtiter wells. Serum is added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ If $H .$ pylori IgG antibodies are present they will bind to the antigen in the well. Unbound serum is removed by washing the wells three times. An HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG is then added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ If $H .$ pylori antibody is present, it will bind to the antibody attached to the antigen on the weli.The wells are again washed three times to remove any unbound conjugate. A TMB substrate is added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ If enzyme is present, it will react with the substrate to generate a colored product. After the incubation period, the reaction is stopped with a Stop Solution and the color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically.

# Intended use of the device:

The Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) ELISA IgG test kit is intended for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to $H ,$ pylori in human serum in the adult population. This test is intended to aid in the diagnosis of $H .$ pylori in patients suspected of having $H .$ pylori infection, and in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, and is to be used in conjunction with clinical findings.

# Cross Reactivity:

An adsorption study was performed to evaluate any cross reactivity. Briefly, sera with different levels of antibodies to H. pylori were adsorbed with either H. pylori, Candida albicans, E. coli, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridiumi spp., Campylobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Haemophilus Influenza, and Proteus. The identity of the bacteria used were identified by the ATCC and confirmed with the MALDI-TOF method. The bacteria were evaluated at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 7 }$ cfu/ml or higher.

Sera with different levels of antibodies to $H .$ pylori, were adsorbed with the recommended organisms. The adsorbed samples were compared to the untreated samples and the mean percent inhibition was calculated. The results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Organism</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration (cfu/ml)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean percentinhibition</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Helicobacter pylori</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>96%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Candida albicans</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.40x10&#x27;</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Escherichia coli</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.90x107</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Borrelia burgdorferi</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00x108</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Clostridium spp.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.20x10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Campylobacter</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.50x10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bacillus Cereus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.40x10&#x27;</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18.2%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Enterobacter</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.80x108$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.1%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pseudomonas</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.45x108}$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.1%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Haemophilus Influenza</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.90x107</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Proteus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.40x10^}$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.6%</td></tr></table>

The mean percent inhibition for $H _ { \ast }$ pylori was $9 6 \%$ ,and $1 . 8 \%$ to $9 . 5 \%$ with the other organisms. There seems to be a weak cross reactivity with Bacillus Cereus. Taking into account the normal test variation, the remaining cross reactivity with Bacillus Cereus may affect high negative samples close to the equivocal range. Overall no effects on the analytical specificity were seen on the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ pylori ELI§A IgG assay.

# Interfering Substance

The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ pylori ELISA IgG assay was evaluated. High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides in serum samples were tested at the assay cutoff (9-11 units) in triplicate. The recommended concentrations from /the guideline "Interference Testing InClinical Chemistry" from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute were used (see table below). The tested substances did not affect the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ pylori ELISA IgG assay.

Leukocytes, intestinal secretions or mucus, fat, and medications used to relieve diarihea or other gastric symptoms were not tested, therefore, it is not known if these substances will interfere with the assay as they were not evaluated.

# 6(b2): Clinical Comparison:

The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgG assay was determined by conducting a correlation study using 625 samples being routinely tested for H. pylori. The samples were tested on both the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgG assay and a commercially available ELISA assay (Micro Detect Inc. K973508) as the predicate device. The results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>Micro Detect IgG ELISA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Equivocal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=3 colspan=1>Gold StandardDiagnostics IgGELISA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>203</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Equivocal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>375</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>cYanmaGentaellowb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>219</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>396</td></tr></table>

The discrepant samples were further tested on a third assay, the DiaMedix $H .$ pylori IgG assay (which is also commercially available). Of the 11 Gold Standard Diagnostics negative samples, Micro Detect Inc. positive samples, the third assay called nine samples positive and two samples negative. Of the 13 Gold Standard Diagnostics positive samples, Micro Detect Inc. negative samples, the third asay called one sample borderline, two negative, and ten samples positive. The comparison data produced the following:

$\%$ Positive Agreement $= 9 2 . 7 \%$ (203/219) with $9 5 \%$ CI: $8 8 . 5 \%$ to $9 5 . 5 \%$ $\%$ Negative Agreement $= 9 4 . 7 \%$ (375/396) with $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 2 . 0 \%$ to $9 6 . 5 \%$ $\%$ Equivocal Agreement $= 2 0 \%$ (2/10) with $9 5 \%$ CI: $5 . 7 \%$ to $5 1 . 0 \%$ EY Overall Agreement $= 9 2 . 8 \%$ (580/625)
