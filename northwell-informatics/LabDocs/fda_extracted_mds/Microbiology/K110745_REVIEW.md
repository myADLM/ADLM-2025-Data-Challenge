# L. Test Principle:

The antibody searched for in the human serum forms an immune complex with the antigen coated on the microtiter-plate. Unbound immunoglobulins are removed by washing processes. The enzyme conjugate attaches to this complex. Unbound conjugate is again removed by washing processes. After adding the substrate solution (TMB), a blue dye is produced by the bound enzyme (peroxidase). The color changes to yellow when the stopping solution is added.

The results obtained for both precision and reproducibility studies were acceptable.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Controls

The ready to use controls serve for a qualitative determination of antibodies. Their concentration can be expressed in units. Fluctuations resulting from the test procedure can be balanced with this calculation method to produce a high reproducibility. Use the means of the OD values for calculation of the units (see calculation of units below).

# Test function control:

a) The OD of the blank should be $< 0 . 1 5 0$ The OD-values of the negative controls should be lower than the OD-values mentioned in the Quality Control Certificate. The OD-values of the positive controls as well as of the cut-off controls should be above the OD-values mentioned in the Quality Control Certificate.

b) Units of the cut-off controls are defined as 10 Units. The calculated units of the positive controls should be within the ranges mentioned in the Quality Control Certificate. If those requirements (OD-values, units) are not fulfilled, the test has to be repeated.

# Calculation of Units:

The OD of the blank value $( 4 5 0 / 6 2 0 \mathrm { n m } )$ has to be subtracted from all other OD’s.

Units\* $=$ (OD controls or samples / OD of cutoff) x 10

# Interpretation of the Test:

Interpretation negative equivocal positive

\*Units are defined by the manufacturer.

i. If the measured values are above the defined equivocal range, they are considered to be positive.

ii. If the measured Unit is within the equivocal range, no significant high antibody concentration is present, the samples are considered to be equivocal. Retest the sample and if the results are again equivocal, no significant antibodies are present. For the definitive detection of the presence of $H .$ . pylori it is necessary to determine the antibody concentration of two serum samples, one $\mathrm { I g G }$ and one IgM and in addition histology, culture and / or a urease test. A correct diagnosis based on the evaluation of a single serum sample is not possible.

iii. If the measured values are below the defined equivocal range, no measurable antigen specific antibodies are present in the samples. The samples are considered to be negative.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection was determined by testing the kit controls along with a pooled positive sample and several dilutions of the pooled sample. The limit of detection was determined at a 30 fold dilution of the pooled sample giving an OD value of 0.379 with a corresponding unit value of 11.9.

# Analytical specificity:

# Cross Reactivity

An adsorption study was performed to evaluate cross reactivity. Sera with different levels of antibodies to $H .$ . pylori were adsorbed with $H .$ . pylori, and Candida albicans, $E .$ . coli, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridium spp., Campylobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Proteus and two different strains of $H .$ influenza. The identity of the bacteria used were identified by the ATCC and confirmed with the MALDI-TOF method. The bacteria were evaluated at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { c f u / m l }$ or higher. The adsorbed samples were compared to the untreated samples and the mean percent inhibition was calculated. The results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Organism</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration (cfu/ml)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean percentinhibition</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Helicobacter pylori</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>96%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Candida albicans</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.40x107</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Escherichia coli</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.90x107</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Borrelia burgdorferi</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.00x108</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Clostridium spp.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.20x107</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Campylobacter</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.50x109</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bacillus Cereus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.40x107</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18.2%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Enterobacter</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.80x108</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.1%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pseudomonas</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.45x108</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.1%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Haemophilus Influenza</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.90x107</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Proteus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.40x108</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.6%</td></tr></table>

The mean percent inhibition for $H .$ . pylori was $9 6 \%$ , and $1 . 8 \%$ to $9 . 5 \%$ with the other organisms. There seems to be a weak cross reactivity with Bacillus. Taking into account the normal test variation, the remaining cross reactivity with Bacillus may affect high negative samples close to the equivocal range. With the exception of the cross reactivity, no overall effects on the analytical specificity were seen on the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ . pylori ELISA IgG assay. A limitation statement was included in the package insert.

# Interfering Substances

The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ pylori ELISA IgG assay was evaluated. High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides in serum samples were tested at the assay cutoff (9-11 units) in triplicate. The recommended concentrations from the guideline “Interference Testing In Clinical Chemistry” from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (18) were used (see table below). The tested substances did not affect the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ . pylori ELISA IgG assay.

Leukocytes, intestinal secretions or mucus, fat, and medications used to relieve diarrhea or other gastric symptoms were not tested, therefore, it is not known if these substances will interfere with the assay as they were not evaluated

# f. Assay cut-off:

# Determination of Cutoff

The cutoff was determined by testing normal sera from blood donors, clinical defined samples, proficiency samples, along with sera positive for H. pylori, borderline positive for $H .$ . pylori, and high negative for $H .$ pylori for a total of 278 samples. The cutoff was determined by taking the negative average plus three standard deviations of the blood donors. The cutoff was further adjusted so that the clinically defined samples were positive, the proficiency samples met their criteria, the positive $H .$ . pylori sera were positive, and the $H .$ . pylori negative sera were negative.

# 2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

# Performance Data

# Method Comparison

The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ . pylori ELISA IgG assay was determined by conducting a correlation study using 625 samples being routinely tested for $H .$ . pylori. No information as to the age, gender or ethnic makeup was provided, therefore, no conclusions can be made on these factors from these samples. The samples were tested on both the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ pylori ELISA $\mathrm { I g G }$ assay and a commercially available ELISA assay as the predicate device. The results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>PredicateDevice IgG ELISA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Equivocal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=3 colspan=1>Gold StandardDiagnostics IgGELISA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>203</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Equivocal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>375</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>219</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>396</td></tr></table>

$\%$ Positive Agreement $= 9 2 . 7 \%$ (203/219) with $9 5 \%$ CI: $8 8 . 5 \%$ to $9 5 . 5 \%$ ; $\%$ Negative Agreement $= 9 4 . 7 \%$ (375/396) with $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 2 . 0 \%$ to $9 6 . 5 \%$ $\%$ Equivocal Agreement $= 2 0 \%$ (2/10) with $9 5 \%$ CI: $5 . 7 \%$ to $5 1 . 0 \%$ Overall Agreement $= 9 2 . 8 \%$ (580/625)

The discrepant samples were further tested with a third commercially available assay. Of the eleven Gold Standard Diagnostics negative samples, and predicate device positive samples, nine samples were positive by the third assay. Of the 13 Gold Standard Diagnostics positive samples, and predicate device negative samples, one sample was equivocal, two negative, and ten samples were positive by the third assay.

# b. Matrix comparison:

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

No claim can be made for clinical sensitivity since comparison was not done to the gold standard e.g. biopsy (culture and/or histological diagnosis) or the urea breath test.

$b$ . Clinical specificity: Same as above   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

H. pylori is universally distributed and affect both genders, all ages and races. The prevalence of infection with H. pylori is higher in underdeveloped countries and in the communities with low standard of living and poor hygiene. Studies in asymptomatic Caucasians in the United States show that there is an increase in the prevalence of $H .$ . pylori infection with age (13-15). An expected values study was performed with the $H .$ . pylori IgG ELISA testing 625 patients from various populations. Results showed that a total of 203 patients were positive with the assay. The expected values result for the $H .$ pylori IgG ELISA is $32 \%$ .

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
