Product and Trade Name: Helicobacter pylori IgA ELISA

Common Name or Classification Name: Campylobacter pylori

Product Code: LYR

Legally marketed device to which the submitter claims equivalence:

Micro Detect, Inc. Pylori Detect IgA ELISA for the qualitative detection of IgA antibodies against $H .$ pylori in human serum. The test is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of infection by $H .$ pylori in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. K003794.

# Description of the device:

The assay requires a total of 90 minutes incubation time. The test uses purified antigen coated on microtiter wells. Serum is added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ If $H .$ pylori IgA antibodies are present they will bind to the antigen in the well. Unbound serum is removed by washing the wells three times. An HRP-conjugated anti-human IgA is then added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ If $H .$ pylori antibody is present, it will bind to the antibody attached to the antigen on the well. The wells are again washed three times to remove any unbound conjugate. A TMB substrate is added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ If enzyme is present, it will react with the substrate to generate a colored product.After the incubation period, the reaction is stopped with a Stop Solution and the color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically.

# Intended use of the device:

The Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) ELISA IgA test kit is intended for the qualitative detection of IgA antibodies to $H .$ pylori in human serum in the adult population. This test is intended as a second test to aid in the diagnosis of $H ,$ pylori in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, in conjunction with

clinical findings. It should be performed and interpreted with another assay for detection of IgG antibodies to $H .$ pylori.

# Cross Reactivity:

An adsorption study was performed to evaluate any cross reactivity. Briefly, sera with different levels of antibodies to $H .$ pylori were adsorbed with either $H .$ pylori, Candida albicans, $E .$ coli, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridium spp., Campylobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Haemophilus Influenza, and Proteus. The identity of the bacteria used were identified by the ATCC and confirmed with mass spectrometry. The bacteria were evaluated at a concentration of $\boldsymbol { 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { c f u / m l } }$ or higher.

Sera with different levels of antibodies to H. pylori, were adsorbed with the recommended organisms. The adsorbed samples were compared to the untreated samples and the mean percent inhibition was calculated. The results are summarized in the following table:

The mean percent inhibition for $H .$ pylori was $9 6 \%$ ,and $0 . 8 \%$ to $1 0 . 9 \%$ with the other organisms. Overall no effects on the analytical specificity were seen on the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H ,$ pylori ELISA IgA assay.

# Interfering Substance

The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ pylori ELISA IgA assay was evaluated. High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides in serum samples were tested at the assay cutoff (9-11 units) in triplicate. The recommended concentrations from the guideline "Interference Testing In Clinical Chemistry" from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute were used (see table below). No interference was noted with any of substances tested and the substances tested did not affect the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ pylori ELISA IgA assay.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>H. pyloriconcentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean PercentInhibition</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2 g/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9-11 units</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>342 μmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9-11 units</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cholesterol</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13 mmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9-11 units</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglyceride</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>37 mmol/L</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9-11 units</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-32%</td></tr></table>

Leukocytes, intestinal secretions or mucus, fat, and medications used to relieve diarrhea or other gastric symptoms were not tested, therefore, it is not known if these substances will interfere with the assay as they were not evaluated.

# Limit of Detection

To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD) for the assay, a pooled positive and a pooled negative sample were tested along with the negative, cutoff and positive controls provided in the kit.Further, the pooled positive sample was diluted up to 4.3 fold. The samples, and dilutions, were then tested 24 times (24 replicates) over several days as described in the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute CLSI document EP-17. The LoD chosen was one that gave a positive result $9 5 \%$ of the time, was near the cutoff, and gave acceptable precision and accuracy results.

In Summary, the controls supplied in the kit were within their acceptable ranges. The pooled negative sample gave negative results on all 24 replicates giving an average OD value of 0.050 and a corresponding Unit value of 1.1. The pooled positive sample gave positive results on all 24 replicates giving an average OD value of 1.259 and a corresponding Unit value 25.3.

The pooled positive sample was then diluted up to 4.3 fold and each dilution was tested with the assay. The 3.3 fold dilution was positive $9 5 . 8 \%$ of the time (after 24 replicates), gave acceptable precision and acuracy results, gave an average OD value of 0.558 was close to the average cutoff OD value (0.497) and gave a corresponding unit value of 11.3. Therefore, we can conclude that the LoD of the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H ,$ pylori IgA Test can be determined at an OD value of 0.558 and unit value of 11.3.

# 6(b2): Clinical Comparison:

The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgA assay was determined by conducting a correlation study using 625 samples being routinely tested for H. pylori. The samples were tested on both the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgA assay and a commercially available ELISA assay (Micro Detect Inc. K003794) as the predicate device. The results are summarized in the following table:

Micro Detect Inc.   

<table><tr><td rowspan="7">GSD</td><td colspan="2">Positive</td><td>Equivocal</td><td>Negative</td></tr><tr><td>Positive</td><td>.121</td><td>31</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Equivocal</td><td>13</td><td>8</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Negative</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>394</td></tr></table>

The discrepant samples were further tested on a third assay, the Inova QUANTA Lite™M H. pylori IgA ELISA (which is also commercially available). Of the seven Gold Standard Diagnostics negative samples, Micro Detect Inc. positive samples, the third assay caled five samples positive. Of the 26 Gold Standard Diagnostics positive samples, Micro Detect Inc. negative samples, the third assay called two samples borderline, one sample negative and 23 samples positive.

The comparison data produced a percent positive agreement of $9 4 . 5 \%$ (C.I. $7 6 . 0 \% - 1 0 0 \%$ ), a percent negative agreement of $9 3 . 8 \%$ (C.I. $8 8 . 8 \% - 9 9 . 5 \%$ ), and an overall agreement of $9 4 . 0 \%$ (C.I. $8 5 . 9 \%$ - $1 0 0 \%$

# 6(b3) Conclusion:

From the data and comparison above, it is our contention that the Gold Standard Diagnostic H. pylori IgA ELISA test is substantially equivalent to the commercially marketed Micro Detect, Inc. Pylori Detect IgA kit.
