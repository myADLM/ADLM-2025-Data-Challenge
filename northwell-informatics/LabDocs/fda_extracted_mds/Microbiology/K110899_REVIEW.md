# L. Test Principle:

The Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) ELISA IgA test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Purified antigen is bound to microwells in a polystyrene microtiter plate. Serum is added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . If H. pylori IgA antibodies are present they will bind to the antigen in the well. Unbound serum is removed by washing the wells three times. An HRP-conjugated anti-human IgA is then added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The wells are washed three times to remove any unbound conjugate. A TMB substrate is added to each well and the plate is incubated for 30 minutes at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . This reaction generates a blue color produced by the bound enzyme (peroxidase). The color changes to yellow when the stopping solution is added and the color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

N/A

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls provided are ready to use. Units of the cut-off controls are defined as 10 units. The calculated units of the positive controls should be within the ranges mentioned in the quality control certificate. If those requirements (OD values, units) are not fulfilled, the test has to be repeated.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection was determined by testing the kit controls along with a pooled positive sample and several dilutions of the pooled sample. The limit of detection was determined at a 3.3 fold dilution of the pooled sample giving an OD value of 0.558 with a corresponding unit value of 11.3

e. Analytical specificity:

Cross reactivity

An adsorption study was performed to evaluate cross reactivity. Briefly, sera with different levels of antibodies to $H .$ . pylori were adsorbed with either of the following organisms; $H .$ . pylori, Candida albicans, E. coli, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridium spp., Campylobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Proteus , or two different strains of $H .$ influenza. The identity of the bacteria used were identified by the ATCC and confirmed by mass

spectrometry. The bacteria were evaluated at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ or higher. The adsorbed samples were compared to the untreated samples and the mean percent inhibition was calculated. The results are summarized in the following table:

The mean percent inhibition for $H .$ pylori was $9 6 \%$ , and $0 . 8 \%$ to $1 0 . 9 \%$ with the other organisms. Overall no effects on the analytical specificity were seen with the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ . pylori ELISA IgA assay.

# Interfering Substances

# Interference

The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ . pylori ELISA IgA assay was evaluated. High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides in serum samples were tested. The concentrations, recommended in the guideline "Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry" from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, were used. The tested substances did not affect the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ . pylori ELISA IgA assay.

# $f .$ Assay cut-off:

The cut-off was determined by testing normal sera, clinical defined samples, proficiency samples, along with sera positive for $H .$ pylori, borderline positive for $H .$ . pylori, and high negative for $H .$ pylori for a total of 254 samples. The cutoff was determined by taking the negative average plus three standard deviations from normal sera samples. The cutoff was further adjusted so that the clinically defined samples were positive, the proficiency samples met their criteria, the positive $H .$ pylori sera were positive, and the H. pylori negative sera were negative.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgA assay was determined by conducting a correlation study using 628 samples being routinely tested for $H .$ . pylori. Testing was conducted at three geographically diverse clinical sites. The samples were tested with both the Gold Standard Diagnostics $H .$ . pylori ELISA IgA assay and the predicate device. The results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>Predicate Device IgA ELISA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Borderline</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=3 colspan=1>Gold StandardDiagnostics IgAELISA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>121</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>31</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>26</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Borderline</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>23</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>394</td></tr></table>

%Positive Agreement $= 9 4 . 5 \%$ (C.I. $7 6 . 0 - 1 0 0 \%$ ) %Negative Agreement $= 9 3 . 8 \%$ (C.I. $8 8 . 8 \% - 9 9 . 5 \% )$ Overall Agreement $= 9 4 . 0 \%$ (C.I. $8 5 . 9 \% - 1 0 0 \%$ )

The discrepant samples were further tested with a second commercially available assay. Of the seven samples, that were negative by the Gold Standard assay and positive by the predicate device, five samples were positive by the second assay. Of the 26 Gold Standard Diagnostics positive samples, which were negative by the predicate device, two samples were borderline, one sample was negative and 23 samples were positive by the second assay.

b. Matrix comparison: N/A

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A (comparison was not done to the gold standard e.g. biopsy, culture and/or histological examination, or the urea breath test.

$b$ . Clinical specificity: N/A (comparison was not done to the gold standard.)   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): N/A

4. Clinical cut-off: N/A

5. Expected values/Reference range:

H. pylori is universally distributed and affects all genders, ages and races. The prevalence of infection with $H .$ . pylori is higher in underdeveloped countries and in the communities with a low standard of living and poor hygiene. Studies in asymptomatic Caucasians in the United States show that there is an increase in the prevalence of $H .$ . pylori infection with age. An expected values study was performed with the $H .$ . pylori ELISA Ig A assay testing 628 patients from various populations. Results showed that a total of 121 patients were positive with the assay. The expected values result seen in this study for the H. pylori IgA assay is $1 9 \%$ .

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
