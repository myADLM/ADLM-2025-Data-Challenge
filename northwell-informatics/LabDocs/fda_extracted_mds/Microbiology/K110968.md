# INTENDED USE

The $\mathrm { P r o F l u ^ { T M } + }$ Assay is a multiplex Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid and qualitative detection and discrimination of Influenza A Virus, Influenza B Virus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) nucleic acids isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients. This test is intended for use to aid in the differential diagnosis of Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV viral infections in humans and is not intended to detect Influenza C.

Negative results do not preclude influenza or RSV virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not ruleout bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing and clinical presentation must be considered in order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.

Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3 and A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation (2006  2007 respiratory season). Performance characteristics for Influenza A were confirmed when Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, and Influenza A/2009 H1N1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation (2008 and 2009). When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The ProFlu+ Assay enables detection and differentiation of Influenza A Virus, Influenza B Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Types A and B), and Internal Control.

An overview of the procedure is as follows:

1. Collect nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic patients using a polyester, rayon or nylon tipped swab and place into viral transport medium.   
Add an Internal Control (IC) to every sample to monitor for inhibitors present in the specimens.   
Perform isolation and purification of nucleic acids using a MagNA Pure LC System (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a NucliSENS easyMAG System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).   
4Add purified nucleic acids to Influenza A/Influenza B/RSV Mix along with enzymes included in the ProFlu+ Detection Kit. The Influenza A/Influenza B/RSV Mix contains oligonucleotide primers and target-specific oligonucleotide probes. The primers are complementary to highly conserved regions of genetic sequences for these respiratory viruses. The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher (see table below).   
5.Perform reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and subsequent amplification of DNA in a Cepheid SmartCycler II instrument. In this process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer extension and amplification. The ProFlu+ Assay is based on Taqman reagent chemistry, which utilizes the $5 ' - 3 '$ EY exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, further increasing fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification products present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each PCR cycle by the realtime instrument.

SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE

# Clinical Comparison Study

The ProFlu+ Assay's supermix was reformulated and performance characteristics were established by comparing the reformulated assay to the original ProFlu+ Assay. All samples positive for IA, IB or RSV using either the current ProFlu+ Assay and/or the reformulated "New" ProFlu+ Assay were confirmed using bidirectional sequencing. The sequencing assays targeted either a different gene than the ProFlu+ Assay or targeted a different region of the same gene as the ProFlu+ Assay. Prospectively collected archived samples from respiratory season years 2008 and 2009 that were collected at two clinical study sites (Columbus, OH and Albuquerque, NM) were used for this study.

"True" influenza A, influenza B or RSV positives were considered as any sample that tested positive for the respective analyte by the original ProFlu+ Assay. "True" Influenza A, Influenza B or RSV negatives were considered as any sample that tested negative by the original ProFlu+ Assay.

Dear Dr. Harrington:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class I (Special Controls), it may be subject to such aditional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
