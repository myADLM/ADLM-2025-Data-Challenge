83 Microbiology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use:

MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of aerobic streptococci including S. pneumoniae.

2. Indications for use:

The MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ MICroSTREP plus Panels are used to determine quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of aerobic streptococci including $S .$ . pneumoniae. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 20- 24 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } C + / - 1 ^ { \circ } C$ in a non- $C 0 _ { 2 }$ incubator, and read visually. Alternatively, the panels can be incubated in and read by the MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ WalkAway System, according to the Package insert.

This particular submission is for the addition of antimicrobial Moxifloxacin at concentrations 0.03 to $8 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to the test panel.

The organisms which may be used for susceptibility testing in this panel are:

Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin resistant strains)   
Streptococcus pyogenes   
Streptococcus agalactiae   
Streptococcus constellatus   
Streptococcus anginosus   
Viridans group streptococci

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only Turbidity inoculation method only

4. Special instrument requirements:

MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ WalkAway $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System is the alternate read method for Moxifloxacin

# I. Device Description:

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. The antimicrobial agent is diluted in water, buffer or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with $1 1 5 \mu \mathrm { l }$ MuellerHinton broth supplemented with $3 \%$ lysed horse blood (LHB), after inoculation of the broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non-CO2 incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is manually read by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. Alternatively, the panel can be incubated in and read by the MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ WalkAway System.

# L. Test Principle:

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. The antimicrobial agent is diluted in water, buffer or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with $1 1 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ MuellerHinton broth supplemented with $3 \%$ lysed horse blood (LHB), after inoculation of the broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non-CO2 incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is manually read by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. Alternatively, the panel can be incubated in and read by the MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ WalkAway System.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at three sites on three separate days in triplicate. The study included the turbidity inoculum method with reading performed manually, by WalkAway instrument. Both within site and site to site results were $5 9 5 \%$ reproducible.

There were more results in the minus category (one dilution lower) by the WalkAway; however, there were more results in the plus category by the manual method.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results most of the time with the reference method. Quality control results demonstrated the ability of the different reading parameters (manual, and WalkAway) by Turbidity inoculation methods to produce acceptable results.

\*This quality control range is applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with $2 - 5 \%$ lysed horse blood.

Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity inoculation method. Inoculum density was controlled by monitoring the daily results of the MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Turbidity Meter to ensure the correct final concentration of the organisms for both the reference and test device.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Clinical efficacy testing was conducted at three external sites using fresh isolates supplemented with stock isolates. The study included a total of 443 Streptococci isolates, with a no growth rate of $1 . 1 \%$ (5/448). There were 319 $( 7 2 \% )$ fresh and 124 $( 2 8 \% )$ stock isolates. There were 50 challenge isolates tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel. All isolates grew in the MICroStrep panels.

Efficacy testing was performed using the turbidity inoculation method and read manually after incubation for 20- 24 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } C + / - 1 ^ { \circ } C$ in a non- $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator. A comparison to the reference method was provided with the following agreement.

EA - Essential Agreement maj – Major Discrepancies CA - Category Agreement vmj -- Very Major Discrepancies R- Resistant min – Minor Discrepancies

EA is when there is agreement between the reference method and the new method is within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. Category agreement (CA) is when the new method result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the new method and the reference method and have on-scale EA.

The performance of the alternate MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ WalkAway System (incubation and read methods) was demonstrated in challenge, quality control, and reproducibility studies with acceptable results.
