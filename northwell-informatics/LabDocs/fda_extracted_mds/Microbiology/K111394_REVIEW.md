# I. Device Description:

The MicroScan® MICroSTREP plus® Panel is used to determine quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of aerobic streptococci. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 20 -24 hours at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $+ / - 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a non- $C 0 _ { 2 }$ incubator, and read either visually or with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the Package insert.

Primary Read Method: Manual; Alternate Read Method: MicroScan® WalkAway System®

The MIC interpretive criteria for daptomycin are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>Organism</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>Susceptibility Interpretive Criteria(MIC* in µg/mL):</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>S</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>I</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>R</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcusagalactiae, and Streptococcusdysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr></table>

\*Currently there are no intermediate or resistant interpretive criteria for daptomycin. The current absence of data on daptomycin-resistant isolates precludes defining any categories other than "Susceptible." Isolates yielding test results suggestive of a "Non-Susceptible" category should be retested, and if the result is confirmed, the isolate should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

$^ { * } \mathrm { { S } = }$ Susceptible: Attainable levels in blood or tissue on usual usage, including oral administration when applicable.

$\mathrm { I } =$ Intermediate: The intermediate category implies clinical efficacy in body sites where the drugs are physiologically concentrated (e.g. quinolones and B-lactams in urine), or when a higher than normal dosage of drug can be used (e.g. Blactams). The “intermediate” category also includes a “buffer zone” which should prevent small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretations, especially for drugs with narrow pharmacotoxicity margins.

$\mathrm { R } =$ Resistant to usually achievable systemic concentrations.

# L. Test Principle:

The antimicrobial agent is diluted in water, buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with $1 1 5 \mu \mathrm { g }$ Mueller-Hinton Broth supplemented with $2 \div 5 \%$ lysed horse blood (LHB), after inoculation of the broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non- $\mathrm { . C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is manually read by visually observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. Alternatively, the panel can be incubated in and read by the MicroScan® WalkAway® System.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was conducted at three study sites.

Each site tested a minimum of 10 on-scale reproducibility organisms per antimicrobial agent. Selection of isolates included organisms with on-scale expected results for each antimicrobial agent included in this study. These isolates may have been selected from the challenge isolates.

Reproducibility was performed using plates with long dilution range and shortened dilution range (mapped). Because mapped dilutions have narrow range, several MIC values were off-scale. Only reproducibility calculations from the long dilution range are presented here.

Reproducibility was calculated as the percent of results for the combined sites which were within $+ / -$ one doubling dilution of the mode MIC value for all

sites. Each reproducibility organism was tested in triplicate on the dried Test panel and singly on the frozen reference panel on three different days at each site. Dried test panels were tested with the turbidity inoculation method and read manually and on the MicroScan WalkAway System.

For reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.

The overall best case and worst case reproducibility values for manual read and WalkAway for long dilution range are shown below. These results met the acceptance criteria.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>InoculationMethod</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ReadMethod</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Reproducible(Best case-all sites)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% Reproducible(Worst case-all sites)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Turbidity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Manual</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>98.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>98.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>WalkAway</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>97.4 (94.8)*</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>94.8</td></tr></table>

\* Value in parentheses reflect the calculation made for off-scale values which were not included in the “Best Case” calculation because the off-scale results were several doubling dilutions from the mode and values are confirmed to be greater than one well from the mode.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results with the reference method. The MICroSTREP plus - Daptomycin test results demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.

Daptomycin quality control data from combined sites is shown below. For $S .$ . pneumoniae, the data is from 3 testing sites. QC data was analyzed for the long dilution range and shortened dilution range (mapped). At least 25 test results were available at each site. The combined QC data is shown in the following table.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>QC Organism</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MICrange(μg/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MIC value(μg/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Broth MicroDilutionReferenceFrequency</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MicroscanManualRead</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>MicroscanWalk-AwayRead</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=6 colspan=1>S. pneumoniaeATCC 49619</td><td rowspan=6 colspan=1>0.06 - 0.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.03</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.12</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>88</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>19</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>23</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.25</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>17</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>83</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>79</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr></table>

All QC values were in the expected range except for two results by each reading method, which were one doubling dilution above the range. For the Manual read, 109/111 $( 9 8 . 2 \% )$ test results were in range and for Microscan WalkAway, 107/109 $( 9 8 . 2 \% )$ test results were in range. QC test results with the new device were within the expected range $5 9 5 \%$ of the time, which is acceptable.

Inoculum density checks showed acceptable results for QC organisms, as well as a select number of challenge and clinical isolates. All results were within the expected range.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Clinical testing was performed at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented with stock isolates of Streptococcus spp. A comparison of the MICroSTREP plus - Daptomycin test panel results was made to the reference method as recommended in the CLSI standard M7-A6 with the following deviations from that recommendation: Pluronic-F was used as the inoculum in the frozen reference panels. This is composed of water which contains a very small amount (0.1) of Pluronic to provide a smoother draw of liquid into the inoculator. Testing of the reference method and the MicroScan panels was

performed at the same time. A challenge set was also tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel. All isolates tested grew in the MicroScan panels.

MicroScan MICroSTREP plus - Daptomycin and CLSI reference broth microdilution results were compared based on the guidelines provided in the AST Guidance Document. Essential agreement (EA) is when the MICroSTREP plus agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the MICroSTREP plus result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation based on interpretive criteria. The $\% \mathrm { E A }$ and $\% \mathrm { C A }$ results were acceptable.

According to the approved drug label for daptomycin, only a susceptible interpretive category is defined. There are no intermediate or resistance interpretive categories. In this study, no isolates were noted to have MICs outside the susceptible category by the reference method. There were 2 cases in this study in which MicroScan MICroSTREP plus results gave a Daptomycin categorical interpretation that was not in agreement with the reference broth dilution MIC (Reference interpretation was “susceptible” while the MicroScan MICroSTREP plus interpretation was “non-susceptible).

Labeling will recommend that isolates yielding a “non-susceptible” category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

A total of 281 (214 fresh/67 stock) clinical isolates of Streptococcus spp. were evaluated at 3 clinical study sties. There were 107 Streptococcus pyogenes, 145 Streptococcus agalactiae and 29 other beta hemolytic streptococci belonging to Group C and Group G (Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis). A total of 50 stock challenge isolates were also included and were tested at one site.

Combined results from clinical and challenge studies demonstrated an overall EA of $9 7 \%$ (321/331) and an overall CA of $9 9 . 3 \%$ (329/331) for the mapped (shortened) dilution range.

The performance evaluation summary of essential and category agreement results for challenge and clinical strains is shown in the tables below. Only results from manual read (primary method) are shown below for the long and short (mapped) dilution range. WalkAway read gave similar results to manual read.
