# Substantially Equivalent Devices: APTIMA Combo 2 Assay; K032194

This pre-market application is to clear the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay for use on the PANTHER System. The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay was cleared on the predicate TIGRIS System on December 24, 2003 (K032194). Clearance of this 510(k) will add the PANTHER System as an optional platform. No changes were introduced to the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay reagents.

# Device Description

The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay combines the technologies of target capture, TMA, and DKA.

Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes. The transport solutions in these tubes release the rRNA targets and protect them from degradation during storage. When the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay is performed in the laboratory, the target rRNA molecules are isolated from specimens by use of capture oligomers via target capture that utilizes magnetic microparticles. The capture oligomers contain sequences complementary to specific regions of the target molecules as well as a string of deoxyadenosine residues. A separate capture oligomer is used for each target. During the hybridization step, the sequence specific regions of the capture oligomers bind to specific regions of the target molecules. The capture oligomer:target complex is then captured out of solution by decreasing the temperature of the reaction to room temperature. This temperature reduction allows hybridization to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the capture oligomer and the poly-deoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the magnetic particles. The microparticles, including the captured target molecules bound to them, are pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The particles are washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification reaction inhibitors. After the target capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for amplification.

Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary oligonucleotide primers tc specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic acid strands. The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay replicates a specific region of the 23S rRNA from CT and a specific region of the 16S rRNA from GC via DNA intermediates. A unique set of primers is used for each target molecule. Detection of the rRNA amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic acid hybridization. Single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probes, which are complementary to a region of each target amplicon, are labeled with different acridinium ester molecules. The labeled DNA probes combine with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA hybrids. The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from unhybridized probe. During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA hybrids is measured as photon signals in a luminometer, and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU). In DKA, differences in the kinetic profiles of th CT and GC labeled probes allow for the differentiation of signal; kinetic profiles are derived from measurements of photon output during the detection read time. The chemiluminescent detection reaction for CT signal has very rapid kinetics and has the "flasher" kinetic type. The chemiluminescent detection reaction for GC signal is relatively slower and has the "glower" kinetic type. Assay results are determined by a cut-off based on the total RLU and the kinetic curve type.

# Intended Use

The AC2 Assay intended use is stated below.

The APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay is a target amplification nucleic acid probe test that utilizes target capture for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) to aid in the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal urogenital disease using the PANTHER System as specified.

On the PANTHER System, the assay may be used to test the following specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals: clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab specimens, clinician-collected gynecological specimens collected in the PreservCyt Solution, and patient-collected vaginal swab specimens'.

'Patient-collected vaginal swab specimens are an option for screcning women when a pelvic exam is not otherwise indicated. The vaginal swab specimen collection kit is not for home use.

# Performance Data

# Brief Description of Non-Clinical Data

The following studies were conducted to support analytical performance of the PANTHER System.

# Analytical Sensitivity Study

Chlamydia trachomatis analytical sensitivity (limits of detection) was determined by directly comparing dilutions of CT organisms in the APTIMA COMBO 2 assay. The analytical sensitivity claim for the assay is 1 IFU/assay (7.25 IFU/swab, 9.75 IFU/mL, PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap). However, dilutions of less than 1 IFU/assay tested positive in the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay (for this study, $100 \%$ positivity was observed in samples containing CT concentrations of $0 . 0 3 \mathrm { \ I F U / m L ) }$

Neisseria gonorrhoeae analytical sensitivity (limits of detection) was determined by directly comparing dilutions of GC organismsin the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay. The analytical sensitivity claim for the assay is 50 cells/assay (362 cells/swab, 488 cells/mL PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap). However, dilutions of less than 50 cells/assay tested positive in the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay (for this study, $100 \%$ positivity was observed in samples containing GC concentrations of $0 . 0 4 \ : \mathrm { C F U / m L } ,$

# Within Laboratory Precision Study

APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay precision was evaluated at Gen-Probe using the PANTHER System. Testing was performed using three PANTHER Systems and three lots of assay reagents. Testing was performed over 24 days.

Reproducibility panel members were created using negative PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens and STM. The positive panel members were created by spiking CT and/or GC organisms to the targeted concentrations shown in Table 1.

For each panel member, Table 1 presents mean RLU, between-instrument, between-lot, between-run, within-run, and overall variation as SD and percent CV. Percent agreement with expected results is also shown.

# Carryover Studies for the PANTHER System

A multi-run analytical study was conducted using spiked panels on three PANTHER Systems. Carryover was assessed using approximately $2 0 \%$ high titer GC samples dispersed between negative samples. The runs included clusters of high positive samples with clusters of negative samples as wel as single high positives dispersed in a specific pattern within the run. High titer samples were made using GC rRNA spiked into STM to give a final concentration equivalent to 2.5 x 105 CFU/mL. Testing was carried out using 5 runs on cach of three PANTHER Systems. Carryover was calculated from a total of 2938 valid negative results. The overall carryover rate was $0 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $0 { \cdot } 0 . 1 \%$ .

# Brief Description of Clinical Data

Prevalence

The prevalence of CT and GC in patient populations depends on risk factors such as age, gender, the presence or absence of symptoms, the type of clinic, and the sensitivity of the test used to detect infections. A summary of the prevalence of three CT and GC disease outcomes, as determined by the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in the clinical trial, is shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4 by specimen type and clinical site.

# Clinical Study Results

A prospective, multicenter clinical study was conducted to establish the performance characteristics of the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay on the PANTHER System. Specimens were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic men $\scriptstyle \mathtt { ( n = 5 8 0 ) }$ and women $\scriptstyle ( { \mathfrak { n } } = 1 3 3 2 )$ enrolled from 7 geographically and ethnically diverse US clinical sites, including obstetrics and gynecolgy, family planning, public health, and STD clinics. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if symptoms were reported by the subject. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms. Of the 580 male subjects, none were ${ < } 1 8$ years of age, 72 were 18 to 20) years of age, 201 were 21 to 25 years of age, and 307 were ${ > } 2 5$ years of age. Of the 1332 female subjects, 11 were 14 to 15 years of age, 59 were 16 to 17 years of age, 319 were 18 to 20 years of age, 401 were 21 to 25 years of age, and 542 were ${ > } 2 5$ years of age.

Up to 2 specimens were collected from each male subject (1 urethral swab and 1 first-catch urine, in that order) and up to 4 specimens were collected from each female subject (1 first-catch urine, 1 vaginal swab, 1 PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimen, and 1 endocervical swab, in that order). All specimens were clinician-collected except urine specimens and approximately half of the vaginal swab specimens, which were collected by the subject at the clinic. Approximately half of the PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were collected with a broom-type device and half were collected with a spatula and cytobrush. Samples were prepared for APTIMA testing in accordance with the appropriate APTIMA specimen collection kit package insert instructions.

All evaluable samples (567 male urethral swab, 1319 vaginal swab, 1330 PreservCyt, and 1310 endocervical swab samples) were tested with the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in accordance with package insert instructions. The samples were split amongst three laboratories (two external laboratories and GEN-PROBE). Samples with initial invalid, equivocal, or error results were retested. Eighteen (18) male urethral swab, 25 vaginal swab, 1 PreservCyt, and 37 endocervical swab specimens had final invalid results and were excluded from the analyses. Most of the invalid results were due to insufficient sample volume. One vaginal swab and 1 endocervical swab had final CT equivocal results and 1 PreservCyt and 1 endocervical swab had final GC equivocal results and were excluded from the analyses.

Male urethral swab, male and female urine, and PreservCyt samples were tested with cleared nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to establish the infected status. The infected status algorithm used results from two specimen types and two reference NAATs. Subjects were categorized as infected if a positive result occurred in each of the 2 reference NAATs. For female subjects, if the positive NAAT results occurred only in the urine specimens and not in the PreservCyt specimens, the subject was categorized as infected; however, for the evaluation of the non-urine specimen types, the specimens were considered non-infected. Subjects that could not be categorized as infected or not infected were excluded from the performance analyses.

# Chlamydia trachomatis Performance Results

Performance characteristics of the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay were estimated by comparing PANTHER System results to the infected status algorithm. Table 6 shows the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay for CT detection and the prevalence of CT (based on the infected status) in each specimen type.

# Reproducibility Study

APTIMA Combo 2 Assay reproducibility was evaluated at two external US laboratories and at Gen-Probe using the PANTHER System. Testing was performed using one lot of assay reagents and a total of six operators (two at each site). At each site, testing was performed over at least 10) days.

Reproducibility panel members were created using negative specimens processed with the APTIMA Specimen Collection Kit. The positive panel members were created by spiking with CT and/or GC organisms to result in panel members with expected targeted concentrations.

Table 17 shows the CT and GC concentrations for each panel member. Table 17 presents, for each panel member, RLU data in terms of mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) between sites, between operators, between days, between runs, within runs, and overall. Percent agreement with expected results is also shown. Samples with valid results were included in the analyses.
