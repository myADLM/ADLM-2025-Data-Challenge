# Predicate Devices:

# Device Description

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in real-time RT-PCR assays (rRT-PCR) on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument.

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is a panel of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ) probes to be used in rRTPCR for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization of human influenza viruses from viral RNA in respiratory specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). Detection of viral RNA not only aids in the diagnosis of illness caused by seasonal and novel influenza viruses in patients with ILI, but also provides epidemiological information on influenza and aids in the presumptive laboratory identification of specific novel influenza A viruses.

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is based on technology which is used in many molecular diagnostic assays. rRT-PCR assays are one-tube assays that first reverse-transcribe specific regions of RNA into cDNA copies. The cDNA then serves as a template for a polymerase chain reaction that utilizes a thermocyclic heating and cooling of the reaction to logarithmically amplify a specific region of DNA. The probe anneals to a specific internal target sequence located between the target loci of the forward and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the 5' nuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades any probe molecules hybridized to amplified target sequence, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, and generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, increasing the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle. Amplification of targets is reflected by logarithmic increase in fluorescence over time in comparison to background signal.

# Intended Use

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx RealTime PCR Instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture. For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A virus as seasonal A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H1pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical

specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW and NPS/TS) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture.

For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian Lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

# Substantial Equivalence Comparison

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel merges two previously FDA-cleared CDC devices and is equivalent to the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (K080570) and the CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-time RT-PCR Panel (K101564). These devices were developed to the same specifications and utilize the same real-time RT-PCR technology to detect influenza A and influenza B in human respiratory specimens. The CDC Human Influenza Virus RealTime RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel further detects and differentiates influenza A and B viruses and characterizes influenza A viruses as A/H1, A/H3 subtypes, A/H1pdm09, and A/H5 using real-time RT-PCR. All three devices utilize the same instrumentation, the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument, which has been granted marketing clearance by FDA (K082562). The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (K080570) and the CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-time RT-PCR Panel (K101564) were granted marketing clearance by the FDA on September 30, 2008, and June 22, 2010, respectively.

# Performance Characteristics

For analytical and clinical performance characteristics, please refer to previously FDAcleared CDC 510(k) Premarket Notifications:

1. K080570 - Cleared on September 30, 2008: CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel   
2.K101564 - Cleared on June 22, 2010: CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel

Additional performance data were collected during the 2010-2011 influenza season. Recent circulating seasonal influenza virus strains can be detected by the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel and the CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel as demonstrated by analytical testing of the 49 original specimens received from US public health laboratories that contained 24 Influenza A/H3 $( 4 9 \% )$ and 25 Influenza B $( 5 1 \% )$ .

Eighteen original lower respiratory specimens were received from US public health laboratories during the 2010-201 1 influenza season from hospitalized patients or fatal cases. The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel and the CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel detected influenza A/H3, A/H1 pdm09, and influenza B in bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washes, tracheal aspirates, sputum, and lung tissue specimens, verifying detection of recent circulating influenza viruses in the lower respiratory tract.

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual   
nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture.
