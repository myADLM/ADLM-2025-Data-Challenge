4. Panel: Microbiology (83)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use:

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for use in rRT-PCR assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture. For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A virus as seasonal A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H1pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW and NPS/TS) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture. • For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian Lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to   
perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

# I. Device Description:

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in rRT-PCR assays on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. It consists of oligonucleotide primers, dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ) probes, and positive controls for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization of the human influenza virus RNA in respiratory tract specimens from human patients presenting with signs and symptoms of respiratory infections. These reagents are used for detection of influenza A and B virus and characterization of influenza A viruses as seasonal A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, or A/H5 (Asian lineage).

Primers and probes for Influenza A, 2009 Influenza A (swine origin), and B viruses were selected from highly conserved regions of specific gene targets within the matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (NP), and non-structural protein (NS), respectively. Primers and probes for detection and differentiation of seasonal influenza $\mathrm { A } / \mathrm { H } 1$ , A/H3, A/H1pdm09, and A/H5 viruses are targeted for conserved regions of their respective hemagglutinin (HA) genes. Sizes of targeted regions are between 100–200 nucleotides. Influenza-specific primers were designed to be 19–25 nucleotides long with annealing temperatures of approximately $6 2 { - } 6 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (GC content of $45 \mathrm { - } 6 0 \% )$ and the terminal $_ 3 \cdot$ nucleotide located at the first or second residue of a predicted amino acid codon.

# L. Test Principle:

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is a panel of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ) probes which may be used in rRT-PCR assays for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization of the human influenza virus RNA in the respiratory tract. The reagents included in Panel consist of primers, probes, and positive control materials. The primer and probe sets are designed for the detection of influenza type A and B viruses that infect humans and characterization of influenza A viruses as seasonal A/H1, seasonal A/H3, A/H1pdm09, or A/H5. The oligonucleotide primers and probes for detection of Influenza A, 2009 Influenza A (swine origin), and B viruses were selected from highly conserved regions of the matrix (M), nucleoprotein (NP), and non-structural (NS) genes, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for characterization and differentiation of seasonal influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, and A/H5 viruses were selected from highly conserved regions of their respective hemagglutinin (HA) genes.

Summary of Influenza testing process:

![](images/839ad232e9fa0ff02774c48a7f937bcf4062d4d7b81fdac5c6836f1037dcd25c.jpg)

# Interpretation of Results

# Extraction and Positive Control Results and Interpretation No Template Control (NTC)

The NTC consists of using nuclease-free water in the rRT-PCR reactions instead of RNA. The NTC reactions for all primer and probe sets should not exhibit fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line. If any of the NTC reactions exhibit a growth curve that crosses the cycle threshold, sample contamination may have occurred. Invalidate the run and repeat the assay with strict adherence to the guidelines.

# Pooled Influenza Positive Control (PIPC)

The PIPC consists of four different influenza viruses representing influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H1pdm09, and influenza B viruses suspended in cultured human cells (A549). Purified RNA from the PIPC will yield a positive result with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, and RP.

# H5 Virus Control (H5VC)

The H5VC control consists of a reassortant human vaccine candidate virus (A/Vietnam/1203/04 x PR/8/34) that was generated by reverse genetics and cultured human cell (A549) material. Purified RNA from the H5VC will yield a positive result with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, H5a, H5b, and RP.

# Human Specimen Control (HSC) (Extraction Control)

The HSC control consists of noninfectious cultured human cell (A549) material. The HSC is used as a RNA extraction procedural control to demonstrate successful recovery of RNA as well as extraction reagent integrity. Purified RNA from the HSC should yield a positive result with the RP primer and probe set and negative results with all influenza specific markers.

# Specimen Results and Interpretation

# RNase P (Extraction Control)

All clinical samples should exhibit fluorescence growth curves in the RNase P reaction that cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles $( < 3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ , thus indicating the presence of the human RNase P gene. Failure to detect RNase $\mathrm { P }$ in any clinical specimens may indicate:

Improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials resulting in loss of RNA and/or RNA degradation • Absence of sufficient human cellular material due to poor collection or loss of specimen integrity Improper assay set up and execution Reagent or equipment malfunction

If the RP assay does not produce a positive result for human clinical specimens, interpret as follows:

If the InfB or InfA along with H1, H3, pdm InfA, or pdm H1 are positive even in the absence of a positive RP, the influenza result should be considered valid. It is possible, that some samples may fail to exhibit RNase P growth

curves due to low cell numbers in the original clinical sample. A negative RP signal does not preclude the presence of influenza virus RNA in a clinical specimen.

If all influenza markers AND RNase P are negative for the specimen, the result should be considered inconclusive for the specimen. If residual specimen is available, repeat the extraction procedure and repeat the test. If all markers remain negative after re-test, report the results as inconclusive and a new specimen should be collected if possible.

The RP assay may be negative when testing virus culture samples.

# nfluenza Markers (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, H5a, and H5b)

When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered negative if all influenza marker (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, H5a, and H5b) cycle threshold growth curves DO NOT cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles $( < 3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ AND the RNase P growth curve DOES cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles $( < 3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ .

When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered positive for influenza if the influenza marker (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA and pdmH1) cycle threshold growth curve crosses the threshold line within 38.00 cycles $( < 3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ . The RNase P may or may not be positive as described above, but the influenza result is still valid. When testing tissue culture derived samples, the Rnase P result is likely to yield negative / not detected result due to the absence of the human RNase P target.

When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the growth curves for the influenza markers (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, H5a, and H5b) AND the RNase $\mathrm { P }$ marker DO NOT cross the cycle threshold growth curve within 38.00 cycles $( < 3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ , the result is inconclusive. The extracted RNA from the specimen should be re-tested. If residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from residual specimen and re-test. If the re-tested sample is negative for all markers and all controls exhibit the expected performance, the result is “Inconclusive.”

When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the cycle threshold growth curve for influenza A (InfA) marker ONLY crosses the threshold line within 38.00 cycles $( < 3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ without any subtype markers indicating detection (InfA positive without H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1 subtypes detected), the sample has potential for containing a novel and/or newly emerging influenza A virus. The extracted RNA from the specimen should be re-tested IMMEDIATELY. If the fresh unfrozen residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from the residual specimen and re-test. If the re-tested sample is again positive for InfA only and all controls exhibit the expected performance, the state public health laboratory director, or designee, should contact the CDC Influenza Division IMMEDIATELY at flusupport@cdc.gov to coordinate the transfer of the specimen to CDC as quickly as possible for confirmatory testing. NOTE: Do not test this sample using the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Assay unless the patient meets the current WHO epidemiological risk factors.

When all controls exhibit expected performance and growth curves for InfA, H5a   
AND H5b markers cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles $( < 3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ : • Report the specimen to be “Presumptive Positive for Influenza A/H5 Virus” and contact the CDC Influenza Division immediately to coordinate transfer of the specimen to CDC for additional testing.

When all controls exhibit the expected performance and growth curves for InfA and EITHER H5a OR H5b markers cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles ( $<$ $3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ , extracted RNA from the specimen should be re-tested immediately. If residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from residual specimen and re-test. If all controls exhibit the expected performance on the repeated test and either H5a OR H5b reactions cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles $( < 3 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { C t } )$ :

CDC Guidance for Public Health Follow-Up Actions Regarding Non-Standard Results with Influenza Subtyping

If a laboratory encounters subtyping results that do not coincide with the typical expected results of the Influenza A Subtyping Assay listed in the table above, please refer to the most current guidance from CDC on the criteria for referring specimens and samples to CDC for laboratory confirmation found at the following link: http://www.aphl.org/memberresources/Documents/MR_ID_InfluenzaSpecimenReferral Chart.pdf

If the result of the Influenza A Subtyping assay indicates an influenza A unsubtypeable AND the patient does not meet the WHO epidemiological risk factors for influenza A/H5, the Laboratory Director should contact CDC (flusupport@cdc.gov) or the CDC Influenza Epidemiology Division IMMEDIATELY after generating a repeated result. This result may be indicative of a novel or newly emerging influenza virus and any delay in contacting CDC may result in a critical loss of response time.

Standards-Based Electronic Laboratory Reporting for Influenza

# Background

This section contains the recommendations for uniform coding and vocabulary for CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. The following information is provided to assist the performing laboratory in complying with new federal guidelines for the meaningful use of electronic health information systems. The implementation of adopted standards should be harmonized across all performing laboratories to ensure semantic interoperability to better support electronic data exchange.

The CDC developer of this assay through collaboration has established Standard English terminology for the test name and test results with the testing community and expert knowledge of the processes involved. It is recognized that this terminology will differ in countries outside the United States. However, through the use of national and international agreements, it is possible to establish a universal set of codes and terms to accurately characterize laboratory observations. Recommendations in this package insert apply to the reporting of results of this assay only within the United States.

# Process for achieving uniformity in laboratory test results

The laboratory performing the influenza assay may utilize a Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) with connections to a hospital or medical system Electronic Health Record (EHR). The coding systems include LOINC - Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ -- http://www.loinc.org) and SNOMED CT – Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms (http://www.ihtsdo.org/). These coding systems have specific capabilities that are essential for achieving uniformity. The test request and results are to be incorporated into a standard Health Level 7 (HL7) electronic format for laboratory test messaging. More information about HL7 can be found at http://www.hl7.org.

LOINC provides for a common understanding of the medical procedure or process related to the specific assay, in this case the process of detecting the presence of influenza virus and the potential sub-typing of the detected influenza virus. The LOINC codes specified here describe the important information about the methodology employed by the assay; recovery and amplification of one or more RNA targets. Multiple LOINC codes are utilized to convey that the assay is composed of multiple components, i.e. it is a panel or a battery of subtests. In the case of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, the LOINC also provides for conveying that an interpretive test summary is appropriate.

SNOMED CT codes provide for unambiguous representation of the test results and allow the application of specific concepts such as “detected” or “positive” or the identification of detected organism names. Though not further defined in this document, SNOMED CT can also be used to provide for description of the type and source/ location of the specimen being tested or for conveying information about failures of the test procedure or the lack of adequate specimen.

# Specific Recommendations for Standards-Based Electronic Data Exchange for Influenza

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Please refer to previously FDA-cleared, 510(k) Premarket Notifications, K080570   
and K101564

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

There are no changes to the internal positive control, the human RNase P; Human Specimen Control (HSC); Influenza virus A/H5N1 Positive Control (H5VC) and No Template Control (NTC) for the New Assay. Please refer to previously FDAcleared 510(k) Premarket Notifications, K080570 and K101564 for further information.

A new positive control has been added in the new device, Pooled Influenza Positive Control (PIPC). It contains noninfectious positive control materials supplied as a liquid, $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ per vial, suspended in $0 . 0 1 { \bf M }$ phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 2 – 7 . 4$ . PIPC consists of four different beta-propiolactone inactivated influenza viruses (influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, and influenza B) suspended in cultured human cells (A549). PIPC will yield a positive result with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdm InfA, pdm H1, and RP.

An internal validation study was performed to confirm that it is acceptable to add A/H1N1pdm09 virus to the existing Seasonal Influenza Virus Control (SIVC) to create a new single control material for use with the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panels. A solution containing a 1:1 mixture of pdmPC (pdm positive control) and SIVC was assembled and tested in triplicate against InfA, InfB, H1, H3, RP, pdm InfA, and pdm H1 markers using procedures described in the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel

(IVD) package insert. The test was performed three times. A difference of less than 3 Cts was observed with each of the applicable subtype markers between the pdmPC, SIVC and the pooled mixture.

# 2009 – 2010 Study

Performance characteristics of the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel were established during a prospective study at eight U.S. public health laboratories and a Department of Defense (DoD) laboratory during the 2009-2010 respiratory virus season (February-April). A total of 1901 patient specimens collected for routine influenza testing were evaluated at the nine clinical sites: 1191 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and nasal swabs (NS), 50 throat swabs (TS), 519 nasal washes (NW) and nasal aspirates (NA), 99 dual nasopharyngeal swabs / throat swabs (NPS/TS), and 42 lower respiratory specimens. Due to low prevalence of influenza, retrospective specimens were used to supplement prospectively collected specimens.

The reference methods utilized in this study were virus culture followed by Immunofluorescent Antibody (IFA) or Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) for identification of influenza type and bi-directional sequencing for confirmation of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) subtype. InfA analyte results from the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel were compared to viral culture results in the analysis. Sequencing was performed only with specimens that were first identified as positive for influenza A by virus culture. Pdm InfA and pdm H1 analyte results from the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel were compared to bidirectional sequencing results in the analysis. Please refer to 510(k) Premarket Notification K101564 for additional information.

4. Clinical cut-off: N/A

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected values are derived from the clinical studies performed during the 2006-2007 (K080570), 2009-2010 (K101564).

From August 30, 2009, through March 27, 2010, World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories in the United States tested 422,648 specimens. Of these, 89,585 $( 2 1 . 1 \% )$ were positive: 89,298 $( 9 9 . 7 \% )$ were positive for influenza A and 287 $( 0 . 3 \% )$ were positive for influenza B. Among 66,978 influenza A viruses for which subtyping was performed, almost all (66,589 $[ 9 9 . 4 \% ]$ ) were 2009 HIN1 viruses.

During October 1, 2006--May 19, 2007, World Health Organization and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories in the United States tested 179,268 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses; 23,753 $( 1 3 . 2 \% )$ were positive. Of these, 18,817 $( 7 9 . 2 \% )$ were influenza A viruses and 4,936 $( 2 0 . 8 \% )$ were influenza B viruses. Among the influenza A viruses, 6,280 $( 3 3 . 4 \% )$ were subtyped; 3,912 $( 6 2 . 3 \% )$ were influenza A/H1 viruses and 2,368 $( 3 7 . 7 \% )$ were influenza A/H3 viruses (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtmlml/mm5631a2.htm). In the rRTPCR Flu Panel multi-center prospective clinical study during the 2006-2007 influenza season, the prevalence as determined by virus culture was as follows: influenza A/H1 $( 7 . 0 \% )$ , influenza A/H3 $( 2 3 . 6 \% )$ , and influenza B $( 9 . 9 \% )$ .
