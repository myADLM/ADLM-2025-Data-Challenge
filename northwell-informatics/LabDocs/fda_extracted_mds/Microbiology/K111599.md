# D. 510(k) Summary:

VITEK® ·2 Streptococcus Linezolid is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus species and is intended for use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Linezolid is a qualitative test. Linezolid has been shown to be active against most strains of the microorganisms listed below, according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial.

Active in vitro and in clinical infections   
Streptococcus agalactiae   
Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant isolates [MDRSP])   
Streptococcus pyogenes

The antimicrobial presented in VITEK® 2 AST-ST Cards is in concentrations equivalent by eficacy to standard method concentrations in mcg/ml.The VITE® 2 AST Cards are essentialy miniaturized versions of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) microdilution methodology.

The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration in $0 . 4 5 - 0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being us to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card.The VITEk® 2 automaticall fil, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual illing and sealing operation. The VITE $\mathsf { K } ^ { \otimes } \mathsf { 2 }$ monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours).At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.

$\mathsf { V I T E K } ^ { \otimes } \mathsf { 2 }$ AST-ST Linezolid demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, as defined in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA. Issued August 28, 2009.

The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of VITEK® 2 AST-ST Linezolid. An exteral evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates, as well as a set of challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the acceptability of VITEK® 2 AST-ST Linezolid by comparing its performance with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method incubated at 24 hrs. The data is representative of performance on both the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact instrument platforms. VITE $\mathsf { K } ^ { \odot } \mathsf { 2 }$ AST-ST Linezolid demonstrated acceptable performance of $9 9 . 8 \%$ E overall essential Agreement and $9 9 . 8 \%$ overall category agreement with the reference method. Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.

Dear Mr. Hardesty:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the-enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Acl. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls) it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice

requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address
