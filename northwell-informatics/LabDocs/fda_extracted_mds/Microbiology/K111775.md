Device Name: Trade Name:

JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit

Common Name:

Real-time PCR assay for detection of Influenza A and Influenza B

Classification Name:

Respiratory Viral Panel Multiplex Nucleic Acid Assay (CFR 866.3980)

# Intended Use

The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Influenza A & B Detection Kit is intended for use on the JBAIDS instruments, for the in vitro qualitative detection of Influenza A and Influenza B viral nucleic acids isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) specimens from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit contains reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays that target the Matrix protein gene of Influenza A viruses, and the Non-structural protein gene of Influenza B viruses. This kit is not intended to detect Influenza C viruses.

Test results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for detection of influenza A were established when 2009 H1N1 Influenza, Influenza A H1N1, and Influenza A H3N2 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. Due to low seasonal prevalence, performance characteristics for detection of seasonal Influenza A/H1 were established primarily with retrospective and surrogate clinical specimens. When other influenza A viruses are present, performance characteristics may vary.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting diagnostic results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by JBAIDS instructors or designees prior to use. Use of this device is limited to designated Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories equipped with the JBAIDS instruments.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a biosafety laboratory (BSL) $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# Device Description

The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit is a rRT-PCR test kit, which, when used with the JBAIDS instrument and software, allows the qualitative in vitro detection of influenza A and B viral RNA. These two assays have been optimized as freeze-dried assays with primer and fluorescent-probe sets for the detection of influenza A and B viral RNA. In particular, the influenza A assay targets a region of the matrix gene specific to the influenza A virus genera, and the influenza B assay targets a region of the non-structural gene specific to the influenza B virus genera. The tests are performed using the previously FDA-cleared JBAIDS instrument and software. A human gene target assay (RNAseP target) will be used as an inhibition and extraction control.

# Assay Principle

Before testing, NPS or NPW specimens are purified using Idaho Technology's 1-2-3TM Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit or the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I. The resulting purified sample is added to Unknown reagent vials and a Sample Control reagent vial, along with reconstitution buffer. When viral RNA is present, a fragment of influenza A or B viral RNA is transcribed and amplified. The amplicon is detected by fluorescence using a specific hydrolysis probe. Each probe is labeled on one end with a fluorescent reporter moiety (6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM)) and elsewhere with a quencher moiety (carboxy tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)). When the probe is intact, the quencher absorbs the light emitted by the reporter moiety. During PCR, the probe hybridizes to the target sequence before the exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase hydrolyzes the probe, separating the fluorophore from the quencher and permitting detection of the fluorescent signal generated by the reporter. The fluorescent signal increases as additional templates are amplified and more probes are hydrolyzed.

JBAIDS Software analyzes the fluorescence amplification curves and reports results as positive, negative, or uncertain. A failure of the Positive or Negative Control will result in the entire run being called invalid. Failure of the Sample Control yields a result of "sample control failure" when the associated sample has a negative result for the target assay. Retesting is required to resolve uncertain, invalid or sample control failure results.

# Substantial Equivalence

The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection System is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. The JBAIDS instrument has been previously cleared under K051713.

The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit is substantially equivalent to the CDC Human Influenza Virus real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel, which was cleared on September 30, 2008 under 510k# K080570.

The CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel is a panel of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis probes for the qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza viruses. The panel can be used to test upper respiratory tract specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW, NPS/TS) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum, and lung tissue) or virus culture.

Prior to testing, the samples are purified with one of four commercially available sample purification methods (see chart below). A PCR master mix is prepared by combining the appropriate quantities of primers and probes from the rRT-PCR Flu Panel with a commercially available reverse transcription enzyme master mix. The PCR master mix is aliquoted into a 96 well plate followed by addition of the purified samples and controls. The prepared plates are placed on an ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument and thermocycled according to the cycling conditions described in the rRT-PCR Flu Panel product insert.

Each run on the ABI includes a no-template control (nuclease-free water), a seasonal influenza virus control (influenza A/H1, A/H3 and influenza B with cultured human cells), an A/H5 virus control (noninfectious reassortant influenza A/H5 virus with cultured human cells) and a human specimen control (cultured human cells). The human specimen control is extracted with the test samples and is intended to ensure that the extraction process was properly performed. The notemplate, seasonal influenza virus and A/H5 virus control templates are added to the PCR plate prior to thermocycling.

At the conclusion of the run, the operator is required to set a baseline for all assays included in the run. The operator is then required to interpret the test results for each sample based on the results of the control and the Ct values for each sample.

# Summary of Performance Data

# Clinical Performance

The clinical performance of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit was evaluated during a prospective study at 5 geographically separated military clinical sites over the 2010-2011 influenza season (December 2010 to April 2011). Subjects with signs and/or symptoms of influenza-like illness were enrolled. Upon obtaining informed consent, NPS and NPW specimens were collected for JBAIDS and comparator testing. A total of 804 valid specimens were analyzed at the five study sites; 314 NPS and 490 NPW specimens. Table 3 provides a summary of demographic information for the 804 subjects that participated in the prospective study.

Of the 804 prospective specimens, successful results were obtained for $9 7 \%$ (778/804) of these specimens on the first attempt (Site $1 ; 3 5 6 / 3 7 6 = 9 5 \%$ Site $2 ; 2 0 3 / 2 0 7 = 9 8 \%$ Site 3 $5 6 / 5 6 = 1 0 0 \%$ ; Site $4 ; 1 1 8 / 1 1 9 = 9 9 \%$ ; Site 5 $: 4 5 / 4 6 = 9 8 \%$ . The remaining $3 \%$ (26/804) required retesting: "Invalid"(16/26), "Uncertain $\ " ( 0 / 2 6 )$ , "SC Failure"(5/26), positive for both the Flu A and Flu B assays (2/26), or were re-extracted and retested due to user labeling error (3/26) (20 samples from Site 1; 4 samples from Site 2; 0 samples from Site 3; 1 sample from Site 4; and 1 sample from Site 5). All 26 samples were resolved upon a subsequent retest.

Nucleic acid from each specimen was isolated using either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit (manual sample processing) or the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I (automated sample processing) and tested with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit. The performance of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit was evaluated by comparing the JBAIDS test results with the comparator/reference method. The reference method was the CDC rRT-PCT Flu Panel influenza A and influenza B assays. Specimens collected at each study site were split into single use aliquots for testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit (performed at each site) and the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel influenza A and influenza B assays (performed at Idaho Technology) to determine Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA). PPA was calculated as $100 \% \times$ $\mathrm { ( T P / / T P + }$ EPY FN)) and NPA was calculated as $100 \% \times$ $\left( \mathrm { T N } / \left( \mathrm { T N } + \mathrm { F P } \right) \right)$ . The exact binomial twosided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval was calculated for both performance measures. The results are summarized in Table 1.

Seasonal influenza A/H1 virus was not circulating during the 2010-2011 influenza season (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/) and was not detected during the prospective clinical study of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit. To supplement the results of the clinical study, an evaluation of preselected archived samples was performed. Due to the limited availability of archived specimens, the clinical performance was further supplemented with surrogate clinical contrived specimens.

# Testing of Preselected Archived Specimens

Additional testing of pre-selected archived clinical NPS specimen was performed at two different clinical study sites to supplement the prospective clinical testing data. Because it is possible that the archived samples had been misidentified or had degraded during storage or previous handling, the presence or absence of Influenza A/H1 viral RNA was confirmed using "validation" PCR assays. The validation PCR assays were identical to the comparator assays that were used for the prospective clinical evaluation study. A total of 51 NPS specimens were obtained and confirmed for testing: 30 known to be positive seasonal Influenza A/H1 specimens and 21 influenza-negative specimens. The specimens were split evenly for purification with the Platinum Path or MagNA Pure purification kits and then randomized such that the users performing the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit testing were blinded as to the expected test result.

Table 5 presents the PPA and NPA for the archived clinical specimens. Data from both extraction kits are combined due to identical performance.

Due to the absence of seasonal Influenza $A / H 1$ virus in circulation during the 2010-2011 influenza seasonal (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/) and lack of availability of archived NPW specimens for seasonal Influenza A/H1, contrived clinical samples (residual influenza negative NPS and NPW samples spiked with a known concentration of seasonal Influenza A/H1 virus) were used as a surrogate to further evaluate the performance of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.

# Testing of Surrogate Clinical Specimens

A total of 136 individual influenza-negative clinical specimens (68 NPS samples and 68 NPW samples) were spiked at a range of concentrations, including near the system limit of detection (LoD), as well as un-spiked, then randomized, and sent to two different clinical trial study sites for testing. Of the 136 surrogate samples included in this study, a valid JBAIDS test result was obtained for 128 samples (62 NPW and 66 NPS). The remaining 8 samples with invalid results could not be retested due to insufficient sample volume, and were not included in the analysis.

Table 3 presents the PPA and NPA for the surrogate clinical specimens. Half of the samples were extracted using the Platinum Path purification kit and half using the MagNA pure kit.

Analyses of the clinical data set, preselected archived specimens, and surrogate clinical specimens demonstrate that the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit is a sensitive and specific test system for the detection of influenza A and influenza B viruses.

# Selected Analytic Studies

# Limit of Detection

The analytical sensitivity or Limit of Detection (LoD) for each target assay (Flu A and Flu B) was determined using both NPS and NPW samples spiked with live, quantified virus strains. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration at which the target is consistently detected (detection is $2 9 5 \%$ of samples tested). Independent specimens from independent donors were spiked with each live virus strain and 20 replicates were tested at the LoD concentration. The LoD levels for representative virus strains detected by the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit are listed in Table 4.

# Inclusivity

The reactivity of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit assays was evaluated with an inclusivity panel consisting of 25 influenza A and 9 influenza B strains or isolates that represent the genetic, temporal, and geographic diversity of the influenza analytes. Each organism was tested in a simulated NPS sample matrix at or near the system LoD. Higher concentrations were tested if the analyte was not detected at the LoD. Each of the 34 influenza strains tested in this study was reactive with the appropriate JBAIDS influenza assays. Results from the inclusivity tested are presented in Table Error! No text of specified style in document. and Table 5. The concentration at which each strain was detected is indicated.

# Exclusivity

The analytical specificity, or exclusivity, of the JBAIDS influenza assays was evaluated by testing simulated NPS samples spiked with high concentrations of influenza viruses (tens to thousands-fold higher than LoD). No cross-reactivity was observed when high concentration of one influenza strain (e.g., influenza A) was tested with the alternate influenza assay (e.g., Flu B assay) at the concentrations listed in Table 6.

The non-influenza exclusivity panel consisted of 17 bacteria, 18 viruses, and 1 fungus, which were selected based on the relatedness to JBAIDS influenza analytes, clinical relevance (cause respiratory symptoms or represent nasopharyngeal flora), or high prevalence within the population (e.g. Herpes Simplex Virus). Simulated NPS samples were spiked with bacteria or fungi at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 6 } \dot { \mathrm { C F U / m L } }$ or $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ and viruses at a concentration between $1 0 ^ { 3 } - 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ copies/mL or $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ . The JBAIDS Influenza A and B assays did not cross-react with any of the organisms tested in the the exclusivity panel at the test concentrations listed in Table 7.

# Reproducibility

A multicenter study was performed to determine overall system reproducibility. Reproducibility testing occurred at three test sites, utilizing four total panels. Panels of NPS and NPW samples, each, were spiked with a representative influenza A virus (A/New Caledonia/20/1999). Panels of simulated NPS and simulated NPW samples, each, were spiked with a representative influenza B virus (B/Ohio/1/2005). Samples in each panel consisted of three samples that were spiked below LoD (high negative, LoD/20), at a low concentration of virus (low positive, LoD), and at a medium concentration of virus (medium positive, $3 { \times } \mathrm { L o D } )$ for a total of 9 samples per panel. Each panel was tested twice daily at each site for five days for a total of 30 results per sample and 90 results per spike level. The detection rate was $\geq 9 8 \%$ for samples containing influenza virus spiked at or above the LoD. As expected, samples spiked below LoD had variable results. Results are shown in Table 8 and Table 9.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number: k111775 Device Name: JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit

Indications for Use:

The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Influenza A & B Detection Kit is intended for use on the JBAIDS instruments, for the in vitro qualitative detection of Influenza A and Influenza B viral nucleic acids isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) specimens from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit contains reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR) assays that target the Matrix protein gene of Influenza A viruses, and the Non-structural protein gene of Influenza B viruses. This kit is not intended to detect Influenza C viruses.

Test results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for detection of influenza A were established when 2009 H1N1 Influenza, Influenza A H1N1, and Influenza A H3N2 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. Due to low seasonal prevalence, performance characteristics for detection of seasonal Influenza A/H1 were established primarily with retrospective and surrogate clinical specimens. When other influenza A viruses are present, performance characteristics may vary.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting diagnostic results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by JBAIDS instructors or designees prior to use. Use of this device is limited to designated Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories equipped with the JBAIDS instruments.

4

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a biosafety laboratory (BSL) $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
