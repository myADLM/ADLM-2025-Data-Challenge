# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

# INTENDED USE

# BD MAX™M GBS AsSay:

The BD MAX™ GBS Assay as implemented on the BD MAX™ System is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed to detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA in Lim Broth cultures, after incubation for greater than or equal to () 18 hours, obtained from vaginal-rectal swab specimens from antepartum pregnant women. The test incorporates automated DNA extraction to isolate the target nucleic acid from the specimen and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect a 4 p region of the cb gene sequence of the Streptococcus agalactiae chromosome. Results from the BD MAX™ GBS Assay can be used as an aid to determining colonization status in antepartum women.

The BD MAX™ GBS Assay does not provide susceptibility results. Cultured isolates are necessary for performing susceptibility testing as recommended for penicillin-allergic women. Subculture to solid media for additional testing when indicated.

# BD MAX™ System:

The BD MAX™System s intended or in vit diagnostic IVD)use in perorigDA clea approved nucleic acid testing in clinical laboratories. The BD MAX System is capable of automated extraction and purification of nucleic acids from multiple specimen types, as well as the automated amplification and detection of target nucleic acid sequences by fluorescence-based PCR.

# SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION OF THE PROCEDURE

A vaginal-rectal swab is collected and transported to the laboratory using standard bacterial swab transport systems containing a non-nutritive transport medium (e.. Amies or Stuart). In the lab, the swab is removed from the transport medium and placed into selective Lim Broth [Todd-Hewitt Broth supplemented with colistin (10ug/mL) and nalidixic acid $( 1 5 | | \mathfrak { g } / \mathfrak { m } | \} ]$ After incubation of inoculated Lim Broth culture for ≥ 18 hours at $3 7 \circ 0$ in ambient air or $5 \% 0 2 ,$ a 15 µL aliquot of the broth is mixed with BD MAX GBS Sample Preparation Reagent and processed on the BD MAX System using the BD MAX GBS Assay. The BD MAX System automatically extracts the target nucleic acid and amplifies a section of the cfb gene sequence of the GBS chromosome, if present. The BD MAX GBS Assay includes an Internal Process Control to monitor for the presence of potential inhibitory substances as well as system or reagent failures that may be encountered during the entire process.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram positive bacterium that causes invasive disease primarily in infants, pregnant or postpartum women, and older adults, with the highest incidence among young infants. GBS is the leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality among infants in the United States. As a result of prevention efforts, incidence of GBS has declined dramatically over the past 15 years, from 1.7 cases per 1,000 live births in the early 1990's to 0.34 - 0.37 cases per 1,000 live births in recent years. CDC estimates that in recent years, GBS has caused

apoimately ,200 cases early-onset invasiv isease per year approiaely $70 \%$ of cases are among babies born at term (≥ 37 weeks' gestation).1

Early-onset infections are acquired vertically through exposure to GBS from the vagina of a colonized woman. Neonatal infection occurs primarily when GBS ascends from the vagina to the amniotic fluid after onset of labor or rupture of membranes, although GBS also can invade through intact membranes. Infants with early-onset GBS disease generally present with respiratory distress, apnea, or other signs of sepsis within the first 24 - 48 hours of life. The most common clinical syndromes of early—onset disease are sepsis and pneumonia; less frequently, early-onset infections can lead to meningitis. Mortality is higher among preterm infants, with case-fatality rates of approximately $20 \%$ and as high as $30 \%$ among those ≤33 weeks' gestation, compared with $2 \%$ - $3 \%$ among full-term infants.1

The current standard of care for preventing neonatal GBS disease is screening pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation to determine their GBS colonization status. Most GBS testing is performed by culture and can take up to 48 hours for definitive identification of GBS following the initial $\geq 1 8$ hour incubation of vaginal-rectal swabs in a selective broth medium. The BD MAX GBS Assay, as implemented on the BD MAX System, can provide results from up to 24 specimens in approximately two and a half hours after the initial $\geq 1 8$ hour incubation/enrichment step. The BD MAX GBS Assay streamlines and simplifies the testing process by eliminating the need for operator intervention from the time the sample is placed onto the BD MAX System until results are available.

# SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE

The BD MAX GBS Assay when performed in conjunction with the 2nd Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System is substantially equivalent to the BD MAX GBS Assay performed on the predicate device; the 1st Generation BD MAX (2 channel) System. Both systems detect Group B Streptococcus DNA; both systems use an automatic analysis system to determine the presence of GBS DNA through real time PCR and fluorogenic detection of the cfb gene. The types of probe are the same and both systems use an automated preparation method. Table 1 provides an upperlevel comparison of the two systems.

# PERFORMANCE DATA

# Precision

Qualitative testing was performed over a 12 day period in order to determine within laboratory precision using the BD MAX GBS Assay on the $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System. Precision was determined across instruments as well. For consistency, testing was performed using the same lot of BD MAX GBS Assay. Panel members were prepared at five levels, which included four concentrations of GBS along with True Negative (TN) samples. The levels of the panel members were determined by relation to the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the assay. The Moderate Positive (MP) sample was at a concentration of \~3X LoD, the Low Positive (LP) sample was at a level of \~1.5X LoD, the High Negative 2 (HN-2) sample was at a \~10 fold dilution of the Lo and the High Negative 1 (HN-1) sample was at a \~100 fold dilution of the LoD. Four replicates of each panel member were tested over a 12 day period with two runs per day on three different instruments by multiple operators.

# Reproducibility

Qualitative testing was performed in order to determine reproducibility using the BD MAX GBS Assay on the 2nd Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System. Reproducibility was determined within site as well as across sites. Panel members were prepared at four levels, which included three concentrations of GBS along with True Negative (TN) samples. The levels of the panel members were determined by relation to the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the assay. The Moderation Positive (MP) sample was at a concentration of $- 3 X$ LoD, the Low Positive (LP) sample was at a level of \~ 1X LoD, the High Negative (HN) sample was at a concentration of \~ 50 fold dilution of the LoD. Five replicates of each panel member were tested at 3 sites across 6 runs over a minimum of a 3 day period.

# Carry Over/ Cross Contamination

A study was conducted using the BD MAX GBS Assay on the 2nd Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System to investigate within-run carry over, between-run carry over and Top/Bottom PCR Cartridge Row carry over. All High Positive samples that gave a valid result were accurately identified as positive while all of the True Negative samples that gave a valid result were accurately identifid as negative.

# Interfering Substances

In order to characterize the ability of the BD MAX GBS assay to detect GBS DNA in the presence of both endogenous and exogenous interfering agents, the assay was tested using the 2nd Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System. The study was performed at GBS concentrations of 300 CFU/mL and 3000 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent. Interference was also studied in the presence of high concentrations of 127 relevant non-target organisms to determine if the detection of GBS at 300 CFU/mL was affected by the presence of these organisms. The following exogenous interfering substances were tested: miconazole (fungicide), hemorrhoid cooling gel, deodorant spray, lubricating gel, moisturizing lotion, body oil and body powder. A complete swab of exogenous agent, similar to the collection of a GBS swab, was added to negative LIM broth and released into the specimen. The specimen (15 uL) with the interfering agent was added to the Sample Preparation Reagent tube. The following endogenous substances were tested: human DNA $( 1 . 5 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ Sample Preparation Reagent), whole blood ( $10 \%$ in Lim), urine $( 3 0 \%$ in Lim), mucus (one swab in Lim), amniotic fluid ( $10 \%$ in Lim), and feces (one swab in Lim).

BD MAX GBS Assay Migration 510(k) Summary

In all cases, the BD MAX GBS Assay detected GBS at concentrations of 300 CFU/mL and 3000 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent in the presence of the endogenous and exogenous substances tested. Three non-target organisms, Achromobacter xerosis, Enterobacter cloacae and Hohiusnfzadowveremosrapotenial nterenchenil syA epanded study was conducted in which twenty (20) replicates o each potential interferent was tested on the $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ Generation BD MAX System. No interference was observed across the 20 replicates of A. xerosis and H. influenzae. Interference (2/20 replicates) was observed in the presence of E. cloaecae when tested at a GBS target concentration of 300 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent.

# Analytical Sensitivity/Limit of Detection Study

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the BD MAX GBS Assay with the 1st Generation BD MAX (2 channel) System is 200 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent as determined by the hit rate $( 9 5 \%$ positivity) method. Pooled Clinical Negative samples spiked with GBS culture (ATCC Strain 27579) and individual clinical negative specimens spiked with GBS culture were used in the determination of LoD. To confirm the analytical sensitivity of the BD MAX GBS Assay with the nd Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System, 64 replicates of ATCC Strain 27579 were tested at concentrations of 200 CFU/mL and 165 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent. The detection rate was $100 \%$ and $9 8 \%$ , respectively.

An additional study, using the methods described previously, was performed to establish and confirm the LoD of the BD MAX GBS Assay with a second GBS strain. The results of this study indicated that the BD MAX GBS Assay when tested with GBS Strain ATCC 13813 on the New System demonstrated a LoD of 160 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent.

# Microbial Variants

The ability of the BD MAX GBS Assay to detect multiple GBS serotypes was demonstrated using 12 different strains of GBS bacteria. The BD MAX GBS Assay with the 2nd Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System was able to detect all major serotypes of GBS at 300 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent (3 x 104 CFU/mL incubated Lim broth culture).

# Analytical Specificity

To confirm the analytical specificity of the BD MAX GBS Assay when performed on the 2nd Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System, the assay was tested on samples containing high levels of non-target organisms. A total of 127 organisms were tested, including 11 organisms phylogenetically similar to Group B Streptococcus and a wide variety of other organisms including viruses, fungi and parasites that are known to infect the urogenital tract or are part of urogenital microflora.The following concentrations of non-target organisms were tested: bacterial and ungal organisms at ${ \sim } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent, viral organisms at $> 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 . 5 }$ EPY TCID5o/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent, and DNA stocks at \~3ng/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent. In the initial study, potential cross-reactivity was observed with nine (9) organisms (Aerococcus viridians, Candida albicans, Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus jensenii, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and with human DNA.

An expanded study was conducted in which twenty (20) replicates of each potential cross-reactant were tested on the 2nd Generation BD MAX System. No reactivity (0/20) was observed with the C. albicans, D. radiodurans, L. jensenii, S. pyogenes or human DNA samples. Reactivity was observed with A. viridians (1/20), E. durans (1/20), P. aeruginosa (1/20), P. stuartii (2/20) and P. vugaris (4/20). P. aeruginosa, P. stuarti and P. vulgaris are gram negative organisms. Lim broth enrichment is designed to suppress growth of gram negative organisms.

# Clinical Performance/Comparison Study

Performance characteristics of the BD MAX GBS Assay on the $2 ^ { n d }$ Generation BD MAX (6 channel) System were compared to the characteristics of the assay on the 1st Generation BD MAX (2 channel) System in a 3-site Comparison Study. The Comparison Study panel was comprised of 214 non-contrived, clinical samples prepared internally from residual, clinical Lim Broth specimens obtained from five (5) clinical laboratories that had inoculated each vaginal-rectal swab specimen in Lim Broth and then incubated overnight for $> 1 8$ hours. The panel was tested on three (3) 1st Generation BD MAX (2 channel) Systems at a single internal site and on three (3) 2nd Generation BD MAX (6 channel) Systems at each of two (2) external sites as well as one (1) internal site. The GBS status of each sample was determined by the result generated by the 1st Generation BD MAX (2 channel) System. In the event of a discordant or IND result, the result generated by two (2) of the three (3) 1st Generation instruments determined the GBS status. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) were calculated. Results are presented in Table 2.
