# I. Device Description:

The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which contains only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 - 0 . 5 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals, and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.

The VITEK 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin has the following concentrations in the card: 1, 2, 4, and $1 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ . The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is $\leq 0 . 1 2 - \geq 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# L. Test Principle:

Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card. The VITEK 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin has the following concentrations in the card: 1, 2, 4, and $1 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is $\leq 0 . 1 2 - \geq 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was conducted at three external clinical sites. Ten Streptococcus species isolates were tested at each site and testing was performed in triplicate over three days with the VITEK 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin card. The testing was performed using both the manual dilution method and the automated dilution mode. Testing was conducted on the VITEK 2 instrument.

For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.

The overall reproducibility was $59 5 \%$ with $+ / -$ one dilution observation for the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact system. Only Manual Dilution testing was conducted since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a functionality to support automatic dilution to inoculate the card. Results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended Streptococcus pneumonia QC organism was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System. Ancillary quality control testing was also performed. Two gram-positive organisms were tested throughout comparative testing at each study site by the reference method only. This was done to perform further quality control of the broth microdilution panels using $E .$ . faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 which have a QC range of $1 { - } 4 ~ { \mu } \mathrm { g / m L }$ and $0 . 2 5 { \cdot } 1 ~ { \mu } \mathrm { g / m L }$ , respectively.

The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.

Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System. Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.

Quality Control Results with the VITEK 2 System for Erythromycin were as follows:

\* VITEK Card Result Range $\mathbf { i s } \leq 0 . 1 2 5 - \geq 8$

The Quality control organism was in control in the reference on all days. Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation dilution were at $\leq 0 . 1 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ~ 1 0 0 \%$ of the time.

A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System. Results were compared to the expected FDA/CLSI QC results. All results for the VITEK 2 Compact System were within the expected QC ranges $100 \%$ of the time.

Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek2 instrument. This was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected range.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at four external study sites. A total of 1103 clinical isolates were tested by VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin with the VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 System. The majority of the isolates were recently isolated from clinical specimens. One hundred and ninety six of the 1103 clinical isolates tested were stock isolates $( 1 7 . 8 \% )$ . A challenge set consisting of 112 isolates was evaluated with VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin. Testing of clinical isolates was performed using the automated method of inoculation and the challenge organisms were tested with both the manual dilution and automatic dilution. Each isolate was tested by the VITEK 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin and the CLSI broth microdilution reference method. The inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the following agreement. Three very major errors and three major errors were seen. The error rates are acceptable based on the recommended performance in the AST Guidance Document. No growth was observed in 9 isolates.
