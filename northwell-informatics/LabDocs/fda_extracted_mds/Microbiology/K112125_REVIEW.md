# I. DeviceDescription:

The iIlumigene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Molecular Diagnostic Test System is comprised of the illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA Amplification Test Kit, the illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) External Control Kit and the illumipro- $I { \boldsymbol { 0 } } ^ { \mathrm { { r m } } }$ Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection System. The illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA amplification assay utilizes loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology to detect the presence of Streptococcus agalactiae in enriched cultures obtained from vaginal/rectal swab specimens taken from antepartum women. Each illumigene® GBS assay is completed using illumigene® Control Reagent, illumigene® Reaction Buffer, an illumigene® GBS Test Device and an illumigene® Heat Treatment Tube. Samples are diluted with the illumigene® control heat‐treatment in the illumigene® Heat Treatment Tube and DNA amplification occurs in the illumigene® GBS Test Device.

The illumipro- $I { \boldsymbol { 0 } } ^ { \mathrm { { r m } } }$ heats each illumigene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ GBS Test Device containing prepared samples and Control Reagent, facilitating amplification of target DNA. When S. agalactiae is present in the enriched culture sample, a conserved sequence of the S. agalactiae is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is formed. Magnesium pyrophosphate forms a precipitate in the reaction mixture. The illumipro- $1 0 ^ { \mathrm { ^ { \dag \check { M } } } }$ detects the change in light transmission through the reaction mixture created by the precipitating magnesium pyrophosphate. Sample results are reported as Positive or Negative based on the detected change in light transmission.

The illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) External Control Kit consists of a Positive Control Reagent and a Negative Control Reagent. External Control reagents are provided to aid the user in detection of reagent deterioration, adverse environmental or test conditions, or variance in operator performance that may lead to test errors.

# L. Test Principle:

The illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Assay is based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification technology (LAMP). Loop-mediated amplification is accomplished by the use of specially designed primers that provide specific and continuous isothermal DNA amplification. Magnesium-pyrophosphate is produced as a by-product of LAMP amplification. The magnesium-pyrophosphate forms a white precipitate in the reaction solution, giving the reaction solution a turbid appearance. The presence of turbidity signifies a positive reaction while the absence of turbidity represents a negative reaction.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

For Meridian’s reproducibility studies, blind coded panels of 10 samples were supplied to three independent laboratories. Samples were randomly sorted within each panel to mask sample identities. The panels included contrived samples manufactured near the assay limit of detection (i.e., low positive samples), $\mathtt { n } = 3$ and high negative samples, $\mathtt { n } = 3$ . The panels also included contrived positive $( \mathtt { n } = 3 )$ ) samples and natural negative samples $( \mathtt { n } = 1 )$ ). Testing was performed by different operators at each site on the same day (intra‐assay variability) for five days (inter‐assay variability). Three lots of illumigene GBS and five illumipro- $\cdot I \dot { 0 } ^ { \mathrm { \scriptsize ^ { T M } } }$ instruments were used in this study. The results are given in the table below:

Reproducibility studies are acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable as this assay is qualitative c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability:

Sample storage and hold time studies were performed to characterize illumigene® Group B Streptococcus assay ranges. Validation studies performed at Meridian indicated that Lim broth represented the worst-case matrix; therefore all samples except two were prepared from enriched Lim medium. The latter two samples (one high negative and one LoD positive sample) were prepared from TransVag broth. Results demonstrated that undiluted samples can be held at $1 9 { - } 2 7 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 6 hours or at $2 { - } 8 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 7 days after culture enrichment and prior to testing. Samples diluted with illumigene® Control Reagent can be held at room temperature for up to 15 minutes prior to heat-treatment. Heat-treated samples can be held at room temperature for up to 45 minutes prior to further processing.

Sample freeze/thaw studies were also performed. Samples were enriched 18-24 hours in enrichment broth and frozen prior to initiation of testing, then exposed to multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Results demonstrated that freeze/thaw of samples should not be done.

Final testing demonstrated that Lim Broth in combination with Dacron/polyester, flocked nylon, and foam swab types perform acceptably with the illumigene® GBS assay. The Amies Clear swab type has been identified in the Limitations section of the Package Insert as an incompatible swab type with the illumigene® GBS assay.

# d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity studies were designed to determine the analytical limit of detection of S. agalactiae diluted in Lim broth. Six common strains of S. agalactiae, representing six different serotypes, were evaluated using the illumigene® GBS assay. Each strain was spiked into negative Lim broth and then diluted serially. A minimum of twenty replicates of each dilution were individually processed and tested to establish LoD. Testing was performed using three production lots of illumigene® GBS and six illumipro- $I { \boldsymbol { 0 } } ^ { \mathrm { { r m } } }$ instruments. External Positive and Negative Controls were tested each day throughout the study.

The LoD of the assay ranged from 60 CFU/Test to 1280 CFU/Test. The table below shows the lowest concentration for each serotype that produced positive results for $9 5 \%$ of the replicates tested.

Additional S. agalactiae strains were tested and produced positive reactions at 1280 CFU/test with illumigene® GBS. Strains and serotypes were tested as follows: Serotype IV: NCTC 11930; Serotype VIa: NCTC 08188; Serotype VII: VII/2; Serotype VIII: VIII/2; Serotype X: NCTC 11249; Unknown Serotype: ATCC 13813 and ATCC12386.

LoD studies are acceptable.

Interference Testing:

Selected substances that might be expected to be present in vaginal/rectal swab samples taken from antepartum women were added to a negative Lim broth sample and two contrived positive Lim broth samples. The negative sample was prepared by pooling confirmed negative Lim Broth samples while the contrived positive samples were prepared by spiking a pooled, confirmed negative Lim sample with either Streptococcus agalactiae, strain 11248 Serotype Ia (123 CFU/test) or Streptococcus agalactiae, strain 12401 Serotype Ib (80 CFU/test). Potentially interfering substances were added to Lim broth samples at final concentrations of $2 . 5 \% \ \mathrm { v / v }$ or greater when the substances could be pipetted. Substances that could not be pipetted were coated onto cotton swabs, immersed in the negative/positive Lim broth samples and tested. Dilution Controls were prepared by adding a phosphate buffered saline solution in place of the potentially cross‐reactive organisms. Each inoculated sample was tested in triplicate.

Results demonstrated that the following substances, at the specified saturated solvent/diluents concentrations, do not interfere with illumigene® Group B Streptococcus test results: Amniotic fluid $( 1 0 \% \mathrm { v / v ) }$ , Human DNA $( 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / T e s t ) }$ , Urine $( 3 0 \% \mathrm { v / v } )$ , Whole Blood $( 2 . 5 \% \ \mathrm { v / v } )$ , Meconium, Stool, Hemorrhoid cream $( 3 0 . 6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / 1 0 0 m g ) }$ ), Miconazole (fungicide), Mucin $( 0 . 5 { - } 1 . 5 \% )$ , Spermicidal gel (nonoxynol 9) $( 4 \mathrm { m g } / 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g } )$ . Lubricating gel produced False Negative Results in 1 of 11 replicates tested. Body Powder produced False Negative Results in 1 of 10 replicates tested. Whole Blood at concentrations greater than $2 . 5 \% \ \mathrm { v / v }$ interferes with the illumigene® GBS assay.

Interference studies are acceptable.

# Cross-reactivity Study:

Microorganisms that could potentially cross-react, expected to be present in vaginal/rectal swab specimens were added to negative and contrived positive Lim Broth samples. The negative sample was prepared by pooling confirmed negative Lim Broth samples. The contrived positive sample was prepared by spiking a confirmed negative matrix with Streptococcus agalactiae, strain 12401, at 122 CFU/test, near the limit of detection for this strain. Potentially cross-reactive microorganisms were added at concentrations of $1 . \dot { 2 } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ (bacteria and fungi) and virus at a minimum of $1 \mathrm { \Delta x 1 0 ^ { 5 } T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ . Dilution controls for each sample were prepared by adding sterile saline solution in place of the potentially crossreactive microorganisms. Each sample was tested in triplicate. Crossreactivity with Enterococcus dispar was observed in one of seven replicates tested.

# 3. Clinical Studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Clinical trials for the illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) assay, including the illumipro $\mathbf { \nabla } _ { \mathbf { T M } } \mathbf { \nabla } _ { - } 1 0$ Automated Isothermal amplification and detection system, were conducted. Performance characteristics of the illumigene® GBS assay were determined by comparison to GBS bacterial culture. Four independent clinical test sites located in the Midwestern and Southern regions of the United States evaluated a total of 826 qualified patient samples. Samples were obtained according to established guidelines for the collection of clinical specimens for culture of Group B Streptococcus and enriched for 18‐24 hours in either Lim Broth or TransVag Broth prior to illumigene® testing. Four hundred and three $( 4 8 . 8 \% )$ specimens were enriched with Lim Broth and 423 $( 5 1 . 2 \% )$ specimens were enriched with TransVag Broth prior to testing. The age groups of patients tested ranged from 15 years of age to 44 years of age, with age unknown for three $( 0 . 4 \% )$ of the patient population. No differences in test performance were observed based on enrichment medium or patient age. Overall assay Sensitivity is reported as $9 7 . 4 \%$ $[ 9 5 \%$ CI: $9 1 . 9 \% - 9 9 . 0 \% ]$ where Specificity is $9 2 . 3 \%$ $[ 9 5 \%$ CI: $9 0 . 0 \%$ ‐ $9 4 . 1 \% ]$ .

# N. Instrument Name

illumipro-10™

# O. System Descriptions:

System Description was reviewed in previous submission, K100818 and K110012.   
No systems or software changes were made.

1. Modes of Operation:

The illumipro™-10 heats each illumigene® GBS Test Device containing prepared samples and Control Reagent, facilitating amplification of target DNA. When S. agalactiae is present in the enriched culture sample, a conserved sequence of the S. agalactiae is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is formed. Magnesium pyrophosphate forms a precipitate in the reaction mixture. The illumipro™-10 detects the change in light transmission through the reaction mixture created by the precipitating magnesium pyrophosphate.
