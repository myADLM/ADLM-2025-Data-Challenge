The $\mathrm { P r o F l u ^ { T M \mathrm { + } } }$ Assay is a multiplex Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid and qualitative detection and discrimination of Influenza A Virus, Influenza B Virus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) nucleic acids isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients. This test is intended for use to aid in the differential diagnosis of Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV viral infections in humans and is not intended to detect Influenza C.

Negative results do not preclude influenza or RSV virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. It is recommended that negative RSV results be confirmed by culture.

Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3 and A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# Intended Use:

The Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay is a multiplex Real Time RTPCR assay for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and influenza B viral infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The assay does not detect the presence of influenza C virus.

Negative results do not preclude Influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2010-2011 influenza season when influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 influenza were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# Device Description:

The Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient sample using the NucliSENS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ easyMAG $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ automated extraction platform. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions in a single tube generating amplicons for each of the target viruses present in the sample. This reaction is performed utilizing the Applied Biosystems $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 7500 Fast Dx platform. Identification of influenza A occurs by the use of target specific primers and a fluorescentlabeled probe that hybridizes to a conserved influenza A sequence within the matrix protein gene. Identification of influenza B occurs by the use of target specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that will hybridize to a conserved influenza B sequence within the neuraminidase gene.

The following is a summary of the procedure:

1. Sample Collection: Obtain nasal swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens using standard techniques from symptomatic patients. These specimens are transported, stored, and processed according to established laboratory procedures.

2. Nucleic Acid Extraction: Extract Nucleic Acids from the specimens with the NucliSENS easyMAG System following the manufacturer's instructions using the appropriate reagents. Use of other extraction systems with the Quidel Molecular Influenza $A + B$ kit has not been validated. Validation of these systems is the responsibility of the end-user.

Prior to the extraction procedure add $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the Process Control (PRC) to each $1 8 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquot of specimen. The PRC serves to monitor inhibitors in the extracted specimen, assures that adequate amplification has taken place and that nucleic acid extraction was sufficient.

3. Rehydration of Master Mix: Rehydrate the lyophilized Master Mix using $1 3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of Rehydration Solution. The Master Mix contains oligonucleotide primers, fluorophore and quencher-labeled probes targeting highly conserved regions of the influenza A and influenza B viruses as well as the process control sequence. The primers are complementary to highly specific and conserved regions in the genome of these viruses. The probes are dual labeled with a reporter dye attached to the 5-end and a quencher attached to the $_ { 3 } \colon$ -end. The rehydrated Master Mix is sufficient for eight reactions.

4. Nucleic Acid Amplification and Detection: Add $1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { L } }$ of the rehydrated Master Mix to each reaction plate well. ${ 5 \mu \mathrm { L } }$ of extracted nucleic acids (specimen with PRC) is then added to the plate well. Then place the plate into the ABI 7500 FastDx.

Once the plate is added to the instrument, the assay protocol is initiated. This protocol initiates reverse transcription of the RNA targets generating complementary DNA, and the subsequent amplification of the target amplicons occur. The Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay is based on TaqMan $^ { \textregistered }$ chemistry, and uses an enzyme with reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, and $5 ^ { \prime } { - } 3 ^ { \prime }$ exonuclease activities. During DNA amplification, this enzyme cleaves the probe bound to the complementary DNA sequence, separating the quencher dye from the reporter dye. This step generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation by a light source of the appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional dye molecules are separated from their quenchers resulting in additional signal. If sufficient fluorescence is achieved by 35 cycles during the data collection stage of amplification, the sample is reported as positive for the detected nucleic acid.

# Analytical Performance:

# Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A and B assay was evaluated at 3 laboratory sites. Reproducibility was assessed using a panel of 4 simulated samples that included medium $( 5 \mathrm { x } ~ \mathrm { L o D } )$ , low (2x LoD), high negative (.3x LoD) levels of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and negative samples. Panels and controls were tested at each site by 2 operators for 5 days (triplicate testing $_ { \textrm { x 2 } }$ operators x 5 days x 3 sites $= 9 0$ results per level for each virus). The panels and controls were extracted using the bioMérieux easyMAG system and tested on the ABI 7500Fast Dx.

Ct values for positive tests

The data from the combined sites indicates that the Quidel Molecular assay generates reproducible results for both influenza A and influenza B viruses when tested with the ABI 7500 Fast Dx.

# Limit of Detection

The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { \ + } \mathbf { B }$ assay was determined using quantified $\mathrm { ( T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L ) }$ cultures of 3 influenza A strains (1 H1N1, 1 2009H1N1 and 1 H3N2), and 3 influenza B strains, serially diluted in negative nasopharyngeal matrix. Each dilution was extracted in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus using the NucliSENS easyMAG System and tested on the Applied Biosystems $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 7500 Fast Dx platform. Analytical sensitivity (LoD) is defined as the lowest concentration at which $9 5 \%$ of all replicates tested positive.

# Clinical Performance:

A total of 1062 specimens were evaluated in this study (686-fresh, 376-frozen). Of the fresh specimens 373 specimens were nasal swabs, and 313 were nasopharyngeal swabs. The frozen specimens were comprised of 376 nasopharyngeal swabs.

Prospective Clinical Study

Six hundred and eighty six (686) fresh specimens (373 nasal swabs and 313 nasopharyngeal swabs) were tested by both the subject and comparator device for influenza A and influenza B virus viral RNA. Four of these specimens were invalid on initial testing with the subject device $( 0 . 6 \% )$ .Re-testing of the specimens according to the Interpretation algorithm described above also yielded invalid results. Seventeen specimens were invalid on initial and repeat testing (as per the device's PI) on the comparator device $( 2 . 5 \% )$ . Three specimens were invalid in both devices; therefore, a total 18 specimens were removed from additional analysis. The table below details the results for the remaining 668 specimens.

\*Twelve specimens were negative by FDA Cleared RT-PCR device but positive for influenza B by sequence analysis.

The prospective clinical study had a dual infection rate for Influenza A and Influenza B of $1 . 8 \%$ (12/668) using the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ EPY Assay. Three of these dual infections were concordant with the FDA Cleared RT-PCR device comparator assay. Five of these dual infections were discordant with the Influenza A results from the FDA Cleared RT-PCR device comparator assay. Four of these dual infections were discordant with the Influenza B results from the FDA Cleared RT-PCR device comparator assay.

# Retrospective Study

Three hundred and seventy six (376) frozen nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by both the subject and comparator devices for influenza A and influenza B virus viral RNA. Two of these specimens were invalid on initial testing with the subject device $( 0 . 5 \% )$ . Re-testing of the specimens according to the Interpretation algorithm described above also yielded invalid results. Two specimens were invalid on initial and repeat testing (as per the device's PI) on the comparator device $( 0 . 5 \% )$ . The invalid specimens were removed from performance analyses. The table below details the results for the remaining 372 specimens.

# 510(k) Number (if known): k112172

# Device Name: Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ Assay

# Indication for Use:

The Quidel Molecular Influenza ${ \bf A } { + } { \bf B }$ assay is a multiplex Real Time RT-PCR assay for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and influenza B viral infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The assay does not detect the presence of influenza C virus.

Negative results do not preclude Influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2010-2011 influenza season when influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 influenza were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
