# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Quidel® Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ Assay is a multiplex Real Time RT-PCR assay for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and influenza B viral infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The assay does not detect the presence of influenza C virus.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2010- 2011 influenza season when influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 influenza were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements:

Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 FAST Dx (software version 1.4)

# I. Device Description:

The assay detects influenza A and influenza B viral RNA that has been extracted from a patient sample using the NucliSENS® easyMAG® automated extraction platform. A multiplex RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions in a single tube generating amplicons for each of the target viruses present in the sample. This reaction is performed utilizing the Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx platform. Identification of influenza A occurs by the use of target specific primers and a fluorescent- labeled probe that hybridizes to a conserved region within the matrix protein gene. Identification of influenza B occurs by the use of target specific primers and a fluorescent-labeled probe that hybridizes to a conserved influenza B sequence within the neuraminidase gene.

The following is a summary of the procedure:

1. Sample Collection: Obtain nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal swabs using standard techniques from symptomatic patients. These specimens are transported, stored, and processed according to established laboratory procedures.

2. Nucleic Acid Extraction: Extract viral RNA from the specimens with the NucliSENS easyMAG System following the manufacturer’s instructions and using the appropriate reagents. Prior to the extraction procedure add $2 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the Process Control (PRC) to each $1 8 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquot of specimen. The PRC serves to monitor inhibitors in the extracted specimen, assures that adequate amplification has taken place and confirms that the nucleic acid extraction was sufficient.

3. Rehydration of Master Mix: Rehydrate the lyophilized Master Mix using the Rehydration Solution. The Master Mix contains oligonucleotide primers, fluorophore and quencher-labeled probes targeting highly conserved regions of the influenza A and influenza B viruses as well as the PRC sequence. The primers are complementary to highly specific and conserved regions in the genome of these viruses. The probes are dual labeled with a reporter dye attached to the $5 '$ end and a quencher attached to the $3 ^ { \circ }$ end.

4. Nucleic Acid Amplification and Detection: Add $1 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the rehydrated Master Mix to each plate well. $5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of extracted nucleic acids (specimen with PRC) is then added to the plate well. Place the plate into the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument. Once the plate is added to the instrument, the assay protocol is initiated. This protocol initiates reverse transcription of the RNA targets generating complementary DNA, and the subsequent amplification of the target sequences occurs. The Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay is based on TaqMan® chemistry, and uses an enzyme with reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, and $5 ' - 3 '$ exonuclease activities. During DNA amplification, this enzyme cleaves the probe bound to the complementary DNA sequence, separating the quencher dye from the reporter dye. This step generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation by a light source of the appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional dye molecules are separated from their quenchers resulting in additional signal. If sufficient fluorescence is achieved by 35 cycles during the data collection stage of amplification, the sample is reported as positive for the detected target sequence.

# L. Test Principle:

The real-time RT-PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets in a single closed-tube reaction. Detection of influenza A, B and the Process Control (PRC) is based on three processes: nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription and real time PCR amplification/detection. Human respiratory specimens (nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs) from symptomatic patients are processed initially to isolate and purify viral nucleic acid from the cellular specimen matrix. After initial reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), amplification proceeds during which the probe anneals specifically to a region of the template between the forward and reverse primers. As primer extension and amplification occurs, the exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the probe separating the reporter dye away from the quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source of appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, yielding increased fluorescence signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of PCR product (amplicons) present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by fluorescent detection modules within the real-time instrument.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A and B assay was evaluated at three laboratory sites. The reproducibility panel and controls were tested at each site by two operators for five days in triplicate (2 operators x 5 days x triplicate testing x 3 sites $= 9 0$ results per sample). The panels and controls were extracted using the bioMérieux easyMAG system and tested on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx.

The reproducibility panel was composed of four simulated samples each for influenza A and influenza B, made by diluting Influenza A H1N1 A/Mexico/4108/2009 or Influenza B Florida into negative nasal matrix. The panel included a medium positive (5x LoD) influenza A sample, a low positive ( $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD) influenza A sample, a high negative (0.3x LoD) influenza A sample, and an influenza A negative sample. The panel also included a medium positive (5x LoD) influenza B sample, a low positive (2x LoD) influenza B sample, a high negative $0 . 3 \mathrm { x }$ LoD) influenza B sample, and an influenza B negative sample.

# Freeze-Thaw Equivalency

The impact of using fresh clinical samples versus frozen clinical specimens on the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay’s ability to detect influenza A and influenza B was evaluated. Briefly, 220 clinical specimens were aliquoted and processed fresh $( < 7 2$ -hours post collection) and frozen (a minimum of 7- days storage at $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). Six (6) samples were discarded from analysis due to invalid results. The invalid rate of the fresh samples was 4/220 $( 1 . 8 \% )$ and the invalid rate of the frozen samples was 6/220 $( 2 . 7 \% )$ . Four of the invalids overlapped between fresh and frozen. There were two influenza A and influenza B positive samples that did not overlap between fresh and frozen in the comparison study. The positive samples evaluated in the study spanned virus concentrations detected from $6 \mathrm { C t }$ to $3 5 \mathrm { C t }$ for influenza A and $8 \mathrm { C t }$ to $3 3 \mathrm { C t }$ for influenza B. The results are summarized in the $2 \mathbf { x } 2$ table below and indicate that the use of fresh specimens and frozen specimens, as defined above, are equivalent.

# Kit Stability

An evaluation of real-time stability using 3 lots of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay kits at $2 ^ { \circ } C \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } C$ and room temperature was done over the course of 61 days, with additional real time results to be collected for 460 days (15 months). The following information summarizes the acceptance criteria; furthermore these criteria will also be used throughout the stability study:

1. Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay kit stability demonstrates 20 months real time stability at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .   
2. Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay kit stability demonstrates 15 months equivalent accelerated stability at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .   
3. Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay kit stability demonstrates 15 months real time stability at room temperature. (RT)   
4. Influenza A and influenza B test positive at each time point tested, 3x, $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ and $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD $( \geq 5$ cycles and ${ \leq } 3 5$ cycles for $7 5 0 0 \mathrm { D x } )$ .   
5. The NTCs test negative at each time point tested (undetermined).

No significant failure of the assay was detected at any of the experimental conditions to date (real time stability data collected to day 61) when compared to the $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { t = 0 } }$ time point. Also, all NTCs tested negative at each time point tested.

# Master Mix Stability after Rehydration

An evaluation of master mix stability after rehydration was carried out over a 5 day period using various storage conditions, including ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ , $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (room temperature). Mock specimens at 100X, 10X, and 3X LoD were used in the analysis. Results show that the rehydrated master mix can be stored for up to 24-hours at room temperature without any significant affect on the $\mathrm { C t }$ values for influenza A, influenza B or the PRC. The data demonstrates that for times longer than 24-hours the rehydrated master mix can be stored at - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for up to two weeks. Storage of the rehydrated master mix at ${ } _ { - 4 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is not recommended.

# Extracted Specimen Stability

An evaluation of the stability of extracted specimens was carried out using the easyMAG extraction system followed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Parallel aliquots of samples that were influenza A (3X LoD) and influenza B (3X LoD) positive were used for this study. Samples were analyzed at time 0 (immediately after extraction), after 2h at room temperature, after 8h at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , after 96 hours with up to three freeze thaw cycles, and after 1 month at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . There was no indication of degradation of the extracted specimen stored at the conditions tested.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay was determined using quantified $\mathrm { ( T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L ) }$ ) cultures of three influenza A strains (one H1N1, one 2009H1N1 and one H3N2) and three influenza B strains, serially diluted in negative nasopharyngeal matrix. Each dilution was extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG System in replicates of 21 per concentration of virus and tested on the Applied Biosystems $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 7500 Fast Dx platform. Analytical sensitivity (LoD) is defined as the lowest concentration at which $9 5 \%$ of all replicates tested positive.

# e. Analytical specificity (inclusivity):

The inclusivity of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay was evaluated against multiple strains of influenza A and influenza B viruses. The clinical panel consisted of 10 influenza A subtype H1N1, two influenza A subtype 2009H1N1, eight influenza A subtype H3N2, two influenza A subtype H5N1, 13 Influenza B strains. An additional panel of non-clinical influenza isolates was also tested. Each panel member was extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG instrument and tested in triplicate.

The Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay detected $100 \%$ of the influenza A (38/38) and influenza B strains (15/15) at 2 to $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD levels including pandemic and avian influenza A strains, and recent circulating influenza B strains.

# g. Interfering Microorganisms

The role of potentially interfering organisms in the ability of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay to detect and differentiate influenza A and influenza B viral RNA was evaluated by testing a panel consisting of 26 viral, 24 bacterial, and one yeast strain representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in the nasopharynx (see Cross-Reactivity table for complete list of organisms). Each organism was evaluated individually in a specimen containing influenza A $( 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L } )$ and influenza B $\bar { 1 0 ^ { 7 } }$ $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ). Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 8 }$ $\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . Viruses were tested at concentrations of $1 0 ^ { 2 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ . Samples were extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG instrument and tested in triplicate. No interference was observed during this study.

# h. Interfering Substances

The performance of Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay was evaluated with potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal specimens. The potentially interfering substances were evaluated in influenza A (A/Mexico/4108/2009), and influenza B (B/Florida/04/2006) at concentrations of $3 \mathbf { x }$ and $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD. There was no evidence of interference caused by the substances tested below with $3 \mathbf { x }$ or $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD viruses.

# i. Assay cut-off

The “cutoff value” represents the fluorescent intensity signal (reported in Relative Fluorescent Units) at which a “positive” reaction reaches a relative fluorescent intensity above the background or baseline of a “negative” reaction. If a sample exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during PCR, the sample is considered positive for that channel. If the sample does not exceed the threshold for a detection channel by the last PCR cycle, the sample is considered negative for that channel.

The cut-off for the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay was determined and confirmed through a phased approach. The preliminary threshold was established using data obtained from the LoD studies and from the analysis of a set of clinical specimens. Data from the analysis of multiple replicates near the LoD of the assay were used to establish the threshold such that sensitivity was maximized. Similarly, the latest Ct value from the LoD data was used to set the cut-off. Using the parameters summarized in the table below, a verification study was done to confirm the threshold and cut-off values.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay on the ABI 7500 Fast DxInstrument</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ConfirmedThreshold (RFU)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Confirmed Ct Cut-Off*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Influenza A</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.5e05</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Influenza B</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.2e05</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PRC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.7e04</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35</td></tr></table>

\*These values reflect subtraction of the first 10 cycles. Fluorescence is monitored after the first 10 cycles during the data collection stage of amplification.

• Results from an LoD study used to verify the threshold and cut-off values are as follows:

o Influenza A – 119/120 $( 9 9 . 1 \% )$   
o Influenza B – 119/120 $( 9 9 . 1 \% )$

These results demonstrated that the preliminary threshold and Ct cut-off settings determined have been confirmed and effective for maximizing sensitivity of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Molecular Assay.

# j. Carry-over Contamination Analysis

An evaluation of potential carry–over contamination during extraction and/or amplification was carried out. High negative and positive samples were run in alternating series to evaluate performance of the device and to monitor for potential carry-over contamination. The evaluation included alternating extractions high and low concentration of virus on the indicated platform. During the amplification stage the plate was setup in a checkerboard approach locating negative and positive samples in adjoining wells. No cross contamination was observed in the evaluation of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay.

# k. Comparison of transport media

Analytical performance of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay was evaluated with six different transport media. Stocks of influenza A and influenza B were used to evaluate performance across the different transport media at a level close to the LoD (3X). Briefly, dilutions of influenza A and influenza B were made and each of the dilutions was extracted in triplicate. Each extraction was then tested in duplicate on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx using the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Assay standard protocol. No differences between the tested transport media were observed and the results are summarized below.

a. Prospective Clinical Studies:

Performance characteristics of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay were established in a prospective study during the 2010-2011 respiratory virus season (January to March 2011). Samples used for this study were fresh nasal (373) and nasopharyngeal (313) swab specimens that were collected for routine influenza testing at thirteen (13) sites across the United States. A single specimen was collected per patient and tested within 72-hours of collection at one central location.

A comparator method (a high performance FDA Cleared Influenza A and B molecular test) was used in the evaluation of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay.

Six hundred and eighty six (686) fresh specimens (373 nasal swabs and 313 nasopharyngeal swabs) were tested by the subject and comparator device for influenza A and influenza B viral RNA. Four of these specimens were invalid on initial testing with the subject device $( 0 . 6 \% )$ . Re-testing of the specimens according to the Interpretation algorithm described above also yielded invalid results. Seventeen (17) specimens were invalid on initial and repeat testing (as per the device's PI) on the comparator device $( 2 . 5 \% )$ . Three specimens were invalid in both devices, therefore, a total of 18 invalid specimens were removed from additional analysis. The tables below detail the results for the remaining 668 specimens.

\*Twelve specimens were negative by FDA Cleared RT-PCR device but positive for influenza B by sequence analysis). $^ { * * }$ Five specimens were positive by FDA Cleared RT-PCR device.

The prospective clinical study had a dual infection rate for Influenza A and Influenza B of $1 . 8 \%$ (12/668) using the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ Assay. Three of these dual infections were concordant with the FDA Cleared RT-PCR device comparator assay. Five of these dual infections were discordant with the Influenza A results from the FDA Cleared RT-PCR device comparator assay. Four of these dual infections were discordant with the Influenza B results from the FDA Cleared RT-PCR device comparator assay.

# b. Retrospective Clinical Studies:

Performance characteristics of the Quidel Molecular Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ assay were also evaluated during a retrospective study of frozen specimens collected during the 2010-2011 respiratory virus season (January to March of 2011). Samples used for this study were frozen nasopharyngeal (376) swab specimens that were collected for routine influenza testing.

For this study the comparator method was a high performance FDA-Cleared Influenza A and B molecular device.

Three hundred and seventy six (376) frozen nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by the subject and comparator devices for influenza A and influenza B viral RNA. Two of these specimens were invalid on initial testing with the subject device $( 0 . 5 \% )$ . Re-testing of the specimens according to the Interpretation algorithm described above also yielded invalid results. Two specimens were invalid on initial and repeat testing (as per the device's PI) on the comparator device $( 0 . 5 \% )$ . The four invalid specimens were removed from performance analyses. The tables below detail the results for the remaining 372 specimens.
