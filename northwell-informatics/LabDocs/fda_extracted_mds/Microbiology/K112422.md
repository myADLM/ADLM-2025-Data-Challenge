# Trade Name:

CrAg Lateral Flow Assay

# Common Name:

Cryptococcal Antigen Lateral Flow Immunoassay

# Regulation:

866.3165

# Predicate Device:

Immuno-Mycologics' CrAg Lateral Flow Assay (K102286)

Intended Use:

The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay is an immunochromatographic test system for the qualitative or semi-quantitative detection of capsular polysaccharide antigens of Cryptococcus species complex (Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gatti) in serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay is a prescription-use laboratory assay, which can aid in the diagnosis of Cryptococcosis.

# Device Description: Explanation:

Detection of cryptococcal antigen in serum and CSF has been used for over forty years to aid in the diagnosis of cryptococcosis with very high sensitivity and specificity (9,14,15). Current guidelines for the management of cryptococcal disease partially base treatment recommendations on cryptococcal antigen presence and more specifically on cryptococcal antigen titers (16).

Cryptococcosis is caused by both species of the Cryptococcus species complex (Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gatti) (5,6,12,13). Individuals with impaired cell-mediated

immune (CMI) function due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (19), lymphoproliferative disorders (18), steroid therapy (8), and organ transplantation (7) are at increased risk of cryptococcosis. AIDS accounts for $80 \%$ of cryptococcal infections (11). The incidence of cryptococcosis in AIDS patients in the United States is estimated to be $5 - 1 0 \%$ (11), while the incidence of cryptococosis in other parts of the world, such as Africa, is as high as $30 \%$ Cryptococcosis is the fourth most common opportunistic, life-threatening infection among AIDS patients (10).

# Description:

The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay is a dipstick sandwich immunochromatographic assay, which detects cryptococcal antigen in serum and CSF.For the qualitative procedure, specimens are diluted 1:2 in 1x Specimen Diluent and analyzed. For the semi-quantitative procedure, specimens are diluted 1:5 in 1x Specimen Diluent followed by 1:2 serial dilutions. All dilutions are then analyzed as in the qualitative procedure.Specimens are placed into an appropriate reservoir, such as a test tube or microtiter plate, and the lateral flow device is then placed into the reservoir allowing the specimen to come into contact with the test membrane. The test uses specimen wicking to capture gold-conjugated, anti-cryptococcal monoclonal antibodies and gold-conjugated control antibodies that are deposited onto a membrane. If cryptococcal antigen is present in the specimen, it binds to the gold-conjugated, anti-cryptococcal antibodies.The gold-labeled antibody-antigen complex wll continue to wick up the membrane w t will intac wih Te  he Te L iiz n-ptocal monoclonal antibodies. If the specimen contains cryptococcal antigen, a sandwich is created with the gold-labeled antibodies and the immobilized antibodies, causing a visible line to ouse, the wicking of any specimen, positive or negative, will cause the gold-conjugated control gat IgG antiod o move o the Control Line ) which is mobilid bovi antioat IgG antibody. The immobilized anti-goat antibody will bind to the gold-conjugated goat IgG Control ilul e v ul l , wile ativult will ceate uronol    dev line, then the test is not valid.

# Performance Summary

Precision Studies (Repeatability & Reproducibility Serum repeatability and reproducibility results can be found in the predicate device 510(k) (K102286)

Repeatability and reproducibility with CSF specimens were determined by spiking a mock CSF that was negative by the IMMY Latex-Cryptococcus Antigen Detection System with cryptococcal antigen at four concentrations: Negative, high negative (C5), low positive (near $\cos )$ , and medium positive. The samples were analyzed on the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay in triplicate on five different days, at three different sites with a total of five different operators, on one lot, according to EP5-A2. One site was internal (Site 1) and the remaining two were a US reference laboratory (Site 2) and a US hospital laboratory (Site 3). For repeatability, percent positive and percent negative detected were calculated for each site (Table 2). For reproducibility, overall percent positive and percent negative detected were calculated by combining the data from all three sites (last two rows of Table 2).

Analytical Sensitivity (lower limits of the assay/analytical cut-off)

Serum analytical sensitivity can be found in the predicate device 510(k) (K102286)

Analytical sensitivity for the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay was estimated by running 24 replicates of varying concentrations of cryptococcal antigen diluted in mock CSF on one lot of kits, according to EP12-A2. The analytical cut-off was defined as the concentration where $50 \%$ of the results were positive and $50 \%$ of the results were negative. The analytical cut-off is $1 . 2 5 \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m } |$ .

Analytical Specificity (cross-reactivity)

Serum analytical specificity can be found in the predicate device 510(k) (K102286)

Due to specimen availability, the following CSF conditions were not tested in the CrAg Lat Fow Assay: pneuonia, Enterovirus, Enterobaceriacee, Sreptooccus sp. Slc p., dero H.inlenye  N.meis, Entc. Epstein Barr, Herpes simplex virus Type 1 and 2, Listeria monocytogenes, Trichosporon beigelii, and samples with syneresis fluid condensation.

This assay was not evaluated for potential interference related to specimen pretreatment with 2-mercaptoethanol or with specimens including the following subastances or conditions: bloQdy CSF, cloudy CSF, white blood cells, xanthochromic CSF, bilirubin, protein, systemic lupus erythmatosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, or N. memingitides.

D. Linearity

N/A

E.High Dose Hook Effect

High dose hook effect concentrations with specimens were determined by spiking negative serum that was negative by the IMMY Latex-Cryptococcus Antigen Detection System and CrAg Lateral Flow Assay, with cryptococcal antigen at various concentrations between 20 and $5 0 0 \mathrm { { u g / m } } 1$ Each concentration was tested in triplicate at IMMY on one lot of CrAg Lateral Flow Assay, according to the package insert. It was determined that serum specimens with a cryptococcal antigen concentration higher than $2 0 0 \mathsf { u g / m } |$ can produce a high dose hook effect and therefore may produce a false negative result.
