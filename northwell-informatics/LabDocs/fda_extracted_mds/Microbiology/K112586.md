Ceftaroline 30µg, BBL™" Sensi-Disc™ Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks

DEVICE COMMON NAME:

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks

DEVICE CLASSIFICATION:

21 CFR§866.1620, Class II (Product Code JTN), Susceptibility Test Disks, Antimicrobial

PREDICATE DEVICE:

Other BBL™ Sensi-Disc™ (e.g., Ciprofloxacin $5 \mu \ g$ , BBL™" Sensi-Disc")

# INTENDED USE:

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks are used for semi-quantitative in vitro susceptibility testing by standardized agar diffusion test procedures. Ceftaroline $3 0 \mu \ g$ BBL™ Sensi-Disc™is intended for use in determining the susceptibility to Ceftaroline  a wide range of bacteria, as described in the "Indications for Use" section. Zone sizes used for interpretation of tests, including control organism limits, were determined by the antimicrobic manufacturer and received FDA approval under NDA Number 200327.

# 510(k) SUMMARY

# Indications for Use:

Use of Ceftaroline 30µg BBL™ Sensi-Disc" for in vitro agar diffusion susceptibility testing is indicated when there is a need to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to Ceftaroline. The concentration of $3 0 \mu \ g$ has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed below, as described in the FDA approved drug insert for this antimicrobic.

# Active In Vitro and in Clinical Infections Against:

# Gram-positive Microorganisms

Staphylococcus aureus   
(including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant   
isolates)   
Streptococcus pyogenes   
Streptococcus agalactiae   
Streptococcus pneumoniae   
Gram-negative Microorganisms   
Escherichia coli   
Klebsiella pneumoniae

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

Ceftaroline 30µg BBL" Sensi-Disc" is prepared by impregnating high quality paper with accurately determined amounts of Ceftaroline supplied by the drug manufacturer. Each Ceftaroline disk is clearly marked on both sides with the agent and drug content. Ceftaroline cartridges each contain 50 impregnated disks that are packed as either a single cartridge in a single box, or in a package containing ten cartridges. Ceftaroline disks are used for semi-quantitative in vitro susceptibility evaluations by the agar diffusion test method.

Agar diffusion susceptibility methods employing dried filter paper disks impregnated with specific concentrations of antimicrobial agents were developed in the 1940s. In order to eliminate or minimize variability in the testing, Bauer et al. developed a standardized procedure in which Mueller Hinton Agar was selected as the test medium.

Various regulatory agencies and standards-writing organizations subsequently published standardized reference procedures based on the Bauer-Kirby method. Among the earliest and most widely accepted of these standardized procedures were those published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The procedure was adopted as a consensus standard by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSl) [Formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)] and is periodically updated.

# DEVICE PRINCIPLE:

Disks containing a wide variety of antimicrobial agents are applied to the surface of Mueller Hinton Agar plates [or Haemophilus Test Medium Agar for Haemophilus influenzae or Mueller Hinton Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood for Streptococcus species] inoculated with pure cultures of clinical isolates. Following incubation, the plates are examined and the zones of inhibition surrounding the disks are measured and compared with established zone size ranges for individual antimicrobial agents in order. to determine the agent(s) most suitable for use in antimicrobial therapy. The categorical terpretation [usceptible ), intermediate ), or resistant (R) or he organism b tested with the antimicrobial agent is made by comparing zone diameters to those found in the respective organism tables of the FDA drug insert and/or CLSl/NCCLS Document M2 ("Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests) and of CLSI/NCCLS Document M100 ("Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing").

# DEVICE COMPARISON:

The BBL™" Sensi-Disc™ Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Ceftaroline $3 0 \mu \ g$ is similar to the BBL" Sensi-Disc" Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Ciprofloxacin 5 $\mu \mathfrak { g }$ in that:

Both methods are for antimicrobial susceptibility testing using paper disks   
impregnated with an antimicrobial agent.   
Both methods have the same intended use.   
Both methods provide the user with antimicrobic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results based on measurements of zone diameters.   
Both methods require the user to determine categorical interpretations (S/l/R) using the measured zone diameters against CLSI/NCCLS Approved Standards M2 and M100.   
Both methods use pure cultures of bacterial isolates.

The BBL™" Sensi-Disc™" Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Ceftaroline $3 0 \mu \ g$ differs from the BBL Sensi-Disc Antimicrobial Susceptibiliy Test Disks - Ciprofloxacin $5 \mu \ g$ in that:

BBL Sensi-Disc Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Ceftarolne $3 0 \mu 9$ is a susceptibility test that uses disks impregnated with the antimicrobic Ceftaroline at a concentration of $3 0 \mu \ g$ while the BBL™ Sensi-Disc™ Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disks - Ciprofloxacin $5 \mu 9$ is a susceptibility test that uses disks impregnated with the antimicrobic Ciprofloxacin at a concentration of $5 \mu \ g$ BBL™ Sensi-Disc Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Disk - Ceftaroline $3 0 \mu \ g$ is a susceptibility test used to test a different battery of microorganisms than the BBL™ SeiDisAntiicobial Sustibility Test Dis Ciprooa $5 \mu \ g$ .
