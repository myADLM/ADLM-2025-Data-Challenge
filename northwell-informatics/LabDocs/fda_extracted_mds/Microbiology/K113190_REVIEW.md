4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable

# I. Device Description:

TRU Legionella is a single use capture immunoassay to detect Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 in human urine specimens. The test consists of a Conjugate Tube, a Test Strip, and Sample Diluent/Negative Control. The Conjugate Tube contains a lyophilized bead of colloidal gold-linked polyclonal antibody to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 detector antibody. The Test Strip carries a nitrocellulose membrane with dried capture antibodies placed at a designated Test Line for Legionella. The Test Strip holder caps the Conjugate Tube during testing and subsequent disposal to reduce exposure to potential pathogens.

The conjugate bead is first rehydrated in the Conjugate Tube with the Sample Diluent/Negative Control. Patient sample is then added, the contents mixed and the Test Strip added. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigens, if present, bind to the antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. When the sample migrates up the Test Strip to the Test Line, the antigen-conjugate complex is bound to the capture antibody, yielding a pink-red line. When no antigen is present, no complexes are formed and no pink-red line appears at the Test Line. An internal control line helps determine whether the test has been executed properly, if kit reagents are performing appropriately and that adequate flow has occurred through the Test Strip during a test run. A visible pinkred line at the Control position of the Test Strip should be present each time a specimen or control is tested. If no pink-red control line is seen, the test is considered invalid.

# Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests

# L. Test Principle:

The conjugate bead is first rehydrated in the Conjugate Tube with the Sample Diluent/Negative Control. Patient sample is then added, the contents mixed and the Test Strip added. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigens, if present, bind to the antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. When the sample migrates up the Test Strip to the Test Line, the antigen-conjugate complex is bound to the capture antibody, yielding a pink-red line. When no antigen is present, no complexes are formed and no pink-red line appears at the Test Line. An internal control line helps determine whether the test has been executed properly, if kit reagents are performing appropriately and that adequate flow has occurred through the Test Strip during a test run. A visible pinkred line at the Control position of the Test Strip should be present each time a specimen or control is tested. If no pink-red control line is seen, the test is considered invalid.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was assessed at three clinical laboratories using a blind coded sample panel. The panel consisted of three contrived moderately positive samples, three low positive samples at a concentration just above the limit of detection, three high negative samples at a concentration just below the limit of blank, and one natural negative sample. The panels were tested in two runs at each site by two operators each day for five non-consecutive days. Reproducibility was $100 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Sample storage

A sample storage study was conducted to verify the sample preservation, handling, and storage criteria included in the TRU Legionella package insert. Aliquots of unpreserved and boric acid preserved positive and negative samples were stored at the following temperatures to determine the worst case storage time for each temperature range: room temperature $( 2 0 – 2 6 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ up to eight days, refrigerated $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ up to eight days, conventional freezer (-16 to $- 2 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ up to 31 days, and ultralow freezer (-66 to $- 8 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ up to 31 days. Ten contrived samples were tested: four negatives, four positives, a high negative sample, and a limit of detection positive. Samples were tested at various times during storage. All samples produced the expected results. The data supports test performance with preserved and unpreserved samples that are stored for up to seven days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 { - } 2 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and/or stored for up to 30 days at $\leq - 1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Fresh versus frozen samples

A fresh versus frozen specimen study was conducted to verify that frozen samples can be thawed multiple times without affecting the detection of the measurand. Ten contrived samples were tested: four negatives, four positives, a high negative sample, and a limit of detection positive. Unpreserved and boric acid preserved specimens were tested. Baseline tests were run, and then aliquots were tested every cycle for three freeze thaw cycles each at -16 to -28 $^ \circ \mathrm { C }$ and at $^ { - 6 6 }$ to ${ } _ { - 8 4 } \mathrm { \Omega } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . All samples produced the expected results. The data supports test performance with preserved and unpreserved samples that are frozen and thawed up to two times.

# Kit stability

Reagent stability was provisionally established using accelerated (stressed) testing methods. TRU Legionella kits were stored at $3 . 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 1 { - } 2 5 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 40-44 ${ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $4 8 { - } 5 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Test performance was evaluated at various time points for up to 65 or 104 days using a sample panel containing a negative sample, low positive sample, reference standard, and both positive and negative controls. The $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ temperature range was used as T1 (initial or baseline temperature) when calculating stability using the Q rule, with $\mathrm { Q } _ { 1 0 } = 3$ . The $4 0 { - } 4 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 8 { - } 5 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ranges were used as T2. Real-time stability studies are currently ongoing with testing performed at quarterly intervals and will be completed at the end of 27 months.

All samples produced the expected result with kits stored at the different temperatures and times. The data supports final product storage at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ for 18 months.

# High-dose hook effect

L. pneumophila Philadelphia and Bellingham strains were spiked into negative donor urine and then serially diluted. A false negative result obtained with a very high level of target antigen would indicate a high-dose hook effect.

\*A negative result is not unexpected as Dilution 6 was at a concentration below the claimed limit of detection.

L. pneumophila Philadelphia and Bellingham strains did not produce a high-dose hook effect when tested at high concentrations with the TRU Legionella assay.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical limit of detection (LoD) was determined for $L$ . pneumophila Philadelphia and Bellingham strains diluted in a negative human urine matrix. The $L$ . pneumophila antigen was serially diluted two-fold and 45 replicates of each dilution were tested to determine the LoD in the TRU Legionella assay.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical specificity was demonstrated by testing the following potentially cross-reactive bacteria, fungi, and viruses: Acaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis (Group D Streptococcus), Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffii, Legionella feelii, Legionella gormanii, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella micdadei, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 3, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 4, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 5, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 6, Morganella morganii, Moraxella osloensis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Nocardia asteroids, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A), Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B), Streptococcus anginosis (Group F), Streptococcus dysgalactiae equisimilis (Group G), Streptococcus pneumonia Adenovirus, Coxsackievirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus A, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus B.

Bacteria, fungi (at a final concentrations of $1 . 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m l ) }$ , or viruses (at concentrations greater than $1 \mathrm { \Delta x 1 0 ^ { 5 } T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m l ) }$ were added to negative urine samples or to urine samples spiked with $L$ . pneumophila serogroup 1 at its limit of detection. None of the tested microorganisms cross-reacted with the TRU Legionella assay.

# Analytical reactivity

TRU Legionella was tested for its reactivity with Pontiac and non-Pontiac strains of L. pneumophila. Aliquots of five Pontiac and four non-Pontiac strains of $L$ . pneumophila were adjusted to visually match a MacFarland Standard 4.0 (approximately $1 . 2 \mathrm { \ : x \ : 1 0 \ : ^ { 9 } \ C F U / m L } $ ) and then spiked into a natural negative urine matrix to a final concentration of $1 . 2 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . Three non-Pontiac strains did not react at the concentration of $1 . 2 \mathrm { x } \ 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ and were retested at a higher concentration of $4 . 8 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is an important cause of travel, community and hospital acquired pneumonia worldwide. Legionnaires’ disease (LD) is known to occur sporadically and in outbreak settings. Recent data indicates that $0 . 5 { - } 5 . 0 \%$ of adults hospitalized for pneumonia has LD. Approximately 8,000- 18,000 cases of LD occur each year in the USA. With this assay, 111 positive samples were tested, 5 were misidentified as negative; and 239 negative samples were tested, all were correctly identified.
