# 3.9. Performance testing - Bench

Microbial recovery studies were carried out to establish the performance of Puritan UTM-RT system.

# Recovery:

The following virus strains were chosen for recovery study: Adenovirus Cytomegalovirus Echovirus Type 30 Herpes Simplex Virus Type I Herpes Simplex Virus Type II Influenza A Parainfluenza Type 3 Respiratory Syncytial Virus Varicella Zoster Virus

The following chlamydiae strains were chosen for recovery study: Chlamydia pneumonia Strain CM-1 Chlamydia trachomatis Type 1 Strain UW-12/UR   
The following mycoplasmas and ureaplasma were chosen for recovery study Mycoplasma hominis Mycoplasma pneumonia Ureaplasma urealyticum

The survival and recovery of viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas was tested to determine the performance characteristics of Puritan Universal Transport Medium UTM-RT. The test methodology comprised of preparing neat stocks of the above microorganisms for testing. Two different dilutions of neat stock suspensions were prepared and, from these, $1 0 0 \mu \up$ were directly inoculated onto swabs in triplicate. The swabs were transferred into the transport medium and held at both $4 ^ { \circ } \complement$ and room temperature $( 2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ for the required amount of time. At key time points following inoculation (0, 24, and $4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ), each sample was vortexed after which an aliquot of the suspension was inoculated into shell vials or suitable culture media. Viability of viruses and chlamydiae was determined by shel vial assay followed by immunostaining and enumeration of fluorescent foci. The viability of mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas was determined using direct culture methods onto appropriate growth media followed by enumeration of colony forming units (CFU). Cultures were processed by standard laboratory techniques and examined following optimal incubation periods. The results demonstrate the ability of Puritan Medical Products UTM-RT to sustain the viability and recovery of test bacteria and viruses for at least 48 hrs at $4 ^ { \circ } \complement$ and room temperature $( 2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C )$ .

# 3.10. Stability and shelf life

# a. Recovery stability

The following strains were chosen for shelf life stability testing:

Cytomegalovirus Herpes Simplex Virus Type II Respiratory Syncytial Virus Chlamydia pneumonia Mycoplasma pneumonia

Prior to stability testing, neat stocks of test organisms were prepared and assessed for viable concentration. Three lots of the test device beyond the expiration point and one newly prepared lot were challenged with one concentration of each neat stock. Device performance was assessed by spiking swabs that.accompanied each transport system with the chosen test dilution. Swabs were then transferred into the UTM, stored at different temperatures (refrigerated and room temperature) and held at 0, 24 and 48 hours. Viability/stability of each test organism under the defined conditions was evaluated through cell culture and immunofluorescence staining (viruses and Chlamydia) or standard bacterial culture methods (Mycoplasma). Culture data between the test and predicate devices were statistically analyzed and compared.

For al four lots, test viruses and bacteria could be quantified through 48 hours at the two storage temperatures. In general, refrigerated storage resulted in higher test strain recoveries and increased stability. One- way analysis of variance demonstrated statistical differences $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ between the lots under certain storage conditions, primarily between refrigerated and room temperature storage; this was concluded to be insignificant from the clinical stand point. Storage stability testing indicated maintenance of the test device performance up to and including the expiration date.

# b. pH stability

The pH of the test device was measured at predetermined time intervals up to 18 month after the manufacturing date. The test was performed using calibrated pH meter with random samples from three different lots of Puritan UTM-RT. All samples tested were found to maintain pH within the specified target range.

# c. Antibiotics Stability Test

Antibiotics stability of test device was evaluated using 3 expired lots and a new lot of test device and compared to the predicate device. All products tested demonstrated the ability to control bacterial activities up to 72 hours.

# 3.11. Cytotoxicity

Cytotoxicity testing using an MRC-5 celline in conjunction with a standard Sulforhodamine B assay demonstrated no cellular toxicity associated with three lots of test devices when statistically compared to negative controls.

# 3.12. Sterilization and Shelf Life

All plastic components of Puritan UTM-RT are validated and sterilized following ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11137:2006, Sterilization of health care products-Radiation or by ANSl/AAMI/ISO11135:2007, Sterilization of health care products-ethylene oxide.

Puritan UTM-RT tubes are filed aseptically under control conditions. Representative samples from each lot of Puritan UTM-RT are tested according to the USP 34 NF, 29:2011, <71>, Sterility Tests.

Dear Mr. Karamchi:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
