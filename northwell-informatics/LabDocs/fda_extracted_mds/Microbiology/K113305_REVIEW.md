# I. Device Description:

VITEK 2 AST card containing the test is inoculated with a standardized suspension of the organism to be tested. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals, and places the card into the incubator/reader while the VITEK 2 Compact System has manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The incubated card is optically monitored by the VITEK 2 Systems for growth within each well in the card throughout the incubation cycle. At the completion of incubation, results are automatically calculated once a predetermined growth threshold is reached. A report is then generated that

contains the MIC value and the interpretive category result (S, I, R) for each antibiotic contained on the card.

The MIC ranges, interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations for testing S. pneumoniae are as follows:

# L. Test Principle:

Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card. The VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole card has the following Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole concentrations of 8/152, 16/304 and 64/1216

$\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is £ 10 (0.5/9.5)– ≥320 (16/304) $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was conducted at three study sites. Ten isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested at each site and testing was performed in triplicate over three days with The VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { R } } 2$ Streptococcus Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole. The testing was performed using both the manual dilution method and the automated dilution mode. Testing was conducted on the VITEK 2 instrument.

For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.

There were no off-scale MIC values. The overall reproducibility was $100 \%$ with $+ / -$ one dilution observation for Automatic and Manual Dilution methods.

A similar reproducibility study was conducted by testing on the VITEK 2 Compact instrument. The VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2$ Streptococcus   
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole card gave a reproducibility of $100 \%$ by Manual Dilution. Only Manual Dilution testing was conducted since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a functionality to support automatic dilution to inoculate the card.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

One QC isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System. The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The VITEK 2 and reference testing was performed a minimum of twenty times by each method at each site. There were some instances were either VITEK or reference results were out of range. In such instances where any organism was out of range for the reference method, all data from that day’s testing was considered invalid and that day’s testing was repeated.

Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System. Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.

\* VITEK Card Result Range is ${ \le } 1 0$ (0.5/9.5) to ${ \ge } 3 2 0 $ (16/304) $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . VITEK reports MIC values as a combined concentration of Trimethoprim plus Sulfamethoxazole based on a ratio of 1:19.

Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the expected QC ranges with an acceptable rate.

A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System. Results were compared to the expected CLSI QC results. All results for the VITEK 2 Compact System were within the expected QC ranges $100 \%$ of the time.

Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek2 instrument. This was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected range.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at four external sites. A total of 306 clinical isolates were tested by the VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole. The vast majority of the isolates were recently isolated from clinical specimens. A challenge set consisting of 50 isolates was also evaluated. Testing was done using the ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \overline { { \mathbb { B } } } } 2$ Streptococcus Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole and the broth microdilution method using cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton (MH) broth. The MH broth was incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ in ambient air for up to 16-20 hours. The inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known results. Two methods of inoculation (manual and auto dilution) were evaluated. Clinical testing was performed using the automated method of inoculation and the challenge set was tested using both the manual and the auto dilution method. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the following agreement.

maj-major discrepancies; vmj-very major discrepancies; min-minor discrepancies

Essential agreement (EA) is when the VITEK 2 panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK 2 panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the VITEK 2 and the reference and have on-scale EA.

EA was not evaluated since this is a qualitative test. However, CA of $9 6 . 1 \%$ was observed for both clinical and challenge isolates, which is an acceptable

performance. Also, another study on the VITEK 2 Compact Systems demonstrated acceptable CA (See below).

A total of 50 Challenge S. pneumoniae isolates were also tested in the VITEK 2 Compact using the manual dilution method. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the following agreement.
