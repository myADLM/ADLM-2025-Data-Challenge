4. Special instrument requirements:

BD BACTEC fluorescent series instrument (BACTEC FX, 9240, 9050)

# I. Device Description:

The sample to be tested is inoculated into one or more vials which are inserted into the BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in CO2 produced by the growth of microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an increase in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO2 present. A positive reading indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is limited to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of medium.

Resins have been described for the treatment of blood specimens both prior to and after their inoculation into culture media. Resins have been incorporated into BACTEC culture media to enhance recovery of organisms without a need for special processing.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

If microorganisms are present in the test sample inoculated into the BACTEC vial, $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ will be produced when the organisms metabolize the substrates present in the vial. Increases in the fluorescence of the vial sensor caused by the higher amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ are monitored by the BACTEC fluorescent series instrument. Analysis of the rate and amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ increase enables the BACTEC fluorescent series instrument to determine if the vial is positive, i.e., that the test sample contains viable organisms.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility study was evaluated by time to detection and recovery, in the Instrument Time to Detection and Recovery studies by using three lots. Both Lots 1 and 3 exhibited no statistically significant difference in time to detection between the new and predicate devices. Lot 2 exhibited a statistically significant difference in time to recovery due to the performance of BACTEC 9050 with Leuconostoc spp.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The range of time-to-detection in hours was $\leq 7 2$ hours for each of the organisms listed below. The QC study was performed on three lots and the QC specifications were met.

There were 26 cultures positive only in the glass device, 20 of the negative cultures in the new plastic device were from the low inoculum (0 to 1 CFU per bottle) level. There were six failures at the 1 to 10 CFU per bottle inoculum level:

Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2 Candida glabrata.

There were four false negative cultures that contributed to the overall difference. Two false negatives were with Leuconostoc species in the predicate device. Two false negatives were in the new device, one with Leuconostoc species and one with Staphylococcus epidermidis. The Staphylococcus epidermidis was a low inoculum and the inoculum plate count was culture negative.

The study demonstrated that the inoculum was 10- 100 CFU per bottle for the new BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic /F Plastic vial.

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

Performance of the BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F medium in plastic bottles was evaluated during internal analytical studies to demonstrate comparable performance to the predicate device – the BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F medium in glass bottles.

# Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study

The study included blood volumes, organism and BACTEC fluorescent-series blood culture instrument (BACTEC FX, 9240, 9050). Each organism was inoculated at 10 to 100 CFU per bottle, across two blood volumes ( $3 \mathrm { m L }$ and 10 mL) over three lots of media for paired sets of the new and predicate devices. This testing was repeated in each BACTEC fluorescent-series blood culture instrument (BACTEC FX, 9240, 9050). There were 726 $( 9 8 . 4 \% )$ pair sets positive in both the new and predicate devices.

3 lots x 2 blood volumes x 3 instruments $\times 4 1$ isolates $= 7 3 8$ pair sets

Organisms with median TTD greater than one hour were summarized in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Organism</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Median TTD Difference (hours)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Candida glabrata</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-2.83Earlier in new device (plastic)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cryptococcus neoformans</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-1.67Earlier in new device (plastic)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Haemophilus parainfluenzae biotype I</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.33Earlier in predicate device (glass)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Micrococcus luteus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.83Earlier in predicate device (glass)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Leuconostoc spp.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.00Earlier in predicate device (glass)</td></tr></table>

# Percent Recovery (Sensitivity) study

A total of 738 paired sets were evaluated in the Percent Recovery comparison. There were nine paired sets failed to recover organisms in both the new and predicate device $( 1 . 6 \% )$ in the percent recovery study. One paired set recovered in the predicate device only (the paired new device was negative) and two paired sets recovered in the new device only (the predicate device was negative).

The recovery failure included S. pneumoniae, Eikenella corrodens, and Leuconostoc spp. The observed failures of S. pneumoniae and Eikenella corrodens were replicates in a single instrument type. An additional study was conducted using the failed recovery strains; there were no recovery failure.

# False Positive Rate Study

False positivity was assessed with bottles inoculated with freshly drawn human blood (i.e. 2, 4, 6, and $8 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ). No organisms were added to the bottle. There were 240 paired sets comprised of 80 bottles from each of the three lots. There were two false positive plastic bottles observed but they were inoculated outside of the recommended usage range for the device $( < 3 \mathrm { m L } )$ ).

# False Negative Rate Study

The data for this study was generated from the Instrument Time to Detection, Percent Recovery (Sensitivity), and Microbial Detection Limit studies. Bottles from that study that are expected to be positive (i.e., those inoculated with viable organisms) will form the dataset for the False Negative Rate.

A total of 82 paired sets were evaluated to determine the false negatives, with the following results:

Detected in predicate device only 27 Detected in new device only 22 Detected in neither devices (Negatives) 33 paired sets

There was one false negative result with the new device: Leuconostoc spp. with 3 mL of blood (plate count 35 CFU).

# BACTEC Instrument Platform Compatibility

Data for this study were from a subset of organisms included in the Instrument Time to Detection study. A total of 246 paired sets (new and predicate devices) were tested in each the BACTEC FX, BACTEC 9240 and BACTEC 9050 fluorescent-series blood culture instruments. There were nine paired sets that failed to recover in both the new and predicate devices in the BACTEC FX instrument.
