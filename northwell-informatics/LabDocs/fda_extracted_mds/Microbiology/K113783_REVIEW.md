For prescription use only.

The ability of the AST card to detect resistance to penicillin is unknown because resistant strains (based on the breakpoints for pneumonia) were not available at the time of comparative testing.

# 4. Special instrument requirements:

For use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems

# I. Device Description:

The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which only contains microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 - 0 . 5 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.

The VITEK® 2 AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06, 0.25, 1, 2 and $4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is $\leq$ $0 . 0 6 - \geq 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# L. Test Principle:

Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a

“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.

The VITEK® 2 AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06, 0.25, 1, 2 and $4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ ). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is $\leq$ $0 . 0 6 - \geq 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was conducted at three external clinical sites. Ten Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were tested at each site and testing was performed in triplicate over three days with the VITEK ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae card. The testing was performed using both the manual dilution method and the automated dilution mode. Testing was conducted on the VITEK 2 instrument.

For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.

The overall reproducibility was $59 5 \%$ with $+ / -$ one dilution observation for the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact system. Only Manual Dilution testing was conducted since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a functionality to support automatic dilution to inoculate the card. Results were as follows:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended Streptococcus pneumonia QC organism was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System.

The reference method QC results were in range every day they were tested. The VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.

Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System. Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.

Quality Control Results with the VITEK 2 System for Penicillin were as follows and include data obtained from testing additional challenge isolates:

\* VITEK Card Result Range i $: \leq 0 . 0 6 - \geq 8 $ .

Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the expected quality control results.

A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.   
Results were compared to the expected FDA and CLSI QC results.

Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek2 instrument. This was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected range.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at three external study sites. A total of 500 clinical isolates were tested by VITEK® 2 AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae with the VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 System. The majority of the isolates were recently isolated from clinical specimens. Two hundred forty seven of the 500 clinical isolates tested were stock isolates $( 4 9 . 4 \% )$ . The total number of viable clinical isolates evaluated was 485; the no growth rate was $2 . 4 \%$ (15/500). A challenge set consisting of 50 isolates was also evaluated with VITEK ${ \textsuperscript { \textregistered } } _ { 2 }$ AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae based on the pneumonia breakpoints. An additional 87 challenge isolates of S. pneumoniae were tested to further evaluate performance based on the meningitis breakpoint. Testing of clinical isolates was performed using the automated method of inoculation and the challenge organisms were tested with both the manual dilution and automatic dilution. Each isolate was tested by the VITEK ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae and the CLSI broth microdilution reference method. The inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the agreement shown in the following tables.

Because two separate breakpoints exist for penicillin when testing Streptococcus pneumoniae depending on the infection source, data was analyzed to evaluate performance based on the pneumonia and meningitis breakpoints separately as shown in the tables below.

EA-Essential Agreement CA-Category Agreement maj-major discrepancies vmj-very major discrepancies min-minor discrepancies Essential agreement (EA) is when the VITEK 2 panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the

reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK 2 panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the VITEK 2 and the reference and have on-scale EA.

For the pneumonia breakpoint, 40 $( 7 . 5 \% )$ minor categorical errors were seen with one major error. A high agreement was observed with a total EA of $9 7 . 6 \%$ , evaluable EA of $9 5 . 9 \%$ and a CA of $9 2 . 3 \%$ . Of 535 total isolates of $S .$ . pneumoniae, three isolates were considered resistant based on the penicillin breakpoint for pneumonia but no very major errors occurred.

$\mathbf { n a } =$ not applicable. No minor error calculation is made due to the absence of a defined intermediate category.

For the meningitis breakpoint, a high agreement was observed with a total EA of $9 7 . 9 \%$ , evaluable EA of $9 6 . 9 \%$ and a CA of $9 6 . 6 \%$ . In absence of an intermediate breakpoint for meningitis, the results showed 10 $( 3 . 1 \% )$ major and 9 $( 3 . 0 \% )$ very major errors. The major error rate of $3 . 1 \%$ was considered acceptable because of the high Category and Essential Agreements.

Performance of the VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 and the VITEK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2 Compact was also evaluated with the same 137 challenge organisms using the manual dilution method. A comparison to the reference is shown in the following tables:
