Submitter's Name: Gold Standard Diagnostics Address: 2851 Spafford St. Davis, CA. 95618 Phone Number: 530-759-8000 Contact Person: Napoleon Monce Date: May 27, 2012

Product and Trade Name: Borrelia burgdorferi IgM B31 Line Blot Test Kit Common Name or Classification Name: Borrelia burgdorferi IgM Western blot

Product Code: LSR

Legally marketed device to which the submitter claims equivalence Bburgdorferi (IgM) Marblot Strip Test System (Distributed by Trinity Biotech) (K951709).

# Description of the device:

The assay requires a total of 70 minutes incubation time. The test uses purified antigens coated on nitrocellulose strips. Serum sample is added to each strip and incubated for 30 minutes. If Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies are present they will bind to the antigens on the strips.Unbound serum is removed by washing the wells three times. An enzyme-conjugated anti-human IgM is then added to each strip and incubated for 30 minutes. It will bind to the any antibody that was attached to the antigen on the strip. The wells are again washed three times followed by a DI water wash to remove any unbound conjugate. After unbound conjugate has been removed by a further washing step, a visualization of the antigenantibody-antibody complex is accomplished by the addition of a substrate which forms blue-violet precipitates at each site antigen bands).The reaction is stopped by washing the nitrocellulose strip with distilled or deionized water. Depending on the observed band pattern one can interpret the presence or absence of specific IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi infection.

# Intended use of the device

The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test Kit is intended for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (B31) in human serum.This test is intended for use in testing human serum samples which have been found positive or equivocal using an ELISA or IFA test procedure to provide supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi.

Two of the 20 Babesiosis samples and one each of the 23 Tick-borne relapsing fever / Rickettsial Disease and 20 Ehrlichiosis specimens were positive on the Gold Standard Diagnostics $B .$ burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test.These samples were also tested on the predicate device which also gave positive results.

# Interfering Substances

The effect of potential interfering substances on samples. using the Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test was evaluated.High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and intralipids in serum samples were tested on six sera (two positives, one low positive, one high negative, and two negatives).The recommended concentrations from the guideline "Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry" from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute were used. The interferents at the concentrations tested did not have any influence on the band patter.A small variability in band intensity was seen that is in the normal range of deviation and didnot change the final interpretationTheresults are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Hemoglobin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2 g/1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>None detected</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>342 μmol/l</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>None detected</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cholesterol</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13 mmol/l</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>None detected</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intralipids</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>37 mmol/l</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>None detected</td></tr></table>

# Specimen Collection and Handling Conditions

A study was performed to substantiate the specimen storage and handling conditions for the Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test. Three samples were tested in triplicate after the following storage conditions:

A) $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours.   
BRoom temperature for 2, 6 and 8 hours.   
C) After 1, 5 and 10 freeze and thaw cycles.

The samples gave consistent results for all testing parameters above, therefore the specimens can be held at $2 { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for at least 168 hours or at room temperature for up to 8 hours and withstand up to 10 freeze and thaw cycles.

# Method Comparison

The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot test was determined by conucting a prospective clinical study at threedifferent eographic sites (Pennsylvani, North Carolina, and Caliornia) in the U..The patient samples were tested by an antiB burgdoreri total antibody EI tt first and the resulting equivocal and positive specimens were tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics $B .$ burgdorferi $\mathsf { B 3 l 1 g M }$ Line Blot test and a commercially available B. burgdorferi IgM Blot test. The results are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2>s .
