The Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold™ Giardia was designed as a single use, rapid, lateral flow immunoassay test device to detect the presence of Giardia lamblia antigen in unpreserved (fresh & frozen), preserved and media containing human stool specimens.

The Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold™ Giardia test strip $( 5 m m \times 6 0 m m )$ combines a Nitrocellulose Membrane with designated fiber pads (conjugate, sample and absorbant). The test strip is then placed into a plastic housing and is sealed constituting the Test Device.

The control line should always appear as a visible pink/red band in the control region of the device.This internal control line is to ensure and indicate that the test device is functioning correctly.

The plastic housing device contains a window where the diluted stool sample is added (Sample Well) and a window above where the results are read in 15 minutes.

The test concept:

Mouse anti-Giardia lamblia is coated onto the test line region of the nitrocellulose zone of the test strip. Rabbit anti- Goat IgG is coated onto the control line region.

Goat anti-Giardia lamblia antibodies are conjugated to red latex particles and dried onto inert glass fiber. This is inserted into the test strip below the nitrocellulose zone.

A buffered solution is added to a dilution tube followed by the addition of the stool specimen (2 drops) via a disposable pipette. This mixture is then dispensed in total into the sample well of the lateral flow cartridge device with a dropper pipette and migrates through a pad containing red microspheres that have been coated with a antibody specific for the Giardia antigen. If the antigen is present, an immune complex forms. The migration continues along the membrane, which contains a striped down anti Giardia capture antibody. If Giardia antigen is present, the immune complex reacts with the antiGiardia antibody at the test line on the membrane.

Thus Giardia antigens present in the sample combine with the antibody/red latex. As this complex migrates it binds to the antibodies in the test region forming a visible pink/red band.

Excess conjugate forms a second pink/red band in the control region of the device. The control line should always appear as a visible pink/red band in the control region of the device toindicate that he test device is functining corecly.

The predicate device and Uni-Gold™Giardia use similar lateral flow technoloy and concepts. The following table provides a comparative summary for both device design features. Any differences in technology do not raise additional concerns regarding safety and effectiveness. Safety and effectiveness are demonstrated to be substantially equivalent.

# Precision / Reproducibility

An Intra-run precision/reproducibility study was performed at 3 sites including one internal site. This study consisted of 6 blind proficiency panel members, varying in reactivity: (2) Low Positive, (2) High Positive and (2) Negative samples. This panel was tested for a period of 5 days. Each site generated 2 runs per day, by two individual technicians totaling 20 replicates per site per panel member, i.e. 12C replicates total. $100 \%$ reproducibility was observed for all sites, for all days using the blind panel sample set, therefore $100 \%$ of the 120 samples tested for Giardia produced the expected result.

An additional Intra-run precision/reproducibility study was performed internal internally. This study consisted of 12 blind proficiency panel members, varying in reactivity: (4) Low Positive, (4) High Positive and (4) Negative samples.This panel was tested for a period of 5 days. Each site generated 2 runs per day, by two individual technicians totaling 20 replicates per panel member. $100 \%$ EMPY reproducibility was observed for all days using the blind panel sample set, therefore $100 \%$ of the samples tested for Giardia produced the expected result.

The Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold ™M Giardia (1206610) along with Uni-Gold ™ Giardia Control kit (1206611) was evaluated at 3 external laboratories. A total of 267 retrospective samples were tested side by side on the test device and a commercially available lateral flow device at three external sites in the following stool matrix types: unpreserved frozen (42), C&S (15), SAF (139), and formalin (71).. The percent agreement of Uni-Gold™ Giardia versus the comparator device was as follows:

The positive samples were tested in the following matrix types: formalin (48), SAF (13), unpreserved frozen (17), Cary Blair (3), and C&S (10). The negative samples were tested in the following matrix types: formalin (42), SAF (70), unpreserved frozen (25), Cary Blair (3), and C&S (10)

# Additional retrospective studies

Performance of the test was compared to non-fluorescent microscopy (staining) at two external laboratories. At site 2, 67 retrospective samples were evaluated and demonstrated a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of $100 \%$ (22/22) and a Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) of $100 \%$ (45/45) versus Wheatley's Stain. At site 3, 259 retrospective samples were evaluated and demonstrated a PPA of $100 \%$ (60/60) and aNPA of $100 \%$ (199/199) versus Iron Hematoxylin Stain.

# Prospective Study

The following table shows a summary of test performance compared against DFA microscopy with prospective samples at site 4.

Due to infection prevalence, no positive samples were encountered during this prospective study. Samples were tested in the following sample matrix types: unpreserved fresh (153), unpreserved frozen (45), formalin (45), SAF (45), C&S (45), and Cary Blair (45).

# Expected Values

The performance of the Uni-Gold Giardia™ Test Kit was evaluated at our external laboratories. The 945 (prospective and retrospective) samples were collected from Hospitals throughout the US and Canada and consisted of both male and female patients, of all ages from pediatric to adult, who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. The retrospective study included 173 positive samples and 394 negative samples confirmed by microscopy. The prospective study included 378 samples which were subsequently confirmed negative by microscopy. There were no differences observed in clinical performance between
