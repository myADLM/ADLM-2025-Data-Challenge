# Legally Marketed Predicate Device

BioPlex® 2200 EBV IgG Panel, k062211

# INTENDED USE / INDICATIONS FOR USE

The BioPlex® 2200 EBV IgG kit is a multiplex flow immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to three (3) separate EBV antigens; Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBV NA-1), Viral Capsid Antigen (EBV VCA), and Early . Antigen diffuse (EBV EA-D) in human serum. The test system can be used in

conjunction with the BioPlex 2200 EBV IgM kit as an aid in the laboratory diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM).

The EBV IgG kit is intended for use with the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 System.

Assay performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients, cord blood, neonatal specimens, or infants. Assay performance characteristics have not been established for the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and other EBV-associated lymphomas.

# Device Description

The EBV IgG kit uses multiplex flow immunoassay, a methodology that greatly resembles traditional EIA, but permits simultaneous detection and identification of many antibodies in a single tube. Three (3) different populations of beads are coated with $E .$ coli derived recombinant proteins, EBV NA-1 $2 8 \mathrm { k D }$ and $4 5 \mathrm { k D } )$ , EBV VCA p18 (40kD), and EBV EA-D (28kD) associated with infectious mononucleosis.12-13 The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent into a reaction vessel. The mixture is incubated at $3 7 \%$ After a wash cycle, antihuman IgG antibody, conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads and this mixture is incubated at $3 7 \%$ The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the attached PE. Raw data is calculated in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).

Three additional dyed beads, an Internal Standard Bead (ISB), a Serum Verification Bead (SVB) and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction vessel and the absence of significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma. Refer to the BioPlex 2200 System Operation Manual for more information. The instrument is calibrated using a set of seven (7) distinct calibrator vials, supplied separately by Bio-Rad Laboratories. A combination of four (4) vials representing four (4) different antibody concentrations are used for semiquantitative calibration. The result for each of these antibodies is expressed as an antibody index (AI).

# Summary of Design Control Activities

A Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) was used to facilitate, capture, and quantify potential impacts of false positive or negative patient results. The Risk Priority Number (RPN) is a quantitative measure of the combined effects of severity, occurrence, and detection of potential risks. Specific mitigations are recommended that may include changes to the design or formulation if the RPN score exceeds a chosen threshold.

The Design Control Activities include Risk Analysis method to identify the verification and validation activities required, test used, and acceptance criteria.

Based on the conclusion of the risk management report, the modified QC procedure fulfills the requirements of the specifications of the design control process. Therefore, the performance of the modified QC test frequency is substantially equivalent to the current cleared kit.

BioPlex® 2200 Syphilis IgG Panel, k063866

# INTENDED USE / INDICATIONS FOR USE

The BioPlex® 2200 Syphilis IgG kit is a multiplex flow immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of Treponema pallidum IgG antibodies in human serum. The test system, when used in conjunction with non-treponemal based assays, provides

serological evidence of infection with T. pallidum. This test system also confirms reactive test results form non-treponemal based screening assays.

The Syphilis IgG kit is intended for use with the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 System.

The BioPlex 2200 Syphilis IgG kit is not intended for use in screening blood or plasma donors

Warning: A positive result is not useful for establishing a diagnosis of Syphilis. In most situations, such a result may reflect prior treated infection; a negative result can exclude a diagnosis of syphilis except for incubating or early primary disease.

# Device Description

The Syphilis IgG kit uses multiplex flow immunoassay, a methodology that greatly resembles traditional EIA, but permits simultaneous detection and identification of many antibodies in a single tube. Three (3) different populations of beads are coated with recombinant proteins associated with $T .$ pallidum (15kD, 17kD, and $4 7 \mathrm { k D }$ . The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent into a reaction vessel. The mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ After a wash cycle, anti-human IgG antibody, conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads and this mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the attached PE.

Refer to the BioPlex 2200 System Operation Manual for more information.

The system is calibrated using a set of four (4) distinct calibrator vials, supplied separately by Bio-Rad Laboratories. Four (4) vials representing two (2) or three (3) different antibody concentrations are used for calibration. Results are calculated for each of the three (3) antibodies and are compared against their own respective cut-off and are expressed as an antibody index (Al). A single result is reported after completing a composite analysis of all the antibodies (the highest AI value is reported).

Dear Mr. Wang:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
