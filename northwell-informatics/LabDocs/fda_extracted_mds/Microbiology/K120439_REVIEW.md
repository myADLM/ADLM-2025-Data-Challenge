1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.

Trade Name: BioPlex™ 2200 EBV IgG Panel BioPlex™ 2200 Syphilis IgG Panel

510(k) number: K063866 and K062211

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED. There is a labeling change to change the frequency of QC testing from once per pack and per day to once per day or per new reagent pack lot. This labeling change does not affect the intended use

3. The modification presented in this 510(k) is a change in the frequency of the QC testing recommendations specified in the labeling. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

5. Design Control Activities Summary

a) Risk Analysis:

A Failure Modes and Effects Analysis was used to facilitate, capture and quantify potential impacts of the Low Signal Pack (LSP) phenomenon. The sponsor considered guidance from 21 CFR 860 and IVDD (98/79/EC) when evaluating the severity of the effects for each of the assays. Additionally potential misuse of the products was considered during the risk analysis.

b) Verification and Validation activities:

Contamination studies were performed to assess the effect of proteases from bacterial and mold contaminants on remediated Syphilis and EBV IgG reagent packs. The results showed that the current (remediated) formulations provide adequate protection against bacteria and mold contamination. Even at extreme contamination levels, remediated Syphilis and EBV IgG kits exhibit only minimal signal loss. The percent recovery ratios of the QC controls were within the acceptable limits and the negative controls were within the specified range as per the product specifications.

The results indicated that the individual assays within the remediated Syphilis and EBV IgG panels were not significantly affected by the microbial contaminants.

The Residual Risk acceptability criteria (RPN score) was established at low level of concern according to the submitter’s Risk Management Plan, and hence does not require any additional mitigation activity.

c) Declaration of Conformity   
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted duly signed by the responsible individuals. The statements indicate that;   
i) As required by the risk analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and   
ii) The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.

Based on the conclusion of the risk management report, the modified QC procedure fulfills the requirements of the specifications of the design control process. Therefore, the performance of the modified QC test frequency is substantially equivalent to the current cleared kit.

6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for Use Enclosure

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
